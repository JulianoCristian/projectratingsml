1. Executive Summary

1.1 Introduction


The project, “Provision of Infrastructure for Boren area project” is located in the eastern
part of Ethiopia within the Dire Dawa City Administration. Diredawa City is found at
about 445kms distance from Addis Ababa. Local Development Plan (Boren Area LDP)
has been studied to the area under consideration.

Boren LDP area has a low coverage of both economic and social service infrastructure
at present and need for development of the infrastructure has been prioritized by the
city administration. Road network in the LDP project area accounts only for 7% of the
total area. The project is being financed under the Urban Local Government
Development Program (ULGDP), financed by the IDA/ World Bank program. The ULGDP
has been designed to support the government’s Urban Development Program (UDP)
and Urban Good Governance Program (UGGP).

The LDP has proposed multiple economic and social infrastructure developments for
the Boren area. Among the envisaged development activities are found; road
networks, drainages, water supply and sanitation facilities. It is anticipated that provision
of these Infrastructure for the locality will optimize the operation of infrastructural
services, reduces infrastructure costs and create a better business environment, which
can enhance socioeconomic development and national competitiveness of the city.

On the Other hand, the implementation of the infrastructure projects is also expected
to cause adverse environmental and social impacts on the natural resources and to
the surrounding community. There are expected adverse environmental and social
impacts owing to the various project characteristics and locations.

As a guiding principle, projects to be implemented under the ULGDP should adhere to
acceptable environmental and social safeguards. The projects should, as far as
possible, not result in damaging effects of the natural resources, involuntary
resettlement and land acquisition and where this is necessary, it is minimized by
exploring all viable alternatives and where it is unavoidable, mitigation measures and
compensation arrangements are made and implemented.

Therefore, being cognizant of the importance of addressing these environmental and
social issues in detail, the DDULG coordinating office has made an environmental
screening and has assigned schedule – 1 type EIA study for the Boren area
infrastructure development projects.

                                                                                                     1

It is with this background and rational, that the city administration has Commissioned
MS - Consultancy to undertake Environmental Impacts Assessment (EIA). The
consultant has conducted the EIA study in line with the agreements made, and as per
the requirements and objectives set in the Terms – Of – Reference (TOR).

1.2 Objectives of the EIA study


The overall objective of the EIA study is to minimize the likely adverse impacts of the
project implementation and ensure that sustainable development objectives are met.
Accordingly; the specific objective of the EIA study is;

    •    To assess the existing environmental condition of the project area

    •    To Identify environmental issues and concerns as relates to the implementation
         of the envisaged infrastructure development projects

    •    To Identify environmental components likely to be affected by the
         implementation of the different project components as indicated in the TOR

    •    To Make analyses of the likely positive and adverse impacts of the projects

    •    To propose appropriate mitigation measures for the adverse impacts and
         enhancement measures for the positive ones.

    •    To prepare Environmental Management and Monitoring (EMP).

The EIA study will also consider sites outside of the Boren LDP demarcated area, and
that will be influenced by the project implementation. Assessment will be conducted for
all project influenced areas including; the Boren LDP area, material production sites,
facilities erection sites etc that are likely to experience the direct impacts of the
infrastructure development project.

1.3 Environmental scoping


The scoping process has considered and discussed; Need for the project, project
location and boundary for the impacts assessment, Project activities, alternatives to
address the infrastructure problems and deficiencies, valued environmental
components, ROW condition of the project corridor, consultation of stakeholders and
has come up with conclusive remarks that project implementation to be pursued by
adopting the proper environmental management discipline.

Implementation of the project will alleviate most of the constraints related to lack of
social services and facilities; while the no project scenario will keep the status quo. In


                                                                                                    2

fact when viewed from purely natural environmental protection points of view, the no
project scenario is preferable, as no adverse impacts will be caused to the natural
resources due to project implementation. However, the benefits attainable from
provision of improved infrastructure will be forgone and the community’s life style and
the planned city activities will be hampered. So, the project implementation will have
no alternative, than pursuing the planned objectives.

1.4 Project Description


The Project is located within the Dire Dawa City Administrative area, at a locality known
as Boren Jeden . Boren locality is located at the outskirts of Dire Dawa city towards
Meleka-jebdu town, where industrial zone of the city administration has been
established.

The Vision set for Boren area is described as to create “Modern residential and
economically active area with adequate public services and modern urban
agriculture”. To bring this vision in to reality, several developments are envisaged that
can result in land use changes.

The provision of infrastructure for the Boren LDP project area is designed to provide
roads, water supply and drainage lines.

It is anticipated that the Provision of Infrastructure for the Boren area project will
optimize the operation of infrastructural services, reduces infrastructure costs and
create a better business environment, which can enhance socioeconomic
development and national competitiveness of the city. Adverse environmental
impacts are also expected to accompany the project implementation.

The EIA study is based on the LDP studied for the Boren Area . It is a study conducted
to assess the impacts, both on natural environment as well as socioeconomic
environmental resources that are likely to occur as a result of the implementation of
the planed visions and missions of the LDP studies.

1.5 Potential environmental impacts of the project


The infrastructure development project will create urban transport facility to those
settlement sites away from the existing route, improvements in sanitary conditions and
increased water supply coverage of the city. Provision of those services for those
communities lacking it at present will significantly contribute positively and creates
satisfaction among the community of the Boren kebele.

The efficiency in mobility for vehicles as well as for all other road users, both motorized
and none motorized mode of transport and pedestrian will benefit from the improved
road standard and conditions.

Adverse environmental impacts likely to accompany the project are also highlighted
and discussed in detail. Adverse impacts are likely to occur both to the natural
environment and social environment of the project influence area. Areas experiencing
direct impacts and indirect impacts are defined and discussed in the main document.

Mitigation measures to be taken are also listed and discussed for each of the adverse
impacts suspected to be caused by the project.

1.6 Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMP)


Environmental management plan has been prepared by identifying key issues and
impacts to be managed. Management and monitoring actions have been discussed
by proposing mitigation actions to be taken, identifying institutional responsibilities for
implementation of those measurers. Management and monitoring actions have been
summarised in a matrix form for ease of the follow ups and to check for compliances.

Costs for implementation of the mitigation measures has also been estimated and
included. Apart from the cost of relocation/ compensation and the costs already
included in the engineering cost estimate for major physical works, the other costs of
environmental mitigation measures, monitoring and capacity building costs are
estimated and included in this report. This part of the cost is Birr 1,416,000 ( one million
four hundred sixteen thousand).

1.7 Conclusion and recommendations


The Boren area is designated as expansion and industrial zone of the DD city
administration. Large scale business, institutions, commercial and residential building
complexes will be developed and will continue to be expanded in the area .

The provision of infrastructure to the Boren area and upgrading of the existing ones will
facilitate such development and the planned vision and missions of the LDP as per the
study. The basis social services for the community will be availed. Sanitary condition will
improve, transport services will improve, traffic flow will be facilitated in the congested
areas, while it will open up vehicular transport facilities for areas lacking public transport
in their premises. Some of the segments traverse residential areas where passage to
vehicle is difficult at present.

However, adverse impacts will also be significant during the project implementation.
Vegetation clearance and land disturbance and related environmental impacts are
likely, the densely settled and commercial sites with houses and facilities will definitely
experience complication, while ROW clearance and relocation of existing facilities and
service utility lines may be requisite. Significant number houses and utility service lines
will have to be demolished and relocated at areas of narrow ROW width. Traffic
management; mobility and traffic safety issues will also be significant and needs well
organized management system.

So it is the recommendation of this study that the mitigation measures proposed at all
stages of the project implementation be given due attention and considered during
the whole processes. With careful and well planned site management, the project can
be implemented with relatively lower adverse impacts.

2. Introduction

2.1 Background to the project


The Provision of Infrastructure for Boren area project is located in the eastern part of
Ethiopia within the Dire Dawa City Administration. Diredawa City is found at about
445kms distance from Addis Ababa.

The city administration has total land area of 1,288.02 Km2, Categorized as inner city
and suburbs. The suburb area covers 125,847 Km2 (97.73%) while inner city has a share
of only 2.27%. (29.24 Km2 ).

The city administration has a plan to expand and develop the suburb areas, and has
prepared Local Development Plan (LDP) for a locality Known as Boren Jeden. Boren
Jeden LDP area composes of 6 neighborhoods including Adamo, Dengo, kaba
Tenkule, Jedneaj, Bealwalti.

Boren LDP area has a low coverage of both economic and social service infrastructure
at present and need for development of the infrastructure has been prioritized by the
city administration.

The current project is being conducted under the Urban Local Government
Development Program (ULGDP), financed by the IDA/ World Bank program. The ULGDP
has been designed to support the government’s Urban Development Program (UDP)
and Urban Good Governance Program (UGGP).

The specific development objective of the ULGDP projects is to support improved
performance in the planning, delivery and sustained provision of priority municipal
services and infrastructure by urban local governments. The ULGDP has the potential to
provide significant social benefits, and to deliver environmental benefits, depending on
the ULGDP investment projects that are put forward by ULGs for performance grant
financing.

The LDP has proposed multiple economic and social infrastructure developments for
the Boren area. Among the envisaged development activities are found; road
networks, drainages, water supply and sanitation facilities. It is anticipated that provision
of these Infrastructure for the locality will optimize the operation of infrastructural
services, reduces infrastructure costs and create a better business environment, which
can enhance socioeconomic development and national competitiveness of the city.

On the Other hand, the implementation of the infrastructure projects is also expected
to cause adverse environmental and social impacts on the natural resources and to

MS Consultancy                                                                         August 2013

the surrounding community. There are expected adverse environmental and social
impacts owing to the various project characteristics and locations.

As a guiding principle, projects to be implemented under the ULGDP should adhere to
acceptable environmental and social safeguards. The projects should, as far as
possible, not result in damaging effects of the natural resources, involuntary
resettlement and land acquisition and where this is necessary, it is minimized by
exploring all viable alternatives and where it is unavoidable, mitigation measures and
compensation arrangements are made and implemented.

It is also believed and justified that, any development intervention cannot be
sustainable and internalized by the communities (which are supposed to be the prime
beneficiary of the initiated intervention), unless and otherwise environmental and social
issues and concerns are incorporated into the development intervention.

Therefore, being cognizant of the importance of addressing these environmental and
social issues in detail, the DDULG coordinating office has made an environmental
screening and has assigned category – A type EIA study for the Boren area
infrastructure development projects.

It is with this background and rational, that the city administration has Commissioned
MS - Consultancy to undertake Environmental Impacts Assessment (EIA), and
preparation of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the Boren Area infrastructure
development.

The consultant has conducted the EIA study in line with the agreements made, and as
per the requirements and objectives set in the Terms – Of – Reference (TOR).

2.2 Objectives and scope of the EIA study


The TOR prepared by the client has described the objectives of the consultancy service
as to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment and to conduct a Resettlement
Action Plan for project affected persons, due to Provision of Infrastructure for the Boren
area Project.

The objectives of the study emanates from overall policies of the ULGDP
implementation stated as “Projects to be implemented under the ULGDP should stick
on to acceptable environmental and social safeguards”. In this regard, it’s clearly
stated in the Environmental and social management framework manual prepared by
MUDC; “ that any projects which are funded by World Bank have to carry out
appropriate and corresponding EA study to ensure sustainable development
objectives”.



                                                                                                  8

The EIA study will cover, environmental scoping, description of the project, description
of baseline environmental conditions; Identification of Valued Environmental
Components(VEC) for the project, analysis of potential environmental impacts;
consideration of alternatives; development of mitigation measures for adverse impacts
and enhancement measures for the positive impacts; preparing an environmental
Management and Monitoring plan.

Accordingly the specific EIA objectives under this study will be;

    •    To assess the existing environmental condition of the project area

    •    To Identify environmental issues and concerns as relates to the implementation
         of the envisaged infrastructure development projects

    •    To Identify environmental components likely to be affected by the
         implementation of the different project components as indicated in the TOR

    •    To Make analyses of the likely positive and adverse impacts of the projects

    •    To propose appropriate mitigation measures for the adverse impacts and
         enhancement measures for the positive ones.

    •    To prepare Environmental Management and Monitoring (EMP).

The EIA study will also consider sites outside of the Boren LDP demarcated area, and
that will be influenced by the project implementation. Assessment will be conducted for
all project influenced areas including; the Boren LDP area, material production sites,
facilities erection sites etc that are likely to experience the direct impacts of the
infrastructure development project.

Accordingly, the EIA study is expected to identify all the adverse environmental and
social impacts, and to propose appropriate mitigation measures for those possible
negative environmental and social impacts and enhancement measures for the
positive impacts.

2.3 Methodology of the EIA study


The assessment study has been undertaken in accordance with the ULGDP’s ESMF and
RPF as well as World Bank safe guard policies and procedures, using generally
acceptable and recognized assessment techniques and evaluation methods,
standards and practices. The national level EIA guidelines, legal and policy frameworks
are also the sources and references made to, during the assessment study.

3. Environmental scoping

3.1 Need for the project


The Boren area is planned to be one of the expansion areas and industrial
development site for Dire Dawa Administration. It has to have well developed
infrastructure and social services to meet the envisaged development requirements.
At present, the infrastructure facilities coverage of the LDP area is generally poor, and
varies depending on the settlement pattern. The planned area is served with all basic
infrastructures such as gravel road, electricity, telephone, potable water, garbage
collection container. The scattered informal settlement area has practically no services.




Figure 3-1 Ongoing Housing developments in                Figure 3-2 existing Road condition within the
the Bore LDP area                                         Bore LDP area




Road networks plays significant role in providing access to social services and
administrative centers and travel mobility, however, Boren LDP area has a low
coverage road network accounting only for 7% of the total area. There are four
categories of roads in the area;
       • The arterial Gravel road which goes to Melak Jebdu
       • The collector roads serving the planned neighborhood.
       • Earth road connecting the planned scattered settlement with the planned
          area.
       • Trails used for circulation inside the farm area.
The arterial road and the sub arterial roads serving the planned neighborhood are
gravel surfaced adequate width, while the remaining major road segments are earth
road, and there is no asphalt road within the project limit.

                                                                                                                10
MS Consultancy                                                                                    August 2013

Fina EIA study Report




Water supply line is limited to small proportion, and access to potable water supply is a
major constraint to most of the dwellers. These group of people are obliged to fetch
water from far distances in the central part of the city, like in Sabian area.

The area has low level of social services such as school, market place, and health
facility, road and drainage facilities.
The development of the area should therefore address the issues of infrastructure as
one of the top priority. To address the key problems of the locality there will be
infrastructure development options to be taken. From these options the locality expects
to solve all or some of the key problems to some extent.

3.2 Project activities


The project activities include design and construction works of 13km road, 13km
drainage and 10km water supply lines as principal works, while ancillary works like
material site development, garage and workshops establishment will also be under
taken.

The main works will be implemented within the Boren LDP area, new alignments and
partly existing track road route corridor. The extent of new land occupation for the main
works will be high in new alignments, while road width widening may be required at
some location, and impacts at those sites can be significant. Construction material
production will make use of the already designated sites at out skirts of the city, some of
which are existing production sites.

The activities under the EIA study include: collection of data on existing environmental
settings of the project area, both primary and secondary sources, analyses of the
project activities and their respective impacts on the environment, identification of the
environmental components that would be most affected by the project, propose
feasible measures that would help to avoid and/or minimize the adverse impacts.

The environmental impact of such infrastructure project can extend beyond the limits
and influence areas of that of socio-economic impacts.

3.3 Alternative solutions for the infrastructure development of Boren Area
    LDP project


The possible alternatives are either to implement the infrastructure development project
or the no project option. There is no better alternative to solve the deficiencies in social
service infrastructure of the project area, other than project implementation.


                                                                                                    11
MS Consultancy                                                                        August 2013
Bren Area Infrastructure Development Project, Dore Dawa             Dire Dawa City Administration
Fina EIA study Report


Implementation of the project will alleviate most of the constraints related to lack of
social services and facilities; while the no project scenario will keep the status quo. In
fact when viewed from purely natural environmental protection points of view, the no
project scenario is preferable, as no adverse impacts will be caused to the natural
resources due to project implementation. However, the benefits attainable from
provision of improved infrastructure will be forgone and the community’s life style and
the planned city activities will be hampered.

So, the project implementation will have no alternative, than pursuing the planned
objectives.

3.4 Geographical boundary and ROW- conditions of the study area in
    relation to possible impacts


The project will be implemented in a suburb area of the Dire Dawa city Administration,
where the land is partially occupied by population settlement, farmland, institutional
and commercial establishments, and open grazing ground.

The study area for the impacts assessment will mainly focus on the Boren LDP project
site, where the infrastructure development is expected to be implemented. However,
land occupation and disturbance can also occur at sites to be developed for ancillary
works like material site development, access roads and for spoil soils disposal. These sites
will be outside of the demarcated Boren LDP project site, but in the periphery of the city
administration, and outside of the densely settled areas.



3.5 Land requirements


The Provision of Infrastructure for Boren LDP project area will be implemented within
the demarcated 5 ha of land area by the LDP project. The infrastructure expected
include road, drainage and water supply line, all of which will follow road route
alignments and will be accommodated within road route corridors. So, the major land
requirement will be for the road infrastructure development with adequate provisions
for other utility service lines.

Within this demarcated route corridor, different social service infrastructures will be
developed as discussed above. Among those planned infrastructure developments are
found, road network, drainage lines, water supply line.

Land is also required for construction material production, workshops and garages, for
detour roads and accesses, for plants and stockpiling of material and spoil soils

                                                                                                    12

disposal. These sites, however, will temporarily be occupied during the construction
phase of the project.

The extent of new land occupation and land clearance will be significant as most of
the works will be done in a newly developing area, with no existing paved route. At
some locations, there are track roads used by the community and the impacts of
vegetation removal can be minimum at those locations, however, road width widening
and upgrading of the road design standard does require additional plots of land on
both sides of the road alignment, and also for ancillary works and material production
at offset distances.

The project influence areas that experience direct impacts of the project are sites and
environmental resources falling within the Right –Of –Way (ROW) of the project; within
the LDP demarcated plots of land and the neighboring kebeles of Dire Dawa city and
material production sites at the periphery of the city limit.

3.6 Land use/ land cover of the road route corridor, material sites and
    camp sites


The dominant land use of the Boren area is agricultural and settlement. Settlement area
accounts for 30% of the land area (25% being unplanned informal settlement sites),
while farmlands and open spaces account for 63%. Road infrastructure occupies 7% of
the land area. The open area is covered by bushes and scrubs including the exotic
plant species known as prosopiece juliflora. Big trees are found only at banks of
seasonal streams and rivers or as tree hedges and at homesteads. There is no park, no
known cultural and historical heritage site, but religious establishments and social
service institutions like schools, health and welfare institutions like Cheshire Homes are
found at different locations. There are few institutions and commercial establishment,
but not developed well.

3.6.1    Potential material sites


Potential material sites are all located outside of the densely settled areas, and are
dominantly covered by bushes or degraded road covered land. The mountains and
hills surrounding the city will be major sites for construction material extraction.

3.7 Consultation of stakeholders


Consultation of stakeholders had been conducted, and discussion forum with high
officials of the city administration including the ULDP coordination office staff had been
conducted. All consulted people and officials have shown positive reactions towards

                                                                                                  13

the project implementation. Comments and suggestions had been given during the
discussions held to assist the good accomplishments of the project. The local
administration and community representatives of Boren Locality have emphasized the
deficiencies in social and economic services provisions in the area, and reiterated the
impacts it has on the developments of their local economic settings. They further urged
the immediate implementation of the project, and committed for all assistances to be
availed from their side.


4. Policy, legal and administrative frameworks

4.1 General
Development programs and projects should comply with available policies, legislative
and institutional frameworks and standards for proper execution and implementation.
Knowledge of the policy and legal frameworks within which the project is going to be
implemented would facilitate the project performance and helps to ensure sustainable
development. There are several policy and legal documents both at federal and
regional level as regards to environmental management and development projects.

The discussion in here concerns the National Development and Environmental Policies
and Sectoral Strategies, legislations and guidelines, Institutional arrangements, land
accusation, tenure rights and expropriation procedures are also indicated in the
discussion.

Understanding of available policies and administrative structures, under which the
project implementation and the environmental assessment and management study
operates, would assist in the efforts made for sustainable development and natural
resource conservation measures.

4.2 Policies and strategies

4.2.1    Environmental policy of Ethiopia (EPE)


The environmental policy Ethiopia (EPE) of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
was approved by the Council of Ministers in April 1997 (EPA/MEDAC 1997). It is based on
the CSE which was developed through a consultative process over the period 1989-
1995.

The policy has the broad aim of rectifying previous policy failures and deficiencies
which, in the past, have led to serious environmental degradation. It is fully integrated
and compatible with the overall long-term economic development strategy of the
country, known as Agricultural Development-Led Industrialization (ADLI), and other key
national policies.

                                                                                                  14
MS Consultancy                                                                      August 2013
Bren Area Infrastructure Development Project, Dore Dawa                  Dire Dawa City Administration
Fina EIA study Report




The EPE’s overall policy goal may be summarized in terms of the improvement and
enhancement of the health and quality of life of all Ethiopians, and the promotion of
sustainable social and economic development through the adoption of sound
environmental management principles. Specific policy objectives and key guiding
principles are set out clearly in the EPE, and expand on various aspects of the overall
goal. The policy contains sectoral and cross-sectoral policies and also has provisions
required for the appropriate implementation of the policy itself.

The policy among others seeks to ensure the empowerment and participation of the
people and their organizations at all level in environmental management activities and
to raise public awareness and promote understanding of the essential linkage between
environment and development.

In addition to its guiding principles the environmental policy of Ethiopia provides
sectoral and cross-sectoral environmental policies. The EIA policies aim:

         •       To ensure that EIA’s consider not only physical and biological impacts but
                 also address social, socio-economic, political and cultural conditions.

         •       To ensure that public and private sector development programs and projects
                 recognize environmental impacts early and incorporate their containment
                 into the development design process.

         •       To recognize that public consultation is an integral part of EIA and ensure that
                 EIA procedures make provision for both an independent review and public
                 comment before consideration by decision-makers.

         •       To ensure that the environmental impact statement always includes
                 mitigation plans for environmental management problems and contingency
                 plans in case of accidents.

         •       To ensure that at specified intervals during project implementation,
                 environmental audits regarding monitoring, inspection and record keeping
                 take place for activities where these have been required by the
                 environmental impact statement (EIS)

         •       To ensure that preliminary and full EIAs are under taken by the relevant
                 sectoral ministries or departments if in the public sector, and by the
                 developer if in the private sector;

         •       To create by law and EIA process this requires appropriate environmental
                 impact statements and environmental audits for private and state
                 development projects.

                                                                                                         15

         •       To establish the necessary institutional frame work and determine the linkages
                 of its parts for undertaking, coordinating and approving EIA’s and the
                 subsequent system of environmental audits required to ensure compliance
                 with conditionalities.

         •       To develop detailed sectoral technical guidelines in EIA’s and environmental
                 audits.

         •       To ensure that social, socioeconomic, political and cultural conditions are
                 considered in EIA procedures & include in sectoral guidelines and

         •       To develop EIA and environmental audit capacity and capability in the EPA,
                 Sectoral Ministries and Agencies as well as Regions.

4.2.2    Conservation Strategy of Ethiopia


The Conservation strategy of Ethiopia (CSE) was provided in1996. It is a strategic
framework document for integrating environmental planning into new and existing
policies, programs and projects. It is an important policy document which views
environmental management from several perspectives. In particular it recognizes the
importance of incorporating environmental factors into development activities from the
outset, so that planners may take into account environmental protection as an
essential component of economic, social and cultural development.

4.2.3    Dire Dawa City Administration Regional Conservation Strategy


The conservation strategy of the DDAC was provided in March 2001 based on the
national level conservation strategy of Ethiopia.

The overall strategy goal is described as to improve and enhance the health and
quality of the life of all people of Dire Dawa Administrative Council and to promote
sustainable social and economic development through the sound management and
use of natural, human made & cultural resources and the environment as a whole, so
as to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of
future generation to meet their own needs.

The strategy seeks to:

         a. ensure that appropriate interventions to restore the present impaired
         regenerative and productive capabilities of renewable natural resources, and
         ensure that essential ecological process and life support systems are sustained,
         biological diversity is preserved and renewable resources are used in such a way
         that their capacity to regenerate and produce is maintained and where

                                                                                                        16

         possible enhanced, so that the satisfaction of future generation is not
         compromised;

         b.     Ensure that non-renewable resources are exploited in such a way that the
         benefits are extended as far into the future as can be managed, and minimize
         the negative impacts of their exploitation on the use and management of other
         natural resources and the environment;

         c.     Identify and develop natural resources that are currently under utilized by
         finding new technologies and/or intensifying existing uses;

         d.     Incorporate the full economic, social and environmental costs and
         benefits of natural resources development into planning, implementation and
         accounting processes by a comprehensive valuation of the environment and
         the services it provides, and by considering the social and environmental costs
         and benefits which cannot currently be measured in monetary terms;

         e.      Improve the environment of human settlements to satisfy the physical,
         social, economic, cultural and other needs of their inhabitants on a sustainable
         basis;

         f.     Prevent the pollution of land, air and water in the most cost effective way
         so that the cost of effective preventive interventions would not exceed the
         benefits;

         g.     Conserve, develop, sustainable manage and support Ethiopia’s rich and
         diverse cultural heritage;

         h.    Ensure the empowerment and participation of the people and their
         organizations at all levels in environmental management activities; and

         i.     Raise public awareness and promote understanding of the essential
         linkages between environment and development.

4.2.4    Water resource and sanitation policies and legislatives


Ethiopian Water Resources Management Policy (EWRMP),1997 deals with the general
water resources management policy and different sub sectoral issues; Water supply
and sanitation , irrigation development, & hydropower. The policy, under section - 2.2.2
discusses the issue of environment, water shade management and water resources
protection and conservation issues.

The policy discusses the sanitation policy under the water supply and sanitation sub
sector. The policy among other issues emphasizes the adoption and promotion of


                                                                                                    17

affordable and culturally acceptable low cost sanitation technology options, setting of
frameworks, coordination of efforts and encouraging involvement of stakeholders both
government and non government institutions, the integration of water supply and
sanitation, need for setting frame works affirming the inseparable nature of water
supply and sanitation activities and need for decentralized approaches for sanitation
projects implementation and management are some of the guiding principles
indicated in the policy.

The Health Policy of Ethiopia


The health policy under its articles; Article 3.4 reads developing safe disposal of human,
house hold, agricultural, and industrial wastes, and encouragement of recycling. Article
5.3 reads prevention of environmental pollution with hazardous chemical wastes

National Hygiene and Sanitation Strategy for Ethiopia

The strategy is set as a road map which leads to 100% adoption of improved sanitation
and hygiene in Ethiopia. The 100% adoption of improved sanitation and hygiene is
defined from Ethiopia’s perspective as the process where people demand, develop
and sustain a hygienic and healthy environment for themselves by erecting barriers to
prevent the transmission of diseases, primarily from fecal contamination. The strategy
paper further elaborates that improved sanitation and hygiene is about erecting
physical and behavioral barriers to stop contamination, and emphasizes that the
primary barriers have the biggest preventive impacts and concentrate on the safe
management of faeces to prevent contact with fields, fluids, fingers, feet, flies and
food.

National Hygiene and On-site Sanitation Protocol

The protocol is designed to follow the national strategy for universal access (100%
hygienic and sanitized households) of hygiene and sanitation. It is primarily concerned
with the safe ‘On – site’ containment and management of human excreta in the
domestic, institutional and public context.

The objective of the protocol is described as to improve implementation of the National
Strategy for Hygiene and ‘on – site’ Sanitation improvement at Local Authority level. The
protocol gives a clear set of guidelines for all stakeholders promoting Improved Hygiene
and Sanitation (HIS), leading to better co-ordination and clearer lines for responsibility
at the national, regional, zonal and woreda(district) levels.

                  Strengthen the integration of all programs with an HIS components within
                   woreda development plans and the health extension services program.



                                                                                                     18

                  Provide the basis for a comprehensive budgeting and investment frame
                   work

                  Improve sector co-ordination with all HIS stakeholders working from one
                   set of guidelines

                  Define minimum standards and a frame work for information
                   management and monitoring to ensure adequate sub sector
                   performance evaluation.

The protocol will be applied in all aspects of Hygiene and sanitation promotion. It will
ensure that all development partners and NGOs adhere to the protocol when
promoting improved hygiene and ‘on-site’ sanitation in each locality.

The protocol is a simple eight step guide to the improved Hygiene and on -site
sanitation program cycle. These steps are to be followed by all those engaged in
promoting Hygiene and on –site sanitation improvements in Ethiopia. The eight steps are
briefly outlined as Step; 1) Participatory situation analyses, 2) Advocacy, 3) Inter-sectoral
broad based planning(reflecting mandates), 4) Human resource development,
supervision, reporting, 5) Financing Improved Hygiene and Sanitation, 6)HIS promotion,
empowerment and enforcement, 7) Access to hardware for latrines and 8) Monitoring
and evaluation linked Information management system

4.2.5    The National Population Strategy


The national population strategy which was issued in 1993, aims to reduce population
growth by reducing the number of children per women from 7.5 to 4.0 by 2015. The
policy also recognizes that if economic and social development is to be sustainable it
must be compatible with the limits of the existing natural resource base.

4.2.6    The National Policy on Ethiopian women


The National policy on Ethiopian women, 1993, which ensures the equality of women in
every aspect of life and the removal of gender based discrimination.

4.2.7    The Social Welfare Policy


The Social Welfare policy, 1994, which addresses problems of famine, illiteracy and
disease within a social framework that is equitable for all people and aims to develop
human resource especially in the rural areas so that the delivery of services is
sustainable, development oriented and involves the community in their planning and

implementation. The policy recognizes that agents for change will be government,
private and both local and foreign NGO's.

4.2.8    Environmental and Social Management Framework of MUDC


The Ministry of Urban Development and Construction (MUDC) has prepared and
provided ESMF in year 2008.

This document provides an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)
for the Urban Local Government Development Project (ULGDP).

Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is a safeguard instrument
(document) which establishes a system for determining and assessing future potential
environmental and social impacts of the ULGDP investment project activities and other
activities associated with this ULGDP investment projectregardless of funding agency.
The framework sets out mitigation, monitoring and institutional measures to be taken
during design, implementation and operation of the project activities to eliminate
adverse environmental and social impacts, offset them, or reduce them to acceptable
levels.

The main purpose of the ESMF is described as to:

                 •   Establish clear procedures and methodologies for the environmental and
                     social assessment, review, approval and implementation of investments to
                     be financed under the ULGDP;

                 •   Specify appropriate roles and responsibilities, and outline the necessary
                     reporting procedures, for managing and monitoring environmental and
                     social concerns related to ULGDP investments;

                 •   Determine the training, capacity building and technical assistance
                     needed to

                 •   successfully implement the provisions of the ESMF; and

                 •   Provide practical information resources for implementing the ESMF.

This ESMF document is to be used by all implementing agencies of the ULGDP in order
to ensure that all environmental and social safeguards are adequately addressed and
that the relevant capacity and training needs are established in order for the
recommended measures to be implemented effectively.




                                                                                                        20

4.2.9    Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) of MUDC


The Ministry of Urban Development and Construction (MUDC) has prepared and
provided RPF in November 2008.

This document provides a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for the Urban Local
Government Development Project (ULGDP). The RPF document is to be used by all
implementing agencies of the ULGDP in order to ensure that all environmental and
social safeguards are adequately addressed and that the relevant capacity and
training needs are established in order for the recommended measures to be
implemented effectively.

The use of this Resettlement Policy Framework will be triggered when a proposed
ULGDP investment project needs to acquire land and people or property is affected.
The objectives of this Resettlement Policy Framework are described as to:

    •    As far as possible ensure that involuntary resettlement and land acquisition is
         avoided or where it is necessary, is minimized, by exploring all viable alternatives.

    •    Where involuntary resettlement and land acquisition is unavoidable, resettlement
         and compensation activities are prepared and implemented by providing
         sufficient investment resources according to GOE Proclamation and Regulations.

    •     Persons displaced by the ULGDP will be meaningfully consulted.

This policy is not triggered for the current project, as the work is limited to the existing
corridors and water supply systems of existing facilities. No significant new land size and
property loss is expected.

World Bank Safe guard policies

The World Bank provides guidance on requirements in the Environmental Assessment
Sourcebook, which includes recent versions of the World Bank Operational Policies as
well as the updates. The World Bank has ten “Safeguard Policies” whose primary
objective is to ensure that Bank operations do not cause adverse impacts and that they
“do no harm”. The ten safeguard policies are grouped into Environment, Rural
Development, Social Development and International Law.

These ten safeguard policies are; OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, OP 4.04 Natural
Habitats, OP 4.09 Pest Management, OP 4.10 Indigenous Peoples, and OP 4.11 Physical
Cultural Resources, OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement,OP/BP 4.36 Forests, OP/BP 4.37
Safety of Dams and OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways, OP 7.60 Projects in
Disputed Areas. Some but not all of these safeguard policies are applicable to the
subject project.

                                                                                                      21

4.3 Legislative frame work


There are several proclamations provided by the FDRE related to Environmental
protection issues. Among these are:

4.3.1 Federal level Proclamations
The Federal Constitution

The Federal Constitution of 1995 sets out important articles related to Development and
Environmental rights; Article 43 discusses the right to development.

The Constitution under Article 44 highlights about environmental rights as follows:

    •    All persons have the right to a clean environment.

    •    All persons who have been displaced or whose livelihoods have been adversely
         affected as a result of state programs have the right to commensurate monetary
         or alternative means of compensation, including relocation with adequate state
         assistance.

    •    Under Article 92 the constitution discusses about environmental objectives as:

    •    Government shall endeavor to ensure that all Ethiopians live in a clean and

Environmental Protection Organs Re-Establishment proclamation No. 295/ 2002 was
provided in October 2002. The proclamation differentiated responsibilities among
environmental agencies at Federal and Regional states. By this proclamation the EPA is
Re-established as an autonomous public institution at the Federal Government. EPA has
among others powers and duties to coordinate measures to ensure that the
environmental objectives provided under the constitution and the basic principles set
out in the Environmental policy of Ethiopia and the conservation strategy of Ethiopia
are realized.

Article-15 of the proclamation states the power & duties of the Regional Environment
Agencies. Powers and duties are also proposed in relation to Zonal, Woreda and
community Environmental Coordinating Committees.

Environmental pollution control proclamations NO. 300/2002 sets rules on control of
pollution, management of hazardous waste, chemical and radioactive substances,
management of municipal wastes, outlines sectors that             require environmental
standard , environmental inspectors, incentives, rights to appeal, Offences and penalty.

Proclamation No. 94/1994, Proclamation on Conservation, Development and Utilization
of Forests, was issued in 1994 to provide for the Conservation, Development and
Utilization of Forests. The objective of this Proclamation is to provide the basis for
sustainable utilization of the country’s forest resources. The Proclamation categorizes
types of forest ownership (State, Regional and Private Forests). It provides the power for
designation, demarcation, and registration of forests to the Ministry of Agriculture and
Regional Governments. According to this proclamation, state and regional forests shall
be utilized in accordance with approved management plans. The Proclamation then
goes on to give some specific direction for the utilization of State and Regional Forests,
and lists prohibited activities within protected forests.

The proclamation, however, has not been enforced and did not help for the sustained
utilization of the remaining forest resources. Policies such as Bio-diversity conservation
and development, EPE, Energy policy and population policy are in place but could not
bring significant change in forest development and use.

Fina EIA study Report


The current project shall be implemented in the Dire Dawa city administration under the
ULGDP. The regional council is structured as regional administrative council, zonal,
Woreda (District) and Kebele (sub district) administrative organs, while the ULGDP
projects have also specific organizational setups as discussed here under.

4.4.2    The Dire Dawa City Administration


The Dire Dawa Administrative Council comprises of 34 Peasant associations and 9
urban kebeles organized under 4 kefitegnas??. The Council is directly accountable to
the Prime Minister’s office and; it is the highest body in the region consisting of a
chairperson and four sectoral development heads. The four sectors are the Economic
Development Sector, the Economic Service Sector, the Administrative and the Social
Affairs Sector. These sectors are mandated to guide, follow and supervise the activities
of their respective sectoral and cross-sectoral offices in the administrative council.

Each of the sector office is responsible to develop and implement their own sector
specific plans. The overall integration and coordination of the regional socio-economic
development plans is done by the Regional Planning and Economic Development
Office and approved by the Administrative Council.

4.4.3    Federal & regional environmental protection authorities


The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), the main agency responsible for
environmental management, was established in 1995 under Proclamation 9/1995, as an
independent agency reporting to the Council of Ministers. The EPA is required to
provide regional authorities with guidance, technical support, and capacity building;
support the development of various guidelines, including procedures appropriate to
local projects; undertake awareness creation in other federal agencies; and provide
technical support to those agencies. Its key objectives are outlined below.

4.4.4    Dire Dawa Environmental Protection Authority


The Federal EPA has devolved responsibility to the Regional equivalent of the EPA. The
Regional authorities should ideally establish an EPA-type institution to deal with
environmental issues at the Regional level. Accordingly the Dire Dawa Administrative
Council Environmental Protection Authority (DDAC EPA) has been established through
proclamation No 2/2004 in year 2004.

This is one of the most relevant institutions when it comes to the control of water
resources pollution problems in and around the city of DireDawa. It is a regulatory

and related laws in accordance with the provision of national environmental policy.

The DDEPAs operates independently of the Federal EPA and reports directly to the
regional state governments. It is the responsibility of DireDawa EPA to inform the Federal
EPA of projects that may be of national significance.

4.4.5    EPAs’ Role in the Implementation of the ESMF


The EPA will be responsible for ensuring that all ULG investment projects under the
ULGDP comply with national EIA regulations and the requirements of the ESMF.
Following screening by the ULG responsible, where relevant, the Regional
Environmental Protection Authorities (REPAs) will review and approve project EIAs and
will issue an environmental permit/ license where applicable.

The federal EPA will undertake environmental audits where required to ensure that
ULGsare complying with their Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) and their
commitments to environmental management, mitigation and monitoring.

5. Project Description

5.1 General


The EIA study is based on the LDP studied for the Boren Area. It is a study conducted to
assess the impacts, both on natural environment as well as socioeconomic
environmental resources that are likely to occur as a result of the implementation of the
planed visions and missions of the LDP studies.

 The Vision set for Boren area is described as to create “Modern residential and
economically active area with adequate public services and modern urban
agriculture” . To bring this vision in to reality, several developments are envisaged that
can result in land use changes. Accordingly it is planned that the current sub optimal
land utilization has to be altered in a manner that can address the shortage of
residential areas in the city, expands social service infrastructures, deters illegal
settlements, promotes private investment, and provision of adequate public services to
satisfy the increasing inflow of people. In so doing there are impacts having either of
beneficial or adverse consequences that can occur.

It is anticipated that the Provision of Infrastructure for the Boren area project will
optimize the operation of infrastructural services, reduces infrastructure costs and
create a better business environment, which can enhance socioeconomic
development and national competitiveness of the city. Adverse environmental
impacts are also expected to accompany the project implementation.

5.2 Project Location


Dire Dawa Administrative Council is located between 9o27’-9o49’ north latitude and
41o38’-42o19’ east longitude. It is found in the eastern part of Ethiopia at 445 kms
distance from Addis Ababa, and has an estimated land area of 128,802 ha.

The Project is located within the Dire Dawa City Administrative area, at a locality known

society at large. The sub project will implement construction of 13km length roads of
different classes.

Component – 2: Provision of Water Supply Line

The Provision of Water Supply Line will have networks of 10km length. The sub-project
aims at providing clean and safe water supply for the Boren area community.

Component – 3: Construction of Drainage Lines

The Drainage Lines Construction sub-project is meant to mitigate flooding effects of the
Boren Industrial Sites and residential areas. It involves construction of about 13 KM
drainage lines.

The Boren area LDP study of April 2010 proposes road infrastructure development as
depicted on the figure below. It is assumed that all of the three planed infrastructure
development activities (road sub project, water supply sub project and drainage line
project) will mainly fall within these road route corridors and Right – Of – Way width.
Both the water supply line and drainage lines will more or less follow and share the road
route alignment.

These route corridors are, therefore, considered among the major recipients of the
direct impacts of the infrastructure development project, and will be dealt with in detail
for the detail impacts analyses.

6. Baseline Environmental conditions

6.1 Topography and climate


Dire Dawa city administration is situated in the Eastern Lowlands of Ethiopia and has
altitude ranges between 950 - 2260 m.a.s.l. The Urban area lies in the depressed land as
compared to the surrounding hills and mountains and altitude within the city ranges
between 1130 and 1335 masl. Generally the city is surrounded by a semicircular ridge of
hills and mountains. It is surrounded by hills and steep slopes in the south eastern part,
while moderate and gentle sloped mountains boarders in the north.

The general catchments of the Boren area are inclined from south to north with altitude
range of 1180m to1127m above sea level. The average slope of the area is gentile
except the hilly area in the north western part.

Climate

Dire Dawa has generally semi-arid (kola) climatic condition. Temperature is hot
throughout the year with minor seasonal variations. November, December and January
are the coldest months, while June and July are the hottest months of the year. The
average annual temperature is about 26oc. Mean minimum and maximum
temperature ranges from 28.1oc in the winter months to 34.6oc in the summer months

The area receives a bimodal rainfall. A small rainfall occurring in spring & the big rain fall
in summer; with an average annual rainfall of 604 mm. Evapo-transpiration exceeds
precipitation in all months except in July and August.

6.2 Geology and soils


The geology of DDAC comprises metamorphic, volcanic and sedimentary rocks. On
the other hand, Fluvisols and vertisols are generally dominant soil types of the area. The
soil types of the Administrative Council vary according to the topography of the land
forms; altitude and slopes.

6.3 Water Resources


The major water source for the administrative council is ground water resource. Surface
water sources are scarce in general, while most of them do not flow during the dry
seasons. As a result the population of Dire Dawa mainly depends on the ground water
source. and few of the springs that emanate from the surrounding mountains.



                                                                                                     35
MS Consultancy                                                                         August 2013

Fina EIA study Report


The major streams that drain the Dire Dawa Administrative Council are Detchatu, Butijii,
Legahare, Dube, Goro & Elbah. The first three pass through the town of Dire Dawa and
the others are mainly at western part of the town. The Boren area is bounded by the
Goro Seasonal river to the north eastern side,

The intermittent streams start from the escarpment zone and flow north wards into the
alluvial plain. Secondary streams join them both from east and west. There are also a
number of Wades & oasis in the administrative Council.

Detchatu is the major one, among the intermittent streams in the Dire Dawa city
administrative area, where most of the precipitation as runoff from the south
(escarpment zone) drains into it. Although this stream is dry for the most part of the year,
it carries very large flow in the rainy season which sometimes causes flash flooding that
result in some damage in the downstream towns. Most of the run of from Detchatu and
the other streams spread in the low lying and flat topographic areas north of the town
recharging the ground water.

6.4 Flora and fauna Resources of the area


Flora

Acacia woodlands, bushes, open shrub lands and grass lands are typical features of
the region’s vegetation cover. Patches of junipers trees are also seen in the upper
mountain ranges. Plantation trees and tree hedges within the city proper are significant
and are providing shades and aesthetic values to the area. List of some of the plant
species of the area are included under the annex section

The Boren site is sparsely occupied by pastoralist settlements, which temporarily stay at
a location. The vast area is open grazing land covered by grass and bushes. The area is
dominated by the invasive plant species Prosopies juliflora. At few locations, crop
cultivation (maize crop) is practiced by the pastoralists, in addition to their livestock
keeping.

Fauna

As there is no forest cover that suit for wild life habitat, one cannot expect much wild
life species in the DDAC. But, there are still some wild lives that have managed to
survive in such disturbed environment. Some of these wildlife include; Hyena, baboon,
Warthog, Leopard, Common fox, Gazelle, Dikdik, Porcupine, Zebra and Lion. List of
some of wild life species found in the administrative council are included under the
annex section.

Avifauna

According to the Dire Dawa Master plan study of 2002, the following are bird species
found in the area include: Tropical Bouboou (Laniarius ferrugineus), Vultrine guineafowl
(Acryllium vulturinum), Coqui francoline (Francolineus coqui), Lilac-breasted roller
(Coracias abyssinica), Ring-necked dove (Streptopeliaca picola), Black headed oriole
(Oriolus larvatus), Blue-eared glossy starling (Lamprotornis chalybeaus), Paradise flay
catcher (Terpsiphone viridis), Yellow-billed ox pecker (Buphagus africanus), Black-
headed weaver (Ploceus cucullatus), African citril (Serinus citrinelloides) and Yellow-
billed hornbill (Tockus flavirostris).

6.5 Land use/ land cover characteristics


Dire Dawa has an estimated land area of 128,802 ha. According to the existing land
use map of the DDAC bush lands, scrub lands and shrub lands cover 38.2 % of the total
area of the DD administrative council. The cultivated land with shrubs and grasses
account about 18.7 % of the total area of the region. The largest portion of the region is
bare land, where rock out crops and bare land are the main components and account
for about 36.1 % of the total area of the Council.

On the other hand Boren LDP area is dominantly agricultural andresidential with very
few economic activitiesand services.The major land use composition of Boren LDParea
is as presented in table 5-1 below.

The land use/ land cover of the Boren area is categorized as 63% agricultural land,
25%Scattered settlement, 18 % planned residential area. Other infrastructure and
facilities occupy the remaining percentage, out of which the existing road network
occupies 7% of the land area

6.6 Population settlement and social service infrastructure

The infrastructure facilities coverage of the LDP area varies depending on the
settlement pattern. The planned area is served with all basic infrastructures such as
gravel road, electricity, telephone, potable water, garbage collection container.

The scattered residential area has no adequate services. They are obliged to fetch
water up to Sabian kebele. The area has no adequate services such as school, market
place, health facility. The development of the area should therefore address the issues
of infrastructure

There are obstructions that encounter within the command area of the LDP project
area. The major obstructions are the high tension traversing within the plots of land at
different location that can cause constraints for ROW and land acquision for the
project activities. The area covered by the electric lines is significant and can
interfere with the development project including the provision of infrastructure facilities
in the area.

6.7 Road infrastructure
Boren LDP area has a low level of road network coverage accounting only for 7% of the
total area. The exiting road network of the area is as summarized in table below. The
total road length is estimated at 32.7km covering land area of 243,985m2. However,
most of the existing roads are none engineered earth track roads without drainage
facility.

7. Potential Environmental Impacts


Discussion of impacts of the project relates to the infrastructure developments planned
to be implemented in the project area. These infrastructure developments include;
road, drainage and water supply lines construction within the Boren Local
Development area.

7.1 General


The potential significant impacts of the proposed project on the environment are
discussed in this section of the report. The discussion also identifies and recommends
appropriate benefit enhancement measures or mitigation measures for the adverse
impacts.

Impact Category

Environmental impacts caused by infrastructure development projects can be
categorized in to three major impact types. They are either of; direct impact, indirect
impact or cumulative impact types. Those impacts of the road project that will be felt
within the influence areas of the project have direct consequences, while it also has
regional and national level significance.

Direct Impacts of the Project

Direct impacts of the infrastructure development include impacts that can be caused
by the construction activities like soil and land surface disturbances, tree hedges
clearance and material removal activity at borrow and quarry development sites, dust
and noise pollution due to the excavation activities and machinery operation, property
losses within the ROW, interferences with traffic flow and interferences with the business
and trade activities, interruption of social services etc. in the highly congested and busy
urban settings of the city.

Indirect Impacts of the Project

These are chain effects or impacts that result due to the road, drainage and water
supply line construction indirectly and at distant locations from the construction
corridor. These include induced water quality deterioration as a consequence of the
spoil soils and soil erosion at up stream of water sources, increased induced
developments due to improvements in the road standard at some locations that were
inaccessible for smooth transportation facilities etc. These impacts are normally
observed during the operation phase of road projects.



                                                                                                   40

Fina EIA study Report


Influence Areas with Direct Impact

The direct influence area covers the route corridors of all of the road segments within
the LDP project area that are planned for improvements. The impact can also be felt at
all other areas that fall within 15-kms radius on both sides of the road segments to be
provided with the infrastructure planed under this project

The major sites experiencing direct adverse impacts of the project will be;

    •    Areas in the road ROW and falling within 30 - 40meters width of the road.

    •    The rivers and streams crossed by the road route, and those at             immediate
         downstream sides

    •    Material production sites; quarry, borrow material and sand extraction points,

    •    Garage sites, and material storage sites, detour and access roads created due
         to the projects.

Influence Areas with Indirect Impacts

Adjacent areas beyond the 15-kms width of the road alignment will be areas that can
indirectly benefit and /or experience adverse impacts of the            infrastructure
development project. These areas include neighbouring localities of the project route
corridor. A significant number of the population in these areas would also use and
benefit from the road construction.

The implementation of the infrastructure project also enhances the overall road
network and water supply performances at Dire Dawa city. The infrastructure coverage
would proportionately be increased as an indicator of socio-economic development of
the city as well as that of the country.

Duration and Scale of Impacts

Major direct environmental impacts on the natural environmental components are
caused mainly during the construction phase. Adverse impacts like; soil and water
resources degradation, soil erosion and clearance of tree hedges and ornamental
plants, material removal and consumption from quarry and borrow pits are caused
during the construction period. Socio-economic impacts like displacement of people,
damages to properties and conflicts between the construction works and local
people’s activities, interferences with the on-going business activities, interruption of
social services and blockages of accesses to shops and service rendering houses etc.
can happen during the construction phase of the project.




                                                                                                    41

7.2 Positive impacts of the project


The infrastructure development project will create urban transport facility to those
settlement sites away from the existing route, improvements in sanitary conditions and
increased water supply coverage of the city. Provision of those services for those
communities lacking it at present will significantly contribute positively and creates
satisfaction among the community of the Boren kebele. The efficiency in mobility for
vehicles as well as for all other road users, both motorized and none motorized mode of
transport and pedestrian will benefit from the improved road standard and conditions.

The upgrading will avail standard vehicular and public transport in the premises of those
that are lacking the services at places like the informal settlement areas and the
expansion areas. The other roads will also benefit from the upgrading by relieving of the
traffic congestions and route corridor traffic accidents on the main Dire Dawa – Melka
Jebdu road.

7.3 Adverse Environmental Impacts of the project


In this section potential adverse impacts have been identified and mitigation measures
that should be adopted to avoid or minimize adverse impacts are recommended. Of
which, some involve good engineering practices while others are viewed from socio-
economic as well as administrative points of view. The impacts described in this section
are potentially the most important as far as the overall impact of the project is
concerned. In all cases, there is a relatively high probability of occurrence of these
significant impacts if no mitigation measures are adopted. The adverse impacts of the
project shall be experienced most at those sites and locations described and on
environmental resources within the road route ROW as described below.

7.3.1    Impact on Land Resources and Soil


The construction work involves site clearance, excavation, paving and grading
activities, all of which involve disturbance of the land surface and loss of productive soil
along the road route alignment, at quarry and borrow pit development sites, along
detours, and along access roads to material production.

Road side ditches and drainage lines to be constructed to divert surface drainages to
adjacent lands are major contributors to soil erosion. Erosion effects can be enhanced
especially at steep slopes due to; cuts in soil and rock and widening of the road widths,
drainage line construction, water supply line construction, road embankment



                                                                                                    42
MS Consultancy                                                                        August 2013

construction, and excavation of foundations for replacement or for additional bridges
and culverts, and due to loosely compacted soil piles.

The impacts due to excavation are relatively low as the entire road route follows the
existing alignment. But impact can still be significant with major improvements in design
and expansion of the road widths. The topography of the area traversed by some of
the road segments is flat and rolling terrain and there won’t be steep slope cut and soil
disturbances due to terrain characteristics.

The excavation, paving and grading of surfaces accelerates erosion effects. The
eroded soil that is transported to the nearby water body can cause sedimentation and
change in the ecosystem, and on the quality of the water. Excavation is conducted for
the expanded road pavement section in this project case.

Soil contamination and soil quality deterioration can result from spills and leakage of
fuel and lubricants used for works, and also from mismanagement of used and waste
oils. During the service period of the road, soil contamination in the corridors can arise
from traffic operation and from transportation of hazardous products all of which have
already been experienced by the existing infrastructure. These impacts have been in
place with the existing road operation, and the road standard improvement will rather
reduce the adverse effect.

Proposed Mitigation measure

Proper mitigation measures should be implemented to minimize the adverse impacts on
land resource and soil erosion effects. The following measures are proposed for
inclusion both in the design and to be implemented during the construction and
operation phases;

    •    Planning the excavation works during the dry season especially around river
         crossings and at road side ditches and drainage line construction.

7.3.2    Adverse impacts on tree hedges and grass cover


The construction work will be implemented partly in an urban environment where major
land use and land cover is occupied by housing establishments and paved surfaces.
However, at the informal settlement sites and at the open fields planned for expansion
areas, bushes and tree hedge do exist. Trees and grass cover also encounter at offset
distances in the premises of project areas along all segments.

Tree hedges along the roads might have to be removed for the construction of the
road, drainage line and water supply line in some areas, where the width of the road is
narrow and where no provisions are left for expansions. These trees have significant
contribution to the city beautification and to regulate the local climatic conditions.
They are serving as shades and facilitate wind circulation in the city. Hence, at most
precautions have to be taken to minimize the damage to those trees both during the
design and construction phases.

Mitigation measure should be planned prior to construction commencement. The
design should make the at most effort and find alternative alignments and alternative
routes to avoid tree removal. In case avoidance is found impossible, adequate
compensation should be paid for replacement of the trees. At least 15 tree seedlings of
indigenous species (of similar type as those damaged if possible) should be planted for
every tree cut by the project. Adequate compensation to enable the tree plantation
and care until it grows to a reasonable height needs to be paid to the owner/ institution
in charge of the city greenery and park development.

7.3.3    Adverse Impact on Air Quality


The assessment and monitoring of air pollution level depends on the traffic volume,
traffic composition, and speed and road surface. Improvement in the road conditions
shall encourage motorized vehicles and industrial development along the road
alignments including those areas that used to be inaccessible for continuous vehicle
movement. This can contribute to the pollution effect of the local atmosphere of the
residential areas during the operation phases of the road.

The major air pollution comes from dust particles during the construction phase. The
dust particle of excavated soil and from the sandy clay soil of the area can easily be
exposed to wind action.

Air pollution shall also be caused by particles produced by smoke from vehicle and
machinery motor exhaust, and all can contribute to the adverse impacts. The air
pollution effects shall have significant adverse impacts during construction as the



                                                                                                  44
MS Consultancy                                                                      August 2013

surface is excavated and spoil soils is either stock piled or transported to disposal sites at
this stage.

Proposed Mitigation Measures

The construction period air pollution impacts can be mitigated by:

    •    Avoiding long period of stockpiling excess excavated material on site.

    •    Dust suppression measures like water spraying on the paved and excavated
         surfaces can minimize the impact of pollution due to dust particles.

    •    Regular maintenances of vehicles and machinery motors for better
         performances. Installation of dust suppression accessories to machinery exhausts.

    •    Trucks carrying fine material that can easily be windblown should be covered
         while transporting.

    •    Sprinkle water to the road so that it could minimize the dust created by the road
         construction works.

    •    Install dust suppression accessories at crusher plants, for machineries producing
         excessive smoke.

    •    Air pollution prevention measures should be incorporated in the construction
         work specifications and contract agreements.

7.3.4    Noise and vibration impacts


Noise and vibration result from construction activities in general but particularly from
operation of heavy machinery. Other operations generating significant noise include
concrete mixing plants and stone crushing. Sustained noise levels during construction
are expected to be much higher than the ambient noise level in the project area. If
blasting of quarry sites and at other construction works are carried at night, it may
affect/disturb the sleeping of the local community. Therefore, to minimize noise
disturbance to the population around the sites, it is recommended not to undertake
activities producing nuisance noise level during rest hours and during night time; and
Locate quarry site in faraway places from settlements areas.

7.3.5    Adverse Impact on Water Resources


There are seasonal rivers and streams like Goro River that are crossed by the road
routes and in the road drainage basins. The road embankments may interfere with the



                                                                                                     45
MS Consultancy                                                                         August 2013

natural run off flow and pose impacts on recharge rate of the local ground water
sources.

The drainage line facilities to be provided carry and discharge all pollutant loads
collected from their respective watershed and discharge at the downstream water
courses.

Degradation of water quality can be caused by entry of excavated soil material in to
the downstream river courses, during construction activities, oil and fuel spillages from
leaking machinery parts and upon refilling equipment. During the operation phase the
drainage line to be provided will continuously and during the rainy season collect and
concentrate pollutants including; solid and liquid waste from the catchment and
discharge into receiving water bodies as point source pollution.

The upkeep of the water resources is, therefore, very crucial both to the health and
economic wellbeing of the community in project areas and at downstream sides.

Proposed mitigation measures

    •    Provision of adequate drainage structure so as to maintain the normal flow
         direction and attempt to maintain uniform water distribution over surfaces at
         downstream side of catchments. This can reduce flow concentration to specific
         direction that can result in flooding effects and soil erosion, helps uniform
         recharge of water sources.

    •    Avoid stockpiling spoils at river banks, streams and groundwater sources

    •    Improvement measures in waste management( solid waste and liquid waste
         collection and treatment) should be exercised to minimize the waste load
         washed away by runoff into the drainages and ultimately into the water sources.

    •    Avoid spilling of oil from vehicles and machinery near water points and
         settlements; and washing of cars in the rivers.

    •    Cart away spoils soils immediately and regularly while working in the premises of
         river crossings.

    •    The water quality deterioration caused by pollution from oil products and
         chemicals can be minimized by timely maintenance of leaking machinery parts,
         good housekeeping practices in garages.

    •    Avoid entry of excavated surplus material in to the water body while operation
         on sites

    •    Provision of adequate flow dispersal structures following the natural flow regime
         of the runoff water.

                                                                                                   46

    •     Energy dissipaters, Stone rip raps or ditches sides protection might be required at
         the discharge side of culverts to minimize soil erosion and gulley formation.

7.3.6    Adverse impacts on properties and social services


The construction of the road will be implemented in densely populated and settled
urban settings, where developed Infrastructure and housings exist. The proposed road
also traverses through a high traffic loaded city centres like road crossings and round
about squares, and several intersections that are heavily loaded with motorized and
none motorized transport and pedestrians movements. Some of the adverse impacts
likely to occur include;

    •    Utility service lines; electric lines, existing water pipelines, storm drainages and
         telecommunication cables might encounter during excavation. Those utility lines
         falling within the ROW width might be affected, resulting in the disruption of the
         services; (water supply, electric light, and telecommunication services may be
         disrupted) until maintenances are done.

    •     In most of the areas with open ditch drainage, there are concrete slab crossings
         or pipe culverts at the entrance to each compound. The concrete slab covers
         and culverts need to be demolished during the road width expansion and
         drainage upgrading work, resulting in loss of the material to the owner. These
         facilities have to be either reconstructed or compensated for in monitory terms
         based on the preferences of the affected people.

    •    In areas where the width of the route corridor is restricted, partial damage to
         houses and/or fences might encounter at some sites, while only fences might be
         affected at other places. This issue is significant for this project, since the
         available width (open spaces) in the ROW at some locations are restricted due
         to old aged buildings and houses to fit into the improved road standard.

Proposed mitigation measures

The project affected people should be compensated for the damages caused to their
properties. Utility service owners should be consulted and their inputs and cooperation
be secured prior to commencement of the construction work. Location maps for the
utility services can be obtained from the utility owners and/or the municipality. The city
master plan may also assist in identifying and guiding the provisions left for utility lines
along the road sides.

The cost for relocation of the service lines will be covered by the road project.
Interruption of the services should be avoided as far as possible or minimized through
immediate repair and maintenances of the defects. Temporary alternative lines should

MS Consultancy                                                                         August 2013

be arranged in cases where relocation requires longer time, and customers’ complaints
should be minimized.

7.3.7    Impacts on public health and traffic safety


Trenches of varying widths are excavated to burry storm sewers and other utility service
lines along the project route. Some of the damages related to such activities are;

   •    Trenches can be source of health risk and cause accidents to children and old
        aged people if left open for long.

   •    There is a potential safety issue associated with construction near to schools,
        hospitals, public areas. Signs should be erected in the roads where construction is
        underway to prevent accidents. The open trench areas must be posted and
        fenced off at all times.

   •    Solid wastes deposited in the open trench and polluted stagnant water formed is
        aesthetically unfavourable and become sources of several disease causing
        organisms. Stagnant water in ditches can be cause for infectious diseases, and
        breeding grounds for disease vectors like mosquito.

   •    Entrance and access to houses might be blocked due to excavated trenches
        and piled up excavated spoil soil. Road routes in the project areas might also be
        blocked to traffic passages due to road crossing activities, piles of soil and
        construction material. This can be risky especially for children and old aged
        people while crossing to gate in and to gate out of their dwelling houses.

   •    There is a potential safety issue associated with construction in the vicinity of the
        residential areas accompanying an increase in traffic. Temporary traffic line
        blockage may be caused during construction due to road crossings and road
        construction and due to surplus excavated material deposits. As a result, there
        will be an increase in traffic volume during construction and this increase is
        unavoidable.

   •     There are sensitive noise receptors such as schools, clinics and religious places
        within the city and along the project area; and consequently noise generated
        from the site will be a major annoyance to a large number of people in the
        densely settled urban areas.

Proposed Mitigation Measures

Trench widths should be designed not to cause obstructions or difficulties for crossing,
especially in front of dwelling houses. Temporary bridge crossings should be included as



                                                                                                     48
MS Consultancy                                                                         August 2013
Bren Area Infrastructure Development Project, Dore Dawa              Dire Dawa City Administration
Fina EIA study Report


required in the project activity schedule. The crossings should be convenient for
disabled people, children and old aged people.

Excavated surplus material should be removed immediately as the construction
progresses and no piled up material is kept long along the roads and in the premises of
houses to avoid access blockages and traffic congestions. Deep excavated trenches
and excessively widened ditches should not be left open for long. Immediate and
section by section backfilling of trenches should be arranged as soon as pipe laying
works are complete. Back fill material should be compacted well to avoid excessive
settlements and further deepening at latter stages.

The contractor is responsible for the safety of residents and he must prepare a safety
plan including road signs and agree with the Site Engineer on the proposed safety plan.

To minimize the disturbance to the local population, it is recommended that
construction work producing nuisance level noise, be limited to normal working hours.

7.3.8    Impacts due to ancillary works


The ancillary works like material development will require plots of land to be occupied
temporarily, either at previously developed site or at new sites. Due to the scarce
vegetation cover and limited forest area, even patches of trees and bush covered land
has to be preserved to the extent possible, so as to regenerate the flora resources of
the area. Activities and site selection for ancillary works, therefore, require careful
consideration of resulting environmental consequences.

Some of the proposed material sites that have relatively dense vegetation cover have
to be preserved by identifying alternative material site as far as possible.

Material production sites should not be located within or in close proximity of sensitive
Physical & Cultural Resources (PCRs) sites like dense forest areas, wild life habitat,
settlement sites, and social and cultural service areas and at cultural and historical
heritage sites.

The quarry material production area has to be screened /determined/ in consultation
and with the approval of the supervision consultant and the client,DD city
administration. Also sufficient consultation should be conducted with the local
administration (Woredas) prior to commencing excavation activity. The relevant
stakeholders including the regional environmental protection offices have to be
involved in site selection and screening and to demarcate and fix the boundary of
disturbance for quarry and borrow material production.

The left over spoil soil should be collected and kept aside for rehabilitation of the site at
later stage of the work. Spoil soil should be shaped and compacted to avoid erosion

                                                                                                     49
MS Consultancy                                                                         August 2013

and leakage to the river courses, water bodies or stockpiled on dense vegetation
covered ground.

Upon completion of the use of the production site, it should be rehabilitated and
restored to its original state to a reasonable degree so as to avoid water ponding, soil
erosion, aesthetically undesirable situations and disfigured landscape. Back filling,
grading and re-vegetation of the site would help to mitigate the impact. Based on the
site condition, simple soil retaining structures and runoff water diversion structures might
be required to stabilize the soil structure and reduce the effect of soil erosion until it
consolidates.

The engineer on site has the responsibility to give instructions and assistance to the
contractor in material site management and rehabilitation activities. Site environmental
management should also involve the DD environmental protection office, the DDULG
project coordination office and also give due consideration for the communities’
opinion and comments.

Rehabilitation works of the abandoned material site be done properly and on timely
bases. Subsequent payments should consider the proper site restoration and
rehabilitation of abandoned material sites as one of the criteria of work performance.
The payments and release of performance bonds will be withhold until rehabilitation
commences and tangible effort is seen on site, and should only be effected if proper
rehabilitation is done for already abandoned material site along with other activities.
This has to be done by the supervising consultant. The project coordination office is
expected to specify this condition as payable item upon hiring the consultant and the
contractor.

The construction contract has to have a clause to the effect that quarry sites and
access roads are deemed to be part of the site, so that the powers and authority of the
Engineer extend to them in the same way as to other areas where works are being
undertaken.

7.3.9    Impact due to spoil soil disposal areas


It is expected that the project works will generate large quantities of spoil material and
debris, especially due to widening of the carriage width and due to some minor
geometric design adjustments. It is likely that there will be occasions when unsuitable
existing road material will need to be removed and disposed of. In addition, material
eroded from the spoil itself can be deposited in water courses, with adverse effects on
channel morphology and capacity to convey flood flows, deteriorates the water
quality of receiving streams.




                                                                                                    50

Fina EIA study Report


Mitigation Measures

The construction contract document should include requirements that spoil disposal
sites should be officially proposed by the contractor at areas designated by the
relevant local administrative organ and permission is obtained accordingly by the
contractor. The selected disposal site shall be in unproductive land, with preference
being given to backfilling deep gullies, quarry and borrow sites developed and
abandoned by the contractor, provided that the requirements of the clause which
follows are met.

The construction contract should contain clauses to the effect that all spoil material
shall only be disposed of at sites which have been approved by the Engineer and in
accordance with approved site-specific environmental plans. The side-tipping of spoil
in any location shall be specifically prohibited. Prior to the commencement of disposal
at any site, the contractor shall prepare a site-specific Site Environmental Plan (SEP) for
the approval of the Engineer and the local supervising official.

7.3.10 Impacts due Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) and HIV/AIDs


Road and infrastructure construction and other similar type of construction works are
considered to be having high potential (due to their mobility) for the spread of
communicable diseases, such as Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) and HIV/AIDS. The
spread could be from the construction workforce to the local population and vice
versa.

This is partly true because construction workers are mostly young and sexually active
group of the population and are mobile, and have more income than the local
population to spend. Hence, the increase in the number of sex workers and alcoholism
are believed to contribute to the spread STD and HIV/AIDS.

Proposed Mitigation Measures

    •    Design awareness creation of projects/programs to address the problem and
         spread of HIV/AIDS among project workers and local communities

    •    Provide education for local communities regarding the spread of HIV/AIDs and
         STDs in public places, schools, and through community clubs and groups

    •    Work closely with local health service giving institutions to control the spread of
         STD and HIV/AIDS

    •    Carry out voluntary testing

    •    Provide care and support for HIV affected and effected groups


                                                                                                    51

8. Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMP)


Environmental Management Plan

Environmental management plan specifies mitigation and monitoring actions with time
frames, specific responsibilities assigned and follow-up actions defined. Major negative
impacts and proposed mitigation measures have been out-lined in the above sections.
Implementations of these measures have to be carried out at different stages of the
road construction & operation phases.

During the design stage the consultant should incorporate proposed mitigation
measures in the design and tender documents. The contractual agreement should also
include articles to enforce the environmental issues. Construction stage activities are
mainly the responsibility of the contractor and that of the construction supervision
consultant. The actual physical implementation works are carried out mostly at this
stage. The execution of the road construction work should also equally treat the
implementation of the physical works of environmental mitigation measures.
Environmental issues during the operation phase of the road shall be handled by the
owner of the road infrastructure, the relevant department.

8.1 Pre-Construction phase management plan


Prior to contractor mobilization and the commencement of construction,
environmental management will be concerned with the following principal groups of
activities:

        •    Ensuring that all government and procedures relating to EIA are complied with.

        •    Implementation of land and property acquisition procedures including the
             payment of compensation.

        •    Relocation & compensation for Utility services in the ROW to avoid service
             disruptions and complaints from user community.

        •    Preparation of monitoring action plan and get it approved by the engineer.

        •    Identification and approval for spoil soils disposal sites.

As the project promoter, the DD ULGDP coordination office will be responsible for
submitting the EIS to the DDEPA for evaluation according to internal procedures.

8.2 Construction Phase management plan


Most of the project environmental management activities will be carried out during the
construction phase, since this is time when most impacts can be expected to arise.
Management will very largely be concerned with controlling impacts which may result
from the actions of the Contractor, through enforcement of the construction contract
clauses related to protection of the environment as a whole and of the components
within it. In this respect, it is important to recognize that successful mitigation of
construction impacts can only be achieved if the environmental protection measures,
as set out in the EIA document and construction contract, are properly enforced.
Proposed

Overall primary responsibility for construction supervision and contract management,
and, therefore, for environmental management during construction, will lie with the
Engineer as defined in the construction contract. However, certain powers and
authority relating to day-to-day supervision will be delegated by the Engineer to the
Resident Engineer (RE). The RE will have executive responsibility for ensuring that all site
environmental management and monitoring aspects are dealt with promptly and
properly.

Particular attention will be paid to establishing procedures whereby emergency action
can be taken by the site staff in the event of the contractor acting in a manner which
may cause immediate and significant environmental damage, for example problems
associated with interruptions to water supply, or contamination of land, groundwater or
surface water through inappropriate handling of contaminating substances, cause
damages to environmental and social resources.

The implementation of proposed mitigation measures will                 be monitored            for
compliances to set standards.

8.3 Post-construction phase management plan


Continued enjoyment of the benefits arising from implementation of the project will only
be achieved if effective routine and periodic pavement, earthworks and drainage
system maintenance is carried out in a timely manner. Environmental management
and monitoring in this respect will be the responsibility of the DD municipality, with
implementation being carried out either by the delegated departments themselves or
by external contractors. The detail of environmental management plan is described as
in Table7-1below.

8.4.1      General Considerations


The monitoring program for the present project will be undertaken both as compliance
to set and proposed measures to mitigate adverse impacts and/or to enhance the
positive ones. It also attempts to check the effects of project implementation. In this
regard, the monitoring will try to meet the following objectives:

  •       To check on whether the proposed mitigation and benefit enhancement
          measures have actually been adopted, and are proving effective outcomes in
          practice

  •       To provide a means whereby any impacts which were subject to uncertainty at
          the time of preparation of the EIA, or which were unforeseen, can be identified,
          and to provide a basis for formulating appropriate additional impact control
          measures.

  •       To provide information on the actual nature and extent of key impacts and the
          effectiveness of mitigation and benefit enhancement measures which, through a
          feedback mechanism, can improve the planning and execution of future, similar
          projects.

Compliance monitoring is usually given more emphasis in the case of road projects
than is effects monitoring. This is because most impact controls take the form of
measures incorporated in project designs and contract documents, and the extent to
which recommendations on these matters, as set out in the EIA, are complied with,
plays a major part in determining the overall environmental performance of the project.

8.4.2      Project Monitoring Phases


Pre-construction Phase monitoring

Monitoring during the pre-construction phase of the project will be concerned with two
aspects:

      •    Checking that the project designs and specifications incorporate appropriate
           measures to minimize negative impacts and to enhance beneficial impacts.

      •    Check that mitigation measures have been included in BOQ as payable items.

    •    Checking that the appropriate environmental protection clauses have been
         included in the contract documents to allow control of actions by the
         contractor, which are potentially damaging to the environment.

These activities have been carried out as part of the preparation of designs and tender
documents for the project and the monitoring at the pre-construction phase has to
confirm this issues.

Construction Phase Monitoring

Environmental monitoring during the construction phase will comprise two principal
groups of activities:

    •    Review of the Contractor’s plans, method statements, temporary works designs,
         and arrangements relating to obtaining necessary approvals from the Engineer,
         so as to ensure that environmental protection measures specified in the contract
         documents are adopted, and that the Contractor’s proposals provide an
         acceptable level of impact control.

    •    Systematic observation on a day-to-day basis of all site activities and the
         Contractor’s offsite facilities including quarry and borrow areas, as a check that
         the contract requirements relating to environmental matters are in fact being
         complied with, and that no impacts foreseen and unforeseen are occurring.

These activities will be fully integrated with other construction supervision and
monitoring activities carried out by the construction supervision consultant. Primary
responsibility for ensuring that an adequate level of environmental monitoring is carried
out will lie with the RE, as part of his duties connected with general site supervision.
Actual monitoring on a day-to-day basis will be carried out by the site staff
/environmentalist from the construction supervision consultant, under the direction of
the RE.

The majority of monitoring will comprise visual observations, carried out at the same
time as the engineering monitoring activities. Site inspections will take place with
emphasis on early identification of any environmental problems and the initiation of
suitable remedial action. Where remedial actions have been required on the part of
the Contractor, further checks will need to be made to ensure that these are actually
being implemented to the agreed schedule and in the required form. Each part of the
site where construction is taking place needs to be formally inspected from an
environmental viewpoint on a regular basis.

Monthly reports prepared by the RE should contain a brief section referring to
environmental matters, which summarizes the results of site monitoring, remedial
actions, which have been initiated, and whether or not the resultant action is having

the desired result. The report will also identify any unforeseen environmental problems
and will recommend suitable additional actions. Progress meetings with the contractor
will also include a review of environmental aspects.

Post-construction Phase Monitoring

Post-construction phase monitoring will be concerned with identification of the need for
routine and periodic maintenance to pavement, earthworks, drains and drainage
structures, together with checking that the maintenance works are being carried out
properly and are not resulting in environmental damage. This aspect will be the
responsibility of DDRA Maintenance Department and the regional environmental
protection departments.

9. Conclusion and Recommendation


The Boren area is designated as expansion and industrial zone of the DD city
administration. Large scale business, institutions, commercial and residential building
complexes will be developed and will continue to be expanded in the area .

The provision of infrastructure to the Boren area and upgrading of the existing ones will
facilitate such development and the planned vision and missions of the LDP as per the
study. The basic social services for the community will be availed. Sanitary condition will
improve, transport services will improve, traffic flow will be facilitated in the congested
areas, while it will open up vehicular transport facilities for areas lacking public transport
in their premises. Some of the segments traverse residential areas where passage to
vehicle is difficult at present.

However, adverse impacts will also be significant during the project implementation.
Vegetation clearance and land disturbance and related environmental impacts are
likely, the densely settled and commercial sites with houses and facilities will definitely
experience complication, while ROW clearance and relocation of existing facilities and
service utility lines may be requisite. Significant number houses and utility service lines
will have to be demolished and relocated at areas of narrow ROW width. Traffic
management; mobility and traffic safety issues will also be significant and needs well
organized management system.

So it is the recommendation of this study that the mitigation measures proposed at all
stages of the project implementation be given due attention and considered during
the whole processes.

With careful and well planned site management, the project can be implemented with
relatively lower adverse impacts.
