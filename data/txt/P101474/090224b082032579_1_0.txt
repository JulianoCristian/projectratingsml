                         The project will be closed in December 31, 2014. Most projects under construction are expected to be completed during this financial year (which closes on July 7, 2014). The
                         remaining six months will be used to complete ongoing works contracts and complete consultancy services. The project has disbursed US$149.34 (99.6%) of the original credit and
                         US$82.6 million (57.9%) of the additional financing. Out of the remaining US$60 million, US$36 million is already committed. Cities have just received their allocations for the current
                         financial year, and the remaining US$24 million is expected to be committed by July 2014.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Progress towards the ULGDP’s development objective and overall implementation progress is satisfactory. The project is likely to achieve its development objectives. The EFY 2004
                         (FY 12) Annual Performance Assessment (APA) completed in August 2013 indicates that 14 cities of 19 cities have had good performance (with a score of 75 percent and above
                         across the performance measures), and another four achieved satisfactory performance (with a score of 50 percent or above). Cities are making good progress in sustaining the
                         improvement in the overall city wide management and expansion of municipal infrastructure. Based on the results, 14 cities received accelerated allocations, four cities received full
                         allocations, and one city did not receive an allocation for EFY 2006 (FY2014) because of less-than-satisfactory performance.

                         Key achievements include:
                         (a) Cities have selected transformational projects in accordance with their vision and missions; and b) the cities visited have selected appropriate projects to fill the existing
                         infrastructure and service delivery gaps, such as construction of cobble stone roads, landfills, and markets. The quantity and quality of infrastructure and services that cities have
                         created under the ULGDP is substantial. All cities have now paved most of their secondary and feeder roads in cobblestones. This has greatly beautified cities, while controlling
                         flooding and improving mobility. Internal and external audit reports are showing continued good financial management performance. The audit reports of the all the cities visited are
                         qualified reports with minor comments. Most of the cities visited have sufficient capacity to fulfill their mandates. All the cities visited by the mission team have staff with the required

                         minimum entry qualifications.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
