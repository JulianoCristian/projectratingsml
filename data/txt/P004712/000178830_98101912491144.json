villages in 27\n            provinces, 16 provinces in the South, 5 in the North, 2 in\n            the East and 4 in the Central Region. The total number of\n            households connected under the project would reach about 1\n            million covering a population of about 6 million. The\n            project includes: (a) construction of about 15,500 km of\n            primary lines, and about 16,600 km of secondary lines; (b)\n            installation of 10,750 distribution transformers, about 1.0\n            million kWh meters and 10,500 km of street lighting; (c)\n            supply of tools, implements, equipment and vehicles for\n            construction, installation and servicing; (d) feasibility,\n            detailed engineering and construction of two or more\n            mini-hydro pilot projects; and (e) consultancy services for\n            a study of mini-hydro schemes in Thailand and a study for\n            PEA's operations development. In addition to generating\n            revenues for the electricity sector, the project would\n            produce quantifiable indirect benefits due to fuel cost\n            savings, increased productivity of cottage industries and\n            power tools, and savings in operating costs of other motive power."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
