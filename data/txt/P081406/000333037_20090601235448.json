the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: competitively designed and organized competitive\n            bidding among qualified contractors gave Compania Nationala\n            de Transport al Energiei Electrice (Transelectrica) good\n            performance at competent prices, well below original cost\n            Estimates, also self-evident but nevertheless a lesson worth\n            noting. The development of a functioning electricity market\n            is a complex undertaking which Romania, the Government and\n            the project's three executing agencies, accomplished\n            successfully with the support of the project. A clear\n            strategy (the road map); competent and committed staff in\n            three executing agencies; close coordination between the\n            agencies, with the Government, and with the European\n            Commission and the Bank; and support by highly qualified\n            consultants with hands-on experience were the key\n            ingredients for Romania's success. Transelectrica\n            experiences and expects increasing challenges, difficulties,\n            and delays in its projects involving land acquisition. To\n            mitigate land acquisition delay risks, the Government could\n            explore amendments to Romania's land acquisition\n            framework for those energy projects which the Government\n            deems to be priority projects of public/national interest.\n            This can be done by streamlining procedures and updating the\n            law in force, in order to avoid delays due to disputes\n            settlement over compensation levels."}, "docdt": "2009-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
