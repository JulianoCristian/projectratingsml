This project is\n            an excellent example of a quick response to an immediate\n            request by the client for assistance in meeting the urgent\n            need for transmission investments and support for\n            development of its power market. Strong government support\n            at the highest levels insured both rapid processing and a\n            high quality product. The Bank, on its part, was able to\n            field an experienced team able to draw on the Bank's\n            global experience, particularly in the development of\n            competitive power markets. This is an area in which the Bank\n            has a strong competitive advantage and consequently, high\n            value added. The project was appraised in a highly\n            professional manner with all aspects receiving careful\n            attention. The project is also notable for its close\n            coordination with other donors. The European institutions\n            are active in this country and responsible for most of the\n            investments made. They have accepted the Bank's\n            preeminent role in market development and have closely\n            coordinated their investments with the Bank. More\n            importantly, the country itself has taken on the major role\n            in coordinating the various donors and has produced a road\n            map outlining sector policy as a part of the preparation for\n            this project. This project was not originally in the\n            program. The country assistance strategy (CAS) assumed this\n            was a sector in which the Bank could withdraw because the\n            international private sector would be forthcoming with the\n            necessary resources. This assumption proved to be incorrect\n            and it took both time and pressure from the country to alter\n            the Bank's perspective.  The Bank probably needs to be\n            more flexible in its programming, particularly in middle\n            income countries that are capable of identifying their need\n            to change priorities in response to changing circumstances."}, "docdt": "2003-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
