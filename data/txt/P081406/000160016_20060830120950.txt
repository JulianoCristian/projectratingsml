Environment Management Plan for Upgrading to 400 KV the Gutinas-Suceava 
Transmission Lines 
 
PROJECT: 
 SWITCHING THE 220 kV OHLs (GUTINAS-BACAU SOUTH, BACAU SOUTH -
ROMAN NORTH AND ROMAN NORTH-SUCEAVA) TO 400 kV OHL WITHIN THE 
NATIONAL POWER GRID
 
I.  
BACKGROUND PROJECT INFORMATION
Transelectrica has requested to use Loan savings from the Romania Electricity Market Project 
–
Loan No. 7181-RO in order to upgrade to 400 kV the Gutinas - Bacau - Roman Nord – Suceava lines. 
Electricity Market Project implementation is progressing smoothly, and is expected to be completed 
before the original loan closing date.  
 
Due to the highly competitive procurement process Transelectrica made considerable savings 
amounting to 19.4 million EUR from Loan proceeds and asked to use it for financing additional two 
sets of additional activities: 
 
(i) 
upgrading to 400 kV of the Gutinas - Bacau - Roman Nord – Suceava transmission lines  by 
Transelectrica, and 
(ii) 
technical assistance and software to OPCOM for the development of a regional power 
market exchange. 
 
Upgrading to 400 kV of the Gutinas - Bacau - Roman Nord – Suceava lines is the first phase of 
a
major three-phase transmission program that has been identified for Bank support under the ECSEE 
APL facility approved in January 2005 to support the development of the Energy Community of South 
East Europe (ECSEE). The Gutinas - Bacau –Roman Nord - Suceava is the only supply route to 
connect the central and north part of Moldova region. 
Under Part A of the current Description of the Project, the complete (all voltages) rehabilitation 
of two substations (Fundeni, and Iernut) are financed from Loan proceeds. The proposed new activities 
would modernize (upgrade to 400kV) three smaller substations (Bacau South, Roman North, and 
Suceava), to upgrade the Gutinas - Bacau - Roman Nord – Suceava transmission lines from 220kV to 
400kV. The grid/wires have already the capacity of 400 kV power transmissions. Upgrade of the 
Gutinas substation is under implementation, being financed by the Nordic Investment Bank. 
The proposed additional new activities would lead to increased transmission capacity, improved 
reliability of power transmission capacity as well as reduction of transmission losses. The map of the 
Romanian national grid is attached. 
 
II.  
PROJECT LOCATION
The power transmission line Gutinas- Suceava is located in the east part of Romania, and 
supply with electricity the eastern region of Romania. called Moldova. Moldova region is located 
between the Carpathian Mountains and Prut river. The line starts at the north of Onesti town with the 
Gutinas substation, pass Bacau and Roman cities, and ends in Suceava city  
Page  4
Page 4 of 34 
The Gutinas substation is currently under rehabilitation. . The Nordic Investment Bank has 
provided a loan to Transelectica to finance this project which will upgrade the Gutinas substation to 
400kV from 220kv.
 The proposed project to be finance from the Bank’s loan proceeds/savings will 
finance the rehabilitation/ upgrading of the rest three substations located on this power transmission 
line, respectively: Bacau South, Roman North, and Suceava, and switching the overhead lines (OHL) 
to 400kV from 220 kV. 
 
A
The (220/110 kV Bacau South transformer substation
 is located near Bacau city, in Letea 
Veche village. The area of the 400 (220) kV substation is about 14,000 sq.m. 
 
The vehicle access into Bacau South substation is done from Bucharest – Roman road 
alternative. Inside the yard the existing internal roads will be used for transport of equipment and 
structural elements. 
The performance of conversion to 400 kV voltage works does not demand the complete or 
temporary procurement of some additional land areas, besides the enclosed perimeter of the outdoor 
substation. 
 
B
The 220/110 kV Roman North transformer substation
 is located at the outskirts of Roman 
town, in no. 1 Plopilor street. 
 
The area of the 400 (220) kV substation is about 27,000 sq.m. 
The vehicle access into Roman North substation is done from DN2 national road. Inside the 
yard the existing internal roads will be used for transport of equipment and structural elements. 
The performance of conversion to 400 kV voltage works does not demand the complete or 
temporary procurement of some additional land areas, besides the enclosed perimeter of the outdoor 
substation. 
 
C
The 220/110 kV Suceava transformer substation
 is located at the outskirts of Suceava city, in 
no. 4 Falticeni street. 
 
The area of the 400 (220) kV substation is about 22,000 sq.m. 
The vehicle access into Suceava substation is done from DN2 national road. Inside the yard the existing 
internal roads will be used for transport of equipment and structural elements. 
The performance of conversion to 400 kV voltage works does not demand the complete or 
temporary procurement of some additional land areas, besides the enclosed perimeter of the outdoor 
substation.

DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project has two components 
–substations’ upgrading and OHL upgrading. . 
A
Upgrading to 400 kV and modernizing the transforming substations (Bacau South, Roman 
North and Suceava) 
 
•
Replacing the autotransformers  of 220/110 kV-200 MVA with the transformers of  
400/110 kV-250 MVA; 
•
Replacing the existing equipment manufactured for 220 kV voltage; 
•
Replacing the technically obsolete equipment; 
•
Constructing the  400 kV substation of Suceava; 
•
Replacing the existing classical control and protection equipment with integrated and 
digital one having a hierarchical, decentralized, distributed and open architecture. The system 
will consist of the control and the protection sub-systems.   
•
Civil engineering developments due to equipment replacements. 
 
B
Switching the OHLs (Gutinas-Bacau South, Bacau South -Roman North and Roman North-
Suceava) to 400 kV 
 
•
Adjusting the clearance distances between the OHL and other crossed over lines  as per the 
norms in force for 400 kV voltage; 
•
Stretching to arrow the live conductors of the lines to ensure the appropriate sizes as per the 
requirements in the norms in force;   
•
Changing the glass insulators with composite ones at the crossings over rivers, national roads, 
electric  rail roads and 110 kV OHL;  
•
Construction of an access  roads to the terminals crossing over the Siret river; 
•
Dismantling the shunting connections of the 400 kV insulation strings, used for the operation at 
220 kV ( at the inlets of the transforming substations); 
•
Connecting the 220 kV OHL FAI-Suceava to the new bay in the substation of Suceava (block 
bay auto-transformer-FAI OHL).  
Note:
 
No new OHLs are to be constructed and no changes in the routes of the existing OHLs are 
to be made; only adjustment works are necessary.

VI.  
STATUS OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS
The approvals from the Local Environmental Protection Agencies (LEA) have 
been obtained. LEA decided that it was not necessary to evaluate the impact upon the 
environment and, in compliance with the provisions of Order no. 863/2002, issued by the 
Ministry of Waters, Forests and Environment (MWFE), LEA have applied a 
simplified 
approval procedure. 
As per Art. 18 of the MWFE Order
 
no.860/2002 (evaluation 
procedure of the environmental impact, for issuing the approval), the Environmental 
Protection Agencies have issued 
favorable environmental Approvals of B type 
without environmental agreement (which is not required). 
 
Following LEA requirements, there were notifications published in the local 
newspapers in the areas where the works were executed and during a 10 day period the 
interested public could provide comments. No comments have been received. The 
notifications included information on the investment project, on the location and times 
from where and when detailed information may be obtained, on the location and the 
deadline for comments. 
 
LEA representatives have checked the locations; and records have been made. 
The Environmental Agencies’ Technical Analysis Teams have been notified and, based 
on specific documentation, have issued favorable environmental Approvals of B type 
without environmental agreement (which is not required). 
At the same time, 
favorable approvals have been obtained form the local administration authorities along 
the OHLs routes. 
 
VII.  
MITIGATION OF ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS 
 
Sections IV and V above detail the environment targets, mitigation measures, 
monitoring and responsibilities, as well as costs of environmental impact mitigating 
actions. The measures consist of: visual impact; air quality; noise impact; wastes from 
construction and demolish activities (metal, ceramics, glass, wood, waste oil, concrete 
etc); PCB contaminated soil; hazardous substances; soil, sub-soil and groundwater 
quality; waste waters quality (rain, residual and oil-polluted waters) – during construction 
phase; and air quality; noise impact; electro-magnetic field; hazardous substances, PCB 
and bird-fighting protection – during operation. 
 
VIII.  
OTHER SAFEGUARDS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
A
Land acquisition.
 
Project implementation does not require land acquisition. To 
extend Suceava substation a land surface of 6,850 sq.m. is needed. This land is state 
owned and managed by the State Domain Agency. The land is to be transferred to 
Transelectrica, free of charge, based on a Government Decision. This procedure is on-
going.

B
Cultural property.
 
There is no impact upon cultural objectives.  The activities are 
developed in the exiting locations: routes of the existing OHLs, except the substation of 
Suceava which is to be extended by the area mentioned above, without affecting 
objectives of any kind. 
C
Incomes of third parties.
 No access to incomes is affected. The activities along 
the OHLs routes will be carried out in those periods of the year with low impact upon the 
crops. Approvals have been obtained from the landowners in the locations where the 
investment work is carried out. In case some crops are affected, compensations will be 
granted to the landowners. Estimation shows small amount necessary for this purpose
