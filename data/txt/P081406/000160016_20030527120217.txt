Project Development 
Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The project 
development 
objective 
is 
to 
develop a 
well-functioning 
wholesale 
electricity market 
with 
the 
aim 
of: 
(a) 
putting 
in 
place 
a transparent 
and predictable 
commercial and regulatory framework and 
a 
power 
exchange 
that 
will 
facilitate 
electricity trading 
within 
a 
competitive 
national, 
regional 
and 
eventually European 
market; 
and 
(b) 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
and 
reliability 
of 
the 
transmission 
system 
in 
order 
to 
support 
trading 
and 
supply 
electricity 
at 
least cost 
to 
consumers. 
A 
well-functioning 
wholesale 
electricity 
market 
is 
an 
integral 
component 
of 
Romania’s 
strategy 
to 
attract 
and 
sustain 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
power 
sector renewal, 
especially 
for 
the refurbishment 
of 
power 
distribution 
and 
generation 
assets, 
and 
to 
develop 
a 
more 
efficient 
and 
increasingly competitive 
power 
sector. 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
proposed 
project 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
Transelectrica 
(Romania’s 
grid 
company 
and 
power 
system 
operator), 
OPCOM 
(its 
subsidiary, Romania’s 
power 
market 
operator), 
and 
ANRE 
(regulatory 
agency 
for 
electricity 
and 
heat). 
The 
following 
project 
output 
indicators 
are 
envisioned 
to monitor their 
performance 
in 
project 
implementation: 
(a) 
the 
new 
electricity trading 
regime 
is 
designed, 
market 
designs 
are 
implemented, 
OPCOM 
is 
operating 
the 
day-ahead 
market through 
its 
Power 
Exchange 
and 
Transelectrica 
is 
operating 
the 
electricity 
balancing 
mechanism; 
(b) 
ANRE 
has 
issued regulations and 
the 
first 
set 
of 
price-cap 
tariffs 
for 
transmission 
and distribution; 
and 
(c) 
Transelectrica 
has 
commissioned 
the 
two 
substations 
rehabilitated under 
the project. 
The 
corresponding 
project 
outcome/impact 
indicators 
are: 
(a) 
an 
initial 
set 
of 
long-term 
contracts 
(vesting 
contracts 
with 
declining 
volumes) 
are 
in 
place 
and 
registered 
with 
OPCOM 
by 
end-2004, 
OPCOM 
Power 
Exchange 
(a 
well-functioning 
spot 
market) 
is 
established 
by 
end-2004, 
accounting 
for 
at least 
5% 
of 
total 
supply 
by 
end-2005,  10% 
by 
end-2006, 
and 
15% 
by 
end-2007; 
and 
ancillary 
services 
are 
settled 
through 
Transelectrica’s 
balancing 
mechanism; 
(b) 
Transelectrica and 
the 
power distribution 
companies are 
providing 
“common-carrier” 
transmission 
services 
and 
distribution 
use-of-system services 
under 
price-cap 
tariff 
regulation 
by 
mid-2005; 
and 
(c) 
substations 
rehabilitated 
under 
the 
project 
are 
operational and 
their 
performance 
meets 
design 
parameters, 
so 
that 
power 
transmission 
interruptions and 
related 
supply 
curtailments 
in 
the Bucharest 
and 
Transylvania regions 
of 
the country 
are 
avoided. 
Supervision missions 
will 
monitor 
these 
indicators. 
The 
missions 
will 
also 
track project 
inputs 
and 
sectoral progress 
related 
to 
the 
project 
using 
indicators shown 
in 
Annex 
1.

Document number:

Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
6/19 
/2001 
The Country 
Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) 
for 
Romania outlines 
the 
Bank 
Group’s 
assistance 
strategy 
to 
the 
country 
at 
a 
time 
when 
Romania 
was 
turning 
away 
from 
its 
legacy 
of 
erratic 
macroeconomic 
management 
of 
the 
1990s. 
After 
almost a 
decade 
of 
uneven 
reform 
efforts, 
the 
current Government that 
took office 
in 
December 2000 began 
the 
reforms 
needed 
for 
a successful 
economic transition, 
and 
-3- 
Page  8
accession 
to 
the European 
Union 
(EU). 
This 
CAS 
presented 
two 
lending 
scenarios. 
Had 
Romania 
reverted 
to 
pursuing 
a hesitant 
pace 
of 
reforms, 
Bank 
Group 
assistance 
would 
have 
been 
very 
limited, 
centered 
on 
a 
few 
poverty-focused 
interventions 
(the 
low 
case). 
However, 
as 
Romania 
has accelerated 
its 
reforms, 
Bank 
Group 
assistance 
supports 
a 
broad 
set 
of 
structural 
and sectoral 
reforms 
to 
accelerate 
growth 
through private 
sector development 
and the 
strengthening 
of 
public 
sector 
institutional 
capacity, 
and pave the 
way 
for 
Romania's 
eventual 
accession 
to 
the 
EU, 
in 
addition 
to 
an 
enhanced 
program 
of 
poverty-focused interventions 
(the 
high 
case). 
In 
the 
power 
sector, 
the 
Bank 
continues 
to 
support 
far-reaching 
reforms 
in 
the 
sector's 
institutional, regulatory and 
governance 
framework 
and 
the 
Government's 
privatization 
agenda. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
provide 
further 
support 
to 
reaching 
these 
objectives and 
facilitate 
Romania's accession 
to 
the 
EU. 
The 
project 
was added 
to 
the 
Romania country program 
in 
2002. 
When 
the 
FY02-04 
CAS 
was 
being 
prepared 
in 
the 
course 
of 
year 
2000, 
it 
was 
assumed 
that 
Bank 
support 
to 
Romania's 
power 
sector 
reforms 
could 
be 
provided 
under adjustment 
operations 
-- 
European donors and the 
private 
sector 
were 
expected 
to 
provide 
necessary 
investment 
resources. 
Romania 
was 
benefiting 
from 
significant 
and 
increasing 
pre-accession 
aid 
from 
the 
EU 
and support 
from 
other 
European 
institutions 
including 
EBRD 
and 
EIB, 
and 
the 
prospects 
for 
private 
sector 
financing 
from 
the 
private 
sector 
were 
reasonably good. 
With 
the 
global 
economic 
downtum, 
however, 
private 
financing 
has 
not 
materialized 
anywhere 
close 
to 
the 
expected 
levels. 
Financing 
from 
European institutions, 
though 
significant and 
growing, 
is 
not 
filling 
the 
resource 
gap. 
Investment 
needs 
in 
most 
areas 
of 
energy 
and infrastructure 
are 
therefore 
not 
being 
met. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
global 
decline 
in 
private 
sector energy 
and 
infrastructure 
investments, 
and the 
resulting 
slower 
than 
anticipated 
privatization 
progress 
in 
Romania, 
the Bank's 
review 
of 
support 
to 
the 
Romanian 
infrastructure and 
energy sectors (discussed 
in 
section 
D. 
1) 
confirmed 
the need 
for 
continued 
Bank 
involvement 
and 
highlighted 
priority 
areas 
for 
possible support 
through 
a 
variety 
of 
instruments 
including 
investment 
lending. 
By 
supporting development 
of 
a 
well-functioning 
wholesale 
power 
market, 
the 
project 
complements 
Bank 
assistance 
to 
the 
power 
sector 
under 
the 
ongoing 
Second 
Private 
Sector 
Adjustment 
Loan 
(PSAL 
2) 
and 
the 
proposed 
series 
of 
Programmatic 
Adjustment Loans 
(PALs) 
which 
were 
outlined 
in 
the 
CAS. 
PSAL 
2 
helped 
the Government 
launch 
its 
power 
sector 
privatization 
program. 
The 
strategy 
envisions 
continued 
Bank 
support 
for 
the 
subsequent 
phases 
of 
the 
privatization 
program 
in 
power distribution 
and 
generation under the 
PALs. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
Investment 
needs 
in 
the 
power 
sector 
are 
mounting 
due 
to 
neglect 
in 
past years 
and 
projected 
load 
growth. 
Economic 
stagnation 
for 
most 
of 
the 
1990s 
resulted 
in 
reduced 
demand 
for 
electricity, 
but 
it 
also 
led to 
inadequate 
investments and 
insufficient 
maintenance 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
aging 
facilities 
and 
networks. 
Nominal 
generation capacity 
is 
about 
17,300 
MW, 
but 
only 
about 
13,200 
MW 
is 
actually 
currently 
available and available capacity 
from 
existing 
facilities 
is 
projected 
to 
decline 
further 
to 
below 
10,000 
MW 
in 
five 
years 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
major 
new 
rehabilitation 
projects 
and 
with 
plant 
retirements 
and 
closures 
of 
uneconomic 
units. 
Total 
system 
peak 
load 
is 
about 
8,100 
MW, 
currently 
in 
principle 
(though 
not 
always 
in 
practice) 
comfortably 
met 
by 
the 
13,200 
MW 
system. 
Now 
that Romania's 
economic 
growth 
is 
accelerating, demand 
for 
electricity 
has 
picked 
up 
and 
is 
projected 
to 
increase. 
As 
a 
result, pressure 
on 
electricity facilities 
and 
services 
is 
increasing, at a 
time 
when 
available capacity 
from 
existing facilities 
is 
declining. 
Raising 
the 
necessary 
investment 
resources 
to 
rehabilitate aging 
plants 
and transmission 
and 
distribution 
networks 
is 
proving 
to 
be 
a 
major 
challenge. 
Raising 
the 
estimated 
US$7.7 
billion 
needed 
in 
the 
2003-2010 
period 
is 
a 
tremendous 
challenge 
in 
the current 
global 
environment 
for 
private 
energy investments and 
continued 
reforms 
and 
complementary actions 
to 
improve 
the investment 
climate 
are 
essential. 
Reforms 
to 
address 
power 
sector 
issues 
were launched 
in 
the 
late 
1990s, 
and 
substantial progress has 
-4- 
Page  9
been 
achieved. 
An 
electricity 
law 
was enacted and 
the 
electricity 
and 
heat 
regulatory 
authority 
ANRE 
(Autoritatea 
Nationala 
de 
Reglementare 
in 
domeniul 
Energiei) 
was established 
in 
1998. 
Sector entities 
have gone 
through 
several 
reorganization 
and 
restructuring 
measures. 
At 
the 
start 
of 
the 
reform 
process, 
power 
generation, 
transmission and 
distribution 
and 
system operations 
were 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Romanian 
Electricity 
Authority 
RENEL 
(Regia 
Autonoma 
de 
Electricitate) 
which 
had 
been 
established 
in 
1990. 
FENEL 
was 
corporatized 
(converted 
into 
a 
joint 
stock company) 
in 
1998 
into 
the 
National 
Power 
Company 
CONEL 
(Compania 
Nationala 
de 
Electricitate) 
and 
a 
separate 
joint 
stock 
company 
Nuclearelectrica 
which 
was created 
for 
RENEL's 
nuclear 
assets. 
Power 
generation 
and 
distribution 
were 
carried out 
by 
CONEL's 
subsidiaries 
Hidroelectrica 
(hydro 
power), 
Temoelectrica 
(thermal 
power 
and 
heat) 
and 
Electrica 
(distribution), 
all joint 
stock 
companies. 
CONEL 
was 
directly 
in 
charge 
of 
transmission 
and 
system operations 
as 
well 
as 
the 
commercial 
relationships among 
its 
subsidiaries 
(the 
start 
of 
an 
electricity 
market). 
The restructuring 
process 
continued 
in 
2000: 
(a) 
Hidroelectrica, 
Termoelectrica 
and 
Electrica 
became independent companies 
reporting 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Industry 
and 
Resources 
(MIR); 
(b) 
the 
process 
to 
establish 
eight 
regional 
power distribution 
companies (discoms) 
was 
launched 
by 
the 
national 
distributor 
(Electrica); 
(c) 
a 
national 
power 
grid 
company Transelectrica 
(Compania 
Nationala 
de 
Transport 
a1 
Energiei 
Electrice) 
was established 
for 
CONEL's 
power 
transmission 
and 
system 
operations 
functions and a subsidiary company 
OPCOM 
(Operator Comercial) 
was established 
for 
CONEL's commercial 
functions 
and 
to 
become 
the 
electricity 
market 
operator. 
Through 
a 
series 
of 
tariff 
adjustments 
by 
ANRE, 
overall 
tariff 
revenue has 
been brought 
up 
to 
cover the 
cost 
of 
supply 
and 
cross-subsidies have 
been 
largely 
eliminated. 
In 
parallel, Romania 
has 
started 
the 
liberalization 
of 
its 
electricity 
market, 
along 
the 
lines 
of 
EU 
directives, 
which 
require member 
countries 
to 
allow 
a 
gradually increasing 
share 
of 
electricity 
to 
be 
contracted 
between 
suppliers 
(generators 
and 
traders) 
and 
eligible 
customers 
-- 
electricity 
users 
qualified 
to 
purchase 
power directly 
from 
the 
wholesale 
market. 
The 
concept 
of 
an 
eligible 
customer 
is 
well-known 
from 
the 
EU 
electricity 
directive, 
but 
Romania 
has 
added 
an 
additional criteria 
requiring 
the payment 
of 
bills, 
reflecting 
chronic 
issues 
in 
bill 
collection 
(this 
issue 
is 
discussed 
further 
in 
Section 
E.2). 
Some 
fundamental 
issues 
remain 
to 
be 
resolved 
before 
a 
well-functioning 
electricity 
market 
can emerge 
and 
before 
the 
sector 
can 
operate 
within 
the larger 
regional and 
European networks. 
This 
is 
largely 
because 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
the generation 
sector 
-- 
not having 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
commercially-oriented 
generators 
and generation 
unbundling 
based 
on 
fuel 
used 
(hydro, 
nuclear and 
thermal) 
-- 
and the 
related regulatory 
and 
commercial framework. 
A 
sufficient number 
of 
buyers 
now 
exist 
as 
the 
eight 
discoms have 
become 
fully 
functional along 
with 
an 
increasing number 
of 
eligible 
customers. 
The 
Government's 
"Road 
Map 
for 
the 
Energy 
Field 
in 
Romania'' 
spells 
out 
its 
strategy 
and 
implementation 
plans 
for 
further 
power 
sector 
reforms. 
The 
Road 
Map 
is 
to 
be 
kept 
current through 
regular 
updates 
for 
progress 
and 
adjustments, 
and consultations 
with 
the 
Bank 
will 
also 
continue. 
(References 
in 
this 
document 
reflect 
the 
March 
2003 version). 
The 
Government intends 
to 
increase 
the 
number 
of 
commercially-oriented 
suppliers through 
further 
generation 
restructuring and 
by 
attracting 
private 
investors. 
Restructuring 
of 
Termoelectrica 
into 
three 
new 
subsidiaries 
(Bucuresti, 
Rovinari 
and 
Turceni) 
along 
the 
lines 
of 
its 
existing 
subsidiary 
Deva 
(which 
was 
established under 
an 
ongoing 
Bank 
operation), 
with 
a 
few 
generation plants staying 
with 
Termoelectrica, 
has 
been 
decided 
and 
implementation 
is 
underway 
in 
accordance 
with 
Government 
Directive 
1524 
(GD 
1524). 
The 
early 
privatization 
of 
two 
of 
the three 
new 
subsidiaries, 
Rovinari 
and 
Turceni, 
is 
envisioned 
in 
the 
Road 
Map 
and 
USAID 
has engaged 
a consultant team 
to 
study 
their 
privatization 
options. 
Significant 
changes 
in 
the 
regulation 
of 
hydro 
generation 
will 
also 
be 
carried 
out, 
initially 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
GD 
1524, 
and 
subsequently 
in 
parallel 
with 
the 
unbundling 
and 
partial privatization 
of 
Hidroelectrica 
envisioned 
in 
the 
Road Map. 
The 
eight discoms 
became 
filly 
operational 
from 
early 
2003, 
when 
they 
took 
over 
the 
responsibility 
of 
their 
power 
contracting 
from 
Electrica. 
A 
discom privatization 
process has 
started. 
The 
first 
two 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
privatized 
in 
the course 
of 
2003, 
and 
the 
Road 
Map 
envisions 
the 
-5- 
Page  10
privatization 
of 
the 
other 
six 
at 
a 
rate 
of 
twolyear 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2006. 
Along 
with 
above 
industry 
structure, 
the 
Road 
Map 
also 
spells 
out 
the proposed 
new electricity 
market. 
The 
proposed 
project 
is 
designed 
to 
support 
Romania's 
power 
reforms through 
the 
development 
of 
the 
kind 
of 
well-functioning 
wholesale 
electricity 
market 
envisioned 
in 
the 
Road 
Map, 
with 
assistance 
to 
the 
Government, 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica. 
ANRE 
has 
already 
launched 
the 
electricity 
market 
liberalization, 
and 
intends 
to 
design 
and 
put 
in 
place 
under 
the proposed 
project 
a comprehensive 
set 
of 
regulations 
for 
a 
new 
trading regime 
- 
a 
wholesale 
electricity 
market 
to 
be 
operated 
by 
OPCOM 
for 
the 
increasingly 
private 
generating 
companies 
and 
discoms, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
electricity 
suppliers 
and an 
increasing 
number 
of 
eligible 
consumers. 
The 
success 
of 
Romania's 
power 
reforms 
in 
key 
areas 
(including 
privatizations, 
investments, 
efficiency 
improvements and 
competitiveness) 
will 
be 
greatly 
influenced 
by 
ANRE's, 
OPCOM's and 
Transelectrica's 
ability 
to 
develop, 
regulate 
and 
operate a 
competitive 
electricity 
market. 
Such a 
liberalized electricity 
market 
will 
also 
facilitate 
Romania's 
accession 
to 
the 
EU 
- 
the 
Road 
Map 
is 
focused 
on 
the 
remaining 
steps 
Romania 
needs 
to 
take 
in 
order 
to 
meet the 
EU 
directives 
in 
the 
energy 
sector 
and 
the 
development 
of 
a 
well-functioning electricity 
market 
is 
one 
of 
its 
key 
elements. 
Full 
integration 
of 
the 
Romanian 
power 
system 
into 
EU's 
internal electricity 
market 
and 
into 
the 
continental Europe 
interconnected 
power 
system 
is 
one 
of 
the 
Government's 
priorities 
in 
its 
power 
reforms. 
Romania 
is 
a 
signatory 
to 
the Athens 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding 
of 
November 
15,2002, 
for 
the 
development 
of: 
(a) 
a 
national 
electricity 
market 
compatible 
with 
the 
EU's 
electricity 
directive; 
and 
(b) 
a 
South East 
Europe regional 
electricity 
market 
(SEEREM) and 
its 
integration 
into 
EU's 
internal 
electricity 
market. 
The 
proposed 
project 
will 
develop a 
well-functioning 
wholesale 
electricity 
market 
that 
meets 
the 
Government's 
national 
and 
regional 
objectives 
as 
spelled 
out 
in 
the 
Road 
Map 
and 
related 
obligations. 
The 
Romanian 
system 
currently 
has 
a synchronous 
interconnection 
with 
some 
of 
its 
neighbors 
including 
Albania, Bulgaria, 
Greece, 
and 
Serbia 
in 
the 
so-called 
UCTE 
second synchronous 
zone. 
On 
May 
8,2003  Transelectrica 
became a 
member 
of 
UCTE 
(the 
Union 
for 
the 
Co-ordination 
of 
Transmission 
of 
Electricity), 
an 
association 
of 
transmission 
system 
operators 
providing 
a 
reliable 
market 
base 
by 
efficient 
and 
secure 
electric 
"power highways" 
in 
Europe. 
This 
opened 
the 
way 
for 
Romania 
to 
join 
and 
-- 
once necessary 
system 
rehabilitations 
and interconnections 
are 
fully 
in 
place 
-- 
effectively 
operate 
in 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
electric synchronously interconnected 
power 
systems 
worldwide. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
proposed 
project 
is 
designed 
to 
support and 
help 
accelerate 
power 
sector 
reforms through 
the 
development 
of 
a 
well-functioning electricity 
market, 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
transmission 
system, 
and the 
development 
of 
price-cap 
regulation 
for 
Transelectrica 
and 
power 
distribution 
companies, 
with 
assistance 
to 
the 
ANRE 
(the 
power 
sector regulator), 
OPCOM 
(power 
market 
operator) 
and Transelectrica 
(grid 
company 
and 
system 
operator). 
The 
new 
electricity 
market 
envisioned 
in 
the 
Road 
Map, 
to 
be 
developed 
under 
the 
proposed 
project, 
is 
presented 
schematically 
in 
Annex 
2 (Figures 
A1 
and 
A2). 
The 
New 
Trading 
Platform 
would 
consist 
of 
the 
following key 
components: 
(a) 
Long-term 
contracts 
between 
producers and 
suppliers. 
These 
initial 
contracts 
(called vesting 
contracts) 
help 
establish, 
in 
line 
with 
GD 
1524 (Figure 
1 
in 
Annex 
2), 
the 
new 
commercial relationships 
consistent 
with 
the 
new 
industry 
structure 
(following 
the 
corporate 
restructuring 
of 
distribution 
and 
generation 
entities, 
where the 
eight 
discoms 
will 
purchase 
electricity 
from 
six 
thermal 
producers 
(i.e., 
Rovinari, 
Turceni, 
Deva 
and 
Bucuresti 
subsidiaries 
as 
well 
as 
Termoelectrica), 
in 
addition to 
Hidroelectrica 
and 
Nuclearelectrica. 
As 
contract volumes 
under 
these 
vesting 
contracts 
decline 
to 
-6- 
Page  11
facilitate market 
liberalization 
targets 
in 
the 
Road 
Map, 
a 
new 
mechanism 
for 
market participants 
to 
meet 
their 
capacity contracting obligations 
is 
to 
take 
over 
- 
this 
is 
essential 
for 
distribution 
companies 
as 
they progressively 
take 
on 
the 
role 
of 
“Supplier 
of 
Last 
Resort” 
for 
consumers 
in 
a 
more liberalized 
market. 
These arrangements 
are 
preferred 
to 
the alternative 
of 
putting 
in 
place 
conventional power 
purchase agreements 
(PPAs) 
so 
as 
to 
provide 
market 
stability 
and at 
the 
same 
time 
facilitate, 
not 
undermine, 
trading 
in 
an increasingly competitive 
and 
liberalized electricity 
market; 
(b) 
A 
Day-ahead 
(Spot) 
Market, 
for 
day-ahead transactions 
for 
energy 
supply 
at 
market-clearing prices 
(spot 
prices) 
to 
meet 
demand 
(Figure 2 
in 
Annex 
2). 
The 
energy 
contribution 
from 
the regulated nuclear 
and 
hydro 
generation 
facilities 
would 
be centrally 
programmed. 
OPCOM 
would, 
through 
a 
bidding 
process 
between 
suppliers 
and 
producers, 
then 
schedule nuclear, 
hydro 
and thermal 
generation 
up 
until 
the 
point 
where the 
demand 
for 
energy 
is 
covered; 
and 
(c) 
Electricity 
Balancing 
Mechanism 
to 
be 
operated 
by 
Transelectrica, 
in 
its 
role 
as 
the 
system 
operator. 
This 
balancing 
mechanism 
would 
resolve transmission constraints 
and 
provide 
sufficient 
reserve 
capacity 
to 
ensure secure 
grid 
operations. 
Although 
the 
present 
mix 
of 
generation 
facilities 
in 
Romania’s 
power 
system 
is 
diversified,  Transelectrica 
nevertheless 
is 
able 
to 
achieve 
most 
of 
current 
system 
balancing 
requirements 
by 
adjusting 
the outputs 
of 
hydro 
generation 
facilities, 
in 
line 
with 
ancillary 
services contracts 
between 
Transelectrica 
and Hidroelectrica. 
Initially, 
tariffs 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
ancillary 
service contracts 
will 
regulated 
but 
it 
is 
envisaged 
that 
with 
progressive 
deregulation 
of 
hydro 
production, 
the 
spot 
prices 
from 
OPCOM’s 
day-ahead 
transactions 
will 
become 
the common 
reference 
price 
(Figure 
2) 
for 
any generation 
entity 
that 
qualifies 
to provide ancillary 
services 
for 
Transelectrica’s 
system 
balancing 
mechanism. 
(d) 
Future 
Refinements 
and 
Prerequisites. 
Romania 
has 
a large 
power 
system 
and 
several 
generators, 
eight 
discoms 
and 
a 
number 
of 
eligible 
consumers 
- 
several 
key 
elements 
for 
an 
even 
more 
sophisticated 
power 
market 
are 
in 
place. 
Based 
on 
experience 
from 
the 
new 
electricity 
market regime 
outlined 
in 
(a)-(c) 
above, 
the 
Road 
Map 
envisions the 
introduction 
of 
additional 
features such 
as: 
(i) 
an 
intra-day 
balancing 
market, 
(ii) 
financial 
instruments; 
and 
(iii) 
after 
the 
unbundling 
of 
Hidroelectrica 
(which 
the 
Road 
Map 
envisions 
by 
2007), 
a 
market 
for 
ancillary 
services. 
The 
main 
constraint 
to 
the 
introduction 
of 
these 
sophisticated features 
is 
not 
the 
size 
of 
the 
power 
system, 
number 
of 
participants 
or 
the 
capacity 
of 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica 
to 
introduce and 
operate such 
features, 
but 
the 
readiness 
of 
key 
market 
participants 
(generators 
and 
discoms) 
to 
meaningfully 
participate 
and 
take advantage 
of 
more 
sophisticated options: 
(i) 
the 
financial position 
of 
the 
power 
sector 
is 
still 
fragile. 
Tariffs 
cover 
costs 
and 
cross-subsidies have 
been 
largely 
eliminated, 
but 
do 
not 
yet 
provide 
the 
kind 
of 
commercial 
returns 
that 
private 
investors 
will 
need 
to 
justify 
investments. 
Bill 
collection 
is 
still 
not 
fully 
under 
control, 
but 
that 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
affect 
the 
market 
as 
discussed 
in 
Section 
E.2; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
new 
generators 
and 
the 
eight 
discoms have 
just 
become 
fully 
operational 
and do 
not 
yet 
have 
the 
necessary 
commercial 
and 
market 
skills. 
As 
highlighted 
in 
the 
Road Map, 
significant 
investments 
are needed 
for 
rehabilitation 
(including 
environmental 
upgrades 
to 
meet 
EU 
directives) 
and 
a 
number 
of 
high-cost generation 
units 
need 
to 
be 
closed. 
A 
conservative 
three-part 
approach 
consisting 
of 
contracts, 
a 
day-ahead spot 
market 
and a mechanism 
for 
balancing 
electricity 
supply 
and 
demand 
has 
been 
adopted 
as 
a 
pragmatic 
way 
forward.

Transelectrica's 
investment 
program 
is 
discussed 
in 
Annex 
4, 
including 
the 
other 
high 
priority 
substation 
rehabilitation 
projects. 
A 
well-functioning electricity 
market 
is 
a 
prerequisite, 
but 
not 
a 
sufficient 
condition 
for 
the 
success 
of 
Romania's 
power 
reforms 
- 
privatizations 
in 
power 
generation and 
distribution 
and significant 
private 
investments 
will 
also 
be 
required. 
The 
proposed 
project 
supports 
generation 
and 
distribution 
privatizations 
through 
the 
development 
of 
the 
electricity 
market, 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
the transmission 
system, 
and 
the 
development 
of 
price-cap 
regulation 
for 
Transelectrica 
and 
power distribution 
companies. 
Discom 
privatization 
has 
been launched 
(for 
two 
of 
the 
eight 
discoms) 
and 
a 
strategy 
for 
generation 
privatization 
(outlined 
above) 
is 
being 
prepared 
by 
the Government, 
supported 
under 
the 
PSK2 
project. 
Further discom 
and generation 
privatizations 
are 
envisioned 
in 
the 
Road 
Map 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
achieve the objectives 
of 
its 
power 
sector 
reforms. 
They 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
under 
a 
series 
of 
three 
programmatic 
adjustment loans.

Project Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed description 
and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
The 
project 
will 
develop a 
well-functioning 
wholesale 
electricity 
market. 
Transelectrica's 
highest 
priority 
investments 
in 
its 
transmission 
system. 
Two 
grid 
substations, 
Fundeni 
and Iemut, 
are 
proposed 
for 
Bank 
financing. 
The 
project 
also 
provides technical 
assistance 
to 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica for: 
(a) 
the 
design 
and implementation 
of 
a 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
electricity 
trading; 
(b) 
design, 
pilot 
testing 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
OPCOM 
Power 
Exchange; 
and 
(c) 
institutional 
support 
to 
Transelectrica. 
The 
proposed 
Bank 
assistance 
has 
been 
designed 
to 
provide 
critical 
inputs 
(and 
avoid 
any 
overlaps), 
taking 
into 
account 
related ongoing 
EU, 
EBRD 
and 
EIB 
projects 
(section 
B.3). 
It 
may 
also 
be 
useful to 
point 
out 
that 
while 
these 
substation 
rehabilitation 
investments 
under the 
proposed project 
and 
investments 
under 
the other 
closely related projects 
will 
support the 
electricity 
market, 
they 
would 
also 
be 
useful 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
liberalized electricity 
market 
- 
they 
help 
rehabilitate 
critical 
aging facilities 
and 
provide 
the 
tools 
to 
effectively 
coordinate and 
control 
the 
power 
system 
to 
ensure 
efficient 
and 
reliable 
operations. 
It 
provides 
funding 
for 
The 
high 
priority 
of 
the 
Fundeni 
and 
Iernut 
substation 
rehabilitations 
was established 
by 
Transelectrica 
using 
a 
multi-criteria 
analysis 
which 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
importance 
for 
synchronous 
interconnection 
with 
neighboring 
power 
grids 
@e., 
to 
meet the requirements 
of 
the 
UCTE, 
section 
B.2), 
improving 
service 
quality 
for 
producers 
and 
suppliers 
in 
the 
electricity 
market, 
and upgrading 
reliability 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
electricity 
to both 
captive and 
eligible 
consumers. 
The 
Fundeni 
substation 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most important 
bulk 
supply 
points 
for 
the 
Bucharest 
area 
and 
serves 
a 
very 
high 
load 
density 
area 
which 
requires 
high 
reliability 
and 
technical 
performance 
of 
quality 
of 
supply. 
The 
Iernut 
substation plays 
an 
important 
role 
in 
ensuring 
the 
electricity 
supply 
for 
the 
central and northern 
region 
of 
Transylvania 
(about 
20% 
of 
Romania's population). 
These 
two 
substations 
will 
be 
completely 
redesigned, 
rebuilt 
and 
equipped 
for 
remote 
control to facilitate 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
electricity 
market. 
Engineering 
and supervision 
services 
for 
bid 
evaluation and 
supervision 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
Fundeni and 
Iemut 
will 
also 
be provided. 
The 
two 
substation 
projects 
are 
described 
in 
more 
detail 
in 
Annex 
2. 
Transelectrica's 
investment 
program 
is 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
4. 
The technical 
assistance 
component 
consists 
of 
three 
main 
parts, 
described 
in 
Annex

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
project 
supports 
the 
implementation 
of 
the Government's 
Road 
Map 
for 
energy sector 
reforms. 
In 
parallel 
with 
further 
restructuring 
of 
generation entities 
to 
create 
a structure conducive 
for 
competition 
(as 
discussed 
in 
section 
B.2), 
ANRE 
needs 
to 
put 
in 
place a 
comprehensive 
set 
of 
rules 
and 
regulations 
for 
the 
new 
trading 
platform 
and 
OPCOM 
needs 
to 
establish a Power Exchange 
to 
implement 
the 
new 
platform 
and 
to 
ensure transparency 
in 
wholesale 
electricity trading 
between 
the 
increasing 
number 
of 
generating 
companies 
and 
discoms, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
electricity 
suppliers 
and an increasing number 
of 
eligible 
consumers 
(electricity 
users 
qualified 
to 
purchase 
power directly 
from 
the 
wholesale 
market). 
The 
success 
of 
Romania's 
power 
reforms 
in 
key 
areas 
(including 
privatization, 
investments, 
efficiency 
improvements 
and 
competitiveness) 
will 
be 
greatly 
influenced 
by 
ANRE'S, 
OPCOM's 
and 
Transelectrica's 
ability 
to develop and 
operate 
a 
competitive 
electricity 
market. 
The proposed 
project 
would 
support 
and 
help 
accelerate Romania's 
power 
sector 
reforms through 
the 
development 
of 
a 
well-functioning electricity 
market 
and 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
and 
reliability 
of 
the 
transmission 
system 
in 
order 
to 
supply 
electricity 
at 
least cost 
to 
consumers. 
3. 
Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
A 
well-functioning power 
system 
is 
needed 
to 
attract investments 
and 
enhance the 
competitiveness 
of 
the 
Romanian 
economy. 
A 
well-functioning power 
market 
is 
necessary 
for 
attracting and 
sustaining 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
power 
sector, 
especially 
for 
the 
refurbishment 
of 
power distribution 
and 
generation 
assets, 
and 
facilitating electricity trading 
within 
a national, 
regional 
and 
eventually 
European 
market. 
Market 
liberalization 
is 
an 
EU 
requirement 
and 
therefore 
the 
development 
of 
a 
power 
market 
will 
also 
facilitate 
Romania's accession 
to 
the 
EU. 
All 
electricity 
consumers 
in 
the 
country 
will 
benefit 
from 
a 
more 
cost-effective 
and 
efficient power 
supply. 
Benefits 
can 
also 
be 
expressed 
effectively 
by 
considering 
the 
counter-factual, 
what 
would 
happen 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
the project. 
At 
the 
level 
of 
project 
investments, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
the investment 
components 
at 
Fundeni 
and 
Iernut, 
the 
two 
existing 
substations, 
already 
beyond 
their 
economic 
life, 
would not 
be 
able 
to 
continue 
to 
provide reliable 
transmission 
service. 
Power 
supply 
to 
the 
capital 
and 
Transylvania 
regions 
of 
the 
country 
would 
be 
severely 
curtailed 
with 
the 
resulting 
loss 
of 
economic 
activity 
and 
adverse 
social 
impacts. 
Without 
a 
well-functioning electricity 
market, 
Romania's 
power reforms 
would 
be 
undermined 
in 
key 
areas 
(including 
privatizations, 
investments, 
efficiency 
improvements 
and 
competitiveness). 
Power 
supply 
would 
deteriorate, 
leading 
to 
loss 
of 
competitiveness 
and 
lower 
growth. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
well-functioning electricity 
market 
meeting 
EU's 
market 
liberalization 
requirements, 
Romania's 
accession 
to 
the 
EU 
would 
be 
jeopardized.

Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
Transelectrica 
is 
the 
Borrower 
of 
the 
proposed 
Bank 
loan, 
with 
the 
sovereign 
guarantee 
of 
Romania 
to 
be 
issued 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Finance 
(MPF). 
Transelectrica 
is 
wholly 
owned 
by 
the 
State 
and 
reports 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Industry 
and 
Resources 
(MIR). 
Transelectrica 
chose 
a 
fixed-spread, 
EUR-denominated 
LIBOR-based 
loan. 
The 
main 
reasons 
for 
choosing 
EUR 
as 
the 
loan 
currency 
were: 
(a) 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Romania 
uses 
EUR 
as 
a 
reference 
currency 
for 
the 
Romanian Leu; 
(b) 
EUR 
is 
also expected 
to 
be used 
soon 
by 
ANRE 
as 
the 
reference 
currency 
for 
setting tariffs; and 
(c) 
Romania 
is 
expected 
to 
join 
the 
EU 
and 
EUR 
is 
expected 
to 
become 
Romania's currency. 
The 
main 
contracts 
to 
be 
awarded 
under the 
loan 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
denominated 
in 
EUR. 
Transelectrica 
chose 
the 
Bank's 
fixed-spread 
loan 
(FSL) 
instrument 
as: 
(a) 
its 
financial 
policy 
requires a 
fixed 
spread; 
and 
(b) 
a 
customized repayment 
schedule 
taking 
into 
account Transelectrica's 
overall 
debt 
service 
obligations 
could 
be 
utilized. 
Transelectrica 
also 
welcomed 
the 
additional 
flexibility 
that 
the 
FSL 
instrument 
provides 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
ability 
to 
convert 
currencies, 
fix 
and 
cap 
interest 
- 
all 
of 
these 
features have 
been 
included 
in 
the 
loan 
agreement. 
Project executing 
agencies are 
ANRE 
(Romania's 
power 
regulator), 
OPCOM 
(administrator 
of 
the 
power 
market), 
and 
Transelectrica 
(grid 
company 
and 
system 
operator). 
The project 
development 
objective 
is 
ambitious 
and 
the 
technical 
assistance 
component 
of 
the 
project 
is 
complex. 
Its 
successful 
implementation 
will 
require careful coordination 
between 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica. 
An 
Electricity 
Market 
Coordination 
Committee,  consisting 
of 
senior 
officials 
of 
the 
MIR, 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica,  has 
been 
assembled 
for 
this 
purpose. 
The 
Committee 
was 
formally 
established 
by 
Ministerial 
Order 
23 
1 
on 
April 
8,2003. 
Close 
coordination 
will 
also 
be 
maintained between 
the 
Bank 
and 
EU 
(as 
EU/Phare 
is 
funding 
ANRE's 
TA 
component, 
an 
integral part 
of 
the project, 
and 
ANRE's 
and 
OPCOM's 
IT 
systems 
under 
a closely-related 
parallel 
project) and 
EBRD 
and 
EIB 
(which 
are 
funding 
other closely-related Transelectrica 
projects). 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica 
have 
competent 
staff 
with 
experience 
in 
power 
sector 
regulation and 
market 
and 
system 
operations, 
and 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
able 
to 
absorb 
and 
effectively 
utilize 
the support 
to 
be 
provided 
under 
the 
project. 
The 
investment 
component (the 
two 
grid 
substation projects) 
is 
well 
defined 
and 
relatively 
straightforward 
and 
the 
envisioned procurement approach 
(a 
tumkey 
contract 
for 
each) 
would 
facilitate 
expeditious 
implementation.  Transelectrica 
staff 
have 
considerable experience 
in 
transmission 
and 
some 
experience 
in 
international 
procurement. 
In 
addition,  Transelectrica 
has engaged 
local 
consulting 
firms 
to 
assist 
with 
the 
preparation 
of 
feasibility 
studies 
and 
bid 
documents, 
and 
international 
consultants 
will 
be 
engaged 
to 
assist 
with 
bid 
evaluation 
and 
project 
supervision. 
Transelectrica's 
Investment 
Management Department 
is 
in 
charge 
of 
all 
projects 
(including 
those 
funded 
by 
donors) 
and 
will 
serve 
as 
the 
project 
management 
unit 
(PMU) 
for 
the 
project 
(Section 
E.4.2 
discusses 
project 
management arrangements). 
The Director 
of 
the 
Investment 
Management 
Department 
reports 
to 
Transelectrica's 
chief 
executive 
officer, 
the 
Director 
General. 
The 
Department 
as 
the 
PMU, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
Transelectrica's 
Finance 
Department, 
will 
also 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
all 
fiduciary 
aspects 
and 
will 
inter 
alia 
also execute 
payments 
on 
behalf 
of 
OPCOM, 
acting 
as 
a 
payment 
agent. 
There 
will 
be 
a single 
Special 
Account 
for 
the Bank-financed portions 
(Transelectrica's 
and 
OPCOM's 
components) 
of 
the 
project. 
Funds 
will 
flow 
from: 
(i) 
the 
Bank, 
either 
via 
the Special 
Account 
which 
will 
be 
replenished 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
statement 
of 
expenditures 
or 
by 
direct 
payment 
on 
the basis 
of 
direct payment 
withdrawal 
applications; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
counterpart contributions, 
via 
the 
current 
accounts 
of 
Transelectrica, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
payment 
requests 
prepared 
by 
the 
PMU. 
OPCOM 
is 
a 
wholly-owned 
subsidiary 
of 
Transelectrica. 
Transelectrica 
will 
assist 
OPCOM 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
part 
of 
the 
project 
by 
using 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Bank 
loan 
(about 
US$4.5 
million) 
to 
finance 
the 
services 
of 
the 
Electricity 
Market 
Consultants 
to OPCOM. 
Transelectrica 
-11 
- 
Page  16
will 
also 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
invest a corresponding 
amount 
plus 
its 
related 
local 
currency expenditures 
under 
the contract 
as 
its 
equity 
investment 
in 
OPCOM. 
In 
return 
OPCOM 
will 
annually 
issue 
additional 
shares 
of 
equal value 
to 
Transelectrica 
to 
complete the 
process 
of 
the 
annual 
equity 
increases. 
A 
Financing 
and Project Implementation 
Agreement 
has 
been 
finalized 
and 
will 
be 
executed 
by 
Transelectrica 
and 
OPCOM for 
this 
purpose. 
It 
will 
become 
effective 
upon 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
Bank 
loan. 
A 
similar 
arrangement 
is 
being 
used 
for 
ANRE's 
component 
of 
the 
project, 
which 
is 
being 
funded 
by 
EU/Phare, 
as 
a 
grant 
to 
Romania. 
Funds 
flow 
from 
the 
EU 
to 
the 
MPF, 
not 
to 
ANRE. 
Instead 
of 
passing 
funds 
to 
ANRE, 
the 
Central 
Finance and Contracts 
Unit 
(CFS) 
in 
the 
MPF 
makes 
the 
payments 
to 
ANRE's 
consultants. 
D. 
Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
A 
new 
business strategy 
for 
World 
Bank 
support 
to 
the 
Romanian infrastructure 
and energy 
sectors 
was 
developed 
during 
2002. 
The 
strategy 
adheres 
to 
two 
underlying 
principles: 
(i) 
Bank 
support 
has 
to 
complement 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
and other 
donors; 
and 
(ii) 
Bank 
support 
should 
be 
designed 
in 
the context 
of 
the institution's overarching 
mission 
of 
poverty 
reduction. 
The 
strategy 
work 
reviewed 
the 
prospects 
for 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
various 
sub-sectors 
of 
energy 
and 
infrastructure 
and 
then 
examined the 
activities 
of 
other 
major 
donors 
in 
order 
to 
identify 
outstanding 
policy 
and 
investment 
gaps. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
analysis 
and 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Bank's 
global 
priorities, 
a 
set 
of 
proposed 
activities 
for 
implementation 
in 
the 
next 
five 
years was 
then 
derived. 
The 
strategy 
work 
was 
carried out 
in 
close 
interaction 
with 
the Government,  energy 
and 
infrastructure 
agencies 
and 
key 
donors. 
The 
final 
outcome was 
reviewed 
and 
confirmed 
with 
the 
Government 
and 
key 
donors 
in 
a conference 
in 
Bucharest 
in 
December 
2002. 
The 
strategy 
highlighted 
priority 
areas 
for 
possible support 
through 
a 
variety 
of 
instruments. 
Through 
its 
broader 
adjustment operations, the Second 
Private 
Sector 
Adjustment 
Loan 
(PSAL2) 
and 
the 
envisioned 
series 
of 
Programmatic 
Adjustment 
Loans 
(PALS), the 
Bank 
will 
work 
with 
the Government 
to 
also 
address 
sectoral 
policy 
issues 
and 
decisions 
in 
energy 
and 
infrastructure, 
including 
privatization 
in 
the 
power 
sector. 
In 
addition, 
within 
the constraints 
of 
the Government's 
fiscal 
framework and 
the 
lending 
limits 
under 
the 
Country 
Assistance Strategy, the 
Bank 
would 
also 
consider 
technical 
and 
financial 
support 
to 
energy 
and 
infrastructure 
development 
through 
two 
specific 
programs. 
Both 
programs 
would 
pursue 
a 
multi-sectoral 
approach, the 
former 
would 
be 
a 
national program 
and 
the 
latter 
would 
concentrate 
on 
low-income 
regions. 
The 
first, 
a 
national 
infrastructure/energy 
program 
which 
includes 
the proposed 
Electricity 
Market 
Project, 
is 
aimed 
at 
addressing 
national 
energy and 
infrastructure 
issues 
in 
the 
power 
sector, 
national 
aspects 
of 
district 
heating, 
and 
key 
issues 
in 
railway 
and 
roads 
reform. 
The 
second, 
an 
urban 
infrastructure/energy 
support 
program 
in 
low-income 
regions, 
is 
aimed 
at assisting 
local 
authorities 
in 
developing 
technical 
and 
institutional 
capacity and 
in 
funding 
their 
urgent 
rehabilitation 
needs. 
The 
scope 
of 
the 
proposed project,  the 
first 
project 
to 
emerge 
from 
the 
national 
infrastructure/energy 
program 
in 
the 
strategy, 
was 
defined 
to 
focus 
on 
electricity 
market 
issues 
and 
highest 
priority 
items 
in 
Transelectrica's 
investment 
program taking 
into 
account assistance 
by 
other 
donors 
including 
EU, 
EIB, 
EBRD, 
and 
USAID. 
Work 
on 
privatization 
in 
power distribution 
and 
generation, 
a 
high 
priority 
item 
in 
Romania's 
power 
sector 
reform 
agenda 
is 
to 
be continued 
beyond 
PSAL2 
under 
future 
adjustment 
operations, 
and 
possibly 
through IFC. 
Investment requirements 
in 
plant 
and 
distribution 
system 
rehabilitations, 
also 
high 
priority 
items, 
were 
left 
out 
to 
be 
covered 
by 
private 
investors 
and 
other 
donors.

Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
During 
the 
preparation 
and discussion 
of 
the 
Bank's business strategy 
for 
energy and 
infrastructure 
assistance 
to 
Romania, 
the 
Government 
strongly 
and 
repeatedly 
reiterated 
its 
interest 
in 
further 
Bank 
assistance, 
including 
the 
proposed 
project. 
The 
same 
message 
has 
been 
conveyed 
to 
Bank 
management 
by 
the 
highest 
levels 
of 
the Government, 
including 
the 
President 
and 
the 
Prime Minister. 
The 
Government's 
new 
Road 
Map 
spells 
out 
its 
strategy 
and 
implementation plans 
for 
further power 
sector 
reforms. 
The 
proposed 
project 
is 
designed 
to 
support 
Romania's 
power 
reforms 
through 
the 
development 
of 
the 
market 
envisioned 
in 
the 
Road Map, 
with 
assistance 
to 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and Transelectrica. 
Government support 
to 
the development 
of 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica 
has 
been 
a 
major 
contributor 
to 
their 
rapid 
institutional 
development. 
Transelectrica, 
the 
borrower 
for 
the 
proposed 
Bank 
loan 
for 
the 
project, OPCOM, 
its 
subsidiary, 
and 
ANRE 
are 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
project. 
It 
represents 
the 
logical next 
step 
in 
Romania's 
power 
reforms 
in 
general 
and 
in 
the 
institutional 
development 
of 
these 
three 
agencies. 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica 
are 
also 
well 
aware 
that the 
success 
of 
Romania's 
power 
reforms 
in 
key 
areas 
(including 
privatizations, 
investments, 
efficiency 
improvements and 
competitiveness) 
will 
be 
greatly 
influenced 
by 
their 
ability 
to 
develop 
and 
operate 
a 
competitive 
electricity 
market. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
Bank 
involvement 
in 
Romania's 
transition 
towards a market economy 
has 
been intensive 
in 
the 
past 
decade. 
This 
involvement 
covers the 
energy 
sector 
(including 
power, petroleum, 
coal, 
and 
energy 
efficiency) and 
infrastructure 
(including 
roads, 
railways, and telecommunications). 
In 
the power 
sector, 
the 
Bank 
has 
supported the 
reform 
process discussed 
in 
Section 
B.2 under 
the 
1995 
Loan 
3936-RO 
for 
the 
Power 
Sector 
Restructuring and 
Modernization 
Project. 
RENEL 
was the 
original 
borrower. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
restructuring 
program, a 
new 
generating company 
Deva 
(a 
subsidiary 
of 
Termoelectrica)  later 
became 
the 
main 
beneficiary 
of 
the loan. 
RENEL's 
legal 
agreement 
was 
replaced 
by 
loan 
assumption 
agreements 
with 
its 
corporate 
successors. 
Also 
Transelectrica 
assumed 
a 
small 
part 
of 
the 
loan 
(a 
part 
of 
that project's 
technical 
assistance) 
and 
the 
Bank 
has 
had 
a 
workmg 
relationship 
with 
Transelectrica 
since 
its 
establishment 
in 
2000. 
The 
Bank's 
global 
experience 
in 
power 
sector 
reforms 
including 
electricity 
market development 
is 
extensive. 
This 
combined country 
and 
global 
sector 
knowledge 
enables the 
Bank 
to 
provide 
strong 
support 
to 
the 
Government, 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and Transelectrica 
for 
Romania's 
ambitious 
electricity 
market development program. 
In 
addition, the 
Bank 
will 
continue 
its 
coordination 
work 
among donors, 
to 
help 
improve 
the 
impact 
of 
Romania's 
external 
assistance. 
The 
Government 
has 
consulted the 
Bank 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
its 
new Road 
Map 
for 
energy 
sector 
reforms.  Transelectrica 
has 
benefited 
from 
the 
Bank's 
project 
preparation 
experience 
and 
has 
decided 
to 
adopt the 
same 
approach 
and 
environmental 
management 
framework 
for all 
its 
future 
projects. 
During 
project 
implementation, 
Transelectrica 
expects 
to 
be 
able 
to 
secure 
highly 
competitive 
prices 
through intemational 
competitive 
bidding. 
Such experience 
and 
price information 
is 
also expected 
to 
benefit 
Transelectrica 
in 
the 
future 
when 
implementing 
similar 
rehabilitation 
projects 
(its 
substantial 
rehabilitation program 
is 
only 
beginning 
and 
will 
continue 
for 
another 
two 
decades), 
including 
cases 
where 
it 
negotiates 
contracts 
with 
suppliers 
offering 
tied 
financing.

Project 
analysis focused 
on 
the 
cost 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
two 
substations 
projects. 
-14- 
Page  19
A 
number 
of 
rehabilitation 
alternatives 
were 
formulated and 
compared, 
to 
ensure 
that 
the most 
cost 
effective 
approach 
is 
selected. 
This 
analysis 
is 
documented 
in 
Transelectrica's 
project 
pre-feasibility and 
feasibility 
reports. 
Project 
investments 
are 
needed 
to maintain 
service, 
to 
replace 
facilities 
that 
have 
reached 
and 
gone 
beyond 
their 
economic 
life. 
Fundeni 
is 
one 
of 
two 
main 
grid 
substations 
feeding 
Bucharest. 
Iemut 
is 
the 
main 
grid 
substation 
for 
the 
Transylvania 
region. 
Economic 
rates 
of 
return 
(ERRs) 
of 
such 
investments 
are 
obviously very 
high 
(loo%+) 
-- 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
substations, 
power 
supply 
to 
the Bucharest 
and 
the 
Transylvania 
regions 
of 
the 
country 
would 
be 
significantly 
curtailed 
with 
the 
resulting 
loss 
of 
economic 
activity 
and 
adverse 
social 
impacts. 
Feasibility 
studies 
developed 
project 
ERR 
estimates 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
the 
existing 
substations 
could 
be 
kept 
in 
operation 
for 
another 20 
years 
with 
increasing 
maintenance 
and 
service 
interruptions, 
yielding 
an 
ERR 
of 
about 
29.7%. 
This 
analysis 
obviously 
understate 
the 
"true" 
ERRs, 
but 
its 
confirms project 
justification 
and 
establishes 
that 
the 
project 
would 
be 
economic 
even 
if 
existing 
substations 
could 
be retained 
-- 
which 
is 
an 
unrealistically 
optimistic 
assumption 
as 
the substations 
have already 
exceeded 
their 
economic 
life. 
Transelectrica's 
Corporate 
ERR. 
To 
complement 
the 
review 
of 
cost 
effectiveness 
and 
viability 
of 
project 
investments, 
a 
corporate 
ERR 
was 
calculated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
incremental 
costs 
and benefit 
streams 
associated 
with 
the 
2003-2007 
time-slice 
of 
Transelectrica's 
investment program, 
including 
the 
investments 
to 
be 
supported 
under 
the 
proposed 
project. 
Conservatively, transmission 
tariff 
was 
used 
as 
a 
proxy 
for 
the 
economic 
value 
of 
transmission 
service. 
Transmission 
tariff 
covers costs 
as 
incurred 
by 
Transelectrica, 
but 
Transelectrica's cost 
of 
equity 
is 
low 
as 
discussed 
in 
Section 2 
below, and 
tariffs 
accordingly 
provide 
for 
only 
marginal 
returns 
on 
the 
portion 
of 
investments 
financed 
through 
internal 
cash generation. 
In 
spite 
of 
these 
conservative 
assumptions, 
the 
ERR 
of 
the time-slice 
works 
out 
to 
be 
about 
9.7% 
(Annex 
4). 
The 
economic issue 
that 
emerges 
from 
economic 
analysis 
is 
not 
the 
viability 
of 
Transelectrica's 
investment 
program 
-- 
which 
is 
focused 
on 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
substations 
and 
transmission 
lines 
so 
as 
to maintain 
an 
essential service 
-- 
but 
the 
implicit 
subsidy 
that the Government 
and Transelectrica 
provide 
to 
electricity 
consumers, 
through 
a 
tariff policy 
under 
which 
the 
Government's 
equity 
investment 
in 
Transelectrica 
eams less 
than 
Transelectrica pays 
for 
its 
debt 
capital. 
A 
more commercial 
equity 
policy would 
result 
in 
higher 
tariff 
revenue, 
and 
in 
this 
analysis where 
the 
benefit 
of 
transmission 
service 
is 
valued 
at 
tariff, 
the 
ERR 
would 
go 
up 
accordingly. 
A 
sensitivity 
case 
was 
developed where 
the 
return 
on 
equity 
was 
set 
to 
match 
Transelectrica's 
average 
cost 
of 
debt, 
which 
would 
then 
also 
be 
the 
weighted 
cost 
of 
capital. 
The 
ERR 
goes 
up 
to 
23.9 
%.

(see

Corporate Financial 
Analysis. 
Transelectrica's current 
financial 
performance 
is 
generally 
satisfactory. 
The 
regulatory framework 
is 
designed 
to 
enable 
the company 
to 
cover 
its 
costs 
and 
eam 
a 
reasonable 
(modest) 
profit 
from 
its 
operations. 
Financial 
projections 
demonstrate that,  subject 
to 
tariff 
adjustments 
in 
line 
with 
Transelectrica's 
current 
regulatory framework, 
its 
performance 
would 
remain 
generally 
satisfactory. 
Annex 
5 
presents 
the 
full 
results 
of 
the 
financial 
analysis 
including 
the 
key 
financial 
statements, 
compliance 
with 
proposed 
financial 
covenants, 
and the 
assumptions 
used 
in 
the projections. 
The 
proposed 
two 
financial 
covenants (debt service, 
debtlequity 
and 
current 
ratios) 
are 
among 
Transelectrica's 
existing 
covenants 
with 
EIB 
and 
EBRD 
(they 
also 
have 
two 
additional 
covenants, 
debt/equity 
and 
working 
ratios, 
which 
are 
not 
proposed 
to 
be 
repeated 
for 
the 
project 
as 
they 
are 
not 
critical 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Transelectrica 
as 
discussed 
in 
Annex 
5). 
Transelectrica's satisfactory current 
and 
projected financial position 
is 
in 
part 
explained 
by 
the 
following 
combination 
of 
special factors: 
(a) 
Transelectrica's 
transmission 
system 
does 
not 
require significant 
expansion 
or 
strengthening 
(Section 
E.3). 
The 
2003-2007 investment 
program 
is 
therefore 
manageable, 
and 
Transelectrica 
projects 
that 
its 
investment 
needs 
in 
the future 
would 
decline 
(this 
is 
reflected 
in 
- 
15- 
Page  20
2008-20 10 figures); 
(b) 
Transelectrica's 
self-financing 
ratio 
in 
the 2003-2007 high-investment 
period 
is 
relatively 
low 
at 
about 
15%, 
meaning 
that the 
bulk 
of 
its 
investment 
program 
will 
be 
debt-financed. 
However, 
when 
Transelectrica 
was established, 
it 
was 
well-capitalized. 
It 
can 
comfortably 
add 
debt 
for 
several years 
and 
still 
maintain 
a conservative 
debvequity 
ratio 
in 
its 
balance 
sheet; 
and 
(c) 
the 
Government 
(as 
Transelectrica's 
owner) 
has 
a 
large 
investment 
in 
the 
company, 
valued 
at 
over US$600 
million 
in 
total 
shareholders' 
equity. 
The 
Government, 
as 
a matter 
of 
policy, 
does 
not 
require commercial 
returns 
on 
this 
investment. 
The 
regulatory framework reflects 
this 
policy 
and 
does 
not 
provide 
for 
commercial 
returns 
on 
equity 
(or 
on 
the 
public 
domain 
assets, 
explained 
below). 
The projected return 
on 
equity 
is 
about 
2%, 
half 
of 
which 
is 
to 
be 
paid 
out 
as 
dividends, 
amounting 
to 
about 
US$34 
million 
in 
the 
2003-2007 
period. 
The 
Government 
is 
projected 
to 
raise 
much 
more 
from 
Transelectrica investments 
through 
taxes 
and 
duties, 
almost 
US$190 
million 
in 
the 
2003-2007 
period. 
Transelectrica's 
Corporate 
FRR 
was 
calculated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
incremental 
costs 
and 
benefit 
streams 
associated 
with 
the 
2003-2007 
time-slice 
of 
Transelectrica's 
investment program, 
including 
the 
investments 
to 
be 
supported 
under 
the 
proposed 
project. 
The 
FRR 
is 
about 
4.3% 
(Annex 
4). 
This 
is 
low, 
but 
as 
it 
is 
in 
line 
with 
Transelectrica's 
low 
weighted 
cost 
of 
capital and 
ANRE'S 
cost-based 
tariff 
setting 
mechanism, 
it 
is 
considered 
satisfactory. 
This 
situation 
is 
acceptable 
in 
the 
medium 
term, 
as 
long 
as 
Transelectrica 
is 
not 
required 
to 
produce 
commercial 
returns 
on 
its 
shareholders' 
equity 
and 
if 
the 
expected decline 
in 
investment requirements 
after 
2007 
materializes. 
In 
the longer 
term, 
as 
investment 
needs 
will 
again 
pick 
up, 
Transelectrica's 
tariffs 
will 
have 
to 
provide 
for 
higher 
returns 
on 
equity and 
higher 
self-financing, 
to 
avoid 
a 
debt 
trap 
(in 
the 
absence 
of 
fresh 
equity 
inputs). 
A 
sensitivity 
case 
where Government 
equity 
earns 
a 
return matching 
the 
average 
cost 
of 
debt, 
yields 
a 
FRR 
of 
15.7 
% 
(a 
20% 
tariff 
adjustment 
would 
be 
needed). 
Public 
Domain 
Assets. 
In 
addition 
to 
its 
own 
assets, 
Transelectrica also 
uses 
assets 
(mostly 
transmission lines) 
owned 
by 
the Government 
in 
its 
operations. 
Being public 
domain 
assets 
in 
accordance 
with 
Law 
213 
& 
219 
of 
1998,  these 
assets 
can 
not 
be transferred 
to 
Transelectrica. 
The 
unclear 
treatment 
of 
Transelectrica's 
these 
public 
domain 
assets 
adds 
an 
element 
of 
uncertainty 
to 
Transelectrica's finances. 
The 
Government and Transelectrica 
confirmed 
that 
this 
arrangement 
will 
be 
formally 
regularized through 
a 
concession 
contract 
by 
mid-2004. 
ANRE 
would 
then 
be 
able 
to 
incorporate the impacts 
of 
the 
concession 
contract 
in 
its 
formulation 
of 
a 
price-cap 
transmission 
tariff for 
Transelectrica, 
which 
is 
to 
be 
formulated 
and 
made 
effective 
by 
mid-2005. 
Bill 
Collection 
by 
Transelectrica. 
Though 
Transelectrica 
provides 
services 
to 
all 
participants 
in 
the 
power 
market, 
transmission 
charges 
used 
to 
be 
charged 
to 
Electrica. 
In 
the 
first 
10 
months 
of 
2002, 
receivables 
increased 
from 
about 
3.5 
months 
to 
almost 6 months 
of 
monthly 
revenue. 
A 
substantial 
part 
of 
this 
increase 
was 
accounted 
by 
payments 
not 
made 
for 
ancillary 
services 
that Transelectrica 
provides 
to 
Electrica 
and 
in 
turn 
contracts 
mostly 
from 
Hidroelectrica. 
A 
settlement 
about 
ancillary 
services was 
reached 
in 
December 
2002 between 
these 
three parties 
which 
reduced Transelectrica's receivables 
to 
below 
4 
months 
and 
should 
help 
prevent future problems 
on 
this 
account. 
Furthermore, starting 
from 
January, 
Transelectrica 
is 
moving 
to 
a 
new 
contractual 
structure, 
where 
it 
charges 
all 
its 
clients 
(instead 
of 
just 
Electrica) 
directly 
for 
its 
services. 
This 
will 
reduce 
dependence 
on 
one 
client 
for 
payments, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
complicates contractual 
arrangements 
and 
will 
require 
Transelectrica 
to 
obtain 
payments 
from 
them 
all. 
However, 
the 
fundamental 
issue 
is 
not 
Transelectrica, 
but 
bill 
collection 
from 
the 
final 
consumers. 
As 
long 
as 
they 
pay 
their 
suppliers 
(distribution 
companies 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the regulated 
market 
and 
generators 
and 
other suppliers 
in 
the 
case 
of 
consumers 
eligible 
to 
purchase 
directly 
from 
the 
wholesale 
market) 
for 
their 
electricity 
consumption, 
Transelectrica can reasonably expect 
to 
be 
paid 
by 
its 
clients, 
the 
generators 
and 
discoms.

Bill 
Collection 
in 
the 
Power 
Sector. 
Romania 
has 
made 
remarkable 
progress 
and, 
though 
still 
not 
fully 
satisfactory, 
the 
overall 
bill 
collection 
ratio 
in 
the 
power 
sector 
has 
reached about 
94%. 
Part 
of 
the 
credit 
for 
this 
performance 
is 
due 
to 
the Government's 
commitments 
under 
IMF 
stand-by 
arrangements and 
Bank 
adjustment 
loans, 
under 
which 
the 
power 
sector's 
bill 
collection 
performance 
is 
being 
closely 
monitored.  Constraints 
relating to 
disconnection 
of 
and 
collection 
from 
industrial 
companies 
to 
be 
privatized 
(or 
closed) 
effectively 
prevent a 
substantial 
further 
increase 
in 
collections towards 
100%. 
This 
is 
an 
issue 
that 
goes 
beyond 
the 
power 
sector, 
and 
it 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
closely 
monitored 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
IMF. 
While 
defaults 
by 
state-owned 
industries 
might 
continue, 
in 
the 
new 
electricity 
wholesale 
market 
they 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
defaults 
to 
state-owned 
generators, 
directly 
or 
through the 
discom 
that 
supplies them. 
State-owned 
industries 
defaulting 
to 
state-owned generators 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
jeopardize 
Transelectrica, 
or 
the 
electricity 
market. 
Defaulting 
customers 
will 
not 
be 
eligible 
to 
operate 
in 
the 
spot 
market 
(OPCOMs 
Power 
Exchange) 
- 
to 
become 
and 
remain 
a 
customer 
eligible 
to 
operate 
in 
the 
spot 
market requires 
the 
customer 
to 
become 
and 
remain 
current 
with 
payments. 
The 
same 
requirement 
applies 
to eligibility to 
enter 
into 
bilateral 
contracts 
-- 
and 
even 
if 
it 
were 
ignored, 
defaulting 
state-owned 
industries 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
contract 
from 
private 
generators 
who 
can 
be 
reasonably expected 
to 
contract 
with 
parties that 
pay 
their 
bills. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
The 
direct 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
is 
positive. 
Taxes 
and 
duties 
flowing 
to 
the 
Government 
budget 
are 
estimated at 
about $20.4 
million, while 
the 
Government 
does 
not 
need 
to 
provide 
budgetary 
support 
for 
the 
project. 
The indirect fiscal 
impact 
of 
the 
project, 
though 
not 
possible 
to 
quantify, 
is 
far 
more 
significant. 
The 
success 
of 
Romania's 
power 
reforms 
in 
key 
areas 
(including 
privatization, 
investments, 
efficiency 
improvements and 
competitiveness) 
will 
be greatly influenced 
by 
ANRE's, 
OPCOM's 
and 
Transelectrica's 
ability 
to 
develop 
and 
operate 
a 
competitive 
electricity 
market 
-- 
the 
objective 
of 
the 
project. 
Overall, 
in 
the 2003-2007 
period 
covered 
in 
the time-slice economic 
and 
financial 
analyses 
discussed 
in 
Annex 
4, 
taxes 
and duties 
on 
Transelectrica's 
investments 
amount 
to 
about 
US$190 million, 
and 
another 
US$34 
million 
is 
projected 
as 
dividends. 
The 
Government 
could 
raise 
even 
more 
from 
Transelectrica 
by 
changing 
its 
current 
tariff 
policy 
under 
which 
the 
Government's 
equity 
investment 
in 
Transelectrica 
eams 
less 
than 
Transelectrica 
pays 
for 
its 
debt 
capital. 
3. 
Technical: 
Transelectrica 
operates 
an extensive 
transmission 
system 
which 
was 
designed 
to 
carry 
a 
load 
about 
twice 
as 
high 
as 
it 
is 
projected 
to 
carry 
in 
the 
coming 
decade. 
After 
two 
decades 
of 
very 
low 
investments, 
various parts 
of 
the 
system 
now 
need 
to 
rehabilitated 
and 
replaced 
(which 
is 
the 
focus 
of 
Transelectrica's 
investment program) and a 
modem 
coordination 
and 
control 
system 
is 
required 
(under 
construction), 
but 
the 
transmission 
system 
does 
not 
require significant 
expansion 
or 
strengthening. 
Priority 
areas 
for 
inclusion 
into 
Transelectrica's 
investment 
program 
- 
including 
the 
Fundeni 
and 
Iemut 
substation 
rehabilitations 
- 
were 
established 
by 
Transelectrica 
using 
a 
multi-criteria 
analysis 
which 
took 
into 
account 
the importance 
for 
synchronous 
interconnection 
with 
neighboring 
power 
grids 
(i.e., 
to 
meet 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
UCTE, 
section 
B.2), 
improving 
service 
quality 
for 
producers 
and 
suppliers 
in 
the 
electricity 
market, 
and 
upgrading 
reliability 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
electricity 
to 
both 
captive 
and 
eligible 
consumers. 
The 
resulting 
investment 
program 
is 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
4. 
Fundeni 
and 
Iemut 
grid 
substation 
projects 
were 
subsequently 
well 
defined 
in 
project feasibility 
studies. 
Transelectrica's experience 
in 
project 
implementation, 
including 
procurement 
and 
construction, 
has 
highlighted 
the need 
for 
a streamlined 
approach. 
Turnkey 
contracting 
is 
accordingly 
selected 
for 
the 
two 
investment 
components, 
through 
two 
turnkey 
contracts. 
This 
approach 
will 
also 
help 
mitigate 
the 
risk 
of 
power 
supply 
interruptions 
during 
implementation, 
when 
part 
of 
the 
existing 
substations 
will 
have 
to 
continue 
to 
operate 
while 
new 
parts 
are 
being 
installed. 
- 
17- 
Page  22
The 
technical 
assistance component 
of 
the 
project 
is 
complex. 
Its 
successful 
implementation 
will 
require 
high-calibre 
consultants 
and 
careful coordination 
between 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica, 
for which 
purpose a 
formal 
coordination 
mechanism 
has 
been 
established 
(Section 
C.4). 
Romania 
has 
in 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica 
already 
in 
place 
a market operator and a 
system 
operator 
with 
considerable 
experience 
in 
Romania 
and 
exposure 
to 
other 
electricity 
markets and market 
and 
system operators. 
Careful 
selection 
of 
highly 
qualified 
consultants 
and an 
electricity 
market 
coordination committee 
bringing 
all 
market 
participants 
together 
on 
a regular 
basis 
improve 
prospects 
for 
successful 
market 
design and 
implementation. 
4. 
Institutional: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica were established under earlier 
phases 
of 
Romania's 
power 
sector 
reforms and 
all 
are 
well-functioning 
entities. 
They 
have 
competent 
staff 
with 
experience 
in 
power 
sector 
regulation 
and 
electricity 
market 
and 
system 
operations, 
and 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
able 
to 
absorb 
and 
effectively 
utilize 
the 
support 
to 
be 
provided 
under 
the 
project. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
Transelectrica 
is 
organized 
into 
functional 
departments (Planning, 
Investment Projects 
Management, 
Finance, 
Asset 
Management and 
Operations). 
The 
Investment 
Management 
Department 
is 
the project 
management 
unit 
(PMU) 
of 
the project. 
Work 
of 
the Investment 
Project 
and 
Asset 
Management 
departments 
is 
increasingly carried out 
by 
project 
teams 
in 
a 
matrix-management 
system 
where 
teams 
are 
led 
by 
project 
directors, 
and 
team 
members 
report 
to 
the 
director 
and 
their 
functional 
departments. 
In 
line 
with 
this 
operational philosophy, 
project 
directors 
have 
been appointed 
and 
project 
teams assembled 
for 
the 
two 
substation 
rehabilitation 
projects. 
The project 
teams 
include technical 
specialists 
of 
the 
Investment 
Project 
Management 
Department 
and 
specialists 
in 
procurement, finance, 
legal, 
etc. 
as 
required, 
from 
other 
departments 
of 
Transelectrica. 
Local 
consulting 
firms, 
funded 
from 
Transelectrica's 
own 
resources, 
are 
assisting Transelectrica. 
Transelectrica 
will 
engage 
consultants 
to 
assist 
with 
bid 
evaluation 
and 
project 
supervision. 
OPCOM 
and 
ANRE 
have designated 
their 
project 
teams. 
Consultants 
for 
ANRE's 
component 
have 
already 
started 
their 
assignment. 
Consultants 
to 
be 
selected 
by 
OPCOM 
will 
help 
manage 
the 
development 
of 
the 
power 
exchange. 
An 
Electricity Market 
Coordination Committee 
has 
been 
established 
to 
coordinate market 
development. 
In 
addition 
to 
ANRE 
and OPCOM, 
Transelectrica and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Industry 
and 
Resources 
(MIR) 
are 
represented 
on 
the 
Committee 
(Section 
C.4). 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
No 
procurement 
issues 
are 
anticipated. 
Procurement 
arrangements have 
been 
agreed 
and 
preparatory 
work 
has 
started. 
The 
agreed 
procurement approach 
(a 
turnkey 
contract 
for 
each 
substation 
project) 
facilitates 
expeditious 
implementation 
of 
the investment 
components. 
Transelectrica 
staff 
have 
considerable experience 
in 
transmission 
and 
some 
experience 
in 
international 
procurement. 
A 
General 
Procurement 
Notice 
(GPN) 
for 
the 
project 
and 
a 
Specific 
Procurement 
Notice 
for 
pre-qualification 
for 
the 
two 
investment 
components have 
been 
published 
in 
the 
UN 
Development 
Business 
(UNDB) 
online 
and 
in 
the Development Gateway 
dgMarket, 
and 
were 
printed 
in 
the 
April 
16 
edition 
of 
UNDB. 
Transelectrica's 
local 
consultants 
continue 
to 
assist 
with 
tender 
documents. 
Requests 
for 
expressions 
of 
interest 
for 
(a) 
bid 
evaluation 
and 
project 
supervision 
and 
(b) 
Electricity Market 
Consultants have been 
published online 
and 
were 
printed 
in 
the 
April 
16 
edition 
of 
UNDB. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
- 
18- 
Page  23
The 
existing 
financial 
management arrangements 
of 
the 
project 
meet the 
financial 
management 
requirements 
of 
the 
World 
Bank. 
As 
of 
the 
date 
of 
this 
report, 
the 
Borrower 
is 
in 
compliance 
with 
its 
audit 
covenants 
under 
an existing Bank-financed 
project 
(Section 
D.5). 
The 
annual 
audited 
project 
and 
entities 
financial 
statements 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
Bank 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year 
and 
also 
at 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
first 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) for 
Romania 
has 
just 
started 
with 
the 
initial 
mission carried 
out 
in 
February 
2003. 
When 
finalized, 
the 
document 
will 
detail 
the 
issues 
on 
the 
financial 
management 
risks 
for 
the 
country and 
the 
implications 
for 
the 
World 
Bank 
operations. 
The 
interim 
CFAA 
work 
suggests 
that 
some 
improvements 
are 
required 
in 
the 
management 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
the 
budget 
process 
and 
budget 
execution, 
as 
well 
as 
cash 
and debt 
management. 
Transelectrica 
has 
developed 
policies and 
procedures 
that 
operate 
in 
addition 
to 
those 
of 
the current 
public 
and 
private 
expenditure 
management 
framework 
to 
minimize project financial 
management 
risks. 
The 
Bank's 
2003 
Country 
Project 
Portfolio 
Review 
(CPPR) 
of 
all 
projects under 
implementation 
in 
Romania 
identified 
some 
common 
financial 
management 
issues. 
The 
Bank 
confirmed 
that 
all 
such 
issues 
have 
been 
appropriately 
addressed 
in 
the 
design 
of 
project's financial 
management arrangements. 
The banking 
sector 
in 
Romania 
has 
strengthened 
in 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
with 
the 
liquidity 
and credit 
risks 
reduced 
to 
moderate levels. 
Transelectrica's 
PMU 
and 
the entities involved, Transelectrica 
and 
OPCOM, 
have been 
operating satisfactorily their 
accounts 
in 
commercial 
banks 
acceptable 
to 
the Bank. 
As 
these 
arrangements 
have been 
satisfactory, 
they 
will 
remain 
in 
place 
during 
the 
Project implementation. 
5. 
Environmental: 
5.1 
Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation and 
disclosure) 
and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The project 
does 
not 
involve 
significant environmental 
issues. 
Existing 
grid 
substations 
will 
be 
rehabilitated, 
with 
no 
land 
acquisition 
or 
resettlement. 
Bank 
staff 
visited 
Fundeni 
and 
Iemut 
substation 
sites 
to 
assess 
environmental 
issues 
associated 
with 
each 
site and 
discussed 
with 
Transelectrica 
environmental 
staff (headquarters 
and regional) 
detailed 
requirements 
of 
the 
environmental 
management 
plans 
(EMPs). 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
Transelectrica 
has 
prepared satisfactory 
Environmental 
Management 
Plans 
(EMPs) 
for 
each investment 
component 
of the 
project. 
The 
EMPs 
are 
based 
in 
large 
measure 
on information provided 
in 
the 
environment section 
of 
the 
feasibility 
studies 
for 
each substation.

of 
receipt 
of 
final 
draft: 
February 7,2003 
(Fundeni) 
and 
February 
28,2003  (Iemut) 
EMPs 
have 
been 
reviewed 
and 
cleared 
by 
the 
Bank 
and placed 
in 
the 
InfoShop 
ahead 
of 
project 
appraisal. 
5.4 
How 
have stakeholders 
been 
consulted at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental impacts and proposed 
environment 
management 
plan? Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that 
were used 
and 
which 
groups 
were 
consulted? 
Romanian 
environmental 
policies 
and procedures 
require 
public 
consultation 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
project 
approval. 
Under 
Romanian 
regulations, 
local 
environmental 
agencies are 
responsible 
for 
conducting 
this 
consultation. 
Additionally, 
the 
Bank 
requires 
public 
consultation 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
appraisal.  These 
consultations 
were 
held 
in 
January 2003 (Fundeni) 
and February 
(Iemut), 
and 
related documentation 
is

included 
in 
the 
EMPs 
as 
requested 
by 
the 
Bank. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have 
been 
established 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives and results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
The 
EMPs include monitoring 
arrangements 
and 
mitigation 
measures 
for 
the 
construction 
period 
and 
during 
the 
operations 
of 
the 
substations. 
During 
construction, 
the 
focus 
is 
on 
the 
handling 
of 
materials 
to 
be 
replaced, 
along 
with 
noise and 
dust. 
Impacts 
are 
minor 
and 
limited 
to 
the 
removal 
and 
disposal 
of 
old 
equipment 
and 
materials and 
minor 
and temporary 
construction 
impacts 
associated 
with 
the 
movement 
of 
men, 
materials 
and 
machines. 
Transelectrica 
has 
investigated 
its 
substations 
and concluded 
that 
no 
equipment 
currently 
in 
use 
at 
the 
substations 
to 
be rehabilitated 
has 
utilized 
PCBs. 
During 
operations, 
Transelectrica 
will 
monitor air 
quality, 
water, 
soil, 
and 
noise. 
6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and specify 
the 
project's 
social 
development outcomes. 
No 
land 
acquisition 
or 
resettlement 
is 
anticipated 
by 
Transelectrica. 
The 
project 
does 
not 
involve 
social 
issues 
or 
direct social 
development 
outcomes. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
preparation 
of 
the strategy 
for World 
Bank 
support 
to 
the 
Romanian infrastructure 
and 
energy sectors 
(Section 
Dl), 
pricing 
policies 
for 
various 
energy 
and infrastructure 
services were reviewed. 
In 
the 
electricity 
sector, 
through 
a 
series 
of 
tariff 
adjustments, cross-subsidies 
have been 
largely eliminated and 
a 
life-line 
tariff 
rate 
is 
provided 
(for 
60 
kWmonthly 
consumption). 
As 
electricity 
consumption 
is 
strongly correlated 
to 
income 
and 
as 
access 
to 
electricity 
is 
virtually 
universal, 
a 
life-line 
rate 
works 
well 
to 
support 
low-income 
households 
in 
Romania. 
This 
is 
a 
well-functioning 
and 
well-targeted 
subsidy 
mechanism. 
Romania's challenge 
is 
to 
maintain and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
its 
extensive 
electricity 
service. 
Private 
investment 
will 
be required 
to 
help 
meet 
that 
challenge, 
and 
tariff 
adjustments 
will 
have 
to 
continue 
to 
be 
made, 
to 
maintain 
cost 
recovery 
and 
to 
provide 
for 
commercial 
returns 
at 
least 
to 
private 
providers 
(subject 
to 
satisfactory 
operational 
performance). 
According to 
the 
Road Map, 
the Government 
expects 
to 
retain 
some 
generation 
assets, 
including 
low-cost 
hydro 
plants. 
Along 
with 
budgetary 
support, 
they 
will 
provide 
one 
possible 
means 
to maintain 
targeted support 
for 
power 
supply 
to 
low-income 
households. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
Stakeholders 
participated 
in 
the 
public 
consultation 
process, 
which 
is 
a 
standard 
requirement 
under 
Romanian 
environmental 
policies 
and 
procedures. 
Transelectrica's 
EMPs 
document 
the consultations. 
Copies 
of 
draft 
EMPs 
were 
made available 
to 
the 
public 
at 
the 
project 
sites 
ahead 
of 
consultation 
meetings, 
and 
all 
landowners around the 
project 
sites 
were 
also 
contacted 
in 
person. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
NGOs 
and other interested 
civil 
society organizations 
participated 
in 
the 
public 
consultation 
process. 
6.4 
What 
institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes? 
The 
project 
does 
not 
involve 
social 
issues 
or 
development 
outcomes. 
Transelectrica's 
corporate-level 
organization 
structure 
includes 
a 
small Environment 
department, 
which 
coordinates 
Transelectrica's 
environmental activities. 
Actual 
work 
is 
being 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
regional 
offices 
(operations) 
and 
as 
part 
of 
the 
projects (preparatory 
studies 
and 
new 
construction). 
EBRD-funded 
consultants 
are 
currently 
working 
with 
Transelectrica 
to 
help 
achieve 
IS0 
1400 
1 
environmental 
management 
certification. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The 
project 
does 
not involve 
social 
issues 
or 
direct social 
development 
outcomes.

Safeguard 
Policies: 
7.2 
Describe provisions 
made 
by 
the 
project 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
safeguard 
policies. 
Environmental 
management 
plans 
(EMPs) 
including 
documentation 
about 
public 
consultations 
have 
been 
submitted 
as 
required, 
prior to 
project 
appraisal (sections 
5.4.-5.5). 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
EMPs 
is 
included 
among 
the 
main loan 
conditions (Section 
G.2) 
and 
will 
be 
supervised 
during 
project 
implementation. 
F. 
Sustainability and Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
The sustainability 
of 
Transelectrica 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
investments 
to 
be 
supported under the 
proposed 
project 
is 
highly 
likely. 
Transelectrica 
is 
a well-established 
and 
viable 
entity. 
Project 
investments 
are 
conventional 
substation 
projects 
and 
contain 
no 
major 
technological 
or 
investment risks. 
Transelectrica 
may 
face 
difficulties 
in 
bill 
collection 
from 
customers 
and 
with 
its 
tariff 
applications 
with 
ANRE, 
affecting 
its 
profitability, 
but 
its 
corporate 
sustainability 
is 
not 
threatened. 
The 
sustainability 
of 
the 
envisioned 
new 
electricity 
market 
is 
also 
high. 
The 
new 
trading 
regime 
is 
complex, 
including 
long-term 
contracts 
between 
producers 
and 
suppliers, 
a 
spot 
market 
operated 
by 
OPCOM, and dispatch 
of 
all 
available generation 
units 
and 
the 
balancing 
of 
supply 
and 
demand 
by 
Transelectrica 
to 
ensure 
secure 
grid 
operations. 
However, 
this 
regime 
is 
the 
logical next 
step 
in 
the 
development 
of 
electricity 
markets 
in 
Romania, 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
more 
sophisticated 
features 
will 
be 
considered 
later 
when 
market 
participants 
are 
ready 
(Section 
B.3.(d)). 
OPCOM 
and Transelectrica 
are 
currently 
already 
operating an 
unbundled 
power 
system 
with 
market 
liberalization (including bilateral 
contracts 
and 
a 
less-advanced 
version 
of 
a 
spot-market). 
Therefore, 
technically, 
operationally and institutionally, sustainability 
is 
highly 
likely. 
The 
commercial 
"success" 
of 
the 
electricity 
market and the 
unbundled 
power 
system 
will 
also 
require 
Romania 
to 
be 
able 
to 
attract 
private 
investors 
into 
power 
generation and 
distribution. 
Prospects 
for 
privatization 
in 
energy 
and infrastructure 
are 
not 
as 
good 
as 
they 
were 
only 
a 
few 
years 
ago. 
After 
rapid 
growth 
until 
the 
late 
1990s, 
global 
interest 
in 
developing 
country 
energy 
offerings 
has 
declined 
significantly 
and 
may 
not 
recover 
quickly. 
The 
number 
of 
prospective investors 
has 
decreased 
sharply 
and 
those 
that 
remain 
are 
increasingly 
selective. 
Due 
to 
its 
proximity to 
Western 
Europe, 
its 
EU 
accession prospects 
and the 
size 
of 
its 
economy 
and 
market, 
Romania 
is 
in 
a favorable 
position 
in 
this 
competition. 
Realistic 
and well-prepared 
privatization 
offerings 
and determined 
action 
to 
address 
-21

sectoral issues 
such 
as 
legislation, regulation, 
pricing 
and 
bill 
collection 
that 
would 
undermine 
the 
attractiveness 
of 
Romania's 
offerings 
are 
nevertheless essential. 
The 
Bank's 
energy 
and 
infrastructure 
strategy 
paper 
for 
Romania 
highlighted 
the 
possible 
need 
for 
further 
Bank 
assistance 
in 
these 
areas, 
concluding 
that 
such 
needs 
should 
be 
reviewed 
later, 
inter 
alia 
based 
on 
the 
investor 
response 
to 
Romania's 
privatization 
offerings. 
One concrete 
indication 
of 
the current 
level 
of 
investor 
interest 
became 
available 
in 
March. 
Four foreign 
prospective investors 
submitted 
expressions 
of 
interest 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
first 
distribution 
privatization, 
indicating 
that 
limited 
interest 
remains, 
reinforcing 
the 
need 
for 
realistic 
and well-prepared 
offerings 
so 
that a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
actual 
bids 
could 
be 
attracted 
from 
this 
limited 
number 
of 
bidders.

The integration 
of 
Romania 
into 
the South East 
Europe regional 
electricity 
market 
and 
into 
EU's 
intemal 
electricity 
market 
will 
improve 
the 
commercial sustainability 
of 
the 
market 
and support Romania's 
strategy 
to 
develop a 
more 
efficient 
and increasingly competitive 
power 
sector. 
Efficient 
generators 
can 
sell 
to 
the 
wider 
regional market 
and 
inefficient 
generators 
face 
an 
increasing 
pressure 
to 
improve. 
Eligible 
customers 
can

will 
find

discusses

issues). 
These 
are 
mutually 
reinforcing 
incentives 
and 
pressures 
on 
market participants 
that 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
wholesale 
electricity 
market. 
ANRE

Critical 
Risks 
(reflecting 
the 
failure 
of 
critical 
assumptions 
found 
in 
the 
fourth column 
of 
Annex 
1): 
The 
development 
of 
a 
well-functioning 
wholesale 
power 
market 
is 
a 
difficult 
undertaking 
and 
the 
technical 
assistance 
component 
is 
accordingly 
complex. 
Experience 
from 
similar 
projects 
elsewhere 
highlights 
the 
need 
for 
highly-qualified 
consultants, 
including 
actual 
operators 
of 
similar electricity 
markets, 
and coordination 
mechanisms 
bringing 
together 
key 
market 
participants. 
The 
most 
critical 
project 
risks 
relate 
to lack 
of 
coordination 
among 
market participants 
and 
inability to 
agreehake 
corrective 
measures, 
both 
during 
the 
design and the 
initial 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
trading 
regime. 
Careful 
selection 
of 
highly 
qualified 
consultants 
and 
the 
Electricity Market 
Coordination 
Committee 
(Section 
C.4) 
bringing 
all 
market 
participants 
together 
on 
a regular 
basis 
improve 
prospects 
for 
successful 
market 
design 
and 
implementation. 
Romania 
has 
in 
OPCOM 
and Transelectrica a 
market 
operator 
and a 
system operator already 
in 
place 
with 
considerable 
experience 
in 
Romania 
and 
exposure 
to 
other 
electricity 
markets 
and 
market and 
system operators 
-- 
in 
fact 
Romania 
is 
considered a leader 
in 
this 
field 
in 
South 
East Europe. 
Regular 
Bank 
supervision 
visits 
are 
envisioned 
and 
other donors 
will 
be 
invited 
to 
participate 
in 
coordination 
meetings.  Nevertheless, 
overall, 
this 
ambitious 
project 
is 
still 
rated 
as 
a substantial 
risk 
because 
of 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
institutional 
and

aspects 
of

be 
in 
place; 
and 
(b) 
the 
sector 
is 
still 
heavily publicly-owned 
and 
therefore 
diverse 
private 
interests 
and private 
sector 
stranded 
asset 
issues 
are absent. 
Procurement controversies 
of 
course 
can 
never 
be 
ruled 
out, 
but 
would 
be 
minimized 
through pre-qualification and 
consultant 
support 
in 
bid 
evaluation. 
However, the 
project 
-- 
the 
development 
of 
a 
wholesale 
electricity 
market 
-- 
is 
an 
integral 
component 
of 
the 
Road 
Map 
for 
Romania's 
power 
reforms, 
and 
especially 
some 
of 
the 
privatizations 
envisioned 
in 
the 
Road 
Map 
may 
become 
highly 
controversial. 
Bank 
support 
for 
privatization 
is 
provided 
through 
adjustment loans 
(PSAL2 
and 
the 
proposed 
series 
of 
PALS), 
but, 
should 
controversies 
emerge, 
the 
project 
may 
also 
get 
drawn 
in, 
being 
an important part 
of 
the Bank's 
assistance 
program 
for 
power 
reforms. 
The 
approach 
and 
strategy 
for 
distribution privatization 
has 
been 
under 
preparation 
for 
quite 
some 
time, 
and 
work 
done 
for 
the 
first 
two 
transactions 
would 
benefit any 
subsequent 
transactions 
as 
well. 
Generation 
privatizations 
would 
involve 
more significant 
and 
much 
more 
visible 
assets. 
Possibilities 
for 
controversies 
would 
be 
reduced 
if 
the Government 
engages 
investment 
bankers 
and 
lawyers 
with 
experience 
in 
similar 
transactions 
to provide 
advice 
and 
to 
help 
prepare 
and implement 
transactions.

Detailed Project Description 
ROMANIA 
Electricity Market Project 
The 
project 
develops a 
well-functioning 
wholesale 
electricity 
market. 
It 
provides 
funding 
for 
Transelectrica's 
highest 
priority 
investment 
in 
the 
transmission 
system. 
Two 
grid 
substations, 
Fundeni 
and 
Iemut, 
are 
proposed 
for 
financing. 
Fundeni 
and 
Iemut 
have 
been 
selected 
by 
Transelectrica 
using 
a 
multi-criteria 
analysis 
which 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
importance 
for 
synchronous 
interconnection 
with 
neighboring power 
grids 
(i.e., 
to 
meet 
the requirements 
of 
the 
UCTE), 
improving 
service 
quality 
for 
producers 
and 
suppliers 
in 
the 
electricity 
market, 
and 
upgrading 
reliability 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
electricity to 
both 
captive 
and 
eligible 
consumers. 
The 
resulting 
investment 
program 
is 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
4. 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
also 
technical 
assistance 
to 
ANRE, 
OPCOM 
and Transelectrica 
for: 
(a) 
Design 
and Implementation 
of 
Regulatory Framework (Commercial 
Code, 
Market 
Rules 
and 
Price-Caps 
for 
network 
services) 
for 
the 
New 
Trading 
Platform; 
(b) 
Design, 
Pilot 
Testing and 
Implementation 
of 
the 
New 
Trading 
Platform 
through 
the 
OPCOM 
Power 
Exchange; 
and 
(c) 
Institutional 
Support 
to 
Transelectrica. 
By

Project 
Component 
1 
- 
US$94.77 
million 
Investment 
Component 
(a) 
Rehabilitation 
of 
Fundeni 
Substation: 
The 
Fundeni 
substation 
(22011 
10 
kV) 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
bulk 
supply 
points 
for 
the 
Bucharest 
area 
and 
serves 
a 
very 
high 
load 
density 
area 
which 
requires 
high 
reliability 
and technical 
performance 
of 
quality 
of 
supply. 
The 
22011 10110 
kV 
substation contributes 
to 
the 
supply 
of 
an 
area 
where 
the 
peak 
demand 
is 
over 900 
MW. 
The 
existing 
1 
10110 
kV 
substation was 
commissioned 
in 
1955 
and 
the 
22011 
10 
kV 
bays 
were 
added 
in 
1971. 
The 
existing 
equipment 
is 
obsolete 
with 
low 
technical 
performance and 
requires urgent 
replacement 
of 
the 
220 
kV 
and 
110 
kV 
bays, 
including 
3x200 
MVA 
transformers 
(22011 
10 
kV). 
The 
substation 
will 
be 
completely 
redesigned 
and 
rebuilt, 
including 
the 
220 
kV 
and 110 
kV 
bays, 
including 
3x200 
MVA 
transformers 
(22011 
10 
kV). 
The 
substation 
will 
be 
designed 
for 
remote 
control 
to 
facilitate 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
electricity 
market. 
(b) 
Rehabilitation 
of 
Iernut 
Substation: 
The 
Iernut 
substation 
(40012201110 
kV) 
plays 
an 
important 
role 
in 
ensuring 
the 
electricity 
supply 
for 
the 
central 
and 
northem 
region 
of 
Transylvania 
(about 20% 
of 
Romania's 
population). 
The 
demand 
in 
this 
region 
is 
about 
1,000 
MW 
at 
peak 
load 
and 
will 
increase 
to 
1,200-1,300 
MW 
in 
the 
period 
2005-07. 
Stability 
analyses shows 
the 
necessity 
to 
maintain 
in 
operation 
the 
400 
kV 
Iemut-Sibiu 
transmission 
line 
and 
a 
generation 
load 
of 
200-400 
MW 
in 
the 
Iemut 
Power 
Station. 
The existing 
22011 
10 
kV 
equipment 
substation was 
originally 
commissioned 
in 
1963 
and 
the 
400 
kV 
bays 
were 
added 
in 
1974. 
The 
equipment 
is 
obsolete 
and 
reliability 
and 
technical 
performance 
is 
very 
poor, 
thus 
requiring 
urgent 
replacement. 
The 
rehabilitation 
is 
intended 
to 
modemize 
the 
substation at 
all 
voltages levels, 
namely 400 
kV, 
220 
kV 
and 
110 
kV 
bays; 
including 
1x400 
MVA 
transformers (400 kV1220 
kV); 
and 1x200 
MVA 
transformer 
(22011 
1OkV). 
The 
substation 
will 
be 
designed 
for 
remote 
control 
to 
facilitate 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
electricity 
market.

Component 
(a) 
Design and 
Implementation 
of 
Regulatory 
Framework 
(Commercial 
Code, 
Market 
Rules and 
Price-Caps 
for network 
services) 
for 
the 
New 
Trading 
Platform 
(US$1.19 
million). 
This 
component 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
ANRE. 
This 
component 
will 
assist 
ANRE 
to 
revise the 
Commercial 
Code 
and 
develop and 
put 
in 
effect 
subsidiary 
market 
rules 
that 
will 
make 
predictable 
and 
transparent: 
(i) 
the 
commercial 
framework 
that 
OPCOM 
and 
Transelectrica 
would 
apply 
to 
develop the 
core 
components 
of 
the 
New 
Trading Platform 
(a 
comprehensive 
set 
of 
long 
term 
contracts, the day-ahead 
market incorporating centralized 
optimization 
of 
hydropower 
generation, 
the 
balancing 
mechanism 
incorporating 
ancillary 
services, 
and the 
settlements 
system); 
(ii) 
a mechanism 
for 
market 
participants 
to 
meet 
their 
capacity 
contracting 
obligations, and 
(ii) 
the cost 
recovery 
mechanism that 
distribution 
entities 
would 
apply 
for 
wholesale 
power 
purchases 
from 
initial 
vesting 
contracts 
and 
the 
Power 
Exchange. 
This 
component 
will 
also 
assist 
ANRE 
to 
design 
and 
implement 
a 
transparent 
and predictable price-cap 
methodology 
for 
setting 
and 
adjusting 
tariffs 
to 
be 
charged 
by 
Transelectrica. 
Finally, 
it 
will 
assist 
ANRE 
to 
design and 
implement 
price-cap 
tariffs 
for 
distribution. 
(b) 
Design, 
Pilot 
Testing 
and 
Implementation 
of 
the 
New 
Trading 
Platform 
through 
the 
OPCOM 
Power 
Exchange 
(US$5.36 
million). 
This 
component 
will 
be 
implemented 
primarily 
by 
OPCOM. 
Electricity Market 
Consultants 
will 
assist 
OPCOM, 
as 
well 
as 
ANRE 
and Transelectrica 
as 
needed, 
to 
design, 
pilot 
test 
and 
implement 
the 
New 
Trading 
Platform. 
One sub-component 
will 
develop 
a 
comprehensive 
set 
of 
long 
term 
contracts (the 
initial 
vesting 
contracts) 
that 
will 
stabilize 
electricity 
sale 
and 
purchase transactions 
for 
electricity 
market participants 
-- 
consistent 
with 
corporate 
restructuring 
of 
distribution 
and 
generation entities (where 
Electrica 
has 
been 
restructured 
into 
eight 
separate 
distribution 
entities, 
Termoelectrica 
is 
being 
split 
into five 
generation entities 
i.e., 
Rovinari, 
Turceni, 
Deva 
and 
Bucuresti 
subsidiaries 
in 
addition 
to 
Termoelectrica, 
in 
addition 
to 
Hidroelectrica and 
Nuclearelectrica), 
mechanism 
for 
market participants 
to 
meet 
their 
capacity obligations, 
and mechanism 
for 
hydropower 
regulation. 
Another 
sub-component 
will 
design, 
pilot 
test 
and 
implement 
the 
OPCOM 
Power 
Exchange 
including 
a 
computer-based 
simulation 
system 
for 
the 
new 
trading platform. Finally, 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
building 
sub-component 
will 
provide 
OPCOM 
with 
on-the-job 
capacity 
building 
and technical 
support 
(including 
software 
development) 
on 
all 
critical 
organizational, 
technical 
and 
operational 
requirements 
for 
the 
commercial 
start-up 
of 
the 
OPCOM 
Power 
Exchange. 
This 
will 
also 
include 
orientation 
training 
for 
ANRE, 
Transelectrica 
and 
other 
market 
participants. 
(c) 
Institutional 
Support 
to 
Transelectrica 
(US$2.40 
million). 
Transelectrica's 
part 
of 
the 
technical 
assistance 
component 
provides 
for 
its 
part 
for 
the 
new 
Electricity 
Trading 
Platform 
and other 
institutional 
support: 
(i) 
The 
Electricity Market 
Consultants 
will, 
in 
addition 
to 
OPCOM's 
Power 
Exchange, also design, 
pilot 
test 
and 
implement 
a system 
balancing 
mechanism 
for 
Transelectrica. 
Initially 
this 
balancing 
mechanism 
will 
primarily 
utilize 
ancillary 
service 
contracts 
between Transelectrica and 
Hidroelectrica 
that 
are 
exercised 
in 
advance 
of 
transactions 
in 
the 
day-ahead

market. 
Such 
ancillary 
service contracts 
would 
however 
allow 
Transelectrica, 
in 
its 
role 
as 
system 
operator, 
to 
adjust 
the 
outputs 
of 
certain specified 
hydro 
(and 
thermal 
) 
units 
that 
would 
provide 
reserve 
capacity. 
The 
same 
terms 
of 
reference 
cover 
both 
the 
OPCOM work 
and 
the Transelectrica 
work; 
and 
(ii) 
the balance 
of 
this 
technical 
assistance 
component 
will 
provide 
consulting 
services 
and 
training 
to 
Transelectrica 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
environment, 
financial 
management 
and 
interconnections/regional 
cooperation. 
Terms 
of 
reference 
will 
be 
prepared 
separately 
for 
each assignment. 
Transelectrica 
is 
currently 
preparing 
a 
training 
program 
that 
it 
has 
entitled 
“The  Management 
of 
Sustainable 
Development 
and Reconstruction 
Projects 
in 
the 
Power Transmission 
Grid” 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
University 
of 
Craiova. 
The 
Bank 
loan 
can 
be 
used 
to help 
finance 
foreign 
experts 
and 
trainers 
for 
the 
program.

Cost Benefit Analysis 
Summary 
ROMANIA: 
Electricity Market 
Project 
A 
Transelectrica 
corporate economic 
rate 
of 
retum 
(ERR) 
and 
a 
financial 
rate 
of 
return 
(FRR) 
were 
calculated 
for 
Transelectrica's 
investment 
program, 
which 
is 
summarized 
below. 
Calculations 
were 
done 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
incremental 
costs 
and 
benefit 
streams 
associated 
with 
the 2003-2007 
time-slice 
of 
Transelectrica's 
investment 
program, 
including 
the investments 
to 
be 
supported under the proposed 
project. 
In 
addition, 
due 
to 
the 
less 
than 
fully 
satisfactory corporate 
ERR 
in 
the 
base 
case, 
a 
project 
ERR 
was 
calculated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
incremental 
costs 
and 
benefits 
streams, 
on 
the 
assumption that 
the 
existing 
Fundeni 
and 
Iemut 
substations 
could 
be 
kept 
in 
operation 
for 
another 
20 
years 
with 
increasing 
maintenance 
and 
service 
intermptions. 
Transelectrica 
The 
Romanian Power 
Grid 
Company 
Transelectrica 
is 
the 
transmission 
and 
system 
operator 
of 
the 
Romanian 
power 
system. 
It 
is 
a 
joint-stock 
100% 
state-owned company. 
It 
operates 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
transmission 
and 
system operator licenses 
and 
the 
grid 
code. 
Transelectrica 
has 
four 
subsidiary 
companies, 
OPCOM, 
SMART, 
FORMENERG 
and 
TELETRANS:

OPCOM 
is 
the

operator 
of 
the 
Romanian 
power 
system 
SMART 
provides 
maintenance 
and 
repair 
services 
to 
Transelectrica; 
FORMENERG 
is 
a 
training 
institute; 
and 
TELETRANS 
provides 
in-house 
telecommunication and 
IT 
services. 
Transelectrica's Transmission 
System 
and 
Investment 
Program 
Transelectrica's transmission 
system consists 
of 
about 
8,800 
km 
of 
transmission 
lines 
(of 
which 
about 
150 
km 
at 
750 
kV, 
4,500 
km 
at 
400 
kV 
and 
4,100 
km 
at 
220 
kV) 
and 
76 
grid 
substations 
(of 
which 
1 
at 
750 
kV, 
26 
at 
400 
kV 
and 49 
at 
220 
kV). 
This 
is 
an 
extensive transmission 
system: 
it 
was designed 
to 
carry 
a 
load 
of 
about 
22,000 
MW, 
about 
twice 
as 
high 
as 
it 
is 
projected 
to 
carry 
in 
the 
coming 
decade, 
and 
the 
system 
does 
not 
require 
significant 
expansion 
or 
strengthening. 
The major 
part 
of 
the 
system 
was 
commissioned 
in 
the 
1960s 
and 
1970s. 
After 
the 
1980s 
and 
1990s 
-- 
two 
decades 
of 
very 
low 
investments 
-- 
various parts 
of 
the 
system 
now 
need 
to 
rehabilitated 
and 
replaced. 
This 
is 
the 
focus 
of 
Transelectrica's 
investment program. 
A 
modem 
coordination 
and 
control 
system 
is 
also 
urgently 
required 
and 
is 
under 
construction. 
Priority 
areas 
for 
inclusion 
into 
Transelectrica's 
investment 
program 
- 
including 
the 
Fundeni 
and 
Iernut 
substation 
rehabilitations 
under the proposed 
project 
- 
were 
established 
by 
Transelectrica 
using 
a 
multi-criteria 
analysis 
which 
took 
into 
account 
the 
importance 
for 
synchronous 
interconnection 
with 
neighboring 
power 
grids 
(i.e., 
to 
meet the 
requirements 
of 
the 
UCTE, 
discussed 
in 
section 
B.2), 
improving 
service 
quality 
for 
producers 
and 
suppliers 
in 
the 
electricity 
market, 
and 
upgrading 
reliability 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
electricity 
to both 
captive and 
eligible 
consumers. 
In 
accordance 
with 
these 
priorities, 
Transelectrica's 2000-20 
10 
investment 
program 
includes: 
0 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
15 
of 
the 
76 
substations. 
Four 
projects 
have 
been 
completed 
-- 
Arad, 
Tantareni, 
Urechesti 
and 
Portile 
de 
Fier. 
Two 
projects 
are 
underway 
-- 
Constanta 
Nord 
and 
Oradea

Nine 
more projects 
are 
to 
be 
carried out 
by 
2010

Financing 
is 
being 
provided 
by 
a 
mix 
of 
official

sources 
including 
tied 
supplier-linked 
financing; 
the strengthening and

of 
about 
3,600

about 
40% 
of

This 
is 
being

large 
project 
co-financed 
by 
EIB,

Transelectrica 
was established 
in 
2000 and the 
preparation 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
investment 
program 
was 
among 
the 
first 
priorities. 
The 
EIB/EBRD/EU 
project 
was 
formulated 
in 
2001 
and 
construction 
started 
in 
2002. 
Transelectrica's 
annual investment 
expenses are 
growing 
rapidly, 
in 
part 
reflecting 
payments 
under 
this 
one 
large 
project, 
but 
as 
analyzed 
in 
Annex 
5, 
the 
2003-2007 
investment 
program 
is 
manageable. 
Transelectrica 
projects 
that 
its 
investment 
needs 
in 
the 
future 
would 
decline 
once 
the 
bulk 
of 
work 
under 
this 
investment 
program 
are 
completed 
and 
this 
decline 
in 
investment 
expenses 
is 
reflected 
in 
2008-2010 
figures. 
Summary 
of 
Benefits 
and 
Costs: 
Transelectrica's 
incremental 
tariff 
revenues 
from 
its 
operations 
in 
the time-slice period, compared 
to 
the 
base 
year 
(2002), 
and then frozen 
at 
the 
2007 
level 
through 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
analysis 
period 
through 
2027, 
was 
used 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
benefits 
in 
corporate 
ERR 
and 
FRR 
analysis. 
Transelectrica's investments 
in 
the 
2003-2007 
period, 
and 
Transelectrica's 
incremental operating 
expenses 
compared 
to 
the 
base 
year (2002) 
in 
the 
time-slice 
period 
and 
then 
frozen 
at 
the 2007 
level 
through 
the 
analysis 
period 
through 
2027, 
were 
the 
cost 
inputs 
in 
the 
financial 
analysis. 
In 
the economic 
analysis, taxes 
and 
duties 
were 
removed. 
The benefit 
of 
the 
project 
in 
this 
analysis 
(which 
assumes 
that 
the 
existing 
substations 
could 
be 
kept 
in 
operation) 
were 
the savings 
obtained 
by 
avoiding 
the increased 
O&M 
and 
service 
interruptions.  The 
cost 
was 
the 
investment 
cost 
of 
the project, 
net 
of 
taxes 
and 
duties. 
Main 
Assumptions: 
In 
the 
corporate 
ERR 
and 
FRR 
analysis,  revenue, 
investment and 
O&M 
are 
taken 
from 
Transelectrica's 
investment 
program 
and 
corporate 
financial 
projections 
in 
Annex 
5. 
For 
economic 
analysis, 
transmission 
tariff 
was 
used 
as 
a 
proxy for 
the 
economic 
value 
of 
transmission 
service. 
The 
use 
of 
incremental 
tariff 
revenue 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
benefits 
is 
highly 
conservative 
as 
tariff 
revenue 
reflects 
only 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
total benefit 
of 
Transelectrica's 
transmission 
service. 
Transmission 
tariff 
covers 
costs 
as 
incurred 
by 
Transelectrica, 
but 
Transelectrica's cost 
of 
equity 
is 
low, 
and 
tariffs 
accordingly 
provide 
for 
only 
marginal retums 
on 
the 
portion 
of 
investments 
financed through 
internal 
cash generation. 
In 
the 
project 
analysis, 
the 
main 
assumption 
is 
that the 
existing 
Fundeni 
and 
Iemut 
substations 
could be 
kept 
in 
operation 
for 
another 20 years 
with 
increasing maintenance and 
service 
interruptions. 
Sensitivity analysis 
/ 
Switching 
values 
of 
critical 
items: 
1. 
Transelectrica's 
corporate 
FRR 
Transelectrica's corporate 
FRR 
is 
about 
4.3% 
and 
corresponding 
NPV 
is 
US$6.2 
million, 
at 
Transelectrica's 
weighted 
average 
cost 
of 
capital. 
This 
is 
low, 
but 
as 
it 
is 
line 
with 
Transelectrica's 
low 
cost 
of 
capital 
and 
ANRE's 
cost-based 
tariff 
setting 
mechanism, 
it 
is 
considered satisfactory. 
This 
situation 
is 
acceptable 
in 
the 
medium 
term, 
as 
long 
as 
Transelectrica 
is 
not 
required 
to 
produce 
-

commercial 
returns 
on 
its 
shareholders' 
equity 
and 
if 
the 
expected 
decline 
in 
investment 
requirements 
after 
2007 
materializes. 
In 
the 
longer 
term, 
as 
investment 
needs 
will 
again 
pick 
up, 
Transelectrica's 
tariffs 
will 
have 
to 
provide 
for 
higher 
returns 
on 
equity 
and 
higher 
self-financing, 
to 
avoid 
a debt 
trap 
(in 
the 
absence 
of 
fresh 
equity 
inputs). 
[Annex 
5 
presents 
sensitivity 
analysis 
of 
impacts 
of 
lower 
tariffs

Transelectrica.] 
Debt-equity 
ratio 
will 
remain 
comfortable 
well 
beyond 
the 
period 
covered 
in 
the 
projections 
(and 
a 
debt-equity 
ratio 
is 
therefore 
not 
proposed 
to 
be 
covenanted). 
A

where 
Government 
equity 
earns 
a

matching 
the

fully 
satisfactory 
(or 
12%). 
The 
economic issue 
that 
emerges 
from 
economic 
analysis 
is 
not 
the 
viability 
of 
Transelectrica's

-- 
which 
is 
focused 
on 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
substations

maintain 
an

the

the 
Government

provide

consumers, 
through 
a 
tariff 
policy 
under

the 
Government's

investment 
in 
Transelectrica 
earns 
less 
than 
Transelectrica 
pays 
for 
its 
debt 
capital. 
A

the

to 
the

this

where 
the 
benefit 
of 
transmission 
service 
is 
valued 
at 
tariff, 
ERR 
would 
go 
up 
accordingly. 
A

Due 
to 
the

in

case, 
a

calculated

The following 
sensitivities 
have 
been 
tested: 
1) 
2003. 
However 
the 
transmission 
tariffs 
are 
increased 
in 
the 
later 
years 
since 
the 
fixed 
costs 
are 
to 
be 
spread 
over 
a 
smaller 
volume 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
base 
case. 
Further 
the 
tariffs 
are 
adjusted 
to 
target 
a 
5% 
Net 
Profit 
Margin 
which 
is 
essentially 
the 
Net 
Profit divided 
by 
Net

the

have 
assumed 
the

The 
sensitivity 
analysis 
demonstrates 
that 
the company 
has 
strong financials. 
The 
company 
would 
default 
in 
the 
case 
where 
tariffs 
are 
held 
constant 
at 
the 
same 
level 
as 
in 
2003. 
This 
to 
regarded 
to 
be unlikely 
since 
the 
tariffs 
are 
determined 
by 
ANRE 
based 
on 
a 
full 
cost 
recovery 
principles. 
The 
tariffs 
that 
are 
approved 
by 
ANRE 
are 
based 
on 
forecast 
calculations 
of 
costs, 
interest 
and 
capital 
expenditures 
submitted 
by 
Transelectrica. 
The 
tariffs 
are 
set 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
within 
a 
five 
year 
framework, 
but 
ANRE 
can 
make interim 
adjustments 
according 
to 
the 
US$/ROL 
exchange 
rate. 
Further 
an 
adjustment 
process 
can 
also 
be 
triggered 
at cost deviations 
greater 
than 
+/- 
5% 
from 
the 
assumed levels. 
Financial 
Risks 
Transelectrica 
is 
exposed 
to 
international,  commodity-based markets 
and 
has 
a 
significant 
loan 
financing 
denominated 
in 
foreign 
currencies. 
This 
can 
result 
in 
additional 
exposure due 
to 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
and 
foreign 
exchange 
rates. 
Transelectrica 
also extends 
credit 
terms 
to 
its 
customers 
and 
is 
exposed 
to 
a 
risk 
of 
default. 
The 
significant 
risks 
are 
described 
below: 
(a) 
price 
for 
the 
services 
rendered 
by 
Transelectrica 
is 
determined 
by 
ANRE. 
DSCR 
is 
greater 
than 
1.0 
even 
if 
there 
were 
no 
price 
increases 
through 
2010; 
(b) 
incurs 
interest 
at 
fixed 
and 
floating 
interest 
rates. 
Sensitivity 
analysis 
on 
interest 
rates 
suggests 
that 
an 
increase 
of 
1 
.O% 
over 
the 
base 
case 
results 
in 
acceptable 
DSCRs 
even 
if 
higher 
interest 
costs 
were 
not 
allowed to 
be 
passed 
on 
by 
ANRE 
(which 
is 
unlikely); 
(c) 
of 
the 
long term 
financing 
costs 
are 
all 
denominated 
in 
foreign 
currencies, 
principally 
US$ 
and 
EUR. 
Transelectrica 
might 
experience 
difficulties 
in 
passing 
on 
the 
effect 
of 
these 
foreign 
exchange 
fluctuations 
to 
its 
Romanian 
customers. 
In 
addition, 
certain 
assets 
and 
liabilities, 
principally 
long-term 
loans 
are 
denominated 
in 
foreign 
currencies, 
which 
are 
retranslated 
at 
the 
prevailing 
exchange 
rate at 
each balance 
sheet 
date. 
The 
resulting 
differences 
are 
charged

Assumptions and 
Financial 
Statements 
Assumptions 
for 
Financial 
Projections 
The 
financial 
model 
is 
based 
on 
information 
collected 
from 
Transelectrica 
including 
their 
business 
plans, 
investment 
schedules, 
operational 
data for 
2002, 
an 
audit report 
prepared 
by 
Arthur 
Andersen 
on 
Transelectrica’s 
IAS 
Financial 
Statements 
and other 
supporting 
documents 
provided 
by 
Transelectrica. 
A 
summary 
of 
the 
key 
assumptions 
used 
in 
the 
base 
case 
financial 
projections 
is 
provided 
below. 
1. 
Volumes 
The 
sales 
volumes 
assumed 
in 
the 
model 
reflect 
the company’s 
business 
plan for 
the 
period 
200 
1-20 
10. 
Essentially 
the 
business 
plan 
assumes a 
growth 
rate that declines 
progressively 
over 
the 
projection period 
from 
5% 
in 
2003 
to 
3% 
in 
2004 
and 
further 
to 
1% 
p.a. 
from 
2008 
onwards. 
2. 
Tariffs 
The 
tariff 
for 
Transelectrica 
has 
the 
following 
three components: 
9 
Tariff 
for 
transmission 
services; 
9 
Tariff 
for 
system 
services, 
further 
split 
between 
o 
The 
tariff 
for 
functional 
system 
services 
(administration 
of 
the 
transmission 
system); 
o 
The 
tariff 
for 
technological 
system 
services (meant 
to 
merely 
cover the 
purchase 
price for 
the 
ancillary 
system 
services); 
9 
Tariff 
for 
market 
administration 
services, 
where Transelectrica 
is 
basically 
a 
collection 
agent, 
since 
the 
whole 
amount 
collected 
for 
this 
portion 
of 
the 
tariff 
has 
to 
be 
passed 
along 
to 
OPCOM. 
The 
tariff 
for 
system 
services 
allows 
a 
very 
small 
margin. 
The 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
margin 
made 
by 
Transelectrica 
is 
from 
transmission 
services. 
Tariffs 
were 
projected  considering  that 
ANRE, 
the 
regulatory authority 
considers, at 
least 
for 
the 
current 
period, that a “legitimate” 
net 
profit 
on 
sales 
should 
be 
in 
the 
range 
of 
5%. 
ANRE 
issued a 
decision 
in 
December 
2002 
that 
sets 
the 
transmission 
tariff 
to 
ROL 
136,000, 
i.e. 
US$ 
4.04/MWh 
at 
the 
then 
ROL/US$ 
exchange  rate. 
This 
is 
a 
1% 
increase 
in 
the  transmission 
tariff 
compared 
to 
the 
average 
transmission 
tariff 
for 
2002. 
3. 
Variable unit 
costs 
The 
variable 
unit 
costs 
(electricity 
loss 
in 
the 
system 
plus 
system services) 
were 
assumed 
to 
remain 
the 
-43- 
Page  48
same 
throughout the 
projection period 
as 
in 
2002. 
Under 
the assumption 
of 
the 
5% 
target 
profit 
on 
sales, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
assumed 
that any 
increase 
in 
the 
cost 
of 
the system services 
would 
be 
absorbed 
in 
a 
higher 
tariff.

progressively reduce

Dividends 
Under 
the 
law 
regarding 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
“national

50% 
of 
the 
net 
profits 
have 
to 
be 
distributed 
as 
dividends 
to 
the

as 
well 
as 
for

6.7 
implementing 
agencies, 
during 
which 
it 
identified 
specific 
risks 
and 
agreed 
on 
an action plan. 
The 
main 
findings 
are: 
In 
February 
2003 
the 
Bank‘s 
mission 
conducted procurement 
capacity 
assessment 
of 
all 
three 
(a) 
Transelectrica. 
A 
company 
with 
a 
solid 
experience 
with 
contracts 
of 
a 
similar 
size, 
including 
those 
financed 
by 
International Financing Institutions 
(EBRD 
and 
EIB). 
The 
company 
has 
two 
procurement 
staff 
who 
have also experience 
with 
Bank-financed 
procurement 
of 
major 
S&I 
contracts. 
The 
source 
of 
a 
possible 
risk 
is 
that 
these 
staff 
are 
not 
fully 
dedicated 
to 
the 
Bank-financed 
project 
and 
are 
also 
involved 
in 
other 
procurement/contract 
management 
activities 
of 
Transelectrica. 
Besides 
these 
staff, other 
procurement personnel 
has 
little 
experience 
in 
international 
procurement. 
To 
minimize 
this 
risk, 
Transelectrica 
has, 
on 
one hand, engaged 
local 
consultants 
(under 
its 
own 
financing) 
to 
prepare the 
technical 
specifications and 
bid 
documents 
for 
the procurement 
of 
S&I 
contracts, 
and 
on 
the other 
hand, 
will 
engage 
consultants 
(under 
Bank 
financing) 
to 
supervise 
the 
overall 
implementation 
of 
the

including 
evaluation 
of 
the

and

negotiation. 
The 
assessment 
of 
risk 
is 
average. 
The 
action 
plan 
is 
to 
provide 
training 
to 
the 
procurement 
staff 
with 
an emphasis 
on 
particular 
issues 
and 
possible problems 
in 
procurement 
of 
S&I 
contracts. 
The 
training 
was 
provided 
by 
the 
Bank’s 
staff 
during 
the 
February 
mission; 
(b) 
responsibilities. 
The 
main 
factor 
of 
risk 
is 
not 
sufficient 
experience 
in 
international 
procurement 
(no 
experience 
in 
Bank-financed 
projects). 
The 
assessment 
of 
risk 
is 
average. 
The 
agreed 
action 
plan 
is 
training 
in 
consultants’ 
procurement and 
help 
of 
Transelectrica and 
hiring 
of 
a 
local 
procurement 
consultant 
(under 
its 
own 
financing) 
to 
assist 
during 
critical 
stages 
of 
the 
procurement 
process. 
The 
training 
was 
provided 
by 
the 
Bank’s 
staff 
during 
the 
February mission; 
and 
OPCOM 
has 
a 
well-functioning internal 
organization 
with 
generally 
clearly 
assigned 
personal

Consultant 
has already been selected 
and 
the 
implementation 
is 
underway 
for 
this 
component, 
which 
is 
financed 
by 
EU/Phare. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
training 
was 
provided 
by 
the 
Bank’s 
staff 
during 
the 
February 
mission. 
ANRE 
also 
does 
not 
have sufficient 
experience 
in 
international 
procurement. 
Nevertheless, 
Bank’s 
review 
6.8 
At 
this 
time 
it 
is 
envisaged that, due 
to 
the 
size 
of 
the 
contracts, 
all 
procurement 
will 
be 
subject 
to prior 
review 
by 
the

ROMANIA: 
Electricity Market 
Project 
Financial Management 
1. 
Summary 
of 
the 
Financial Management 
Assessment 
(a) 
Country 
Issues 
(i) 
The 
first 
Country Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
for 
Romania 
is 
underway 
(its 
initial 
mission 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
February 
2003). 
The 
CFAA 
is 
focused 
on 
the 
financial 
management 
risks 
for 
the 
country and 
the 
implications 
for 
Bank 
operations. 
The 
initial 
CFAA 
work 
suggests 
that 
some 
improvements 
are 
required 
in 
the 
management 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
the 
budget 
process 
and 
budget execution, 
as 
well 
as 
cash 
and 
debt 
management.  These 
potential 
issues 
do 
not 
affect 
the 
proposed 
project. 
A 
direct 
loan 
to 
Transelectrica 
is 
proposed (Section 
C.4). 
Transelectrica 
has 
developed 
policies 
and 
procedures 
that 
operate 
in 
addition 
to 
those 
of 
the 
current 
public 
and 
private 
expenditure 
management 
framework 
to 
minimize 
project 
financial 
management 
risks; 
(ii) 
The 
Bank’s 
annual 
Country 
Project 
Portfolio 
Review 
(CPPR) 
of 
all 
projects 
under 
implementation 
in 
Romania 
identified 
some 
common 
financial 
management 
issues. 
These 
issues 
have been 
addressed 
in 
the design 
of project’s 
financial 
management 
arrangements; 
and 
(iii) 
The 
banking 
sector 
in 
Romania 
has 
strengthened 
in 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
with 
the 
liquidity 
and credit 
risks 
reduced 
to 
moderate levels. 
Transelectrica 
and 
OPCOM 
have 
been operating 
satisfactorily 
their 
accounts 
in 
commercial 
banks 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
As 
these 
arrangements have 
been 
satisfactory, 
they 
will 
remain 
in 
place 
during 
the 
Project 
implementation. 
@) 
Strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
The significant 
strengths 
that 
provide 
a 
basis 
of 
reliance 
on 
the 
project 
financial 
management system 
include: 
(i) 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
PMU 
and 
its 
staff 
in 
implementing 
Bank-financed projects and 
satisfying 
Bank 
financial 
management requirements, 
as 
some 
of 
the 
PMU 
staff 
have 
worked 
on 
the 
Power 
Sector 
Project 
that 
was 
implemented 
by 
the 
previous 
National Electricity 
Company; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
PMU 
ring 
fencing 
(centralized)  arrangements 
and 
simple 
funds 
flow. 
There 
are 
no 
significant 
weaknesses 
of 
the 
project 
financial 
management 
system. 
(e) 
Implementing Entities 
Transelectrica and 
OPCOM 
were 
established 
in 
August 
2000 
as 
commercial 
legal 
entities, 
by 
Government 
decision, 
following 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
National Electricity 
Company. 
The 
projects 
management 
unit 
(PMU) 
was established 
in 
Transelectrica 
as 
a 
department 
in 
charge 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
several 
projects financed 
by 
different 
donors. 
The 
PMU 
will 
implement 
the 
Electricity Market 
project. 
The 
PMU 
reports 
to 
Transelectrica’s  management.  Since 
Transelectrica 
is 
wholly 
owned 
by 
the 
State, 
it 
reports 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Industry 
and 
Resources 
and 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Finance. 
OPCOM 
is 
a 
wholly 
owned 
subsidiary 
of 
Transelectrica. 
For 
this 
reason 
and 
also 
in 
order 
to 
have 
streamlined 
arrangements 
in 
place 
it 
was agreed 
that 
OPCOM 
is 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
manage 
the 
project 
funds 
directly, 
hence the 
Transelectrica 
PMU 
be 
in 
charge 
and 
will 
have 
all 
fiduciary 
aspects 
centralized.

Project 
funds 
will 
flow 
from: 
(i) 
the Bank, 
either 
via 
a single Special 
Account 
which 
will 
be 
replenished 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
SOEs 
or 
by 
direct 
payment 
on 
the basis 
of 
direct 
payment 
withdrawal 
applications; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
counterpart contributions, 
via 
the current 
accounts 
of 
Transelectrica 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
payment 
requests 
prepared 
by 
the 
PMU. 
The 
Loan 
Agreement 
will 
be 
signed 
between 
the 
Bank 
(IBRD) 
and Transelectrica 
with 
the 
Government 
of 
Romania 
guarantee 
issued 
by 
the 
MoPF. 
There 
will 
be 
a single 
SA, 
for 
the 
whole project 
implementation. 
The 
PMU 
will 
execute the payments 
on 
behalf 
of 
OPCOM, acting 
as 
a 
payment 
agent 
and 
this 
financing 
from 
both 
the 
loan 
and 
counterpart 
funds 
will 
be 
contributed 
by 
Transelectrica 
as 
equity 
increase 
to 
OPCOM's 
share 
capital. 
OPCOM 
is 
a 
wholly-owned 
subsidiary 
of 
Transelectrica. 
Transelectrica 
will 
assist 
OPCOM 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
part 
of 
the 
project 
by 
using 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Bank 
loan 
(about 
US$4.5 
million) 
to 
finance 
the 
services 
of 
the 
Electricity 
Market 
Consultants 
to 
OPCOM. 
Transelectrica 
will 
also 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
invest a corresponding amount 
plus 
its 
related 
local 
currency 
expenditures 
under the 
contract 
as 
its 
equity 
investment 
in 
OPCOM. 
In 
retum OPCOM 
will 
annually 
issue 
additional 
shares 
of 
equal value 
to 
Transelectrica 
to 
complete the 
process 
of 
the  annual 
equity 
increases. 
A 
Financing  and  Project  Implementation 
Agreement 
has 
been 
finalized 
and 
will 
be 
executed 
by 
Transelectrica 
and 
OPCOM for 
this 
purpose. 
It 
will 
become 
effective 
upon 
the effectiveness 
of 
the 
Bank 
loan. 
ANRE's 
component 
of 
the 
project 
is 
being 
funded 
by 
EUPhare, 
as 
a 
grant. 
Funds 
flow 
from 
the 
EU 
to 
MoPF 
and instead 
of 
passing 
funds 
to 
ANRE, 
the 
Central 
Finance 
and 
Contracts 
Unit 
(CFCU) 
in 
the 
MoPF 
makes 
the 
payments 
to 
ANRE's 
consultants. 
The 
PMU 
includes 
a 
Director, 
a finance team 
comprising 
the 
Project Finance 
Manager, 
Project 
Disbursement 
Officer 
and Project Accounting 
Officer 
and 
a 
number 
of 
Technical 
and Procurement 
Specialists. 
The 
Project 
Finance Manager 
has 
good 
experience 
of 
implementing 
Bank-financed projects 
and 
is 
fully 
capable 
of 
fulfilling 
the 
financial 
management needs 
of 
the project, 
as 
shown 
during 
the 
previous 
years 
on 
the 
WB-financed 
Power 
Sector 
Project 
that 
was 
implemented 
by 
the 
previous 
National 
Electricity 
Company. 
&I 
Accounting 
Policies 
and 
Procedures 
The 
accounting 
books and 
records 
are 
maintained 
on 
accrual 
basis 
and 
the 
entity 
and 
project financial 
statements 
are 
presented 
in 
Romanian 
Lei. 
The 
PMU 
has 
instituted 
a 
set 
of 
appropriate 
accounting 
procedures 
and 
internal 
controls 
including 
authorization and 
segregation 
of 
duties 
documented 
in 
the 
financial 
management 
procedures 
manual. 
(g) 
Reporting 
and 
Monitoring 
The 
PMU 
will 
produce 
all 
financial 
reports 
for 
the 
Bank 
and 
Government 
with 
its 
existing 
software 
system, 
based 
on 
Access, 
that 
it 
is 
able 
to 
report 
accurately 
and 
timely 
on 
project 
expenditures. 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
will 
be 
used 
for 
project 
monitoring 
and 
supervision. 
The 
PMU 
will 
produce a 
full 
set 
of 
FMRs 
every 
(calendar) 
quarter 
throughout 
the 
life 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
formats 
of 
FMRs 
were agreed 
and 
attached 
to 
the 
minutes 
of 
negotiations. 
In 
respect 
of 
ANRE, 
the 
PMU 
will 
receive quarterly 
data 
relating 
to 
the 
EC-Phare 
financing 
for 
ANRE 
(technical

(h) 
Information 
Systems 
The 
Transelectrica and 
OPCOM 
information 
systems 
comprise 
their 
internal 
software 
systems, 
based 
on 
Access, 
which 
are 
used 
for 
presenting 
all 
needed 
entities 
and project financial 
reports, 
for 
both 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
Government, 
denominated 
in 
Lei. 
The 
is 
a 
new 
contract 
entered 
into 
by 
Transelectrica 
and 
financed 
by 
EU-Phare 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
new 
fully 
customized 
MIS 
software. 
The activities 
to 
this 
end 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
finalized 
towards the 
end 
of 
year 2003. 
The 
new 
MIS 
will 
be a 
modern 
and comprehensive 
management 
tool 
that 
will 
be 
used 
for 
the 
entity 
and 
project 
monitoring 
needs. 
The 
technical 
specifications 
of 
the 
new 
MIS 
are 
available 
in 
the 
project 
files. 
(i) 
Supervision 
Plan 
During 
project 
implementation, 
the 
Bank 
will 
supervise 
the 
project’s 
financial 
management arrangements 
in 
two 
main 
ways: 
(i) 
the 
Bank 
will 
review 
the 
project’s quarterly 
financial monitoring 
reports 
as 
well 
as 
the project’s  and entities’ 
annual 
audited 
financial 
statements 
and 
auditor’s 
management 
letter; 
and 
(ii) 
during 
the 
Bank’s 
supervision 
missions, 
the 
Bank 
will 
review 
the 
project’s 
financial 
management 
and 
disbursement 
arrangements 
(including 
a 
review 
of 
a 
sample 
of 
SOEs 
and 
movements 
on 
the 
Special 
Account) 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
minimum 
requirements. 
As 
required, 
a Bank-accredited 
Financial 
Management Specialist 
will 
assist 
in 
project 
supervision. 
2. 
Audit 
Arrangements 
(a) 
Internal 
Audit 
Both 
Transelectrica and 
OPCOM 
have 
recently 
started 
to 
develop 
their 
internal audit function.  There 
are 
newly 
created departments 
(starting 
with 
January 2003) 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
recent 
changes 
in 
the 
Romanian legislation 
(Law 
672/ 
Dec 
2002), 
headed 
by 
a 
chief 
intemal 
auditor 
and a number 
of 
intemal 
auditors and 
technical 
experts. 
The 
intemal 
audit 
departments 
will 
include 
the 
Electricity Market 
Project 
in 
their 
work 
program. 
@) 
External 
Audit 
Transelectrica 
was 
audited 
in 
accordance 
with 
ISA 
since 
its 
incorporation 
in 
August 
2000 
by 
independent 
external 
auditors. 
The 
auditors issued a 
qualified-exception 
opinion 
on 
Transelectrica’s 
financial 
statements 
for 
2000,2001 
and 
2002, due 
to 
issues 
relating 
to 
the 
application 
of 
IAS 
29 
and 
aspects 
pertaining 
to 
fixed 
assets. 
In 
respect 
of 
FY 
02, 
the 
final 
draft 
audit report and 
management 
letter 
(discussed 
and 
agreed 
upon 
by 
Transelectrica 
with 
the 
auditors) were 
submitted 
to 
WB 
on 
May 
9th, 
2003 
and 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
signed 
versions 
of 
the 
documents 
will 
be 
issued 
by 
June 
lst, 
2003. 
OPCOM 
was 
audited 
in 
accordance 
with 
Romanian 
Auditing 
Standards since 
its 
incorporation 
in 
August 
2000 
by 
a Romanian 
authorized 
auditor. 
The 
opinion 
on 
OPCOM’s 
financial 
statements 
for 
2000,2001 
and 
2002 
is 
unqualified. There 
were a 
number 
of 
recommendations 
made 
by 
the 
auditor that were 
accepted 
and 
implemented 
by 
OPCOM. 
The 
previous audit 
experience 
under 
the 
Power 
Sector 
Project 
that 
was 
implemented 
by 
the 
previous 
National Electricity 
Company 
was satisfactory 
with 
no 
overdue 
audit 
reports.

The 
PMU 
has 
developed 
audit 
terms 
of 
reference 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank, 
to 
include 
the 
Project 
financial 
statements, 
SOEs 
and Special Account, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
audit 
of 
entities’ 
financial 
statements. 
Audit 
Reports 
The 
audit 
of 
the 
project and 
of 
the 
entities 
will 
be 
conducted 
by 
independent 
private 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the Bank, 
on 
terms 
of 
reference acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
annual 
audited 
project 
and entities 
financial 
statements 
will 
be 
provided to 
the 
Bank 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year 
and 
also 
at 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
costs 
of
