During\n            construction, spray with water using pressurized water jets\n            to control dust and earth removal activities, erect a dust\n            protective barrier, and cover equipment and machinery. To\n            reduce noise, execute during the daytime and avoid exceeding\n            noise limits. Wastes shall be separated and stored within\n            the substation area: collect waste oil in metallic tanks\n            located on concrete foundations and dispose of solid waste\n            in specially treated areas. Afterwards, remove waste and\n            reuse or store waste. Unrecoverable inert wastes shall be\n            taken to government approved dump sites. Remove topsoil and\n            dispose of oil-contaminated soils in special areas. Restore\n            sites by filling holes, leveling soil, and covering grass.\n            PCB contaminated soil shall be removed and treated by\n            licensed contractors using internationally accepted methods.\n            During project operation, collect wastewater according to\n            quality requirements. Alleviate air pollution by installing\n            technologically capable machinery and using low-sulfur\n            content fuel. Equip the diesel unit with a collecting tank\n            and oil/water separator. Procure new equipment to decrease noise."}, "docdt": "2006-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
