areas. The GOP hopes to achieve this\n            by: (i) providing 50,000 new student places to accommodate\n            76,500 students in double shifts; and by (ii) improving\n            school management practices and training school\n            administrators and teachers.The project aims to; (iii)\n            provide textbooks and other learning materials; and to (iv)\n            expand bilingual education programs for Aymara- and\n            Quechua-speaking children. The project also seeks to\n            strengthen the Ministry of Education's (MOE) project\n            execution and operating capacity."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
