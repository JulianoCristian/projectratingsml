Dear Mr. Jahan:
Re: BANGLADESH - Third Inland Water Transport Project (Cr. 2232-BD)
Amendment of the Development Credit Agreement
I refer to your letter dated May 7, 1995, regarding the above mentioned 
amendment. We have no objection to replace the Word DOS for BIWTA in Part D.3. Part 
D.3 should thus read:
"Strengthening DOS by providing speed boats for safety patrols, and provision 
of equipment for Inland Deck Personnel Training Center of BIWTA."
Best regards,
Sincerely,
Paul Isenman
