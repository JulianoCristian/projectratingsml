Project\n            sustainability is unlikely basically because the Government\n            of Bangladesh's commitment to pursue much broader\n            policy and institutional reforms, including divestiture,\n            appears weak. Overall World Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, while Borrower performance was unsatisfactory\n            since it failed to achieve most of the important reform\n            objectives. Lessons learned included the need to plan reform\n            programs through a participatory process; to actively\n            involve senior officials and closely monitor project\n            implementation; to reduce delays in approval of procurement\n            related activities by increasing the financial authority of\n            the parastatals; to enhance the role of the private sector;\n            and to engage the government in activities prior to Credit\n            approval which would cement its commitment to reform, such\n            as its taking irreversible actions like enacting legislation\n            prior to effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2000-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
