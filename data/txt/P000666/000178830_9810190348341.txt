APPRAISAL OF EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS IN ETHIOPIA
SUMARtY
i.       .The Ethiopian Government has made a request to the International
Development Association for financial assistance to construct and equip 5h
new secondary schools and additions to 23 existing secondary schools, 3 new
teacher trGiinine institutes; one npw technical institute and additions to
an existing technical institute.
ii.       The project is considered to be an urgent and high priority need.
Tt will permit a- major reision of the -zeon-r- s-and
curriculum to include practical subjects and will increase secondary school
enrollre71n+ rcnapait  from 1, 000 to  1 1.J0 with a trebling of g rad  19
graduates.  There will be 1,330 additional places in trade training and 300

at an economical price and of a modest, standard suitable for school direc-
uors± representing ' . 7I ofL thlie cost Of '± tA1e project.
iv.       EthioUJan trained teachers in secorldary schools araount to only 7%
of secondary school teachers, the remainder are mainly expatriates and Peace
Corps Volunteers; but e,xisting training facilities together with those
proposed in this project will result in an increase to 22% by 1970 and 80%
by 1980.
v.        Only 1% of children in that age group receive any secondary sc:nool
ecducation and the annual output of grade 12 graduates is less than 1,000;
most are of a quality not suited to the essential needs of industry, com-
merce and entry into the professions. The need for batter trained workers
is evident from the testimon- of employe-:s and the fact that most skilled
work is performed by expatriates. Tt is probable that shorta.e of local
skilled manpower is one of the main reasons that implementation of the
1962-67 Five Year Plan is so greatly behind schedule.
vi.       There is no shortage of foreign private architects, engineers or
contractors in Ethiopia but there is insufficient technical staff in the
Government to execute the work involved in the proposed project. The
Ethiopian Government has therefore agreed that a firm of architectural
consultants should be engaged to prepare all plans and drawings, advise on
the award of contracts, supervise the work and certify its execution for
purposes of disbursement (para. 60).
vii.      The proposed project is soundly based and meets vital requirements
for the countryts development. Estimated cost is about US$11.n million, the
foreign exchange component amounts to about US$3.6 million. The estimated
annual current expenditure created by the project is US$2.5 million. Bo-th
the capital contribution and the recurrent costs are within the capacity cf
the govermment. Subject to certain conditions being fulfilled (para. 89)
the project is suitable for an IDA credit in the amount of US$7.2 million
equivalent.

1,330 more students will be undert;aking trade training.
3..       An appraisal mission comprising Messrs. R. F. McNIahon (leader),
M. Hultin, H. Ziegler and K. Andersen (Urnesco) visited Ethiopia during
May - June, 1965. This report results from visits made to educational
institutions throughout the country, from discussions held with officials
in the Ministries of Education, Finance, Public Works and Labor, the
Planning O1fice, with the British Council and USAID and from contacts with
the British, Swedish and U.S. embassies. The mission also had discussicins
with Unescc) officials in Paris and Addis Ababa and had the findings of
previous missions to Ethiopia, including a Unesco Educational Investment
Programing Mission (1962), an ILO/Unesco Mission which advised on the
development of technical and vocational education (1964), Bank economic
missions (1963 and 1965) and a Unesco project preparation mission (1964),
available t;o them.

II. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
h.        General.  Rthiopia lies in the tropics between latitudes 3°N and
18°N but the great range of altitudes within the country considerably

from tropical desert to Afro-Alpine condition is found.  It has an area of
h61,OOO square miles and an estimated pop'ation. (1962) of m-
The population is very unevenly distributed; the dry lowlands are sparsely
populated a. nd1 'A 9_ of41 the population l,ves abuove the 3.,00 'eel contour li
in the more humid highlands.
5.,       Agriculture.  The country's agricultural and natural resources have
yet to be fully expluoited0  Th,e land, alithough varyling in productivity, has
great potentiality but development will depend inter alia upon reform of the
'.and ownership system.  mne livestock potential and forest resources are
considerable. Agriculture provides about 7D5 of the G.N.P., supports more
tnan 90`1 of' the population and suppliebs almost 1O01o of tne country's exports.
60        Industry is still in its infancy but progress is evidenced by tne
establishment during the last five years of a wide variety of light industrial
enterprises. Further development particularly of light and consumer goods
indLustries is anticipated. Hydro-electric power prospects are good and the
new Assab petroleum. refinery can more than satisfy domestic requirements.
7.        A scarcity of trained manpower has limited industrial development
to areas such as textiles, cement manufacture and food processing where a
relatively small proportion of trained manpower is needed. Future industrial
developments will call for more highly skilled personnel. Aside from shortage
of funds, this scarcity may be considered as a serious bottleneck in the
economic development of Ethiopia. As a result of all these conditions per
capita inccme is only about UIS$O per annum.

III. EDUCATIONI AND TRAINING
8.        The Educational Svstem.  The organization and administration of
education is centralized under the Ministry of Education with headquarters at
Addis Ababa (Annex 1). the Minister of State for Education being anpointed by
the Emperor. Two Assistant Ministers of State are responsible respectively
for aniministration and eduantional nolinv,    Separate departments. eatAh under a
director, are responsible for elementary, general secondary, technical and
snecimtl iJ erdcio'i+.in andi teacher trainin, ei _acnr'h hwvincr te  atm sub-din sions
for inspect:ion, research and statistics.
9.        Ethiopia comprises fourteen provinces and at each provincial capital
is  Provin,zia - l Educ+i O^ff i-er (P.E .) 0  whI- I  responsibl  forthe eff-e+J T
operation, including inspection, of all schools in his province and who reports
dircectly to the appropriate assistant  ini ster. He_ is ast        btworhe
assistant inspectors.
10.       In general, the administration is reasonably well organized andl
Staffed but sulffers from a lack of' qualifLed and experienced technical educa-
tion specia:Lists anci of a properly manned buildings maintenance section

11.       The school inspectorate is satisfactory and can be expected to
i1ProVe qUickly In efficiency as more qualified peopie are available Lrom the
university"s training program (Annex 2 and para. 27). The efficient function-
ing of the research and statistics units is hampered by an acute shortage Of
qualified staff; whilst arrangements for collecting and analyzing statistics
within the Ministry are effective, liaison with other ministries in these
matters  is minimal.. The Ministry's FLnance Department is efficient and
there is good cooperation between it and the Ministry of Finance.
12.       The system of education is in process of change from eight years of
primary education followed by four years of secondary education to six years
of primary, two years of junior secondary and four years of senior secondary
education (Annex 3). Amharic will continue to be the medium of instruction
in primary schools but a gradual change from Amharic to English is to occur in
the junior secondary schools and Eiglish will be used throughout the senior
secondary schools.  In this report grades 1-6 will be designated primary
schools and grades 7-12 secondary schools.
13.       In Primary Education, the general standard of classroom accommodation
and equipment, particularly in the lower classes, is not conducive to efficient
learning.  There is an acute shortage of furniture, books, stationery and.
teaching aidls. The average class has 45 pupils but lower grades frequently
have as many as 65 pupils. High "drop--out" rates are a serious problem; of
those starting school in grade 1, only one child in six reaches grade 6 and
some two-thirds of the losses occur in the first two years. About one
quarter of the students are girls (Annexes h and 5).



114.      Primary enrollment has increased from 224,000 in 1960/61 to 317,000
in 1963/6X, with a -uhqt2ntiaI part. of the increase cnming frnm the tnanlning

substantially because of the high costs involved in following the Ministry's
new curric-uIlUI \JJd(ar. 1 7).
17.       Tlhe curriuuiuii of all secuxidaiy schools formerly inclwued academic
subjects only but about two years ago two government schools added practical
subjects to the curriculum and this nas since been extended to five gover-nmrit
schooLs, USAID providing appropriate equipment and teaching staff.   These
pilot schemes have been successful and it is now proposed to use them as
models for all secondary schools.
18.       The general standard of accommodation in secondary schools is :Low.
Teaching eq:uipment and visual aids are practically non-existent, building
maintenance is poor,and insufficient financial provision is made to support
opera-tions in a satisfactory manner. Facilities for printing textbooks and
stationery are in short supply but the completion later this year of the new
government ?rinting press could alleviate these shortages.
l9¢       The "drop-out" rate is high; only about 3,' of those starting grrade
7 complete grade 12 and only 205% of grade 12 graduates obtain a school cer-
tificate at a standard adequate for university entrance (Annexes 4 and 5).
The performance of the students in school certificate examinations is par-
ticularly weak in mathematics and science subjects, due to shortages of
suitably skilled teachers and lack of equipment.
20.       Technical and Vocational Education (Table 3) has received minor
attention in the educational system.   The government maintains two techni.cal
institutes for the training of craftsmen and a commercial institute; a poly-
technic for technicians is supported by the USSR.   The Ethio-Swedish Building
Institute trains building technicians. Two agricultural schools train
students to craft level.

are not available8
23.       Teacher Training (Table 4). There are about 7,000 primary school
teachers, aii Ethiopians.   No record of their training or qualifications is
available but discussions with school directors indicated that as many as
20, have had no teacher training and t;heir education is iimited to about
seven years at school. Primary teachers are trained at four government
training institutes.  Students are selected after completing grade 10 of
secondary education. and then receive a two-year training course. Assistance
towards the staffing and operation of these institutes is provided by a
combined Unesco/Unicef project.

school grade 12. Output is planned to reach a maximum of 100 per year by
1973 which should enable all these institutes to be staffed by Ethiopians by
1975 (Annex 2).

Total:  i, 3
Aoout 100 of the total teach practical subjects; only 10 of these are
Ethiopians,.  The average student-teacher ratio in secondary schools is 20:1.
This figure is low because in many schools the facilities in the upper grades
are not fully utilized.
26.       Ethiopian secondary school tleachers are university trained by a team
from Utah University under contract to USAID; the program includes training
overseas for some better students who will eventually take over the duties of
thle Utah team as this program is phased out (Annex 2).   Grade 12 school
graduates receive either a four-year course to qualify them to teach in senior
secondary schools or a two-year course for a junior secondary school teaching
qualification.  Annual output is estimated to rise to 105 for senior secondary
schools and. 122 for junior secondary schools by 1970.
27.       The university provides a one-year course for school directors,
supervisors and inspectors. Specially experienced and qualified teachers are
selected for this course the output from which is planned to reach a maximum
of 100 by 1966; this is sufficient to meet the planned needs of primary and
secondary school staffs at that level.
28.       The university also runs a two-year course for physical education
specialists, the output from which is planned to rise to 70 by 1970. All
university students are required to serve one year as a teacher in secondary
schools; this year of service occurs between the third and fourth years of
study and helps appreciably in the supply of teachers.
29.       No facilities exist for practical teacher training.   Ethiopian
teachers in the polytechnic and technical institutes are all graduates of one
of the two technical institutes. A few have had experience in engineering
works overseas, but the majority have negligible industrial experience. The
resignation rate of staff from these institutes is at a seriously high level;
the salaries are too low to attractr arid keepn comnetent staff when nomnnred with
local industry.
30.       Higher Education.  The Haile! Selassie I University, Ethiopia's
onlvy iniversitJy was foun.ded in 1961.  TI has faculties of Arts, Law,
Science, Medicine, Agriculture, Engineering, Architecture, Social WTork,
Theolo r, Co.m.m.erce, and Education.  About 1,630 students are currently e:nrolled
and there is an annual intake of 800. Less than 0.1% of the university school

IV. THE NEID FOR TEE PROJECT
33.       T'he present Five Year Plan (:1962-67) gives estimates of the addi-
tional needs of various categories of skilled manpower during the period of
the P'lan. WThilst it is now clear that full implementation of the Plan will
not be achieved by 1967, it is possib:Le that major parts of it will be
imple!mented by about 1970 and arrangements should now be made to provide the
necessary skilled ranpower. Additional. skilled manpower requirement for full
implementat;ion of the Plan would i.nclude:
Technical insitAute 'rrd]ntes:          5.000
General secondary school graduates:    10,000
34.      FBecause of a lack of systematic manpower figures in Ethiopia
d   i     nns: were heldr T.Ti th PmriIrerr 1;o assess preent andi flitii-re needs of
skilled personnel. The majority of employers asserted that present secondary
school graduates were generally untsuitalble for employm.ent because of th.eir
low overall quality and lack of training in useful basic skills; all felt
that training oriented towards gro-_ ng industrial emplo.ym..ent opportunities
should be a prime function of secondary school instruction. Most positions

children aged 13-18 and of these only 31,000, about 1%, attended government
secondary schools in the year 496i4/65    in the ---   y o
grade 12, cf whom some 20 percent obtained a school leaving certificate of
Stuific±eiiu sL.aiiard to perurL u.u R to enutev university.  ±n±S smnall output o
qualified students has caused the university to admit unqualified students
(para. 30) to the general detriment oI' university standards.
36.        !uanltUitati-vely, it is clear that the outpuut fromri grade 12 is grossly
insufficient to meet the needs of the university, government departments,
coimmerce and industry. Further, the government is planning an improvement in
the quality and an increase in the quantity of primary school pupils and thi3
will then lead to an increasing demand on secondary school places. A large
expansion in secondary school enrollment is therefore considered to be essential
to the economic needs of Ethiopia and to a properly balanced system of education.
37.       Qualitatively, representatires of government departments, commerce
and industry were unanimous that the standard of secondary education needs
considerable improvement. To meet the: needs of a developing country, a wider
and more appropriate range of subjects should be included to modernize the
school curriculum. For a predominantl.y agricultural country and where light
industry and commerce are emerging, subjects of a practical type should be
taught in all secondary schools in addition to the academic subjects previously
offered,  To help to ensure an increase in the quality of pupils entering
secondary schools strengthening of primary schools with well trained teachers,
for which the project provides two primary teacher training institutes, was
considered to be a factor which would give a sound foundation to the whole
project.

38.       PrimLary T'eacher Training.  An increased supply of trained teachers
is essentiaLl to meet the needs for expansion and improvement of primary
education. There are now about 7,000 pri.mary school teachers, 20% of them
untrained, for 317,000 pupils. The government's policy is to triple school
capacity to 900.000 pupils during the four years 1965-69.   ImDlementaticn of
this policy whilst maintaining the present pupil/teacher ratio and repla.cing
untrained by trained teachers with allowance for a 5% teacher annual loss would
need at least 17,000 more trained teachers.  Output of teachers from existing
training institutes; during 1965-69 (Table I,) is exnPcted to 'h only 3;.330!
this falls so far short of requiremenbs that full implementation of the govern-
ment4s nolicv is unrealist3if  A w      niser polit-v is for an PYn1nsionn in nrim.rv
school teacher training to which would be geared an expansion of primary
school S
39.       Practical Teacher Trainin.   Mnost positionsn incormm.erce and inrustry
requiring practical or commercial ski:Lls are filled by expatriates whose early
rPn1 ace.imsnt byr Ethiopians should bet a ma;jor objective of the educational
system but, until recently, academic subjects only have been taught in second-
ary *.chools.   As st;ated abvTe (pran.  37) it+ J  4mpor+tnt+ +tIh+ irnig people

institutes indicated an annually increas.ing deman,d for their studenbs, except
in woodwiork subjects where some difficulty in placing students is now being
experienced. The output oI craftsmen from both institutes is at present only
about 175 per year which is too small to meet the needs of industry.   An
increased output to 500 craftsmen couid readily be absorbed by industry..  Part
of this output would attend the practical teacher training institute and so
help to solve the difficult problem of recruiting suitable students.
42.       Some towns, particularly Dire Dawa and Nazareth, have a gradually
deve:loping light industry which is creating a demand for skilled tradesrnen.
This demand is not being satisfied from local sources.   To promote this
industrial development suitable local facilities for technical training are
required; no such facilities are now available.

struction of three teacher training institutes and construction or equipping
of' ±.t,TO ±echnial irnstitutes; student host.els and stqff hoiusP. were innlidep
at most sites.  The! cost of the proposed project totalled US$9.26 million
(Eth$23.15 mnillion).  ExamTination of t;his project showed its cost had been
underestimated, the proposed standards of buildings and equipment were on
too low a scale, and it contained sevelra' schools of too smal"  a size to be
economically viable.  In order to keep the costs down to acceptable limits,

will be more than trebled. Equally important, the standard of secondary
education will be considerably improved because the new facilities provided
will permit, major revision in the secondary school curriculum so as to
include prELctical subjects including agriculture, industrial arts, commerce
and home economics. USAID (para. 17) has already helped to establish prac-
tical subject teaching at four l/ selected schools and they have now under-
taken to supply equipment for practical subjiects to an additional lh schools;
construction or extension of these schools is a part of the proposed project
and it is intended that the remaining secondary schools should be similarlv
equipped and staffed with the help of the requested IDA credit.  Estimated
cost ner student for the construction and equi,nmpnt of new schools sunplied
from the IDA credit, is US$210; this figure excludes the cost of boarding

The total output of' trained teachers from the five teacher training insti-
tutues will then rise to 1,100 per annum by 1969 (Table 11).
48.      'Staffing for these institutes will be provided partly by university
graduates (para. 2h) and partly by a combined Unesco/Unicef team wnich by
1970 will be replaced by suitably trained graduates from the university.  The
estimated cost per student place is US,$3-7.
49.       P'ractical Teacher Training Institute.  No facilities exist at
present for the training of teachers of practical subjects; a new practical
teacher training institute, to be attached to the university's department of
education, is therefore proposed. A four-year degree course to qualify
students to teach in senior secondary schools and a two-year diploma course
to qualify students to teach in junior secondary schools will be organized.
50.       UTSAID have under active consideration the provision of suitable
staff' and have sent, a Utah University representative to Addis Ababa to study
and report on the setting up of this institute.  11hilst final details have

to be determined, it is understood that IJSAID would commission a U.S.
University to supply a team of about 6 technical staff to be assigned to
the project and phased out over a period of 7 years as trained Ethiopians
become available. IDA funds would finance the buildings and equinment.
51.       The annual intake of students wiould be 90; k5 in the two-year
course and 45 in the four-year course; the annual output of trained teachers
for the senior snhools would be nhout 35 nnd for the ilnior shnools bhout

buildlings  on  a adjacent site presen    --l occupied by t-e uversity depat-
ment of engineering but soon to be vacated. A wide range of modern machinertr

588 to 1,336 and at Asmara from 237 to 729 by 1969.  Similar courses at both
inst-it-Ut,es WIL Include rracUne show and bench fitting, welding and sheet
metal work, electricity and electronics, automobile maintenance, carpentry
and building trades. Tne cost per student enrolled at Addis Ababa, based on
new equipment supplied, is estimated at US$260 and at Asmara, for new
buildiings and equipment, is uS$70.   In the UK the cost per student place in
technical institutes is about $1,850 of which $450 represents equipment cost.
55.      'Trade Extensions at Two Secondary Schools.    They are situated
in Dire Dawa and Nazareth where minor industries are developing and there
is an increasing need for skilled craftsmen. The trade extensions will
enable part-time day and evening classes to be offered in a range of
practical subjects., This type of education is new to Ethiopia and therefore
experimental in nature. If successful, and similar training in Europe
indicates it probably will be, then a valuable link between the schools and
local industry will be made.  The arrangement also has the added economic
advantage of utilizing, during the evenings, the schools' daytime facilities0
56.       It is an-ticipated that all students will be part time day or
evening and will normally attend school for one day or two or three evenings
per week; the courses of instruction would extend for two or three years0
The facilities for 48 places provided at each school would thus allow about
336 students to at-tend planned programs of instruction. The cost of each
of the 48 places is estimated at US$500.



57.       Student IHostels.  31 secondary schools and one primary teacher
training inistitute are situated in areas of low population density and
student hostels are therefore proposed for these.   The hos-tels will be built
in standardlized units, each to house 36 students and will include super-
visor's accommodation suitable for a single person. They will be of an
economic and minimal standard and wil:L include washing and cooking facilities.
Accommodation for 2,520 students, i.e., less than 5% of all students, will
be provided at a cost of US$lhO per student.
58.       Staff Housing.  It is desirable that the school director should
live on the campus of all schools having hostels, particularly since accom-
modation for boys and girls is sometirmes provided.  One staff house is to be
provided at each of 29 schools. The other schools with proposed hostels
already have staff houses. A staff house for the school director is also
provided at each of the two primary teacher training institutes.   The
housqes will be economieailyv desijJgned and sniJt.,qbhJ  fonr 1 nm1 living conditions
to cost US$6,800 each.
59.       Schedules of accommodation prepared for each school were revised
during the project           cndeosts acjusted to a realnis.Ji figivro.
Equipment requirements were established with close reference to the instruc-
tion program end r-m-bers of pu,pils in each school . Audio-visual teach;ng
aids and laboratory equipment are provided for all schools. Equipment on a.
reasonable scale and cost- is provided for the uwo technical institutes
60.       Administration,  The implemeDntation of the project will imposc
additional burdens on the Ministry of Education.   The assistant minister
in charge of administration is uui4idered to be a suitable person to take
charge of the project.  It is suggested that he should be the Chairman of
a Project 1mplementtation Cormm.ittee whose members wo-ulu iSclude senior
representatives from the Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Finance.
Tle Commit;ee should be empowered to appoint consulting architects, wi"t
whom it should establish close working relationships, award contracts and
carry out avl other duties relevaint to the project.
61..      nhe assistant minister woul(i need the help of an accountant, an
architect and a technical adviser for the execution of the project. It is
probable that an architect may be available through bilateral aid from the
Swedish government and Unesco is taking steps to provide a technical
adviser.  Ihe Ministry of Education is prepared to appoint an accountanit
into its finance department, who, together with necessary assistants,
would be engaged on the project.   Suitable links exist between the Ministry
of Education's FinEnee Department and the Ministry of Finance to ensure the
necessary iinancial cooperation between them and the Association.
62.       Commissioning of the schools as they are built and become availa-
ble, including the training and appointing of staff would be the responsi-
bility of the assistant minister in charge of the education division. ]-t
is proposed to appoint the directors of new schools at an early date so
that they could give some assistance and supervision during the development
stages of their schools.

responsibilities.
Stage I Survey and Design
- To conduct a field survey of existing facilities of all project
scnools.
- To develop economical and uniform design standards.
- To work out alternative design solutions for component building
types to arrive at standardized and most economical structures.
- To prepare detailed master plans for all the 78 schoois in the
project.
Stage II  Preparation of Contract Documents and Supervision of
Construction
- To prepare comprehensive working drawings and specifications.
- To approve the list of building contractors and sub-contractors,
recommend the bidding procedure and award of contracts.
- To mobiLize office and on-the-site supervisory staff for the
entire construction phase, with qualified professional super.-
visors stationed in the field as needed.
- To oversee the entire project until certified final completion
has been issued.
64.       Financial Implications.  The additional recurrent expenditure
raised by t'he project is estimated at US$2.5 million and this is considered
to be well within the capacity of the Government's finances as is also a
contribution of US$:3.8 million to the capital cost.

VI. BUILDING CONSTRUCTION
65.       There are many large private and public buildings in Addis Ababa
of an excellent standard, both structurally and architecturally, but the
general standard of school construction varies widely; a few are built of
stone, but many are made from mud and wood (locally called "chica").   Some
newer school buildings are fabricated from precast concrete blocks.   Main-
tenance of most schools is not of a satisfactory standard. The Hinistry of
Education has a property and maintenance section; but this would need to be
better staffed and financed to become properly effective. An allowance for
maintenance of school buildings has been included in the estimated annua:L
recurrent costs of US$2.5 million raised by the project.
66.       Building activities have increased during the last few years but,
owing to greatly increased competition in the building industry, costs have
remained reasonable and static. Introduction of the quantity of building
pronosed in this project would be well wi-thin local building capacitv and
shoaLd cause no pressure on general building costs.
67.       The larger building firms are asually foreign based with registered
subsidiarie  in Rthionia; most locnl firms are small "jibhing" builders.
There is plenty of general labor but skil:led craftsmen and supervisors are
in shortsuppnly.

6°.       T:he Ministy of Public Works has - few prof'essional en-,---rs <md
architects on its staff but they are too preoccupied with their present
dutles to be available for detailed work on thlis project.
I o       iLesyons.LU.ly  .L fL l,hI Vd. of 1skchL building   rtsU wtUh4 tJhe
Ministry of Public Works.   T'endering, bidding and contract awards for school
construction follow an acceptable system. Tendering is usually public and
advertized in the local papers; for the proposed project the government will
Invite internationa.L bidding ior the supply of imported apparatus andu equip-
ment, but because of the wide variation in conditions at the 78 building
sites of the project-, it will probably be advisabie to award contracts for
the construction of buildings to Ethiopial contractors experienced in local
conditions.
71.       with the exception of some primary schools erected by communities,
schoo:Ls constructed during the last ten years have all been designed by -the
Ministry of Public Works and built by locally based contractors.



72.       FunLds for the maintenance of school buildings are centrally
controlled by the Ministry of Education, a. system which leads to unreason-
able delays in executing urgent repairs.  Some decentralization of respon-
sibility to enable provincial education officers and school directors to
undertake maintenance is necessary.
73,       The basis of cost estimates for construction for all project items
in this report is a square meter cost for the particular type of construction
involved. These basic costs were the Subject of careful investigation and
were determined after consultations with MKinistry of Education and Ministry
of Public Works officials and local private consultants and contractors.
Owing to wide differences in clLmatic and topographical conditions and
transport difficulties in various parts of the country, together with a
shorta.ge of skilled labor in some areas, there are variations of basic costs
at the building sites amounting to as much as 50 per cent.   These factors
have been taken into account in the cost estimates (Annex 7).
7h.       The school designs for the proposed project are based on a standard
size classroom to hold 4O students; multiples of this structural unit are
used for the! laboratories. workshons and library. Construction will be in
precast concrete blocks and steel roof trusses covered with galvanized iron
sheets.

VII.  CONCLUSIONS AMD RECOIvMWNDATIONS
79.       Education. and training in Ethiopia urgently need expansion and
improvement. Only 10% of eligible children attend primary school grades
1-6 and abcut 1% attend secondarv schnol grades 7-12.  Tess than 0.1%
receive education after grade 12. There is clear evidence that the quality
of teachinp iS lovw nnd the present qrualit.y of school buildin-gs and euipn-
ment is below acceptable standards.

81.       A strengthening of primary and secondary education is urgently
needed too prov;.de 3. so,,-d fou.-+-d ation n upon w-hich future devel opmemts i
higher education can be based.  The inclusion of practical subjects,
including agriculture Mand comamerce i an essentil addit;io  to secondary
school curricula, which should prove of long term value to the country's
LAeve.lopm,ent.
82.       An expansion of light industry is taking place, causin~g a rise in
the demand for skilled craftsmen. The present technical institutes are
inadequately housed, equipped and staf'fed to produce the desired quantity
and quality of craftsmen.
83.       Additional teachers, particularly for primary schools and for
practIcal subjects in secondary schoo]ls an-d technnical ins-titutes, are
urgently required.
81.       Ihe items in the proposed project are well conceived to help to
overcome these shortcomings. Tne two primary and one practical teacher
training institutes to be supported by Unesco/Urglef and USAID respectively
will alleviate the main weakness in the present education mystem.  The
building and extension of 77 secondary schools and the use of new modernized
curricula, together with the supply of suitably trained teachers, will
ensure schools of a good standard. The rehousing and modernizing of the two
technical institutes and the introduction of trade extension courses at two
secondary schools will increase the flow of well trained craftsmen into new
and developing industries.
85.      T'he siting of secondary schools throughout the Empire has been
carefully considered, taking into account population distribution, supply
of grade 6 graduates from nearby primary schools and accessibility by road
transport. Similar considerations inf'luenced the location of student
hostels. Quarters for one or two single supervisory staff and one school
director's house have been provided at; each school where considered
essential.
86.       IThe scale and design of buildings to be constructed are appropriate
to the purposes they are to serve and cornorm to the general standards of
construction in Ethiopia.  They are characterized by a sense of economy and
the estimates are realistic and within acceptable limits.

87.       For all the institutions concerned equipment needs are most urgent
and unlikely to be satisfied from local resources.
88M       The project submitted to IDA by the Government has been apprcved
by the Council of Ministers and has the full support of the Emperor. The
financial obligations, for both capit;al and recurrent expenses, have been
clearly defined and are within the capacity of the government (para. 43).
89.       During negotiations agreement of the Ethiopian government waE
obtained on the following requirements which are considered essential for
the satisfactory implementation of the project:
(a)  A person acceptable to IDA will be nominated to be in overall
charge of the project and resporLsible for its implementation tc
the Minister of State for Education (para. 60).
(b)  He! will have an architect; and a specialist in technical education
as advisors.  A oualified accountLnt will be anDointed to the
st;aff of the Ministry of Education who would be responsible for
this projent (para   61).
(e) For all hrilding procnlns11tAinr architects acepntable to
JI)A will be appointed to carr-y out all necessary work (para. 6 ).
(d)  For the practical teacher training institute the Ethiopian
govcrTnent will obtain staff and equipment of a quality and
quantity &cceptable to IDA (para. 50).
