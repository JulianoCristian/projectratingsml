12,400 ha of\n            sugarcane in South Kalimantan and produce about 50,000 tons\n            of sugar per annum for domestic consumption.  In addition,\n            3,000 ha are to be cleared for smallholder houses, gardens\n            and foodcrops.  Through sugar development and technical\n            assistance components, the project will contribute to\n            reducing sugar imports by about 7%; provide the basis for\n            improving technical and managerial approaches to rainfed\n            sugarcane production which will influence GOI's overall\n            sugar development program; and have a significant impact on\n            the development of an area with limited agricultural\n            alternatives.  It will provide funds for start-up activities\n            of future nucleus estates and smallholders projects based on\n            annual crops; for studies in the sugar sector as well as\n            contributing to the overall manpower and training program\n            for new sugar estates."}, "docdt": "1983-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
