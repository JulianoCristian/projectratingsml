major improvement of capacity as\n            well as structural upgrading of the road network in the\n            state of Mizoram. The negative environmental impacts will be\n            mitigated in the following ways: Massive hill cutting\n            affecting the stability of slopes is a key issue. Other\n            concerns relate to the damage to the road formation, damage\n            to the hillside flora and fauna, and disruption to traffic.\n            Based on the geological setting, zoning has been worked out\n            and cut slopes recommended. Locations vulnerable to\n            landslides have been identified, and at most locations,\n            mitigation measures as rock bolting, provision of band\n            drains where required, and bio-engineering techniques that\n            stabilize vertically cut slopes adopted. To prevent loss of\n            biodiversity, physical damage or removal of individual\n            plants close to the existing carriageway and on the hillside\n            where cutting will occur during construction will be\n            minimized. Pipe culverts and barbed wire fencing will\n            prevent ecological disturbance. Other mitigations include\n            identifying disposal areas for construction debris,\n            locations for water harvesting and storage, and traffic\n            diversion and timing of activities. Other measures address\n            involuntary resettlement, indigenous populations, and income\n            restoration. Further volumes focus on major maintenance\n            routes, environmental impact assessment, and sectoral\n            environmental assessment."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
