  A. Introduction

  1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to provide an
  additional credit o f SDR12.10 million (US$18 million equivalent) for the Mizoram State
  Roads Project, India (Project ID: P069889, Credit Number: 3618-IN). The proposed
  additional Credit would help finance the costs associated with cost overrun as discussed
  inparagraph 6 below. N o changes inthe scope of the ongoing project are contemplated.
  The expected outcome from the activities to be supported with additional financing
  would be sustainable improvement inmanagement and carrying capacity o f the core state
  road network inthe state o f Mizoram.

  B. BackgroundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancing

  2.     Mizoram State Road Project was declared effective on June 3, 2002 with a Credit
  amount o f SDR47.5 million (US$60 million equivalent).           K e y project data and
 perfonnance data i s stipulated below;

         Key projectData                             ProjectPerformance
  Effectiveness Date: 06/03/2002     Development Objective: Moderately satisfactory
  Closing Date: 12/31/2007           Implementation Progress: Moderately satisfactory
I Project Age: 55 months
  %Disbursed : 64.5 %

  3.      The project's development objective is to improve the management and carrying
  capacity of the Mizoram core state road network. The project comprises six components:

  (a)     improvement (widening and strengthening) of about 184 km State Highways at an
         estimated cost o f about US$39 million;
  (b)    implementation o f the Resettlement and Indigenous People Development Plan
          (R&IPDP), Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and land acquisition and
         utility relocation plan associated with road improvement component at an
         estimated cost o f about US$2.25 million;
 (c)     rehabilitatiodmaintenance o f about 520 km o f state roads at an estimated cost o f
         US$18.75 million;
 (d)     design, supervision and technical advisory services for civil works at an estimated
         cost o fUS$6.0 million;
 (e)     institutional strengthening, including equipment, TA, training, and pre-investment
         studies at an estimated cost o fUS$3.0 million; and
 (f)     road safety engineering interventions at an estimated cost o f about US$l.O
         million.

 4.      ImplementationStatus:The Credit is fully committed and the disbursement has
 reached US$38.7 million (about 64.5%). The development objective and implementation
 progress has been rated as moderately satisfactory as (a) 210 km (out o f 220 km)
 maintenance roads have already been completed and opened to traffic and a travel time
 reduction o f about 50% has been achieved in these roads, (b) 42% o f the core road
 network has been improvedto good condition and maintenance backlog has decreased to
 800 km from 1,000 km, (c) share o f Public Works Department (PWD) administrative

                                                2


costs reduced from 35% to 22% o f the road sector budget, and (d) Government o f
Mizoram has endorsed a road development policy, planning and quality assurance cells
have been established within PWD, a road fund i s being set up and substantial
procurement and contract management reforms and IT capacity enhancements have been
undertaken. Implementation o f the road improvement component has, however, been
seriously delayed and both the Phase Iand Phase I1upgradation works are unlikely to be
completed by the Credit closure date. It is therefore unlikely that the expected travel time
and cost benefits associated with upgradation works will be fully achieved by the Credit
closure date.

5.      There i s full compliance with all legal covenants, except the Project Agreement
Covenant 2(e) (Schedule 2), regarding the implementation and monitoring o f the EMP
and Environmental Social Management Plan (ESMP) which remains partially complied.
Nevertheless, there has been significant improvement in recent past in compliance with
the EMP provisions in terms o f campsite management, spoil disposal and traffic
management and safety matters and it is likely that by March 2007 this covenant can also
be considered as fully complied. Further, the audit report o f the project for the year 2005-
06 has been received and pending issues have been clarified to the Bank in respect o f
audit objections and disallowances.

7.      Rationale for Additional Credit: The causes o f the cost overrun were mostly
beyond the control o f the Government o f Mizoram. It would be important to complete the
ongoing activities as planned in order to achieve the original development objective.
Without the additional finance, the Project Development Objective will be seriously
compromised as the expected travel time and cost benefits associated with road

                                             3


improvement works will be only partially realized. Moreover, Mizoram is categorized as
a special category state given that it i s a financially weak state in the relatively
underdeveloped North Eastern region o f India. It would be difficult for such a poor state
to allocate additional counterpart funds to absorb the cost overrun impact.

C. ProposedChanges

8.      There are no changes inthe project's Development Objective, original design and
scope. There are no complementary changes applicable to institutional arrangement,
financial management, disbursementarrangements andprocurement also. (See Annexes 2
and3 for revisedproject costs and financingplan).

D.Consistencywith CAS

9.      The September 2004 CAS (for the period FY 05 -08) identifies three strategic
areas of engagement (a) infrastructure (roads, transport, power, water supply and
sanitation, irrigation and urban) development to underpin both accelerated growth and
improved service delivery; (ii) human development (education, health, social protection-
priorities to support specific MDGs); and (iii)rural livelihoods. The project i s fully
consistent with the proposed CAS program priorities. More specifically the additional
financing continues to support the CAS strategic objectives o f providing high quality
infrastructure and more efficient management of the roadtransport sector.

10.     The planning and development strategy of Government of India (GOI) also places
highpriority on socio-economic development inthe NorthEastern states of India, which
generally have reasonably good social indicators but low economic development. All o f
these states are geographically isolated, being in hilly or mountainous terrain with long
transport links with the rest o f India, and virtually no access to trade with neighboring
countries in the remote region. The present project and the additional financing being
sought perfectly aligns with GO1 priorities for development in this remote and
economicallyweak region.

E.EconomicAnalysis of CostOverruns

11.     Revised cost-benefit analyses had been carried out for the two road upgradation
contracts, Phase Iand Phase I1and rehabilitation contracts M1 and M 5 where there was
substantial cost increase from the appraisal stage.

12.     Inthe case o f upgrading contracts where costs were increased by 32% over the
appraisal estimate, the overall economic rate o f return has increased from 15% (at
appraisal) to 22%. The increase ineconomic rate o f return i s due to larger unit savings in
Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) as a result o f increased fuel prices and more than 50%
increase intraffic as compared to forecasted traffic at the time o f appraisal. Moreover, the
traffic on parallel National Highway connecting Aizawl and Lunglei which i s about 67
kmlonger than the project road, has increased to about 2.2 times of the estimated traffic
andthis would result inlarger savings from divertedtraffic (see Annex 3 for details).

                                            4


13.     The results for revised economic analyses for rehabilitation roads M1and M5 are
quite in line with the appraisal document for economic analysis. The current traffic i s
almost similar with the traffic estimated during the appraisal. However, since the unit
savings have gone up because of fuel cost increase, the increased VOC savings have
offset the increase inconstruction cost. Moreover, for the entire rehabilitation component
the switching value for cost was 45.1% and the overall cost increase was about 15%,
much lower than the switching value (see Annex 3 for details).

F.ExpectedOutcomes

14.     The expected outcome i s to improve the management and carrying capacity o f the
Mizoram state core road network.

G.Benefits andRisks

15.     With the improvement and rehabilitation of a large part (about 50%) o f the core
road network, the project addresses the transport access needs for one o f India's most
remote and isolated states. The project also provides enhanced transport accessibility to
education, health services and employment opportunities for about 70 percent o f the
state's population thereby significantly contributing to the development and poverty
alleviation. Without the additional financing, these socio-economic benefits will only be
partially realized.

16.     There are no additional risks associated with the additional financing. The project
is fully committed, the road rehabilitation works have been substantially completed and
the road improvement works are in progress. Nevertheless, the progress on road
improvement component i s much slower than originally scheduled and delays in
implementation o f this component would continue to remain as a moderate risk.
Government o f Mizoram has been making continuous improvement in contract
administration and supervision to mitigate such risks.

H. PolicyWaiver for theAdditionalFinancing

17.     The Borrower requested that the Bank waive the requirement under paragraph 3
o f OP 13.20 ("Additional Financing for Investment Lending") that additional financing
be provided as a separate Credit, with the financial terms and conditions for the
additional Credit being set inaccordance with OP 3.10 ("Financial terms and Conditions
o f IBRD Loans, IDRD Hedging Products and IDA Credits").          The Borrower requested
that the additional financing be treated as an extension o f existing Credit rather than a
new Credit, and be processed through an amendment to the existingDevelopment Credit
Agreement applying the same repayment terms as that o f the existing Credit rather than
enteringinto a new Credit agreement.

18.     Justificationfor the Waiver:Underthe flow of funds arrangement agreed for the
original Credit, Credit proceeds from the Bank are passedby GO1to Mizoram, a special
category state, on a 90% grant and 10% loan basis. This arrangement was changed by
GO1effectively inApril 2005. Under the new on-lending arrangement between GO1and
Indianstates, the GO1will pass on the terms of its borrowing from the Bank/IDA to the

                                             5


states on a back-to-back basis. This new on-lending regime could negatively affect
Mizoram, if it were to request additional financing from the IDA through a new Credit
agreement since the back-to-back arrangement will apply to the amount o f the additional
financing (Le., Mizoram will receive the proposed additional financing from IDA as
100% Credit at the IDA terms). Mizoram advised GO1that if the state does not get the
on-lending from GO1under the 90% grant, 10% Credit terms, the state will not be able to
afford the additional financing, and therefore, will not be able to complete the project.
GO1informedthe Bankthat under domestic rules andprocedures, Mizoram could benefit
from receiving the additional financing under the previous 90% grant, 10% Credit terms
if the additional financing was made available not as a separatehew Credit but as an
extension o f the current IDA Credit.

19.    The Bank Management reviewedthe waiver request and approved the waiver on
January 5,2007.

I.FinancialTermsandConditionsfortheAdditionalFinancing

20.    The financial terms and conditions for the additional financing would remain as
the same as that o f the original Credit. The original Credit is a standard Credit with 35
years o f maturity, including 10 years grace period and contractual commitment fee equal
to 0.5%.

21.    The original Credit was declared effective on June 3, 2002. The additional
financing will be processed as an amendment o f the original Development Credit
Agreement under the original General Conditions rather than as a new Credit to enable
amortizationo f additional financing into amortizationo fthe original Credit.

22.    There are no project specific conditions to effectiveness.

             Annex 3: CostBenefitAnalysis for Contractswith Cost Escalation

  3.1.    Revised cost-benefit analyses have been carried out for the four contracts (Ml,
 M5 andUpgradingRoad Phase Iand Phase 11)whose costs have increased substantially
 due to the reasons cited before. The methodology followed for the economic evaluation
 for these contracts was same as used at the appraisal, Indian Road Congress SP-30 for
 estimating VOC and speed under different road condition and width. The cost o f
 construction and the input parameters used for the analyses were updated to the current
 year since the prices o f POL has increased significantly inthe last 2-3 years.

 3.2.     The results o f the economic analysis are summarized in the table below. The
 results indicate that the increased investments on these contracts are economically
 justified despite cost increases. Inthe case o f contracts for upgrading, though the cost
 have increased by 32% over the cost at appraisal, the overall economic rate o f return has
 increased mainly due to larger unit savings inVOC as a result o f increased prices o f fuel
 and more than 50% increase intraffic as compared to the forecasted traffic at the time o f
 appraisal. Also, the traffic on the parallel NHwhich i s about 67 km longer has increased
 to 2.2 times o f the estimated traffic and this has resulted in larger savings from diverted
 traffic.

 3.3.     The results for M1 and M 5 are quite in line with the appraisal document for
 economic analysis. For maintenance roads, the switching value for cost was 45.1% for
 the total component and inreality the total cost for maintenance has not increased by this
 amount. Also, since the unit savings have gone up because o f increases in the fuel cost,
 the results are better than would have been otherwise. For the maintenance o f roads, the
 traffic estimated at the time o f appraisal andthe current traffic are quite similar.
