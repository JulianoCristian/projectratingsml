1. INTRODUCTION
1.1.   OVERVIEW
The Mizorom State Roads Project (MSRP) is being prepared and implemented by the
Mizoram Public Works Department (MPWD) with World Bank (WB) assistance. Phase I
of the project is under construction following appraisal by the Bcnk in 2002. The
project preparation for Phase ll is underway since fate 2001. A consortium], acting as
Project Co-ordinating   Consultants (PCC). is assisting the MPWD       during- project
preparation. Their inputs will continue (in 1imited capacities) throughout the project
duration. in addition, MPWD will also hire the services of a Construction Supervision
Consultant as the Engineer for the implementation along similar lines as Phase 1. Like
all Category 'A' transport projects funded by the World Bank, MSRP is subject to an
lndependent Environmental Review2. This Environmental Impact Assessment and its
companion reports, covering the activities to be carried out in Phase 11, have been
scrutinized during the IER. These reports are now updated addressing the observations
made during the Review.
1.2.   PHASE tl ACTIVITIES IN MSRP
Phase 11 of MSRP endeavours to complete the enhanced connectivity of two of the
most important cities in Mizoram - Aizawl and Lunglei, initiated in Phase 1. Upgradation
of the MPWD's old Aizowl - Lunglei road will reduce the distance by 65km when
compared to NH 54. A new alignment bypassing Aizawl city from the east will
connect NH 54 near Zemabawk to the state highway near chainage 4.5km. In
addition, 230-km of existing state highways will also undergo major maintenance.
Table 1-1 summarises the works to be undertaken during Phase 11 of MSRP. These
routes are also shown in Figure 1.1.

1.2.1. Major Maintenance Component
As part of Phase II activities under MSRP, several existing roads are covered under the
major maintenance programme. The improvement works would mainly include:
*   Pavement improvement treatment.
*   Upgrading existing earthen roads to gravel roads
*   Repair of bridges
*   Repair and / or reconstruction of culverts
*   Improvement of side drains
*   Slope protection works at potential landslide sites
*   Provision of important signs. like regulatory and warning signs at hazardous locations, and
other design features to improve the safety and comfort of travel.
Depending on the present conditions, different levels of treatment have been
proposed for shorter stretches within the entire length. These are categorised as:
*   Category 1.: Resurfacing at locations of moderate surface distress
*   Category 2: Resurfacing and construction of base course over the existing pavement at
locations of acute base and surface distress
*   Category 3: Rebuilding of pavement from subgrade upwards at locations of complete
pavement failure
Table 1-2 summarises the proposed improvements for the major maintenance
component in Phase II of MRSP. Figure 1-1 shows the routes selected for the major
maintenance component.

2. DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED ROADS
2.1.  M2: KANHMUN - ZAMUANG - TUILUTKAWN ROAD 92.40 KM
This is an inter-state road linking Mizoram with Tripura, Assam and leads further to Indo
- Bangladesh border. This road running almost north-south is divided into two sections
as described below:
2.1.1. Kanhmun-Zamuang Section
Kanhmun town, the northern end of M2, is situated very close to the border state of
Tripura and Assam. The road passes through three villages - Morawi, Borai and
Thuampui. There are 12 nos. of bridges on this section of the road. There is a sand
quarry at km 18.375 on the bank of the river Langkaih from where the sand is taken to
other places for construction purposes. The bituminous surface of the road is in very
poor condition. The carriageway width of paved section is about 3 m and formation
width is 4.0 m. The condition of the road surface is generally very poor with potholes,
cracks and other signs of pavement distress. Existing culverts (81 nos.) are practically
not functioning and a number of additional culverts are required. Side drainage is
practically non-existent.
2.1.2. Zamuang - Tuilutkawn Section
This section of the road starts from Zamuang on Bairobi - Zamuang - Kanhmun road,
and ends at junctions of West Phaileng and West Kawnpui roads. It has a length of
60.90 km. It is a bituminous road with an average pavement width of 3.5 m having a
formation width of 4.4 m. Condition of the pavement is generally poor. It connects the
villages Rengdil (km 35.615), Kawrthah (km 44.300), Tuidam (km 23.000).
Kawrtethawveng (km 64.075), W. Bunghmun (km 73.160) and Serhmun (km 80.700).
Major and Minor landslides have been reported to occur at chainage 39.980. 41.50,
51.200, 69.835, 88.240 and near the site of stone quarry at km 65.180. The existing cross
drainage channels are inadequate and additional culverts (42 nos.) identified based
on hydrological considerations are proposed to be constructed. In the southern most
stretch, the route passes through the Dampa Tiger Reserve for approximately 1 Okm.

2.2.  M6 ZOBAWK - HAULAWNG ROAD 29.70 KM
This road starts from Aizawl - Lunglei Project priority road P1 B at Haulawng and meets
NH-54 at Zobawk. It connects the villages of Zotui (km 9.720), Chengpui (km 13.370)
and Ralvawng (km 22.040). It passes through hilly terrain negotiating steep g7rodients
and sharp curves at many places. It is an earthen road, except for about first 800 m
bituminous surfaced section in poor condition. The average formation width is 4.2 m.
The slopes are unstable and landslides reportedly have occurred at kms 15.625,
16.065, 16.9 and 18.330. The existing roadside drainage is inadequate. There are 27
existing culverts, most of which are in need of repair. About 43 new culverts will have
to be constructed to improve the cross drainage system. It has been decided to pave
this road with bituminous surface to a width of 3.0 m single lane standard so that it
can be properly maintained since this road is located in a high rainfall area.

2.3.  M15 SERCHHIP-THENZAWL-THENHLUM ROAD       97.70 KM
This road measuring a length of 97.70 km starts from the town of Serchhip on NH-54
and ends at Thenhlum. It has been recently included in the project under the
package of Major Maintenance Roads Phase -11.
The road passes through major towns of Thenzawl, (km 20.00), Buarpui (km 62.08),
W.Bungtlang (km 76.300), Changpui (km 89.96) and Thenhlum (km 101.313). At
present, the road from km 82.938 to 105.975 is being maintained by Border Roads Task
Force (BRTF) and will be taken over by PWD shortly. The portion of the road from km
15.157 to 23.450 is common with Priority Road PlA, which is being upgraded under
Phase - 1, and therefore the net length of the road is only 97.68 km. The road passes
through a hilly terrain negotiating sharp curves and steep gradients at many places.
The road has a bituminous surface having an average carriageway width of 3.5 m
and formation width of 6.0 m upto km 14.00. Beyond km 14.00, the road has an
average carriageway width of 3.2 m and formation width of 4.5 m. The road has
several unstable slopes and major and minor landslides have occurred at many
locations.

The existing culverts (361 nos.) are inadequate, thus resulting in poor drainage. The
existing culverts require extensive repairs and 44 nos. of new culverts are proposed to
improve the drainage system. There are two single lane bailey bridges on this road
across Mat and Tlawng rivers at km 13.193 and km 45.100 respectively which have to
be maintained. There are two small stone quarries at km 80.775 and 92.300. One
crusher exists at km 12.70.

2.4.  M 16: SELESIH -THUAMPUI ROAD- 12.0 KM
This road starts from Kawnpui - Lungdai Aizawl Road at Selesih and after passing
through Southern part of Durtlang town at a distance of 5.0 km, it meets NH - 54 at
Thuampui, a suburb of capital city of Aizawl. Heavy traffic is observed on Kawnpui -
Lungdai - Aizawl road as most of the buses & cars between Kawnpui & Aizawl take
this shorter route (45 km) instead of following NH - 54 (64 KM). The commercial
vehicles do not prefer to follow this route because of very steep gradient between
Selesih - Durtlang - Aizawl and as such to ease the gradient an alternative road from
Selesih to Thuampui near Aizawl passing through southern part of Durtlang has been
considered for major maintenance. This alternative road is almost at level gradient
and very good for plying commercial vehicles. The road has a bituminous surface and
has a single lane carriageway having an average width of 3.0 m and formation width
of 4.5 m. The condition of the pavement is generally bad. Adequate side and cross
drains are required. The road alignment passes through hilly terrain with unstable
slopes and many potential landslide sites. There are also two small stone quarries
along this road. The road once it is fully maintained will serve as a main highway

3. SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
The works in major maintenance are to be confined to the existing bench. Hence, the
environmental impacts would be for less than the upgradation component.
Therefore, the depth of analysis for this component has been limited. However, two
corridors Kanhmun - Tuilutkawn (M2) and Haulawng - Zobawk (M6) require greater
care from the environmental angle than others. These concerns are being mentioned
here for the Contractors' appreciation of the importance attached to them oy the
PIU. It is expected that the Contractor(s) will execute the works in these corridors in a
manner which is becoming of such an endeavour.
The concern with M2 route is two-fold. The entire route lies in the overlap of riverine
reserve forests of two rivers - the Tut and the Langkai. Moreover, the southern end of
the corridor passes through the Dampa Tiger Reserve for approximately 10km. Thus,
while the entire route passes through a sensitive area, there is also a protected area
through which the road passes. The Indian Wildlife Board, chaired by Prime Minister of
India, has decided not to allow any road improvements in the Wildlife Sanctuaries
and National Parks. Only road maintenance is allowed within such areas. While the
project is for maintenance, it is clarified that Category IlIl treatment (Rebuilding of
pavement from subgrade upwards) will not be allowed in the stretch of the route
passing through Dampa Tiger Reserve. The Contractor will submit the exact chainage
of the location after consulting the local forest officers, and carrying out joint
inspection with them as necessary, to the PIU. No civil works in this stretch of 10Km are
to be carried out unless approved by the PIU. The Contractor will start the work in this
stretch only after the approval has been accorded.
The issues relating to the M6 route arise from the proposed treatment. The currently
earthen (except first 800m stretch, which too is dilapidated) road will be converted to
a bituminous road. Siting of the hot-mix plant, the crushing plant and other ancillary
units needs to comply with the letter and spirit of the major maintenance component.
Storage of material of construction on site, especially within or close to settlements, is
also a concern.
Other than these, no significant adverse impacts are anticipated due to the major
maintenance component. These are summarised in the following paragraphs:
3.1.  LAND
No hillside cutting is envisaged and therefore large volume of earthwork is not
expected as part of the major maintenance component. The impacts on land will
therefore be limited to locations identified as vulnerable to slides (see Chapter 2). No
loss of additional topsoil is envisaged. Since the scope of the works is restricted, use of
resources such as rock for gravel, bitumen for surfacing, etc. is not expected to be
considerable.

;MizOrom Stote Roods Project Phase-It
ERMP for Maintenance roads. June 2003
3.2.  WATER RESOURCES
Confining the works within the existing formation will ensure that there will be no loss of
water source during the major maintenance along any route. Therefore, no
permanent impact on water quantity would occur. Protection of water quality in the
many watercourses that intersect the project corridors needs to be addressed early in
each package. However, with the adequate protection measures built into the
project, the impact will be minimal. Any accidental loss of a roadside water source
needs to be compensated as stipulOted in a later section.
3.3.  AIR QUALITY
Since no cutting of hillside is going to take place, the degradation of air quality will be
a,concern for receptors in the vicinit; of the location of construction plants only.
Localised air pollution may occur during the laying of the profile correction course.
Therefore, air quality impacts are not likely to be significant.
3.4.  NOISE
Only temporary increase in noise levels is anticipated because of movement of
construction vehicles and equipment. No significant increase in noise levels is
expected.
3.5.  FLORA
The loss of flora in the vicinity of bench for the road cannot be ruled out. Even the
conscious removal of vegetation from the road itself (where growth of grass and
plants in the median has been observed along some roads in the state) may be
required for maintaining the road. The contractor can be asked to carry out an
inventory of roadside flora to ensure prevention of loss of any important species.
3.6.  FAUNA
No impacts on fauna are anticipated with the management plan in place for the
maintenance activities. Except for M2, there are no ecologically important areas
close to any other routes. Therefore, the impacts of major maintenance on fauna are
expected to be limited.
3.7.  SOCIAL IMPACTS
The construction activities are expected to be confined to the existing clear road
width only. Therefore, it is assumed that no private or community asset will be
impacted during the execution of major maintenance. More specifically, even if such
structures are encountered, the activities will be carried out so that these are not
impacted. There shall be no land acquisition and the traffic movement will be within
the constricted width available. None of the roadside utilities, such as electricity lines,

telephone lines or water pipelines will be affected. If any of the resources/assets
mentioned in the foregoing discussion are likely to impacted, the compensation and
mitigation shall follow the R&R Policy adopted for MSRP (Salient features of the policy
are described in Annexure 1). Unforeseen impacts and mitigation measures that need
to be applied before the construction can proceed further are provided in the next
section. It will therefore be incumbent upon the Contractor to verify that (s)he is
handed over the site free of all encumbrances.

4. MITIGATION AND MANAGEMENT OF IMPACTS
The anticipated impacts, even though limited, will be mitigated following the
guidance provided this chapter. Before the start of construction in any of the
corridors, the Contractor will survey the entire stretch. During the survey, in addition to
the road inventory, a list of environmental resources and/or social assets close to the
road will also be compiled. This list will be submitted to the Divisional Officer(s) acting
as the Engineer who will verify the possible extent of impacts on these sensitive
receptors before according their approval to beginning of construction. The
guidance in this chapter is in line with the Standard Specifications for Construction of
Roads and Bridges (Fourth Revision), published by Ministry of Road Transport and
Highways, Government of India.
The pre-construction activities need not be in sequence but it is expected that the
construction stage activities will broadly follow the sequence of Table 4-1. During the
post-construction stage, demobilisation and operation may again follow the
Contractors' own plan. Since most of the activities that have noticeable adverse
environmental impacts are to occur within the time of Contractors' presence on site,
focus of this plan is on Construction Phase.
In the post-construction or operation phase, the environmental impacts are not
envisaged as significant and the only inputs that may be required on the
environmental issues are monitoring at specified intervals (see Environmental
Monitoring Plan) at locations identified by the Engineer (DO's MPWD), during the
course of the construction activities.

5. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
Implementation of Phase 11 major maintenance component of MSRP will be the
responsibility of MPWD. Its Divisional Officers will act as Engineer on stretches of roads
within their respective jurisdictions. The actual execution of the works will be entrusted
to a Contractor selected through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) process. MPWD
will also procure the services of a Quality Assurance Consultant for this component.
While The powers of measurement and sanction remain with the DO, the QA
consultant is expected to provide expert advice on many technical aspects including
environmental protection and social issues.
Since the Kanhmun - Tuilutkawn (M2) corridor passes through Dampa Tiger Reserve
towards its southern end for nearly 10 km, it is suggested to avoid maintenance works
in this stretch or atleast Type Ill treatment that envisages building the road subgrade
upwards be avoided in this section of M2. Any work to be undertaken in this stretch
should be with written permission of the MPWD. This is reflected in the ERMP. Moreover,
the Zobawk - Haulawng road (M6) is being converted from its current earthen
condition to a blacktopped road. Therefore, the levels of impact are anticipated to
be higher on this particular stretch. The QA consultants need to be aware of these
special requirements. It is expected that like Phase 1, there will be provision for
Environmental staff as part of the QA consultants' ToR so that these issues are
accorded due importance.
5.1.  REPORTING SYSTEM
A streamlined environmental reporting system put into the ERMP will provide important
feedback in terms of the quality of work and adherence to the proposed programme
to all concerned - DO at Field offices who act as Engineer, PIU, MPWD and WB.
Quarterly reports in formats attached to the ERMP will ensure that the data is
compiled on each important aspect and available to suggest any improvements,
which will enhance benefits of the project. The PIU will be responsible for setting the
targets for the various activities anticipated during construction phase in consultation
with their field offices and obtaining agreement from the Contractor after mobilization
but before beginning of works on site. The contractor will report from then on
regarding the status on each of these to the DO. The PIU will monitor the activities
through its own staff or the QA's Environmental Specialist after it has obtained the
Contractor report with DO's remarks on it during the construction phase. During the
operation phase. the supervision as well as reporting responsibilities will lie with the PIU.
The items selected include:
e Facilities at construction camps
* Sites for dumping excess hill cuttings
* Pollution monitoring for air. nois.e cnd water at locations specified in the ERMP

The capacity building as part of major maintenance component has been integrated into the
overall MSRP institutional strengthening by providing the same training as that for the upgradation
component. The Supervision Consultant for the upgradation component or Quality Assurance
Consultant will provide additional hands-on environmental training to MPWD Divisional Office staff
as well as workmen of the Contractor selected for major maintenance.

6. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
The primary purpose of the Environmentcl Monitoring Plans is to ensure thot the
environmental objectives set during project preporotion are being consistently
achieved during project implementation. The formulation of an appropriate
environmental monitoring plan and its diligent implementation are key to overall
success in the major maintenance component. The results of the monitoring plan will
provide vital information to intluence decision-making during construction and
operation stages. It is expected to provide information regarding the effectiveness of
the mitigation and enhancement measures proposed within the ERMP and suggests
further actions that need to be taken to achieve the desired results. Monitoring
includes:
* Visual observations;
 Selection of environmental parameters at specific locations;
* Sampling and regular testing of these parameters.
6.1. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the Environmental monitoring plan are:
& Evaluation of the efficiency of mitigation and enhancement measures:
* Updating of the actions and impacts of baseline data:
a Adoption of additional mitigation measures if the present measures are insufficient:
* Generating the data, which may be incorporated in environmental management plan in
future projects.
6.2. METHODOLOGY
Monitoring methodology covers the following key aspects:
* Components to be monitored;
a Parameters for monitoring of the above components:
* Monitoring frequency;
* Monitoring standards;
* Responsibilities for monitoring;
* Direct responsibility;
* Monitoring costs.
Environmental monitoring of the parameters involved, threshold limits and frequency
as well as location of monitoring are presented in Table 6.1.

7. ENVIRONMENTAL BUDGET
The budget for environmental managemnent measures for the major maintenance
component is provided in Table 7-1. It does not include any training budget since this
aspect is integrated with the upgradation component. Several environmental issues,
such as culvert maintenance and repairs. landslide protection measures have been
included in the proposed trealment as part of the Engineering costs (see Chapter 1).
Some environmental protection measures are incidental to the works and the
Contractor needs to account for them within his, costs - such as provision of sprinkling
water to reduce dust nuisance. The total budget is around Rs. 3 million.

Mizoram State Highway
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy
1.0   INTRODUCTION
1.1   The State Government of Mizorom (GOM), through Public Works Department
(PWD) has proposed to implemeni the state highways project. The objective of
the project is to improve, widen and upgrade the roads and provide a
framework and guidelines for resettlement and rehabilitation of the project
affected people.
1.2   This Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy describes the principles and
approach to be followed in minimizing and mitigating negative social and
economic impacts caused by the project.
2.0   BROAD PRINCIPLES
2.1   Involuntary resettlement is an integral part of Mizoram State Highway Project
and will be dealt with at the early stages of the project. The guidelines extend
to Mizoram State Highway Projects for Resettlement and Rehabilitation of the
Project Affected Persons and assistance in re-establishing their homes and
livelihoods. The broad principles of the R & R Policy are as below:
a involuntary resettlement shall be avoided to the extent possible or minimized where
feasible, exploring all viable alternative project designs.
* Where displacement is unavoidable, people losing assets, livelihood or other
resources shall be assisted in improving or at a minimum regaining their former
status of living at no cost to themselves.
* People's participation shall be undertaken in planning and implementation of the
project.
2.2   The project will broadly have three impacts that require mitigation measures.
They are:
* Loss of assets, including land and house
* Loss of livelihood or income opportunities
a Collective impacts on groups, such as loss of common property resources.
The first two categories represent direct project impacts on an identified
population. The people likely to be affected by the project will be surveyed
and registered, and project monitoring, and evaluation will compare longer-
term impacts against baseline socio-economic data.
The third category represents a group impact. where group members need not
be individually surveyed. Gains and losses of a group-oriented nature are not
quantifiable in terms of impact on the individual. Mitigation and support

=RMP for tvlCnt.enonce roocs. .nnexures. June 2G03
mechanisms will be collectively oriented, and the monitoring will focus on
impact on such groups.
2.3   All acquisition of private land would be under the Land Acquisition
(Amendment) Act, 1984, which provides for compensation for the properties to
be acquired. Further support will be extended under the broad principles of
the policy to meet the replacement value of the assets.
2.4   The common property resources will be replaced as far as feasible and
assistance will be provided of replacement value to the group.
2.5   Major widening and strengthening work planned will take place within the
ROW, which will be based on IRC requirements, or as agreed with the PWD
based on land availability, gradient, traffic and congestion of population
along the road length. However, major land acquisition and many impacts are
perhaps not foreseen except at locations where existing alignment may
involve shifting to accommodate bypasses, geo-metrics and other cost
effective improvements. Efforts will be made during implementation to
minimise any disturbance in the daily activities of the local populace.
2. 6  Before disposition, all compensation, Resettlement & Rehabilitation and related
activities will be accomplished as for as possible in accordance with this policy.
2.7   It would be seen that there are no / minimum adverse social, economic and
environmental effects due to the project and construction related activities on
communities and specific measures would be provided in the RAP wherever
this happens. Budgetary and other provisions will be kept whenever and
wherever such uhforeseen impacts are noticed.
2.8   All land acquisition will be after harvest of crop.

be undertaken. This will help in assessing the magnitude of displacement, losses
to be sustained by PDPs and PAPs, better targeting of vulnerable groups,
ascertaining the cost of R & R, preparing the rehabilitation package and
institutional arrangements.
6.1.2 The social impact assessment will consist of two surveys namely:
(a)   Census survey of 100 % PAPs.
(b)   A baseline socio-economic survey of 25% of PAPs.
6.1.3 Surveys will be used to prepare the Social strip maps indicating land and structures
along the road stretches and collect baseline information on common resources.
6.1.4 The base line survey will be completed prior to the date of notification under
section 4, sub-sectionr (1 j of LAA. If decicration is not issued within the s:ipuloted
