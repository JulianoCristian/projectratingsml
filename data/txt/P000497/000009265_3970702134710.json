rehabilitation project\n            for Chad has two distinct objectives for rehabilitating the\n            agricultural sector and accelerating development in the wake\n            of a devastating civil war (1979-82) and a debilitating\n            drought (1984). First, it would improve coordination through\n            the development of key rural institutions and the emergency\n            rehabilitation of productive facilities in the rural sector.\n            Improved coordination would be achieved through\n            institutional development of such key services as the\n            Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. This would be\n            accomplished by providing resident experts, consulting\n            services, vehicles and equipment. The emergency\n            rehabilitation of productive facilities would involve\n            re-establishing and developing immediately productive\n            facilities in the rural sector, both for public sector\n            enterprises and for key rural development services. Second,\n            for the long term, this project would enhance the\n            Government's ability to guide agricultural planning and\n            development by implementing pilot actions to establish\n            optimum approaches in rural development and by carrying out\n            key sub-sector studies. Pilot actions to be initiated, for\n            example, would include testing new technologies for\n            expanding food crop production and water resource maintenance."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
