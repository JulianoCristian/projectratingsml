The project\n            implementation period was consistent with the original\n            five-year execution plan, but with a six-month delay in\n            credit effectiveness and a three-month extension in credit\n            closing. However, due to a slower than expected disbursement\n            schedule, total project costs represented about 80 percent\n            of original estimates, leaving a canceled balance. Key\n            factors responsible for this slow disbursement were: (1)\n            delays in procurement decisions due to Government heavy and\n            inefficient procedures for approving annual project\n            activities and budgets; and (b) inadequate provision of\n            local counterpart fund due to misinterpretation by\n            Government of the required level of local counterpart fund,\n            lead to a suspension of disbursements under the special\n            account for one year."}, "docdt": "1993-08-06T00:00:00Z"}
