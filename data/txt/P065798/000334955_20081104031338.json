Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) a longer time-frame should be\n            considered for protected area (PA)/natural resource\n            management projects with a capacity-building focus; 2)\n            adequate attention to monitoring and evaluation design,\n            implementation and utilization is important for every\n            operation, but is essential for a learning and innovation\n            loan where it facilitates the testing of the learning\n            hypothesis. Hypotheses should be framed to ensure PA\n            management effectiveness (including internal and external\n            over-sight); 3) a strategic approach should be adopted to\n            the development of institutional capacity; 4) investments\n            should be made early in counterpart implementation capacity\n            and such limitations should inform project design; and 5)\n            large firms can bring consistency and stability but can be\n            expensive and contribute little to local capacity and\n            project leadership. Individual technical assistance (TA)\n            contracts give flexibility and cost effectiveness, but can\n            be difficult to manage and can create problems with\n            continuity of key messages and programs. Appropriately\n            balancing these options contributes to the efficiency,\n            effectiveness and sustainability of technical inputs."}, "docdt": "2008-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
