of\n            Cambodia's natural resources, particularly its mountain\n            forest ecosystems, through the improvement of the Ministry\n            of Environment's capacity to plan, implement, and\n            monitor effectively, the National Protected Areas. The\n            components call for: 1) national policy, and capacity\n            building activities, to initiate the Ministry of Environment\n            in developing its strategy, for the National Protected Areas\n            system. Financing would include a comprehensive review of\n            its current management systems, and implementation of ranger\n            training programs. Sustainable financing will be included\n            for the formulation of the entire protected areas systems,\n            as well as for the development of management planning\n            guidelines. Legal and regulatory constraints will be\n            reviewed, and public awareness reinforced, through related\n            educational programs; 2) support of basic management needs,\n            through park infrastructure financing, management planning,\n            and staff development programs. The financing includes\n            community education, and, outreach programs for park\n            protection activities; 3) community development in park\n            management, conducting natural resource and social\n            assessments, for better livelihood practices; and, 4)\n            project management, to support the overall work program, and\n            financial management."}, "docdt": "2000-01-10T00:00:00Z"}
