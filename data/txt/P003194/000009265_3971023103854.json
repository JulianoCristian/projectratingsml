{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Coffee Project\n            for Zambia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it is\n            important for export-based agricultural enterprises to have\n            the best available technology to ensure quality, and to have\n            sound marketing strategies. Access to credit greatly\n            facilitates the acquisition of technology. Lack of access to\n            credit was a major reason for the limited progress of the\n            smallholder component. However, financing for smallholders\n            needs to be addressed as part of the broader issue of rural\n            finance, and may include elements such as out grower schemes\n            for cash crops and input credit through stockiest and\n            processors. Industry-based institutions such as the Zambia\n            Coffee Board are more likely to be effective on a\n            sustainable basis than public sector institutions with a\n            similar purpose."}, "docdt": "1997-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
