IRAN: THIRD HIGIGWAY PROJECT
Summary
i.        The Government of Iran has asked the Bank for a loan of US$32 millicn
equivalent to finance the foreign exchange cost of a road project consisting of
construction, improvement and paving of 1,680 km. of highways as well as the
engineering and supervision of field works. The project is part of the Govern-
ment's Third Five-Year Economic Development Plan and will be the Bank's third
road loan to Iran.
ii.       The previous two Bank loans of $72.0 million and $18.5 million res-
pectively helped finance road projects which included construction and improve-
ment of some 3,700 km. of main roads, or one-fifth of the country's highway
network. The Bank's financial assistance was also instrumental in introducing
into the country improved methods of road construction and a more efficient
organization.
iii.      The project includes construction and irnprovement of three roads
(1,450 km.) in the country's southeast, central and northeast regions and
paving of the arterial highwqay between Tehran and the Caspian region (230 km.).
iv.       The total cost of the project is US$90.0 million, including US$5.2
million for the cost of engineering and supervision. The cost estimates are
based partly on final engineering and partly on preliminary surveys, and are
therefore subject to possible variation when the final engineering is completed
on all roads, but an allowance of 20 percent included in the estimate should
suffice to meet such contingency. The designs and specifications are satis-
factory. The foreign cost components are 35 percent of the construction cost
and 50 percent of the engineering and supervision costs. The local currency
cost of the project will be provided by the Plan Organization (P.O.) out of
its development budget.
v.        The execution of the project would be the immediate responsibility
of the Ministry of Roads under the financial and technical control of the P.O.
The field works would be supervised by qualified consultants. The contracts
would be awarded to local and/or foreign contractors on the basis of unit
prices and international competitive bidding.
vi.       The maintenance of roads is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Roads. Its maintenance budget will be increased and a special fund will be
established for renewal of maintenance equipment and purchase of spare parts.
vii.      The project is economically justified by savings in transportation
costs.  In addition, the project will stimulate agricultural, industrial and
mining development in the affected regions.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for a loan of US$32 million for
a period of 25 years, including a 4½-year period of grace.



I. INTPODUCTION
1.        The Government of Iran has asked the Bank for a loan of US$32 million
equivalent to finance the foreign exchange cost of a road project consisting of
construction, improvement and paving of 1,680 km. of highways. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$90,0 million equivalent.
2.        The project is part of the Government's overall investment programn for
roads planned for execution during the Third Five-Year Plan Period from 1962-
1967. The project would be the third highway loan to Iran. The first loan of
$72.0 million, 227-IRN, was signed in May 1959, and the second, $18.5 million,
381-IRN, in June 1964.
3.        The appraisal of the project is based on feasibility studies and,
partly, final engineering undertaken by consulting firms under the Bank's first
road loan and on the findings of a Banlc Mission which visited Iran in August-
September 1964.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
4.        Iran's territory of more than 630,000 square miles is larger than the
combined total area of Italy, Spain, France and Great Britain. About 90 percent
of the land area consists of deserts and high mountains with inhabited areas
scattered throughout the country. The vast size of the country and the
scattered population make transportation costly and, consequently, many import-
ant sections of the country are not adequately served.
5.        About 70 percent of the total population of 21 million reside in
rural areas, engaging in production of staple crops, mainly wheat, and live-
stock raising. The agricultural yields are generally low due to antiquated
farming methods, little application of fertilizers and scarcity of water. A
systematic development of water resources for irrigation has begun only recently.
6.        The relatively small industrial sector of the economy is based mainly
on agricultural raw materials. Important industries include textile, sugar
refining, cement, chemicals, tobacco, vegetable oils and fertilizers. Cotton
textile and cement production generally meet the total domestic demand.
7.        The mainstay of Iran's economy is petroleum which presently produces
an annual revenue of about $400 million to the Government.  Iran accounts for
over 20 percent of the Middle East oil output.
B. Modes of Transportation
8.        The main transport media in Iran, besides pipelines for oil, are roads
and railways with air transport playing a supplementary role.  The road networlk
consists of about 6,100 km. of asphalted roads, of which 1,200 km. are under
construction, 16,000 km. of gravel roads and about 12,000 km. of dirt roads and
tracks. The railroad has about 3,600 km. of track. A pipeline from Abadan to
Tehran and the vicinity conveys the oil products consumed in and around the
country's capital.



- 2 -
9.        The Gulf ports of Khorramshahr and Bandar Shapur are the principal
gateways of Iran's foreign trade. A new port is under construction in Baridar
Abbas in the southeast. Iihen the port construction is completed in 1967, a
part of the general cargo traffic of the Khorramshalhr port will be diverted to
the new port to relieve the congestion in the former port. The airports in
Tehran and Abadan accomnodate international as well as local flights. Other
principal airports for local traffic are located at Isfahan, Shiraz, Kerman,
Meshed and Tabriz.
10.       The railway is operated by the Iranian State Railways, a subdivision
of the Ministry of Roads and Communications.   The principal line extends from
the Gulf ports of Khorramshahr and Bandar Shapur to Tehran and further to Bandar
Shah on the Caspian Sea (Trans-Iranian Line). iMeshed in the northeast and
Tabriz and Julfa in the northwest are also connected with Tehran by rail. At
Julfa the railway is linked, by transshipment, with that of the U.S.S.R.   A
140 kmi. extension beginning near Tabriz towards the Turkish border is under con-
struction to provide a connection with the Turkish railway system.
11.       Railway freight traffic is composed mainly of petroleum products,
Government's imports of bulk commodities and general merchandise. The main
part of the railway freight revenue is derived from the operation of the north-
south Trans-Iranian Line, on which most of the traffic is from south to north.
12.       Both freight and passenger traffic, which had been growing steadily
until recently, have begun to decline somewhat. The railway is today in keen
competition with road and pipeline transport. Although, with the expansion of
the road network and the resultant growth of highway transport services, the
Government would eventually have to take measures to regulate road transport
to coordinate with the railway operation, the presently available indications
do not suggest that the railway is faced with unfair competition from road
transport. The principal and immediate measures that will have to be taken in
Iran to realize a better coordination between road and railway transport appear
to be the improvement of railway's operating efficiency and organizational
changes that will enable the railway to operate as a business enterprise.
13.       The organization and operation of the railway need to be improved if
it is to compete with road transport. The railway is today heavily overstaffed
and its equipment is less than fully utilized. The lack of authority by the
railway's management to adjust tariff rates causes loss of even the long-
distance traffic to highway transport. The railway management is acutely
aware of these problems, and the Government has been considering a streamlining
program, but no step has yet been taken.
III. THE HIGHWJAY SYSTEM
A. Recent Developments
1h.       During the past five years the Iranian Government has undertaken an
extensive road development program, which was assisted by the two previous Bank
loans.
15.       The first Bank project financed the construction and improvement of



- 3 -
roads connecting the Tehran region with the ports in the south, the Caspian
littoral region and the southwestern region bordering Iraq. The project which
is now complete, added some 2,500 km. of modern paved roads to the country's
highway network. Together with about 2,400 km. of roads reconstructed or
improved by the Ministry of Roads, the 4,900 km. of paved roads form the vital
arterial highways serving the most important and productive regions of the
country. The economic impacts of this project are discussed in paragraphs 47
through 51.
16.       The Second Road Project included the reconstruction of about 1,200 km.
more of main roads, the most important of which being the main trunk-road to
the northwest from Takestan through Tabriz to Bazargan on the Turkish border,
traversing the rich agricultural region of Azerbaijan. When the Second Project
is completed, some 6,100 km., or about one-third of the country's main road
network, will have been improved to modern highway standards.
B. Road Organization and Finance
17.       The Plan Organization (P.O.) is the Government agency responsible for
planning and execution of development projects including road construction.
The immediate responsibility for road construction and maintenance, however, is
in the Hands of the Ministry of Roads under the law go-verning the Third Five-
Year Plan. The P.O., nevertheless, continues to be responsible for planning,
design and survey, and retains control of project funds.
18.       The performance of the Ministry of Roads as the executing agency of
road works is satisfactory. Foreign consultants for supervision of field works
are now under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. There is close cooperation
between the Ministry and the consultants, and relations between the P.O. and
the Ministry are also satisfactory.
19.       The Ministry has organized a special division which deals exclusively
with the execution of road projects financed by the P.O. and supervised by the
consultants. A revolving credit, established by the P.O. in behalf of the
Ministry, is used to pay contractors and consultants. The payments are made
promptly.
20.       Road construction is financed by the P.O. from its development budget
whiich is made up of a part of the Government's oil revenue as prescribed by the
Third Plan Law. The cost of road maintenance is met by the M4inistry of Road's
annual budget. Taxes collected from users of roads, such as fuel tax and import
tariff on vehicles and parts, become part of the Government's general revenue.
As no consistent record is available on these tax receipts, it is difficult to
estimate the contribution of road users toward the costs of road construction
and maintenance.  The fuel tax collected in recent years is estimated at about
Rls. 2.5 billion per annum (US$33 million).   No estimate is available of the
tax receipts on imports of vehicles and parts.   But it does not appear likely
that the total collection from all these sources of revenue can cover the
capital as well as maintenance costs of the country's road system. There is
however room for increasing the levels of taxes on diesel oil and imports of
vehicles and parts.



-h -
C. Maintenance of Roads
21.       The maintenance division within the Ministry of Roads has been
strengthened during the past few years and its operations improved substan-
tially. The set-up of its central and regional organizations is good. Branch
Offices and modern repair shops have been established in each province (Ostan).
The improved maintenance organization and operation are due largely to the
assistance given by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads (B.P.R.) which since 1958
acted as advisor to the M5inistry. Funds for mechanizing maintenance operations
were made available in several U. S. Exitr-Bank loans over the last five years.
22.       Although further improvement of maintenance operation is both desir-
able and necessary, the basic organization now exists and the roads are for the
most part adequately maintained. The annual budgetary allocation for mainten-
ance has been gradually increased and is now about Rls. 700 million (see Table
1). This amount, mainly devoted to payment of salaries and operating costs of
equipment on routine maintenance is still insufficient and should be increased,
particularly because the rapidly developing traffic on the new roads will soon
require increased periodic road maintenance. In addition, a special fund
should be created for renewal of equipment and supply of spare parts. Estab-
lishment of such a fund is under consideration by the P.O. During negotiations
these matters were discussed with the Govern.ment and assurances were obtained
on the implementation of the necessary measures.
IV. THE; PROJECT
A. Description of the Project
23.       The project consists of the construction, improvement and paving of
about 1,680 km. of main roads in the northeast and south of the country. The
designation and the length of the roads included in the project are as follows:
1. Sirjan-Kerman                       =        170 km.
2. Nain-Kerman                         =        540 km.
3. Shahpasand-Meshed-Afghan Border     =        740 km.
4. Tehran-Rudehen                      =55 km.
5. Rudehen-Amol-Babol                  =        175 km.
Total              1,680 km.
24.       The Sirjan-Kerman road is a part of the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road
which will become the main trunk road to serve the new port under construction
at Bandar Abbas. The project includes the improvement and asphalt paving of
the existing road, including relocation of certain sections through a flat and
partially rolling area. The construction of the section between Bandar Abbas
and Sirjan was started two years ago with the P.O. 's own financing and is
supervised by the consulting firm, Kampsax. About half of the work has now
been completed.
25.       The existing road between Nain and Kerman is a gravel road traversing
a flat to rolling country. The road is virtually the only link betwreen central



- 5 -
Iran and the southeastern provinces. The current traffic volume over the road
is already relatively heavy and its importance is expected to increase when the
construction of the Bandar Abbas port is completed. A comprehensive reconnais-
sance survey and an economic feasibility study were carried out on the road by
consultants retained under the First Road Project. Final survey and design by
the consultants are needed before construction work can start.
26.       The Shahpasand-Meshed-Afghan Border road is a continuation of the
Sari-Shahpasand road towards the east, along the northern foothills of the
Elbruz Mountains and extending to the Afghanistan border.   The Sari-Shahpasand
road is being improved by the P.O. under the supervision of the consulting firm,
Kampsax. The proposed project road is an important trunk-road serving Meshed
(pop. 250,000), one of the largest cities of the country and the administrative
and commercial center of northeastern Iran, and provides international road
connection with land-locked Afghanistan to the east.
27.       The first section of the proposed road between Shahpasand and Ghuchan
was rebuilt by the Ministry some years ago with a new base and gravel surfacing.
The road has a generally good alignment which needs correction only in a few
locations before paving.
28.       The Ghuchan-Meshed section which serves a rich agricultural valley is
an old gravel road with poor alignment. Realigmaent is therefore proposed in
the middle of the valley to serve better the numerous villages on both sides.
The Ministry of Roads has recently completed a preliminary survey of the new
road, wJhich has been reviewed by the P.O., and will serve as the basis for the
final design by consu'ltants.
29.       The section from Ileshed to the Afghan border also needs to be recon-
structed. The existing road has poor alignments and is of little value. A
preliminary survey has been completed by the linistry.
30.       The Tehran-Rudehen-Babol route forms a modern trunk-road facility
serving traffic betwieen the Tehran metropolitan area and the Caspian region
across the Elbruz Mountain ranges. The Rudehen-Babol road, constructed under
the First Road Project, received a surface treatment on one section and an
asphalt binder-course on the remainder. Because of the heavy traffic (up to
3,00 vehicles a day), the road surface has to be covered with an asphalt con-
crete carpet. The Tehran-Rudehen road, completed about four years ago by the
Ministry, needs minor relocations, improvement and an asphalt carpet over the
existing surface treatment.
B. Cost Estimates
31.       The total cost of the project is estimated at Rls. 6,750 million,
including 20 percent contingencies, or US$90.0 million equivalent, of which
about Rls. 2,415 million, or US$32 million, represent the foreign exchange cost
proposed to be financed by the Bank. Table 2 gives details of the cost

estimates, which are summarized as follows:
Total Cost      Foreign Cost
- - - in mllion USN - - --
1. Road construction, improvement

2.  Engineering and supervision          5.0              2.5
3.  20 percent contingencies on

Total       90.0            32.0
32.       After final engineering the contracts on both sections of the Sirjan-
Kerman road have recently been awarded to local firms on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. The cost of Rls. 507 million used in the Table
is the consultant's estimate, on which the contractors offered prices slightly
below the consultant's estimate.
33.       On the Nain-Kerman road a comprehensive study including preliminary
survey and design was undertaken by the consulting firm of Amman & Whitney.
As the terrain is level and the project work is mainly the improvement of the
existing road, rather than realignment, the cost estimate indicated by the
consultants of Rls. 3.8 million (or US$50,000) per km., should be considered
fairly reliable. However, final engineering will have to be prepared before
the cost estimate can be finalized.
34.       On the Shahpasand-Meshed-Afghan Border road, the cost of paving the
Shahpasand-Ghuchan section was estimated by the consulting firm, Kampsax, and
appears reliable.  For the Ghuchan-Meshed section, a preliminary survey and
design was undertaken by the Msinistry, with a cost estimate. As no engineering
is yet available for the Meshed-Afghan Border section, the Ministry's estimate
of Rls. 3.5 million per km. was raised to Rls. 4 million after review by the
consultants. The same unit cost is used in estimates for the Ghuchan-Meshed
section which will be improved to higher standards (Class I) than the Meshed-
Border section (Class II). The estimated cost should be adequate to cover the
reasonable contingencies that might occur in the course of the project.
35.       The estimate for pavement of the Rudehen-Babol road is based on the
final designs prepared by the consultants, Kampsax, and is reliable.
36.       For the Tehran-Rudehen road, a tentative estimate was prepared by the
consultants, which should approximate fairly closely, based on previous ex-
perience, the estimates to be prepared on the basis of final designs.
37.       The estimated cost for engineering and supervision (for details see
Table 2) is based on estimates prepared by the consultants and reflects their
actual experience under the First and Second Road Projects.
38.       While the cost estimates of the proposed project appear to be con-
sistent with the experience of the two previous road projects, they are based



- 7 -
mainly on preliminary surveys, so that there may be some variations in the
final estimates. For this reason, a contingency of 20 percent has been added
to the construction costs to meet any possible shortfaUl in the estimates.
C. Design and Execution
39.       The project roads will be built to first class standards (Class I),
with the exception of the Sirjan-Kerman road and the Meshed-Afghan Border
section of the Shahpasand-Meshed-Border road, which will be built to second
class standards (Class II). The design standards adopted by the Ministry of
Roads are generally satisfactory. (See Table 3). The same design standards
were applied to the roads constructed and improved under the First and Second
Projects.
40.       Final engineering is available only for two of the roads included in
the project or about 20 percent of the project works; the Sirjan-Kerman road
is already under contract, and pavement of the Rudehen-Babol road ready for
tendering. For the other roads final survey and design is scheduled to be
carried out by consultants.
41..      The project will be carried out under the immediate responsibility
of the Ministry of Roads. Competent consultants should be retained to prepare
final plans and designs and to supervise works in the field. During negotia-
tions, assurance has been obtained on the employment of consultants.
42.       The construction work will be carried out by qualified local and/or
foreign contractors, on the basis of unit price contracts and international
competitive bidding.
43.       One of the beneficial results of the road construction program has
been the growth of a local construction industry. When the Bankts first road
project was initiated in 1959, there were few local contractors in Iran capable
of undertaking road construction works of the magnitude required by the project.
Today, a considerable number of competent and well-equipped construction firms
have emerged as a direct result of the road projects. Their capacity and
experience are adequate to carry out many future road programs in Iran.
D. Financing of the Project
44.       It is expected that for the sections not yet finally engineered the
consultants would complete this work for about 90 percent of the roads by the
end of 1965 and the remainder in the first half of 1966; the project would be
completed in 1968.
45.       Accordingly, the disbursement of the loan may be as follows:
First Year     Second Year     Third Year      Fourth Year     Total
$5.5 million   $12.6 million    $9.8 million    $4.1 million    $32.0 million



- 8 -
46.       The amount of local currency required annually for execution of the
project would be approximately as follows:
In Million Rials
First Year     Second Year     Third Year     Fourth Year      Total
750           1,705          1,325            555    = Rls. 4,335 million
($10.0)        ($22.8)        ($17.8)         ($7.4)   = ($55.0 equivalent)
The P.O. provides local currency from devenopment funds made available from
the Government's annual oil revenues during the Third Plan Period. During
negotiations, assurance has been obtained from the Government that it rill
make available the necessary allocations in its development budget.
V. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Benefits of Road Investments in Iran
47.       The results of road investment in Iran in the recent past lend con-
siderable support to proposals for further road investments. The First Road
Project financed by the Bank in 1959 is complete and the mission could ascer-
tain some indications of its favorable impact on the economy of Iran, although
it is not always possible to obtain quantitative data.   There are three princi-
pal indicators of the favorable impact of the project, namely, the increase in
traffic volumes, reductions in the levels of charges by public carriers, and
growth in productive activities in the service areas of the project roads.
48.       The increase in the traffic volumes on the roads improved or recon-
structed under the First Project is remarkable. On the basis of rather
incomplete traffic counts conducted ainually by the Ministry of Roads, it
appears that the traffic volumes on the Project roads, opened to traffic
beginning in 1962, grew rapidly and have now approximately doubled the 1958
level. Tnis relatively high rate of growth was registered on tne Project roads
while most of the lower standard roads in the country showed far lower rates of
growth (mostly under 5 percent per annum or about 30 percent increment during
the 6-year period). The current daily volumes of traffic on most of these
First Project roads are over 1,000 vehicles, and the proportion of commercial
vehicles (trucks and buses) varies between 50 and 80 percent of total traffic
volumes.
49.       The effects of the improved road conditions were directly registered
in the levels of charges by public carriers - buses and trucks. The rates
charged by these commercial carriers on the improved roads were just about
halved compared with the levels prevailing before the improvement - bus fare
from Rls. 0.50 (US$0.7¢) per passenger/km. to Rls. 0.25 (US$0.3¢) and truck
charges from Rls. 2.50 (US$3.3¢) per ton/km. to Rls. 1.25 (US$1.7¢). The
information was supplied by T.B.T., the largest bus company in Iran and the
Truckers Syndicate in Tehran.
50.       The reduction of fares by half would appear to squeeze profit margins



- 9 -
of the public carriers to a level considerably below the previous level. But,
according to the carriers, while lowering of the unit profit margin is inevi-
table because of the intensified competition among many carriers on improved
roads, the increased volume of business resulting from road improvements
usually produces the same or a higher total return on the capital invested. In
Iran there is no government regulation of rates and charges collected by public
carriers.
51.       The effects of road improvement on the economic growth of the service
areas are difficult to evaluate in quantitative terms, and, moreover, the pro-
ject is too recent to have produced its full effects. However, it is noted
that, in the regions served by the project roads, there is a large expansion
of the areas of agricultural cultivation, and a considerable diversification
of farming, which includes a switch from traditional staple crops to cash crops.
In order to obtain full benefits of the road investment, construction of
feeder-roads is necessary to connect isolated areas with the new main roads.
For this reason, many of these areas served by the First Project roads are
included in a proposed feeder-road project the Bank has appraised simultaneous-
ly with the appraisal of the Third Highway Project.
B. The Method of Evaluation of Benefits
52.       Three of the five roads included in the project, Sirjan-Kerman,
Nain-Kerman, and Shahpasand-Meshed-Afghan Border, serve areas relatively
underdeveloped but which show large potentials for growth. The main objective
of improvement of these roads, therefore, is to induce and accelerate economic
deve'lopment of the affected areas.
53.       The two other roads, Tehran-Rudehen and Rudehen-Babol, serve excep-
tionally heavy traffic volumes between the Tehran area and the Caspian littoral
region which is one of the best developed agricultural areas in Iran. The
purpose of investment in these roads is to prevent the deterioration of the
road surface by application of a permanent type of asphalt pavement, rather
than to correct any existing unsatisfactory conditions of the roads.
54.       The estimates of economic benefits have been made for each road and,
where traffic volumes and costs of improvement vary considerably between dif-
ferent sections of the same road, such estimates have been made for each section
of the road. For those roads serving the presently underdeveloped areas
(Sirjan-Kerman, Nain-ICerman, and Shahpasand-Afghan Border), the rate of traffic
growth is assumed to be at 10 percent per annum during the first five years of
operation of the improved roads and thereafter gradually declining to 5 percent
per annum toward the end of the 20-year economic life of the investment. The
unit savings of an average size truck, after improvement of these roads, are
considered to be about Rls. 3.7 per km. For the roads connecting Tehran with
the Caspian littoral (Tehran-Rudehen and Rudehen-Babol) the rate of traffic
growth is assumed to be 7.5 percent per annum during the first five years,
declining to 5 percent by the end of the 15-year economic life of the invest-
ment. The unit savings of an average truck on this road would be Rls. 1.6 per
km.



- 10 -
55.       The bases of these assumed figures are the statistics of motor fuel
consumption and registered motor vehicles of the country as a whole, and the
estimates of vehicle operating costs prepared mainly from information supplied
by the consultants. The details of this information are given in Tables 4, 5
and 6.  The basic data used are generally the same as those used for the
appraisal of the Second Road Project. As review and interpretation of the data
were made in the Second Project appraisal report (TO-403b, May 1964) and there
is no significant change since then, the detailed discussion of the data is not
repeated here.
56.       The rates of return showsn for each road are calculated on the basis
of the presently available cost estimates which include 20 percent contingen-
cies.
C. Sirjan-Kerman Road
57.       The 170 km. road betwieen Sirjan and Kerm.an traverses the northwestern
part of the Kerman province.   The province, located in the extreme southeast
of Iran, consists predominantly of deserts and salt deposits. Extremely dry
climate permits little productive activity except herd grazing in primitive
fashion. The road's service area, however, is probably one of the few areas
better suited for agriculture in the region. The soil is better and weather
is more favorable for cultivation than in the rest of the province. Conse-
quently, a large part of the estimated population of the province of 800,000
is concentrated in this area.  Although at present the main pursuit of the
people of the area is limited to growJing nuts, a large part of the unused land
area could be cultivated if adequate irrigation were provided.
58.       The city of Kerman (pop. 70,000) is the capital of the province and
the center of economic activities. The area surrounding Kerman is rich in
mineral resources but very little is being exploited.   The construction of the
new port in Bandar Abbas in the south should encourage development of mining
activities by providing convenient and economical ocean transport. The mining
resources include coal, iron, chromite, lead, copper, zinc, manganese ore,
asbestos, etc. Exploitation of these mining resources is being planned by both
public and private concerns.
59.       The port of Bandar Abbas is being built by the Government at a cost
of about $22 million, of which $15 million is financed by a TISAID loan granted
in 1963. The construction started early in 1964 and is planned to be completed
within three years. The port will have three general cargo berths with an
annual handling capacity of 300,000 tons, and bulk loading facilities for ores
on a separate berth to handle 300,000 tons a year.
60.       In anticipation of the opening of the new port in Bandar Abbas, the
Government has already started construction of a new road from Bandar Abbas to
Sirjan. This road was proposed to be included in the Bank's Second Road Project
last year, but the Bank mission at that time found it difficult to justify
because the existing traffic volume was too low (about 50 vehicles a day) and
the design standards proposed too high. Despite the recommendation of the con-
sultants that the initial improvement should be undertaken on a modest scale



- 11 -
and the standards raised later if port traffic should materialize, the Govern-
ment persisted in building a high standard highway. The Government is, there-
fore, financing the construction of this road without the Bank's assistance.
61.       However, the Sirjan-Kerrman road, which is an extension of the Bandar
Abbas-Sirjan road, is considered justified and included in the proposed project.
The reasons are manifold: first, the section in question has a higher traffic
volume (about 100 vehicles a day); second, the area served has better agricul-
tural potential than the areas along the Bandar Abbas-Sirjan road; third, due
to the favorable terrain, the cost of improvement is only about one-half of
that for the Bandar Abbas-Sirjan section (Rls. 3 million per km. against
Rls. 6.2 million); and last, but not least, since the Government has decided
to go ahead with the construction of the Bandar Abbas port, a certain volume
of port cargo will move over the road, although perhaps not as much as the
200,000 tons a year projected by the Government for 1967.
62.       Assuming that only about one-half of the projected cargo materializes
by 1970 instead of 1967, the total traffic volume over the road, which includes
the present traffic and its projected growth during the 20-year economic life
of the investment, would produce an annual return of about 11 percent on the
investment.
D. Nain-Kerman Road
63.       This road connects the Kerman area with the industrial and marketing
center around Isfahan. As the 138 km. section from Isfahan to Nain is being
improved and paved by the Ministry, the project includes improvement of the
section starting from Nain. The city of Isfahan, with a population approach-
ing 300,000, is the second largest city of the country.
64.       The proposed road is an important part of the arterial highwlay between
the capital region around Tehran and the southeastern provinces of Kerman and
Baluchestan. It would also be an essential link in the highway system connect-
ing the port of Bandar Abbas with central Iran.
65.       Until recently, the development of the region east of Isfahan was
somewhat neglected because of its relative remoteness from the country's
population centers. Consequently, the area has been isolated from modern
influences and the majority of its people even now are engaged in primitive
agriculture or cattle grazing. According to the Government's consultants,
only about one quarter of the potentially productive land area is presently
cultivated.
66.       The region is rich in mineral resources.   Several teams of foreign
geologists recently carried out extensive investigations of the area and
established that the region's underground reserves of lead, zinc, iron and
coal are sufficient to permit large scale exploitation for many years. A
number of foreign mining concerns are currently engaged in negotiations with
local companies to form joint ventures for exploitation and exportation of
mineral ores of the region.
67.       In recent years, many industrial establishments have grown up in the



- 12 -
cities and towns along the roads. These industries include food processing
and canning, and production of beet sugar, flour, chemicals, cement, metals,
bricks and furniture. Many of them are, of course, small industries. The
traditional industry is carpet weaving for which the region is noted for its
fine products.
68.       The current daily traffic on this road is about 250 vehicles, of
which more than two-thirds are trucks. The total savings in vehicle operating
costs together with some savings in road maintenance cost after the improvement
is estimated to yield an annual return of 13 percent on the investment cost
during the 20-year economic life of the investment.
E. Shahpasand-Mesbed-Afghan Border Road
69.       The road runs laterally through the northern part of the Ostans of
Mazandaran and Khorassan, paralleling throughout most of its length the Russian
border running about 50 km. to the north. The railway betwneen Tehran and
Meshed is located on the southern side of the mountain range whereas the pro-
posed road is located in the northern foothills of the same mountain range.
The railway runs through mostly a desert area and therefore serves few popu-
lated or productive areas, except the Meshed region where it terminates. Most
of the service area of the proposed road, on the other hand, is not served by
the railway. For this reason, competition between the road and railway after
the improvement of the former is expected to be minimal. At any rate, the
purpose of road improvement is to develop the presently isolated areas through
which the road runs rather than providing an alternative connection between
the central and northeastern parts of the country.
70.       The area extending about 100 km.. eastward from Shahpasand is a part
of the fertile agricultural plain of Gorgan, where cotton, wheat and rice are
the main crops. Next to this plain there is a mountainous region where culti-
vation of sugar beet is the main agricultural activity.  About halfway between
Bujnurd and Meshed the mountainous region ends and a wide plain reappears,
extending to the Afghanistan border. Currently the wihole area is devoted to
production of sugar beets, cotton and wheat.
71.       The VWestern half of the road's service area is under the favorable
climate of the Caspian region and is shielded by the paralleling mountain
range in the south against the influence of the dry air of the "Dasht-i-Kavir"
or the great salt desert. With annual precipitation of over 400 mm, it is
possible in normal years to grow one crop without irrigation. From Ghuchan
to the Afghan border the amount of rainfall is lower, 200-300 mm per annum.
In this area, however, an extensive underground irrigation system, called
"Qanats", provides additional water for cultivation. The part of the region
with sufficient rainfall has achieved a rapid development of its agriculture
during the past 15 years, particularly in cotton and sugar beet cultivation.
72.       Mineral resources are rich but not adequately exploited at present
because of the remoteness of the region and poor transportation.  Currently,
only coal mining is relatively active. Other mineral resources include iron,
copper, magnesite, lead and chromite.



- 13 -
73.       The area surrounding Meshed is fairly well developed industrially
using raw materials supplied from the poad's service area. Cotton ginning
and beet sugar production are the most important industries. Other industries
include a cement plant, manufacture of beverages and matches, food processing,
drying and canning of fruits, and vegetable oil extraction. The area is also
one of the important carpet producing centers of Iran.
74.       The Meshed-Border section of this road serves the international
traffic between Iran and Afghanistan. Beside the general merchandise, the
annual export of about 25,000 tons of Iranian petroLeum products to
Afghanistan is transported over this route.
75.       The present traffic volume on the road varies from about 150 to 250
vehicles depending on sections. As a whole, the savings on vehicle operating
costs and road maintenance would yield an annual rate of return of 13 percent
on the investment cost, including Rls. 525 million which was already put in
by the Govermnent on the sections between Shahpasand and Ghuchan. The differ-
ent sections yield different rates as follows:
Section         Km.    Current Daily Traffic    Annual Rate
(In Truck Equivalent)     of Return
Shahpasand-Bujnurd      255              250                 16%
Bujnurd-Ghuchan         125              200                 18%
Ghuchan-Meshed          120              210                 13%
Meshed-Border           240              150                  9%
76.       The last section, Meshed-Afghan border, produces a relatively low
rate of return. But, as the road improvement will facilitate both the develop-
ment of the region and trade with Afghanistan, this section should be improved
as part of the project roads. The road on the Afghanistan side is being
reconstructed with financing by the USAID.
F. ,ehran-Rudehen-Babol Route
77.       The present road between Tehran and Rudehen was constructed four
years ago by the Ministry of Roads, and its extension to Babol on the Caspian
shore was constructed as part of the First Bank Project two years ago. Both
sections have only a binder course of hot asphalt or surface treatment. The
traffic has been increasing very rapidly in recent years and the current
volumes vary between 1,200 and 3,000 vehicles a day depending on sections and
days of the week.
78.       Because of the heavy volume of traffic the road surface needs a
permanent type of pavement. If the pavement work is postponed by a few years
(say three to four years) the existing surface would be completely disintegrated
and some destruction of base and sub-base courses would result. The postpone-
ment of investment would, in other words, result not only in increasing the
cost of vehicle operation but also in a partial loss of the investment already
made.



79.       The savings on. vehicle operating costs an.d road maintenance would
yield, during the 15-year economic life of the in.vestment, annual rates of
return. of 21 percent and 22 percent for Tehran-Rudehen and Rudehen-Babol roads,
respectively.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMUENDATIONS
80.       The cost estimates of the several roads included in. the project are
based partly on.preliminary engineering and partly on final engineering, but
on. the basis of past experience on.road pzojects in Iran and with an.allowance
of 20% for contingencies they are considered to be realistic.
81.       Assurances have been obtained from the Government on. the provision
of local funds for the project, on. the employment of consultants and the bid-
ding procedures to be followied, and on. increases in the MYinistry of Roads'
maintenance budget and the establishment of a special fund for equipment re-
newal and purchase of spare parts.
82.       The Project is economically justified from benefits accruing to
road-users and savings in. road maintenance costs. The Project, moreover, will
contribute to the agricultural, industrial, and mining development of the af-
fected regions.
83.       The Project provides a suitable basis for a loan.of US$32 million.
equivalent to the Iranian. Government. A 25-year term including a Le½-year
period of grace would be appropriate.
