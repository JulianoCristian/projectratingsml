INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO
IRAN
FOR
A ROAD PROJECT
April 16, 1965



REPORT AND RECOM>ENDATON   OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO IRAN FOR A ROQiJ PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation   on a proposed
loan to Iran in an amount in various currencies equiva'ent to US$32 million.
The loan would be used to assist in financing part of the road program in-
cluded in Iran's Third Five-Year Economic Development Plan.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.     Since 1956 the Bank has made five loans to Iran.  The proposed
loan would be the third provided to assist Iran in building and improving
its main road r.etwork, a project of high priority i-n the economic devel-
opment of the country.
3.     The Bank made the first road loan to Iran in May 1959 in an amount
of US$72 million to help finance the construction, reconstruction and im-
provement of about 2,500 km of mnain roads and the design and engineering
of a program of main roads, as well as preliminary engineering for a num-
ber of feeder roads in important agricultural areas.
4.     The second loan was made in June 1964 in an amount of US$18.5
million to construct or improve additional 1,200 km of highways together
with two bridges and two viaducts. Again funds were provided under the
loan to assist in planning and basic engileering of the future extension
of Iran's highway, system.
5.     A Bank mission visited Iran in August-September 1964 and two suit-
able projects were subsequently agreed upon:   this third nrin rond proj:cct
and a feeder roads project.  Negotiations with representatives of the
Government of Iran for both projects were held in VWashington in March 1965.
6.     The proposed loan, togetlher with the simultaneously proposed US$8.5
million loan for feeder roads, would increase the Bank's lending to Iran
to seven loans totalling US$253.2 million. This amount includes a US$5.2
million loan to the Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran guaran-
teed by Iran.

to be presented to the Executive Directors sometime in May.

Iran.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THEI PROPOSED LOAN
11.    Borrower:               Iran.
Amount:                 US$32 million equivalent in various currencies.
Purpose:                Construction and improvement of about 1,680 km
of roads.
Amortization:           In 42 semi-annual installments beginning
November 1, 1969 and ending May 1, 1990.



Interest Rate:          5 1/2 per cent per annum.
Commitment Charge:      3/8 of 1 per cent per annum.
PART III - APPRAISAL OF THE LOAN
The Pro.ject
12.    A detailed appraisal of the Project (TO-464) is attached (No. 1).
13.    The present project is a continuation of the two previous road loans
which helped finance construction and improvement of some 3,700 km of main
roads, or nearly one-fifth of tne country's highway network.  The Bank's
financial assistance was also instrumental in introducing better organiza-
tion and more efficient methods of road construction in Tran.
14.    The present project includes the construction and improvement of
three roads (1,450 kim) in the country's southeast, central and northeast
regions.  They will ex'end the existing road network into the eastern part
of Iran.  The Shahpasand--iTIesiled-Afghan Border road will at the same time
provide an international road connection with land-locked Afghanistan to
the east. The project also includes the paving of the arterial highway
between Teheran and the Caspian region (230 km).
15.    The total cost of the project is US$90 million, including US$5.2
million for the cost of engineering and supervision. The cost estimates
are based partly on final engineering and partly on preliminary surveys.
Thus they are subject to some variation when the final engineering is com-
pleted on all roads, but the allowance of 20 per cent of construction
costs included in the estimate should suffice to meet such a contingency.
The costs in foreign currency are estimated at 35 per cent of the construc-
tion costs and 50 per cent of the engineering and supervision costs. Thle
local currency costs would be met by the Plan Organization out of its devel-
opment budget.
16.    The execution of the project would be the immediate responsibility of
the Ministry of Roads under the financial and technical control of the Plan
Organization. Qualified engineering consultants and contractors would be
employed to carry out the project. The roads would be constructed to design
standards satisfactory to the Dank, and Iran would undertake to maintain its
main roads adequately and to enforce load limitations on vehicles using them.
17.    The project is economically justified on the basis of benefits
accruing to road-users and savings in road maintenance costs. Moreover, it
should stimulate the agricultural, industrial and mining development in the
regions concerned.



Procurement
18.    All contracts for the projcct would b2 awoErdcd on the basis of
internationnl competlitive bidd3in- by preqlialified contractors.
Economic Situation
19.    A report entitled t"Current Econoriic Position and Prospects of
Iran" (AS-i37a) was distributcd on April 1, 1965 (R`5-52).
20.    Iran has boon passing throughi an economic recession since latc
1961.   In this pcriod, the rate of gro7th of income in real terms
appears not to have excec;ded the rate of population increase - 2% to 2.5%
per annum - and in 1962/63 per capita GIP may even have declined.   There
was an increase in economic activitly during 1964, but crop failures also
occurred in that year and somc signs of inflation appeared.   Imports
rose substantially, there was a net outflow? of capital reflecting loan
repayments, and foreign exchange reserves declined.   Iran drew $18 million
from the IflF in September 1906.  These financial difficulties should be
quickly overcore in view of the favorable prospects for oil revenues, to
which exceptional receipts of about US$200 million will be added this year
from bonus paynents for new off-shore concessions.   Progress of the Third
Plan (September 1962 - IIarch 1l968) hais not been very sntisfactory.
Primarily as a result of delays in project preparation, public investment
has been considerably below the targets.   Now, however, a number of
projects in transport, communications, power, industry and agriculture
will soon be ready for execution, though the relative priorit-y of all of
tnese has not yet been clearly established.
21.    In recent years Iran has borrowed only limited amounts from foreign
sources while making substantial repayments on outstanding loans.   With
the rising trend of oil revenues expected to continue, Iran is in a position
to incur substantial additional debt on conventional terms.   Service on
existing foreign debt is equivalent to about 11 per cent of estimated gross
foreign exchange receipts in 1965, and will decline sharply thereafter.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRITI2\S A1JIh AUTHORITY
22.    The draft loan agreement between the Government of Iran and the
Bank is being distributed to the Fxecutive Directors separately.   The
agreement conforms substantially to the usual pattern and that of the two
previous road loans to Iran.
PART V - COMPFLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEFENT
23.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMIENDATION
24.    I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
Resolution:



RESOLVED:
THAT the Bank shall grant a loan to Iran in an amount in
various currencies equivalent to thirty-two million U.S.
dollars ($32,COO,0)0), to mature on and prior to ilay 1,
1990, to bear inte rest at the rate of five and one-half
per cent (5-1/25%) per annum, and to be upon such other
terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accord-
ance with the terms and conditions set forth in the form
of Loan Agreement (Third Road Project) between Iran and
the Bank which has been presented to this meeting.
