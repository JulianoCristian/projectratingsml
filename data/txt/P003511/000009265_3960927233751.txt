MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SHANGHAI INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent of $150.0 million to
finance a Shanghai Industrial Development Project (SIDP). The proposed loan
would have a repayment term of 20 years, including five years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate and would be onlent to the Shanghai Municipal
Government (SMG) on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. SMG, in
turn, would make available the loan to the participating financial institu-
tions (PFIs). The PFIs would onlend those funds for eligible subprojects for
a maximum period of 12 years including up to three years of grace at a vari-
able interest rate equal to the Bank rate plus a minimum spread of 1.25 per-
cent and subborrowers would carry the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background.  Industry is China's largest productive sector account-
ing for almost half of its GDP. Gross industrial output has grown at an aver-
age annual rate of about 10 percent over the last ten years. Despite its
rapid growth, the industrial sector is characterized by low efficiency and
productivity and a limited variety of products which are often of poor qual-
ity. This is mainly due to inappropriate economic policies, outdated equip-
ment and technology, inadequate infrastructure and weak support institutions.
The Bank is assisting the Government to address the above problems through its
economic and sector work and lending operations.
3.        With the gradual decentralization of responsibilities for production
and investment decisions under China's ongoing economic reforms, it is becom-
ing increasingly important that the above-mentioned issues in industry be
addressed at the provincial level. The Bank, therefore, has initiated a
series of provincial operations designed to assist the provincial authorities
in identifying and resolving policy and enterprise reform issues in conjunc-
tion with specific subsector and enterprise-level restructuring. The Tianjin
Light Industry Project, approved in 1989, was the first project. The proposed
project is the second.
4.        Shanghai Municipality, which has provincial status, has the second
largest industrial output value (after Jiang i) among the provinces in China.
The Municipality has recently been designated as one of the key sites for
experiments in the implementation of enterprise and financial market reforms,
including the introduction of the joint stock system in certain key enter-
prises and expansion of the market for trading financial instruments. The
Municipality is also introducing several models of industrial restructuring.
The lessons of such experiments will contribute to national policy reforms in
these fields. SMG attaches priority to these measures in recognition that
they are necessary to solve some of the problems experienced by the Municipal-
ity's industrial sector during the past dozen years. During most of that
period, despite its size and historical strength, -hanghai's industrial sector
grew more slowly than the rest of China's industry for several reasons: gov-
ernment regulation was greater in Shanghai's industrial sector; until 1989,



- 2 -
the enterprise reform program was implemented more slowly in Shanghai than in
other provinces; and furthermore, the Municipality has been taxed more heavily
than other provinces by the central government, leaving fewer resources for
investment. Shanghai also has a much higher portion of state-owned enter-
prises (SOEs) than the rest of the country. These have grown more slowly than
the township and village enterprises, which play a relatively larger role in
other areas. Shanghai faces increasing competition from other provinces while
also being squeezed by raw material and energy shortages, and saddled with
outmoded manufacturing technology, deteriorating infrastructure, and a scar-
city of land for expansion. Important elements of Shanghai's industrial
strategy are to- reform the ownership and management systems of its SOEs;
move into higher value-added activities that are more technology intensive,
less polluting, and less intensive in energy and raw materials; and improve
the policy and infrastructural environment for foreign investors and other
nonstate enterprises.
5.        Four priority subsectors--electronic components, precision and sci-
entific instruments, printing machinery, and electrical apparatus--face prob-
lems of industrial adjustment that are found in many other subsectors in
Shanghai. Following government efforts in the mid-1980s to reduce the number
of layers of bureaucratic control over SOEs, these subsectors had been orga-
nized as loose groups of suboptimally sized factories, along with a corporate
office without the authority to restructure factories for efficiency gains.
The factories are characterized by overlapping products, duplicate manufactur-
ing processes, poor product quality, and limited marketing and distribution
channels. Using funds under the Japanese Grant Facility (JGF), two interna-
tional management consulting firms helped develop specific restructuring
strategies for the four subsectors.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  To revitalize its economy Shanghai
needs to improve the structure and management of its industrial sector. The
Bank is well-placed to assist the SMG because of its ability to support the
formulation, implementation and financing of an integrated package of needed
policy and enterprise reform measures based on the experience gained from
industrial restructuring projects elsewhere in the world, and previous eco-
nomic and sector work and lending operations in China. The project is consis-
tent with the Bank's overall strategy for assistance to the industrial sector
in China.
7.        Proiect Objectives and Description.  The project would support the
implementation of the technological and organizational restructuring program
for the four priority subsectors (para. 5). Technological restructuring would
focus on rehabilitation, consolidation, modernization and expansion of produc-
tion for the domestic and international markets, particularly those of South-
east Asia and on an OEM basis. In addition, joint ventures would be sought
during the project. The organizational restructuring would support the devel-
opment of reconstituted subsector corporations, which are integrated corpora-
tions able to carry out the product and manufacturing rationalization needed
in each subsector. Not all factories in the subsectors today would come under
the new integrated corporations. Only those factories that have a critical
role to play in implementing the agreed subsector strategies are included.
The enterprise reforms are reflected in legal charters approved by SMG that
are acceptable to the Bank. They would be supported by further actions to
reorganize internally and strengthen management systems. The project would



have three components: (a) about $134 million of the proceeds of the loan
would be utilized toward meeting the foreign currency requirements for techno-
logical restructuring in the four subsectors. Specifically, it would finance
subprojects appraised by the PF!s that are consistent with the ag'reed subsec-
tor strategies, are environmentally sound, and meet agreed financial and eco-
nomic criteria; (b) about $16 million of technical assistance (TA) to the four
subsectors, including management consulting services to support organizational
restructuring and project implementation, computer equipment and software and
overseas training and travel abroad to acquire foreign technology; and (c) an
institutional development component financed under the JGF consisting of pol-
icy studies of enterprise reform issues and the effect of recent and planned
policy changes in the four subsectors that would be carried out as part of the
project. Under this component the PFIs would receive training covering sub-
project appraisal methodology, and Bank procedures on procurement, disburse-
ment and reporting.
8.        The five PFIs are the China Investment Bank, Industrial and Commer-
cial Bank of China, People's Construction Bank of China (acting through their
Shanghai branches), the Bank of Communications Shanghai Branch and the
Shanghai-based Shanghai Investment and Trust Company. They would be responsi-
ble for the appraisal and supervision of subprojects to be financed under the
proposed Bank loan and would each lend to only one of the subsectors included
under the project. Each PFI is considered to be capable of carrying out the
project appraisal, implementation and supervision tasks required under the
proposed project. Although the project is to assist the four preidentified
subsectors, the PFIs will be allowed the flexibility to finance subprojects in
other subsectors as agreed between the Bank and SMG, on the basis of develop-
ment strategies to be prepared by the Municipality.
9.        The total cost of the project is tentatively estimated at $319.6
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $180.3 million
(36 percent of total costs). Final cost estimates would depend upon the indi-
vidual subproject cost estimates that will be prepared by the PFIs at the time
of subproject appraisal. After all subprojects are appraised and final for-
eign exchange estimates are known, any remaining foreign exchange financing
gap would be financed by SMG. Retroactive financing up to a total of $5 mil-
lion will be allowed for eligible expenditures incurred after March 15, 1989.
A breakdown of tentative cost estimates and the financing plan is shown in
Schedule A. No procurement table is given since this is a line of credit and
procurement packages will generally be small and awarded after a comparison is
made of quotations solicited from at least three qualified suppliers from dif-
ferent countries. Contracts above $1 million will be awarded following ICB.
The methods of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7702-CHA, dated January 9, 1991, is being dis-
tributed separately.
10.       Agreed Actions.  Agreements were reached with SMG during negotia-
tions on the following major actions and conditions: (a) maintain throughout
project implementation a project monitoring unit (PMW) with functions and
responsibilities acceptable to the Bank and with competent staff to coordinat,
and monitor overall implementation of the project; (b) maintain a steering
committee (SC) that would guide the work of the PMU and annually exchange



- 4 -
views with the Bank on implementa ion of the development programs and strat-
gies of the four subsectors, including policy and enterprise reforms;
(c) approve charters for the integrated corporations that are acceptable to
the Bank; (d) ensure that financial consolidation of the new integrated corpo-
rations is carried out within nine months of charter issuance; (e) ensure the
availability of funds for implementation of the project; and (f) carry out
studies in accordance with terms of reference and timing agreed with the Bank.
Agreement was reached with the PFIs on the following major actions and condi-
tions: (i) eligible subprojects would be consistent with the development
strategies agreed between the Bank and SMG, meet their lending criteria
including a minimum FRR of 12 percent for all subprojects (and a minimum ERR
of 12 percent for subprojects above the free limit), and be sponsored by cor-
porations with satisfactory legal charters and projected financial positions;
(ii) subprojects to comply with the Shanghai Environmental Protection Bureau's
environmental protection guidelines which are satisfactory for the project
subsectors; (iii) existing operations of the factories sponsoring subprojects
to be in compliance with those guidelines; and (iv) each PFI would seek Bank
approval of the first two investment subprojects below the free limit. Each
corporation would appoint the necessary consultants as a condition of effec-
tiveness.
Ul.       Benefits.  Organi;ational and technological restructuring and policy
reforms will result in greater efficiency, and better domestic and interna-
tional competitiveness in the four project subsectors. The subproject selec-
tion criteria will ensure that investments under the project are consistent
with SMG's strategy for each subsector, financially and economically viable,
and environmentally sound. The proposed project would provide SMG with a
model for other industrial subsectors in Shanghai that need restructuring.
12.       Risks.  There are two main project risks.  The first is a possible
failure to implement the subsector enterprise and policy reforms. However,
SMG is strongly committed to the reforms. In addition, legal restructuring of
the subsector corporations, a requirement before subloans could be made to
them, has already taken place. The Bank and SMG have also agreed on a frame-
work for periodic reviews of the reforms during project implementation.
Second, there is the possibility of delays in project implementation. How-
ever, specific arrangements have been made to reduce this risk, including
staff training prior to the project, establishment of the PMU hind SC, proce-
dures for implementation at the level of the subsector corporations and engag-
ing consultants to provide management assistance during project implementa-
tion. A strong base for full implementation of the agreed restructuring has
been laid through initial organizational and managerial changes introduced
during 1990.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
