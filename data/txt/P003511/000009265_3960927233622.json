instruments). It aims to promote increased\n            efficiency and competitiveness through : (i) technical\n            assistance for organizational restructuring in each of the\n            subsectors and upgrading internal enterprise management\n            systems; (ii) financing through a credit component for\n            technological restructuring subprojects that are\n            environmentally sound and based on a rational product,\n            market and organizational restructuring strategies, and\n            sound economic and financial criteria; and (iii)\n            implementation of policy reforms at the subsector level. The\n            project also includes an institutional development component\n            consisting of policy studies of enterprise reform issues and\n            the effects of recent and planned policy changes in the four\n            subsectors. In addition there are pre-project training\n            courses for the PFI's in subproject appraisal."}, "docdt": "1991-01-09T00:00:00Z"}
