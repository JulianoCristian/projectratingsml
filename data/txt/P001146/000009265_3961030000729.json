First,\n            project scope and content should be coherent and support an\n            agreed sector strategy and program that is based on a\n            consensus and agreed upon by the different Government\n            departments. Second, at the project's start, agreement\n            should be reached on performance indicators. They should be\n            reviewed through project launch workshops, annual\n            programming exercises, and a mid-term assessment. Third,\n            project management arrangements should be agreed upon,\n            including staffing commitments and the roles of key\n            technical units. Fourth, Bank missions should be more\n            frequent, with a skill mix tailored to the technical and\n            management requirements of the project. Finally, the Bank\n            may want to consider a shorter timeframe for future\n            projects, with phased implementation based on an agreed work\n            program with the Government."}, "docdt": "1995-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
