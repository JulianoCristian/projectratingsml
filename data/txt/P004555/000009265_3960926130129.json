The\n            project's main objectives are to: (a) develop an\n            exisitng geothermal steam field and a new power plant at\n            Bacon Manito; (b) support the delineation and the assessment\n            of geothermal sites for use in Luzon; (c)support measures\n            for upgrading and expanding system facilities; and (d)\n            support institution building and financial recovery at NPC\n            (National Power Corporation). The project provides for (1)\n            drilling of about 18 wells and construction of a\n            steam-gathering system; (2) construction of a power plant;\n            (3) construction of single and double circuit transmission\n            lines, rehabilitation of substations and extension of\n            communication links; and (4) consultancy services."}, "docdt": "1988-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
