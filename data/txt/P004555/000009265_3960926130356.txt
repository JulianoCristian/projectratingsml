MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATiON OF THE i'RESTDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON TWO PROPOSED LOANS.
ONE LOAN TO THE NATIONAL POWER CO3PORATION AND A
SECOND LOAN TO THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY,
BOTH LOANS BEING GUARANTEED BY THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR THE BACON MANITO GEOTHERMAL POWER PRnJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on two proposed loans `,r
an aggregate of US$100 million is submitted for approval.  The proposed loans
would be extended to the National Power Corporation (NPC) (US$59 million), and
to the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) (US$41 million) to be onlent to
its subsidiary, the Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC), on Bank's
standard variable interest rate with 20 years maturity; the Republic of the
Philippines would guarantee the two loans.  The proceeds would help finance a'
single, integrated project to develop geothermal resources, power generation,
and transmission. The Government of Italy is providing US$60 million as
cofinancing for the project.
2.       Background.  During the period 1973-1985, the Philippine energy'
sector was reasonably successful in meeting the objectives of (a) replacing
imported fuels with indigenous coai, geothermal steam, oil, and non-
conventional fuels; and (b) arresting the growth of fuel consumption while
introducing fuel efficiencies Into the industrial 0ector.  This policy
resulted, in part, in demand for electricity increkasing only by a modest 4.8Z
p.a. from 15.1 TWh in 1980 to 18.7 TWh in 1983 and remaining stable at about
that level through 1986. ' this slow growth, combined with the expectation that
the since mothballed nuclear plant would meet all of Luzon's intermediate term
capacity requirements, resulted in a relaxed approach toward investment p.an-
ning.  Since 1986, political events have created an (ncertain environment for
the institutions working within the sector while faling oil prices have
created a need for an economic reevaluation and redirection of strategies for '
investment in domestic resource development. Moreover, a lack of agreement
between NPC, PNOC-EDC, and the Government has inhibited the increased use of
geothermal steam for power generation. While NPC had sufficient generating
capacity to satisfy anticipated demand in the Luzon grid through 1990, the
downgrading of generating capacity in Tiwi power plant and the relatively
sharp increase in power demand in 1987, requires NPC to expedite the devlop-
ment the additional capacity expeited to be needed as of 1991.  NPC has also
suffered-serious-cash-f-low-problems- in recent--ears- =- 
3.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The troposed project, which would
contribute to the efficient development of the 'Philippine power sector,
requires close cooperation and coordination among the principal parties--NPC
as the generator and wholesaler of power and PNOC-EDC as the primary supplier
of geothermal steam to NPC. Through its past operational involvement, the
Bank has developed constructive relationships that enable it to facilitate
important interactions between NPC and PNOC-EDC. Bank advice is expected to
help resolve issues such as coal and steam pricing, and develop the consequent
analysis of investment strategies. Sector work being conducteJ by Bank staff
has provided a basis for discussing these issues with NPC. PNOC-EDC, and the
Government. The sector's institutions all have considerable scope for
improvement of operational and financial performance, as well as investment
planning. The project would afford the Bank an opportunity to provide
assistance to NPC in these areas of institutional strengthening. Final'-y, by
using Bank procedures for procurement, the real cost of investment in the



2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
project can be optimised.  The Government is keenly lnteroeted in the B^nk'c 
continued involvement in a sector which is critical for the country's
industrialization.
4.       ProJecJtObiectives.  The proposed project is expected to support the
least cost source of Incremental capacity,for the Luson grid.  The project
will also support measures to strengthen the institutional and finaucial capa-
bilities of the executing agencies.
5.       Prolect Descriotio.  The proiect constitutem an integrated approach
to resource devolopment, power generation and transmission. The project's
main,objectives are to (i) develop an existing geothermal steam field at Bacon
Manito I and the associated power, plant; (ii) support the delineation and
assessment of geothermal resources for use in Luzont (ili) support measures
for upgrading and expanding NPC's system facilities; and (iv) support
institution-building and financial recovery efforts at NPC and PNOC.EDC.  The
project provides for (a) the drilling of about 18 wells for delineas
tion/appraisal of prospective geothermal sites, additional production/injec-
tion wells at the Bacon Manito I field and construction of a4,steam-gathering
systems (b) construction of a 2 x 55 MW power plant includin; turb*ne
generators, auxiliary equipment-and 32 km of 230 kV trandmission line,
',c) construction of 142 km of single and double circuit transmission llnes,
rehabilitat-ion of substations and extension of communication linkst and
Cd) consultancy services. The total cost of the project is estimated at
-US$227.0 million,,vith % foreign exchange component of"US$858.2 million. A
breakdown' of costs and the financing plan are shown in,,Schedule A. Amountp
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement scheoddi
are shown in Schedule B. T-he Government of Italy is providing a loan of US$60
million, the proceeds of which will be used by NPC to finance the Baco* 4Manito
Power Station. A timetable of key project'processlng events and status of
Bank group operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively.  Two maps are at*.Ahed   The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6999-PR
dated May 27, 1988 is being diLtributea separately.
6.       Agreed Actions.  Before negotiations, the various parties (a) agreed
on the terms for the sale of the geothermal steam, including a price of
US2.7: /kVh, to drive the power station; (b) incorporated design features to
ensure compliance with environmental regulations of the Environmental
Management Board and standards sati'sfactory to the Bank; and (c) established a
Project Implementation Cdumittee to coordinate exe; 'tion of the proposed
project. At negotiations, the various parties have 'agreed on the following
actions: (a) implementation by NPC of an acceptable action program to
maintain its accounts receivable and payable at levels consistent with proper
comnercial practices; (b) joint annual reviews of NPC's budget for the
forthcoming year and its financing plan for the next five years, with
particula-r attention to the specific instruments to be used for local currency
financing; (c) a joint annual review of NPC's investment program focussing as
much on the methodology for investment program optimization as on the
constituents of the program; (d) annual realization by NPC of rates of return
at 82 on revalued net fixed assets in operation and debt service coverage
ratios of 1.3; Ce) annual realization by PNOC-EDC of current ratios of 1.0,
debt/equity ratios of 70130, and debt service coverage ratios of 1.2; and
(f) effectiveness of the loan from the Government of Italy by December 31,
1988.

7.       Benefits.  Economic benefits under the project are expected froms
(a) development of a geothermal steam field for provision of 110 MW of addi-
tional base load power generation in Luzon; (b) improved efficiencies in powe:
transmiss'ion and reduction of losses through system modernization; and
(c) improvement of the operational and institutional efficiencdies of'the two
agencies. The internal economic rate of return of the project based on direct
benefits measured in terms of sales revenue is 19Z.
8.       Risks.  The proposed project includes no unusual technical risks.
Extensive scientific investigations and independent resource assessment have
'confirmed the existence of sufficient steam reserves.  NPC and PNO,-EDC have
staff experienced in supervision and'execution of works similar to those
required under this proposed project.  However, as a result of financial
weakness, NPC could have difficulty realizing counterpart funds and keeping to
the project implementation schedule. Also, because the Project Implementation
Cdmmittee will not function under the authority of a preponderant institution,
the project includes'a risk of delays if the Committee cannot enforce the
necessary coordination needed between the' arties. Measures to minimize these
risks have been incorporated in the project design.
9.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the ExecutiveD
Directors approve the proposed loans.
