The project will also provide\n            financing to facilitate the test marketing of a new lower\n            price house although project beneficiaries will generally be\n            above the poverty line, (above two minimum wages),\n            beneficiaries closer to the poverty line will be reached. If\n            the test marketing is successful it is estimated that about\n            300,000 Type A houses would be constructed during the\n            period, with about 19% of the program's financing\n            provided under the loan. The project also includes studies\n            related to savings mobilization and investment in rental properties."}, "docdt": "1988-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
