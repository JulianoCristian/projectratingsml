{"cdata!": "This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Beijing-Tianjin- Tanggu Expressway\n            (BTTE) in China. The project's objectives were to\n            assist the Government in meeting the road transport needs in\n            one of the most important and congested corridors in China,\n            and in increasing the efficiency and cost effectiveness of\n            the highway subsector. Notwithstanding the difficulties,\n            substantial delays and quality deficiencies encountered\n            during the implementation of the BTTE, the key component of\n            the project, as well as the minor components of the project,\n            were implemented satisfactorily. The identification of the\n            components, preparation, appraisal and supervision of the\n            project were satisfactory. The following lessons learned are\n            relevant to the still ongoing and future Bank Group-financed\n            highway projects in China: (a) The noted deficiencies of the\n            civil works design and technical specifications highlighted\n            the urgent need for the revision, improvement and\n            consolidation of engineering design and technical\n            specifications into national standards for the construction\n            of high-class highways in China. (b) The late start and the\n            slow progress made on the preparation of the Electronic,\n            Electrical and Mechanical (E&M) works for the BTTE,\n            covering tolling, traffic monitoring, telecommunication and\n            lighting systems, added about two years to the\n            implementation period of the project. (c) The contractors\n            and almost all of the supervision staff had been affiliated\n            with the same transport divisions of the two municipalities\n            and the province involved in the construction of the BTTE.\n            (d) Preparation and follow-up to the recommendations of\n            studies are frequently deficient, and the Bank Group's\n            participation in and guidance to ongoing studies have often\n            been inadequate."}, "docdt": "1997-03-11T00:00:00Z"}
