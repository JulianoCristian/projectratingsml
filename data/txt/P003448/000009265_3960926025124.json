{"cdata!": "The Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway\n            Project aims to assist the Government in meeting the road\n            transport demand in one of the most important corridors in\n            China, and increasing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness\n            of the subsector.  The project is to be carried out under\n            the overall responsibility of the Ministry of Communications\n            (MOC) with an expressway company responsible for supervision\n            of the expressway construction.  The project itself\n            includes:  (a) construction of a 142 km, four-lane divided,\n            controlled access, tolled expressway connecting Beijing and\n            Tianjin with the new port of Xingang at Tanggu, as well as\n            two connecting roads (12 km).  It also involves (b)\n            consultants' services to help train the MOC's and\n            the company's staff in the supervision and quality\n            control of construction; (c) provision of road maintenance,\n            operation and traffic monitoring equipment for the\n            expressway; and (d) assistance in improving road planning by\n            setting up a computerized road data bank.  Finally, the\n            project entails (e) sector studies and (f) training of staff\n            from MOC's Highway Bureau and the Provincial Highway\n            Bureaus, in the areas of transport planning and other\n            highway and transport-related topics."}, "docdt": "1987-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
