ND0RANDU~ UAND RECOtENDUTION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF Tim
I ' TRtATIONAL DVSLQPN ASSOCIAiON
TO THE MXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
FOR AN ENERGY PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Central African Republic for SDR 13.5 million ($18 million) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with
40 years maturity. It would help finance the first phase of the country's
energy development rehabilitation program including an expansion of it8
electric power system, a strengthening of its petroleum exploration:and
distribution activities-as well as a reinforcement of the energy sector's main
institutions.  The project would be cofinanced by the  African Development Fund
($14.6 million), the Kuwait Fund ($6.9 million), the Caisse Centrale de
'Cooperation Economique of France ($13.3 million), the Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation of France ($4.8 million), the Arab Bank for Economic Development in
Africa ($4.0 million), the OPEC Fund ($4.0 Million) and others including
possibly 'IBuIDF ($2.7 million).
2.    Background.   CAR is relatively well endowed with energy resources,
particularly hydroelectric power and fuqlwdod. The country also has a likely
potential for petroleum production, but this remains to be ascertained. The-
power sector is currently experiencing major difficulties of both a technical
and institutional nature. Its major problem is a severe shortfill of hydro
'power during the dry season which results in planned load shedding during a
period of 6 months/year in the interconnected system serving Bangui, which
accounts for 992 of electricity sales.  Moreover, under-investment in the power
system gives rise to frequent brekdowns in generation, transmission, and
distribution. On the institutional side, the utility company, Enerca, suffers
from weak management and a laclCof operational'authority. This, in combination
with inappropriate tariff levelsistructure, has resulted in severe financial
,losses and arrears. As for the petroleum.sector, the high cost of imported oil
products--partly due to CAR's distance from the coast -- constitutes a major
burden on the economy. This is aggra%ated by the non-competitive petroleum
acquisition and distribution system currently prevailing in the country.
Petroleum exploration efforts are being severely hampered by a virtual absence
of local capabilities in such areas as geology, geophysics, exploration
contracting.
3.    The Bank Group has not'been involved in CAR's energy sector until now but
was requested by the Government to participate in the financing of the
construction of a storage dam together with five other financiers. This dam
will regulate the flow of the M'Bali River so that existing downstream
hydroelectric plants (Boali I and 2), the only hydroelectric facilities of the
country, will be able to generate a firm 16.9 MW versus 3.5 MV at present. The
dam is the first step in the least cost generation expansion program to meet
both existW' and forecasted load growth.



-2
4     Rationale for IDA Involvement.  At the Government's request, IDA has
played a leading role in formulating and coordinating co-financing for this
broad-based energy project, which was initially conceived as a more limited
project-confined to constructing the M'Bali dam. Following IDA's initial
review of the energy sector, the institutions therein and sector regulations,
Government and IDA concluded that far reaching reforms were required for proper
development of the sector in order to ensure thats (i) only highest priority
energy investments are implemented, (1i) energy sector policies and
institutions are reformed in conjunction with physical investments, and (iii)
the hydro-elecXric scheme proceed only after its ecological and resettlement
implications had been thoroughly examined and an appropriate environmental
action program had been defined. Government subsequently asked IDA to asFist
it in formulating appropriate sector policies, In this first energy project,
IDA has helped define and design specific action plans'-for institutional and
management improvement along with an improved regulatory framework through, for
example, the proposed performance contract between Government and Enerca. IDA
has been involved in the adjustment program of CAR since 1986.  This program
calls for, inter alia, improvement in the performance of the parastatal sector
as well as, more generally, greater efficiency in the use of the country's
resources. The proposed Project provides an appropriate opportunity for IDA to
support an extension arid deepening of this adjustment process focussed on the
energy sector and its parastatal agencies, in particular Enerca.
5.   Proiect Obiectives.  The project constitutes a first step towards a full
restructuring of'CAR's energy sector which will take a number of years to
accomplish. As such, the project supports"the introduction of a number of
immediate reforms as well as preparatory work for reforms to be implemented in
the future. The immediate objectives of the project ares (a) to reduce CAR's
dependence on costly oil imports by harnessing the full hydroelectric potential
of the M'Bali River; (b) to make the power sector financially sound by
introducing appropriate tariff adjustments, eliminating subsidies and adopting
more stringent action on receivables; and (c) to strengthen Enerca's management
by providing it with an adequate level of autonomy, training its staff, and
creating a Planning Department. The project's longer term objectives, for
which preparatory work will be started in the next 6-12 months, are: (d) to
rationalize the energy sector's overall pricing policy covering both levels and
structure of power tariffs as well as petroleum wholesale and retatl prices;
(e) to establish an appropriate system for promoting private investment'in-
petroleum exploration in CAR; and (f) to improve the efficiency of petroleum
procurement and distribution in the country. In addition, the project will lay
the groundwork for a Bank-UNDP Energy Assessment to be undertaken in FY 1990.
6.    Project Description.  The project comprises: (i) construction of the
H'Bali dam, including civil works, population resettlement, environmental
protection; (ii) rehabilitation of the generation, transmission and
distribution network of Enerca in Bangui; (iii) improvements in the financial
management of Enerca and audit of its accounts over the period 1987- 1992; (iv)
technical assistance to Enerca and MEM; (v) training of Enerca staff, both in
CAR and abroad; and (vi) studies i.e. a taritf study, a petroleum
pricing/distribution study including a financial audit of Petroca's accounts,
and the preparation of a power generation!transmission master plan.



-3-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
7.    Actions Agreed.  During negotiations the following key actions were
agreed: (a) by June 30, 1989, introduction of a performanc, contract between'
the Government and Enerca under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Association: (b) Government's financial compensation-to Enerca to cover capital
costs and operating losses related to electricity supplies to new rural areas;
(c) monitoring and reporting requirements and dams inspection procedures
acceptable to IDAI and (d) as conditions of credit effectiveneses (i) interim
adjustment of electricity tariffs, (i) submission of a draft performance
contract to the Association; (iii) transfer to Enerca of full ownership of the
hydroelectric plant at Boali 2 and the related debts (iv)a plan for the removal
of wood from the reservoir area; (v) satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement
between Government and Enerca; (vi) effectiveness of all co-financing
agreements, and (vii) opening of a Project Account for local expenditures with
an initial deposit of FCFA 130 million.
8.    Pro3ecto Benefits.  Benefits produced by the project include improvements
in the availability and quality of electricity service, as well as increased
efficiency and productivity in both the power and petroleum sectors. These
benefits will result from both new policy actions to be taken under the project
and from direct investments which will: (a) com ercialize the electric utility
Enerca; (b) relieve.current constraints on power generation in a least-cost
fashion and at acceptable environmental impacts; (c) achieve cost reductions
via substitution of costly fuel imports; (d) strengthen the electric utility
Enerca through technical assistance and an improved regulatory environment
facilitated by the use of a performance contract; (e) assist the Government in
the rationalization of the petroleum sector, both retail distribution and
petroleum exploration.
9.    For electricity users in general, and the public at large, the
improvement in the quality and quantity of service received will be reflected
in the gradual elimination of self generation, and through expanded public use.
Industrial and commercial users will benefit from reduced production losses
which have often accompanied the prolonged service curtailments. For the
Government, benefits will accrue in the context of its overall policy of
revitalizing and restructuring the public enterprise sector, and by helping
reduce its current heavy financial burden on the national budget.
10.   Project Risks.  Risks associated with the project relate to both physical
construction activities and to aspects of project execution and financing, and
include: (i) risks of cost overruns and schedule delays (ii)
environmentallhealth risks (iii) risk of dam failure,and (iv) risk of improper
execution by Enerca. Special measures either have already been taken and/or
will be undertaken during project implementation to minimize these risks; the
risks are manageable, and do not materially affect project justification.

11.   Rioarian Issue.  The MH'ali River flows into the M'Poko River several
kilometers below the proposed dam; the H'Poko, in turn, flows into the Oubangui
River. which forms the frontier between the CAR and Zaire. The Borrower, in
accordance with IDA's request, informed the Governments of Zaire and Congo of
its intention to-construct the dam on the M'Bali River. A statement of no
objection to the project was obtained from these riparians. -
12.   Recomindationi.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of-the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
