As such, the project supports the introduction of a\n            number of immediate reforms as well as preparatory work for\n            reforms to be implemented in the future. The project is\n            comprised of seven main components : (i) the construction of\n            a storage dam on the M'Bali river, including civil\n            works, resettlement of area population, as well as\n            implementation of an environmental protection program; (ii)\n            an expansion of diesel generation in Bangui and the\n            rehabilitation of Enerca's (Energie Centrafricaine)\n            main power system facilities; (iii) institutional\n            strengthening of Enerca, including investments in its\n            general facilities; and (iv) technical assistance to Enerca\n            and MEM (Ministry of Energy, Mines, Geology and Hydrology\n            OPEC). Further to this, the project will also finance : (v)\n            training of Enerca administrative and technical staff; (vi)\n            a petroleum exploration action plan; and (vii) tariff and\n            pricing/distribution studies and the preparation of a power\n            generation/transmission development plan."}, "docdt": "1988-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
