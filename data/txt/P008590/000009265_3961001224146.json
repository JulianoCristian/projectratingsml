The project consists of the\n            following three components.  A line of credit for mortgages\n            to alleviate the risks of long term lending when inflation\n            is high and volatile.  The mortgage instrument will be one\n            that charges a variable market rate of interest while\n            regularly adjusting payments to changes in nominal wages.\n            When payments are less than the amortization due, the unpaid\n            part will be added to the loan balance to be paid off over\n            the lifetime of the loan.  A line of credit for construction\n            will finance construction of about 15,000 new dwelling units\n            in projects to be carried out by developers.  Finally,\n            technical assistance will be provided to: (a) the Mortgage\n            Fund; (b) the Project Unit within the Ministry of Spatial\n            Economy and Construction; (c) participating banks willing to\n            engage in mortgage lending; and (d) municipalities\n            undertaking reform of land use practices, financial\n            management and urban infrastructure planning."}, "docdt": "1992-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
