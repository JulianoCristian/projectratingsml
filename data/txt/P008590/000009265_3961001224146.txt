MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDITION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANX FOR RECON5TRUCTIC.N AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THU EZUCUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSXD LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR A HOUSING PROJBCT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of Poland for US$200 million equivalent, to
help finance a housing project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard
variable rate, with a maturity of seventeen years, including four years of
grace.
2.    BackgooUnds Poland faces a major housing problem. The sector has
absorbed substantial resources during the 1980., (about 18 percent of public
investment) but the number of usable dwellings is still 10 percent short of
the number of households. Housing has been heavily underpriced and subsidies
amounted until recently to about 3 percent of GDP per year and even more if
off-budget sub&-a were included. Excess demand and chronic shortages have
been the inevitable consequences. The housing shortage has been compounded by
the economic stabilization program introduced on January 1, 1990. The sharp
increase in nominal interest rates slowed down the progress of ongoing
construction and drastically reduced new startb. These changes affected
mostly the housing cooperatives (traditionally the principal investors in the
sector) and brought to a halt a supply-driven system in whicb the allocation
of land, the activities of contractors, the supply of building materials, and
the allocation of credit were all administratively decided. The current slack
in production is partially offset by the emergence of independent contractors
and developers, who under prevailing conditions operate mainly on a cash basis
for upper income markets. In addition, the new municipal administrations,
elected in May 1990, are taking over the property and management of assets
formerly owned by the central government: land, infrastructure, public
housing, service enterprises, construction firms. Thus, housing sector reform
has become inseparable from the process of political, administrative and
fiscal decentralization.
3.    Rationale for Bank Involvements  Severe housing shortages, low
production levels and high nominal rates of interest could renew pressures for
unrestrained subsidies and derail the stabilization process. Therefore,
r        housing policy needs to become part of and support the adjustment process in
several ways: contribute to the stability, restructuring and growth of the
economy; encourage privatization of the building and contracting industry; and
facilitate reform of the financial sector. The key reform areas includes on
the financial side, introducing adjustable mortgage schemes which capitalize
some interest without allowing any subsidy and are thus attractive to the
borrower and the lenderl on the finsca sift, gradually increasing rents and
eliminating fiecal subsidies to housing credit; on the real side, improving
regulations on the use of urban land and design standards for infrastructure
and buildings.
4.    Proiect Obiectives:  The loan would support the Government's first
steps in moving from a heavily subsidized, centrally controlled mode of
housing production to a more efficient, market-based system of supply through
private initiative. The specific project objectives are: (i) the creation of



-2-
banking services to finance mortgages; (il) a greater role for the private
sector in housing production; (iii) incentives to split existing cooperatives
into smaller housing associationsl (iv) compet;tive bidding for construction
cQntracts; (v) pricing of land as part of housinq costs; (vi) removal of legal
and regulatory constraints to private initiative; and (vii) greater efficiency
in the use of scarce local Government resou:ces.
S.    Instituticnal Arranaements:  A Mortgage Fund would be established and
financed with equity contributions from the budget and with the proceeds of
the Bank loan. The Fund would extend credit to domestic banks issuing
construction loans to developers or mortgage loans to households. The Fund
would be supported by a Project office under the Ministry of Spatial Economy
and Construction which would be responsible for project implementation. The
office is supported by foreign consultants financed by international donors
and includes specialists of finance, banking, legal, regulatory and
administrative matters, planning and engineering.
6.    Proiect pscgrintion and Implementation: The proposed project includes
the following components;
(i)  A Line of Credit for Mortgages.   To alleviate the risks of long
term-lending while inflation is high and volatile, the mortgage instrument
would be one that charges a variable market rate of interest while regularly
adjusting payments to changes in nominal wages (a Dual Index Mortgage, DIM).
When payments are less than amo. tization due, the unpaid part will be added to
the loan balance to be paid off over the lifetime of the loan. This type of
lending requires long term capital whiczx the Gove:nment will make available
through a special credit program to be supported by the proposed loan.
(ii) A Line of Credit for Construction. A line of credit (up to three
years) would finance about 15,000 new dwelling units in projects to be carried
out by private and/or public developers. The investment costs may include
civil works, land, smaller infrastructure and working capital. A first-year
pipeline of representative sub-projects has been identified in fourteen cities
throughout the country with an estimated cost of US$210 million.
(iii) Technical Assistance. The principal recipients of Technical
Assistance would be: (i) the Mortgage Fund; (ii) the Project Office within the
Ministry of Spatial Economy and Construction; (iii) banking institutions
likely to engage in mortgage lending; and (iv) municipalities undertaking
reform of land use practices, financial management and urban infrastructure
planning.
7. Actions Aareeds During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government on the following: (i) adoption of an operational manual to guide
investors, lenders and beneficiaries through project implementation; (ii)
establishment of the Mortgage Fund in BUDBANK; (iii) adoption of dual index
mortgages in the sale of all project housing; (iv) access to the two lines of
credit subject to set eligibility criteria (i.e. unit costs, technical
soundness, location, environmental, financial and economic impact); (v) joint
review of the proposed annual investment programs; (vi) annulment of



-3-
cooperative housing loans not fully disbursed before March 31, 1992 (an
estimated budgetary saving of the order of one percent of GDP in the current
year); and (vii) an official statement of the Government's medium-term
policies for housing finance (i.e. elimination of interest subsidies, resource
mobilization, mortgage instruments).
8.    SMironmeDW  &ects: The proposed project has been reviewed and
placed in environmental screening category "C" consistent with the provisions
of Operational Directive 4.00, Annex A, 'Environmental Assessment".
9.    Beefits:  The principal benefits of the project would be efficiency
gains from a market-based system of housing production and finance. The
project would help accelerete recovery and restructuring of the sector and
would increase labor mobility and choice in the housing market.  Competitive
pricing would stimulate productivity and help contain unit costs. Additional
benefits would accrue from the extensive program ol technical assistance to
local governments, banks and investors.
10.  jjBks: The project has been designed to offset the following risks:
(i) relatively high inflation rates and sloe growth in real income which .the
mortgage instrument should be able to withstand; (ii) interest rate subsidies
would be avoided to protect the budget an-d encourage the development of
market-based housing finance; (iii) inexperience of central and local
administrations, banking institutions and private investors which would be
assisted in applying new policies, instruments and procedures; (iv) escalating
construction costs should be contained through price competition to help
preserve affordability to the original target group; (v) obsolete municipal
regulations would be revised to encourage private initiative.
11.   Recommendtlo:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
