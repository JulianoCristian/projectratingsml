Lessons convey the following.\n            The project's success is attributable to the coherence\n            of its policy objectives, and to the demonstration of new\n            approaches, where following a gradual process of reforms,\n            demonstration of new products succeeded, even under\n            uncertain circumstances. However, the project lacked\n            continuity, and ownership among both the finance, and\n            housing sector officials; only to be recognized later on,\n            allowing enough time to convey an understanding of the\n            project. Nonetheless, during the economic transition, it\n            became important to understand demand, as exemplified by the\n            project design, and policies, established on the basis of an\n            assessment of projects under construction, and an assumption\n            that solving the resource constrain, would encourage banks\n            to lend, and households to borrow for financing homes.\n            Probably the most important contribution to the success of\n            the project, was the process of capacity building, and\n            understanding of market-based finance instruments, in spite\n            of severely underestimated timing in the disbursements\n            projections, and allocation of resources. Though it may be\n            argued that a policy, or technical assistance loan would be\n            instrumental in achieving policy, or sector reforms in the\n            context of transitional economies, it is fair to say that\n            the appropriateness of credit lines for financing\n            demonstration products/procedures, encouraged the emergence\n            of a competitive hosing finance system, and the separation\n            of subsidies from finance."}, "docdt": "2001-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
