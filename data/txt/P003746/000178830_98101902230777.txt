INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTICN AND DEVELOPfET
REPORT AND RECC(NM1DATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CN A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A JAKARTA URBAN DEVE0RLO2T PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and reconendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$25.0 million
to help finance a Jakarta Urban Development Project. The loan would have
a term of 20 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 8
percent per annmum. About US$18.2 million of the proposed loan would be
lent by the Government to the Special District of Jakarta (DKI) at 8½
percent per annum for a period of 20 years including five years grace.
About US$300 million of the prmposed loan would be lent by the Government
to the National Urban Development Corporation (NUDC) at 12 percent per
annum; the loan would be repayable as housing lots provided under the
sites and services component of the project are sold by NUDC.
PART I - THE ECONOCY
2.         The latest economic report on Indonesia, "The Indonesian
Economy: Recent Developments and Prospects for 1974/75", of Novemiber
26, 1973, (R73-273) described and anaJ.yzed the substantial. changes which
had taken place in the Indonesian economy in 19730 Since then there
have been important further developments, especially in oil prices. A
Basic Economic Mission is planned for October 1974 to reassess Indonesia's
longer term development prospects and policies. Country data are shown
in Annex I.
3.         The Indonesian Economy, which was dualistic and export-
oriented in the colonial period, was severely affected by the great
depression in the 'thirties, and the war, followed by the struggle for
independence, in the'forties. After a relatively brief period of re-
covery in the early 'fifties, the economy stagnated again in the decade
1957-1967 largely as a result of adverse economic policies. Thus, after
a long period of economic difficulties, in which the population nearly
doubled, Indonesia had become one of the poorest large countri.es in the
world.
4.         After the Suharto Government introduced an effective stabili-
zation program to combat the economic disruption and spiralling inflation
of the mid-1960's, there has been a period of recovery and rehabilitation
under the First Five-Year Plan.  Real annual economic growth was close t.o
7 percent in the period 1968-1972. Domestic savings and investments
increased considerably, thus providing the basis for continued economic
expansion after the rehabilitation phase. By 1972, investments, exclud-
ing those in the oil sector, had grown to an estimated 17 percent of the
GNP, of which more than two-thirds were financed from domestic sournes.
Sustained efforts were made to increase food production, with emphasis on
rice. Although a drought in the second half of 1972 led to a setback in
food production and a steep increase in prices, production has recoverec
since then. Efforts to expand food production continue to receive high
priority and in this connection, international supplies permitting, the
Government is increa3ing fertilizer imports in 1974. Expansion of
domestic fertilizer capacity is being pursued actively.
5.         Even before the increase in petroleum prices in the latter
part of 1973, the money economy was booming, and real growth was
accelerating under the influence of steep increases in Indonesia's



-2-
export pri-e3, a significant physical expansion of production in the oil
and forestry sectors, a rapid growth in direct foreign investment
(initially in mining, but increasingly in manufacturing), and a large
inflow of short-term credit. The same factors, however, also caused
significant inf ation, reaching a rate of nearly 50 percent during the fiscal
year 1973/74h. The Government took a number of measures to combat the
in-flation, most recently in April, 1974. Since then, the annual rate of
inflation has been 17 percent.
6.         The contribution of the oil sector to the economyI, which was
alreac1y increasing rapidly, has taken a quantum jump since September 1973.
The Indonesian oil price, which was still $3.73 per barrel in that month,
reached $12.60 per barrel in July, 1974, In addition, early this year,
Indonesia renegotiated the contracts with the foreign oil companies to
receive a larger share of the total oil proceeds. Thus, while the net oil
contributions to the balance of payments and the Government's oil revenues
were below $0.5 billion in 1972/73   (less than 5 percent of the GNP),
they are expected to reach well over $3 billion in 1974/75, an increase of
$20 per capita. Giveii also the external and domestic inflation, both
exports and budgetary receipts will probably exceed $5 billion in.
1974/75, a rough quadrupling in two years.
7.         The inflation is, however, also affecting the expenditure side
of the balance of payments and the budget. Average Indonesian import
prices are expected to increase by 80 percent between 1972 and 1974, with
the largest increases occuring in foodstuffs and agricultural inputs
(rice, wheat, sugar, fertilizer). To shield the domestic consumer against
the effect of high external prices, the Government is subsidizing these
impoi:ts at an annual cost of nearly $1 billion. In addition, the Govern-
ment has to pay more for domestic goods and services (including Government
salaries). Thus, about one-half of the additional budgetary receipts wi11
be eroded by the different effects of inflation. Of the other half, a
significant part will be spent on real increases in Government outlays,
including much-needed gradual salary increases, development expenditures,
routine material expenditures, and subsidies to regions. Nevertheless,
there will probably remain a budgetary surplus of $0.5 - $1.0 billion in
1974-75. The expected overall surplus on the balance of payments is
larger, and foreign exchange reserves may increase from $0.9 billion on
March 31, 1974 to about $2.5 billion (about six months of imports at the
theor expec ted rate) a year later.
8.         These surpluses are not large in relation to Indonesia's needs
for additional current and capital expenditures in nearly every field, as
specified in the Second Five Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79).  Moreover,
eartier problems of absorbtive capacity are being overcome gradually.
1/ Denotes fiscal year April 1 to March 31



- 3 -
Thus, even though some of the expenditures budgeted for 1974/75
(consiuners' subsidies) should only be temporary, it will probably not be
long before the new resources are fully absorbed,
9.         The Second Five Year Plan also provides significant new
directions in emphasizing the social., regional and equity aspects of
development. It is recognized that, while the Government's initial
economic stabilization and rehabilitation programs, as well as a number
of specific activities, have benefitted large segments of the population,
the benefits of investments in the modern sector - much of it in or around
Jakarta - have not been widely spread. Also, the continued high level of
agricultural prices after the 1972 crop failure has ultimately benefitted
the rural areas, but is severely reducing the real income of the urban
poor. Tbh Government's policy to keep the prices of basic commodities in
check through subsidization of imports is providing relief, but it is the
intention to gradually work out and implement a number of more basic
socially oriented policies in the fields of employment, education, housing,
etc.
10.        In the short and medium run, Indonesia will need continued
international technical assistance for project implementation and insti-
tution building. After its new financial resources have been absorbed,
Indonesia will also still need financial and technical assistance from
abroad to implement programs to alleviate its poverty. There is
therefore a strong case for continued international assistance to
Indone3ia, even though the country may generate relatively modest
bru,getary and balance of payments surpluses for a limited period. In
aUl probability, these surpluses will have been absorbed by the time
di`;3bursements from new loans become significant.
11.        The soft average terms of foreign assistance provided in the
context of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI), and the re-
scheduling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970 Paris
Club Agreement with the Western countries and Japan, and parallel arrange-
men ts with several Eastern European countries) have kept Indonlesia' 
public debt service ratio relatively low. Service payments on rescheduled
and subsequently inclurred public debt are estimated at $344 million in
1974, will reach a peak of $371 million in 1975, and are projected to
decrease gradually thereafter.  Comparing these amounts with the projected
export level of over $5 billion in 1974/75, and given the fact that
Indonesia's external terms of trade will probably remain favorable, it
appears that Indonesia now has the capacity to service significant addi-
tional debt on conventional Bank terms.
12.        The changes in Indonesian economic circumstances discussed
above had become apparent at the time of the IGGI pledging meeting in May
1974. As a result, it was generally agreed that progran aid was no longer



-4-
as urgently needed as previously, although reduced amounts of such aid can
usefully continue for some time. At the same time, the meeting endorsed
the vriew that a considerable expansion in project aid was warranted to
assist Indonesia in carrying out its more ambitious development strategy.
Although some members were not in a position to make pledges, it seems
likely that total aid commitments (including IBRD loans) in 1974/75 will
exceed the aid request of $850 million.
PART II - BANK GROIJP OPEtATIONS IN INDONESIA
13.        As indicated in Part I, Indonesia will continue to need sub-
stantial external financial and technical assistance to rehabilitate and
improve infrastructure and to expand production capabilities in agricul-
ture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing.  With the continued growth of
the economy, the Government will also be able to devote increasing atten-
tion to development of effective programs designed to ensure that the
benefits of development are distributed widely. Agricultural programs to
increase the productivity of smallholder farmers, regional development
(especially in the outer islands), family planning and other social programs
rill therefore have an important place in the development strategy during
the period of the Second Plan (1975-79).
14.        The work of both the headquarters and Resident Staff has been
oriented toward these development objectives. A basic economic mission,
scheduled for this fall, will concentrate on questions of employment and
income distribution.
15.        The Bank Group has in the past financed some of the local costs
of projects in Indonesia. A limited amount of such financing will continue
to be necessary in connection with Bank Group assistance to the agriculture
and social sectors, where projects frequently have a low foreign exchange
component.
16.        As of Jily 31, 1974, Indonesia has received 37 IDA credits
amounting to US$561.8 million and one Bank loan of US$h8 million.  The Bank
Group accounts for less than 4 percent of Indonesia's total outstanding
public debt.  By 1978 it is expected to account for less than 11 percent of
total outstanding debt and less than 5 percent of Indonesia's annual debt
service obligations. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of July 31, 1974, and notes on the execu-
tion of on-going projects.
17.        In accordance with the priorities of Indonesia's Five-Year
Plans, over 35 percent of lending to date has been for agriculture. IDA
has extended four credits to help rehabilitate and develop plantations in
the Government estates sector. Other credits for agriculture include four
to assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems and one each for a fisheries
project, a seeds multiplication program, beef cattle development, small-
holder rubber development, sugar industry rehabilitation and smallholder



tea development. Industry is of growing importance to the Indonesian
economy and the Association has assisted in four projects in this sector.
It organized a consortium of lenders to finance a major expansion of the
PUJSRI Fertilizer plant, assisted in the reorganization and financing of
the major state development bank (BAPINDO), provided financial assistance
for Indonesia's first industrial estate project, and assisted in the
establishment and financing of the Private Development Finance Company of
Indonesia (PDFCI). Other priority sectors to which credits have been
extended are power, transportation, telecommunications, education and
population. In addition, four credits have been made to assist the Govern-
ment in preparing projects and formulating appropriate development policies.
Projects in rural works, transmigration, water supply, agriculture research,
irrigation, inter-island transport and second loans to PJSRI and BAPINDO are
being prepared and may be ready to present to the Executive Directors
during this fiscal year.
18,        The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in 1968, and about
half of all credits have been made since June 1971. The program has
increased rapidly from a relatively small base, and consequently the un-
disbursed portion of IDA credits is relatively large. Many credits have
been associated with institutional reforms involving, inter alia, the
creation of new project authorities, drafting of new charters and the
enactment of new legislation, all of which has taken time. Thus, a number
of projects have experienced delays in the initial stages of implementa-
tion, however, project execution has improved sharply during the last year
as organizational improvements have begun to take effect and Indonesian
staff have become more familiar with Bank Group procedures. Nevertheless,
several projects continue to suffer from management, procuremen-t and budget-
ary problems and require continued close attention from the Bank's Resident
Staff.
PARIT III - THE SECTOR
19.        Indonesia is the fifth most populous country in the world
( estimated at about 128 million in 1974) and has an annual population
growth rate of about 2.0 percent. About 18 percent of the population now
lives in urban areas. There are more than two dozen cities with popula-
tions over 100,000, including several over 500,000. As a re3ult of intenss
population pressures on available agricultural land in Java and Bali,
millions of unskilled, uneducated rural poor have been migrating to thle
cities during the last 30 years despite the lack of even rudimentary urban
infrastructure and social services. The population of the Special District
of Jakarta (DKI), the capital city and site of the proposed project, has
grown from about 500,000 in 1945 to about five million today (about seven
million in the greater Jakarta area). With an annual average per capita
income of about $160 (compared to about $80 for Java as a whole) the city
is one of the largest and poorest in the world.



-6-
20.        The majority of Jakarta's new residents have settled in
kampungs (village compounds) in undeveloped, often swampy areas on the
constantly expanding outskirts of the city, wherever they coula erect
a simple, temporary dwelling. The average population density in Jakarta
is about 8 000 persons/km2, but central city densities reach about 21,500
persons/kmi. Since there are virtually no medium or high rise dwellings,
living conditions are extremely crowded. E&ployment opportunities,
whether real or imagined, coupled with continued population pressures in
rural areas, are likely to lead to continued rapid growth of Indonesia's
cities including Jakarta. Although acceleration of rural development
programs, and transmigration of rural poor to sparsely populated outer
islands, have high priority in Indonesia's Plans, neither program can
alleviate in the near future the problems of urban growth which already
plague Jakarta.
Present Urban Infrastructure in Jakarta
21.        Infrastructure and housing in Jakarta, particularly for low
income groups, is inadequate by even the most basic standards. The
water distribution system suffers from leakage and contamination and is
unreliable. About 50 percent of the population use wells, which are
often contaminated by sewage and increasing salinty due to depletion of
the fresh water aquifer. There is no sanitary sewer system in Jakarta.
Houses with piped water flush wastes into septic tanks or into open
ditches along the roadside. Much of the population has no alternative to
the use of drainage canals for bathing, laundering and waste disposal.
Most of the cityts uncollected garbage also ends up in the canals and
rivers and along the road where it clogs drainage channels and causes
extensive flooding during the rainy season. Seasonal floods sweep the
raw sewage and garbage out of the ditches and canals back into the
kampungs. In the dry season, when the flow of water is insufficient to
drain off wastes, they decay in the canals and pose a serious health
hazard.
22.        Housing is grossly inadequate.  A 1969 survey of Jakarta
housing showed that more than 900,000 families (average size of five
persons) were living in 486,00o dwellings.  Of these dwellings, 68
percent had no private toilet facilities, 80 percent had no electricity
and 60 percent had no access to piped water. Permanent houses with solid
walls, cement floors and tile roofs constituted only 24 percent of the
total housing stock; temporary houses of bamboo matting walls, earth
floors and thatch roofs comprised 44 percent and semi-permanent struc-
tur-es with some combination of temporary and permanent materials accounted
for the balance.
23.        Roads are well developed in some parts of the city but are
inadequate or non-existent in many low income areas. Unimproved kampungs
have no hard surface roads and only earthen footpaths. Public transport
is seriously overstrained and travel to places of employment is often an
arduous undertaking. Social facilities and services such as schools and



- 7 -
health clinics have become more widespread in recent years as a result
of continuing Government programs, but overall these are far from
adequate for the population's needs.
Ed sting Community Develop.ent Programs
24.        The KamDung Improvement Program (KIP), was initiated in 1969
to improve the lives of the low income gxoups in Jakarta through upgrad-
ing of public footpaths as well as secondary and tertiary roads and
other infrastructure. Detailed planning and design of the improvements
to be made with the limited fnds available was carried out by DKI
departments with priority being given to tha least developed kampungs.
Residents of the kampungs participated in the planning process through
local representative committees, and the works were designed so that they
displace only a minimum number of kampung residents.
25.        While the KIP has resulted in significant infrastructure
improvements and improved living conditions for many poor, there has been
no public program for developing new, planned housing sites with basic
urban amenities to accomodate the large and expanding low income popula-
tion. And, except for very high income development, the private housing
construction sector has been stagnant. Aware of the need for public
housing programs, the Government has been acquiring underutilized land
in the Jakarta area for development with miri'mim, yet adequate, urban
facilities and services. It recognizes that investment in planned
housing sites will be less costly than continuing to provide infrastruc-
ture after land has already been settled haphazardly; new site develop-
ment wil also make it possible for the GovenusenL to direct more effec-
tively urban expansion in accordance with an overall growth strat8gy for
Jakarta. Moreover, it is expected that new site development will stimu-
late self-help housing construction, thereby returning to low income
groups the benefits of their own labor.
Plans for Future Urban Develo]Ment
26.        The social, economic and political problems arising from condi-
tions in Jakarta and other large Indonesian cities are staggering.
Population growth and urban migration lead to mounting pressures on the
city administrations; unplanned but rapid urban growth continues to fore-
close future physical planning options, while consuming the limited
financial re9ources available for urban investment. A waster plan for
the development of Jakarta was adopted in 1967. However, it was based on
inadequate analysis of the relationship of Jakarta to the surrounding
region, and overlooked the potential for alternative land use patterns;
therafore, the Plan had little impact on development in Jakarta which has
proceeded in an uncontrolled fashion. Present land use has little
resemblance to projections in the 1967 Plan, which now has virtually no
relevance either to the present situation or future requirements. More-
over, the metropolitan area of Jakarta extends beyond the administrative
boundaries of DKI and coordination of plarning and investment between DKI
and the Province of West Java has not been effective.



- 8 -
27.        The Goverwment is aware of these problems and, in consulta-
tion with the Bank has initiated the following major actions as part of
its urban development strategy:
a) formation of a National Urban Development
Corporation (NUDC), a public corporation under
overall policy direction of the Ministry of
Public kbrks, charged with buying and develop-
ing land, particularly for low cost housing)
b) formation of a National Mortgage Bank (NMB) to
stimulate urban development by financing hous-
ing for low income groups through long-term
real estate mortgages;
c) improvement of the property tax system in
Jakarta, through periodic review and modifica-
tion of the existing assessment and collection
system, to increase tax revenues and enable
3KI to finance a larger share of its future
development needs;
d) execution of projects to demonstrate the poten-
tial of a low cost approach to both kampung
improvement and new commmnity development; and
e) creation, in the near future, of a greater
Jakarta Planning Board which will supervise
and direct planning and coordination of develop-
ment in the Jakarta metropolitan area. As a
first step, the Government has established a
planning group under the Directorate General of
Housing, Building Planning and Urban Develop-
ment (Cipta Karya59, Ministry of Public Works,
to function as the technical anr of the Board.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
28.        The proposed project was prepared with assistance from con-
sultants hired by the Govermnent and financed under the Third Technical
Assistance Credit (Credit No. 275-lND). It was appraised in a series of
missions in July andi November 1973 and Fbbruary 1974. Negotiations were
hell in Washington from July 24 to August 8, 1974; the Government's
delegation was headed by Mr. Rachmat WLradisuria, Director General of
Housing, Dailding, Planning and Urban Development Mnistry of Public
Works. The appraisal report dated August 30, 197f is being circulated
se)arately to the Executive Directors. Annex III contains a loan and
project summary.



-9-
The- ProjcOt
29.        The proposed project is the first phase of the Government's
efforts during the Second Davelopment Plan to improve the living standards
and quality of life for the urban poor. Jakarta was selected as the site
of the project because of the city's acute poverty, substantial over-
crowding and inadequate infrastructure. Through experience gained in
implementing the project and assistance from techinical experts, the
organization and s-taff capabilities of the NUDC and NMB will be developed.
The NUDC will initiate its program of urban land development through
execution of a sites and services program and supervision of the KIPe, The
NMB will begin its operations with mortgage lending for the sites and
services program. Project investments consist of three major elemenrts
described in paragraphs 30 to 35 below.
Kamung Iprovement_Proram,
30.        With assistance from the proposed loan, the DEI would expand
and accelerate the KIP during its fiscal years 1975 and 1976 so as to
upgrade public infrastructure and services in about 1980 ha of kaMpungs
inhabited by about 890,000 low income people. In the past five years,
DXI has improved about 2,4100 ha through the KIP, but with improvements
being limited primarily to roads and footpaths. For the proposed project,
DKI has doubled its own financial contribution to the KIP, reflecting the
high priority assigned to development investments that benefit the lowest
income groups. *The expanded KIP would provide comprehensive commtnity
development including surface drainage ditches, public water supply,
communal sanitary units, garbage collection facilities, schools and health
clinics as well as paved footpaths and roads, all constructed in accor-
dance with design standards agreed with the Bank (Schedule 5 to the Loan
Agreement). Under the project, there would be greater emphasis than
before on social and sanitary facilities and better planning and coordi-
nation of the program within DKI (paragraph 37).
31.        The KIP investments imply de facto recognition of kampung
residents' right to the property they occupy ard in the past the program
has encouraged residents in affected kampungs to invest both savings and
labor to upgrade their own dwellings. This process of self-help improve-
ment is expected to continue and over a period of years DEI plans to
raise the standards of kampung improvement until most residents have
access to electricity, water and sanitary facilities comparable to those
facilities which will be constructed under the sites and services program.
Sites and Services Develowient
32.        The NUDC will develop for low cost housiug about 130 ha of
sparsely populated land by providing simple urban infrastructure and
services. The site is ideally situated close to sources of employment
in the expanding industrial zone on the eastern edge of Jakarta about
2 km from the Pulo Oadung Industrial Estate, financed under Credit No0
428-IND. The area will be subdivided into about 8,000 residential lots,
most with simple "core" houses, consisting of a tiled roof, compacted



- 10 -
earth and lime floor., bamboo matting wall,p piped water and a sanitary
unit draining into a septic tank. Roads, drainage and water supply
systems and commity buildings including schools and health clinics
will also be constructed, Space will be reserved for recreation areas
and mosques. Demonstration houses wil be constracted aad DXI will
conduct a training program with the assistance of NUDC to teach the now
residents how to complete and expand their core unitso The sites and
services program involves a higher standard of urban amenities than does
the KIP because most of the development costs (about 84 percent) will be
racovered from purchasers of the lots. As a condition of effectidvenss
of the proposed loan title to the site will be vested in NUDO,
33.        There wil be three lot sizqs: 8Cm2 lots (about 70 percant);
14Qh21ots (about 24 percent); and 2OCb'- lots (about 6 percent). Core
houses will be constracted onl;y on the 8Cm2 and 14012 lots, There ill
also be commercial lots In selected areas to allow for orderly derelop-
ment of markets and small buRinesses to serve the residentsa These
comrcial lots and the 20QOu lots Wil be sold by NUDC on a cash basis
at market price. The 80m2 and 14Om'I lots would be sold by NUDC to low
income residents of Jakarta who satis;f  eligibility requirements.
Parchasers of these lots would finance their lot and core house with the
assistance of mortgage loans from NMB covering up to 90 percent of the
purchase price. Mortgage loans would bear interest at 12 percent per
anmwm and have a termn of up to 15 years. The 140M lots will be sold at
developent cost (about US$1,700 equivalent); profits from the sale of
200h2 lots  il be used to subsidize the price of the 80m2 lots (expected
to be under US$1,O0O equivalent). It is estimated that the 80m2 lots could
be afforded by falie    at approximately the 20th percentile of the income
distribution; the 1W40m lots could be financed by families at the 50th
percentile. The core house design which is more extensive and complete
than in ary previous Bak financed project, is an immediately habitabie
structure.  Therefore, a building materials loan fund has mt been
included as a requisite featur  of the project. However, over tim  the
owners are expected to expand and improve their houses and the Govurrmat
is conidering the establishmnt of a building materials loan sohe    to
assist in financing such improvements. Purchasers would be required to
personally oocupy and maintain their lots. Resale of lots wl be
controlled for a period of five years to discourage fraudulant lot pur-
chases by land speculators. Details of lot sale prices, arrangemnts for
the selection of purchasers, eligibility criteria and conditions of sale
are set forth in Schedule 6 to the Loan Agreement.
Tchnbi al Assistance
34,        (onsltants acceptable to the Bank wl be retained by the
NUDC on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to:
a) assist the Managing Director to develop
NUDDC's policies and procedures;
b) assist the Project Manager in general
project execution, supervision and train-
ing including engineering, accounting and
managemt; and



c) assist in the preparation of feasibility
studies for urban development projects
in other cities.
35,        To improve planning and development for the Jakarta area,
consultants will also be retained by the Cbvernment to assist Cipta
Karya with the technical work of the freater Jakarta Planning Board,
which will be established in the near future (paragraph 27 (e)). The
advisers nf   work with Cipta Karya in developing an econcic and
physical gmwth strategy for the area, determining the priorities of
proposed sector investments within a five-year investment program, and
helping to formulate te-ms of reference for further project studies in
the metropolitan region.
Project Organization
36.        The NUDC would be responsible for overall project execution,
coordination and supervision. For this purpose, a special project unit
has been established within NUDC, staffed by the Mlnistry of Pablic Works
persomnel who have been working on preparation of this project. Appoint-
ment of both the Project Director and the Managing Director of NUDC would
be conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan. The Managing
Director and his staff, with the assistance of the advisers provided under
the project (paragraph 34 (a)), will develop the policies and operating
procedures of the NUDC for the planning, engineering and execution of low
income urban development projects and will prepare an investment program
for NUDC for 1974J/75-1978/7fo A major objective of NUIDC in execution of
this first urban project is to develop a national model for both kampung
improvement and sites and services development which can be replicated
with appropriate variations in projects in other cities.
37.        The KIP investments would be carried out by DE: under the
supervision of NUDG. Since 1969, the various planning and construction
activities for the KIP have been executed by different departments of the
DKI under the general supervision of the Deputy Governor for Development.
However, to execute the expanded KIP and more effectively coordinate the
inputs from various departments, a separate unlit has been established by
DKI and charged with responsibility for KIP implementation. The unit
consists of about 40 experienced professionals from DEI departments
previously connected with the KIP and is responsible for selecting
kampangs to be improved, determining improvementsto be undertaken in
accorcance with established standarcis and local community considerations,
awaraing civil works contracts and supervising on-site construction.
38.        Investments for the sites and services area would be the
responsibility of NUDC (development of the site and its internal infras-
tructure), DKI (on-site schools and health centers), and the Government
(infrastructure outside the site boundaries)0

allow it to function as a mortgage lending institution. The Govenmaent
is currently arranging with bilateral donors for technical experts to
assist NMB develop its operating policies and procedures. The Coverment
has provided NMB with initial equity capital of Rp. 3 billion, and NMB
is empowered to borrow from public and private, foreign and domestic
sources as additional funds are needed for further mortgage financing.
Project Costs and .inancing Arran&ements
4o.        Total project costs, sumnarized in Annex III, are estimated
at US$51.0 mi-llion equivalent, of whiz-h about US$11.6 million (22
percent) is foreign exchange. The proposed loan of US$25 million
equivalent, would finance about 50 percent of total project cost,
including about US$13.4 million of local costs.
41.        The financing plan is summarized in Annex III. Under a sub-
sidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank, the Government would
lend to DKI about US$L8.2 million of the proceeds of the loan to finance
about half the costs of the civil works for the KIP and the foreign
exchaLnge costs of vlehicles. This subsidiary loan would have an interest
rate of 8 percent per annum and would be repayable over 20 years,
including a five year grace period. The balance of the funds required
for the KIP would come from DKiE's budgetary resources.
42.        About $4i. million of the proceeds of the proposed loan would
go to finance part of the construction cost of the sites and services
component of the project. These funds would be used to reimburse half
of the cost incurred by a) DKI for on-site primary schools anci health
centers, b) the Cbvernment for external infrastructure serving the site,
and c) NUDC for on-site development cost. The reimbursements to NUDC
(about US$3 million) would be in the form of a loan from the Government
bearing interest at 12 percent per annum; interest would be capitalized
during construction and the loan would be repayable as housing lots are
sold by NUDC.  In addition, the Government would make available to NUDC,
as equity, about US$2.7 million of the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan
to meet the cost of technical assistance.
43.        NMB would finance mortgage loans in part from its equity and
in part from a loan provided by Govelnment which would be at least
equivalent to the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan used to reimburse
expenditures incurred by NUDC for the sites and services component of the
project. NMB's loan from Government would have an interest rate of 8 to
9 percent per annum and would be repayable in accordance with the aggre-
gate amortization schedules of mortgage loans to lot purchasers. This
arrangement would give NKB a spread of 3 to 4 percent on at least half the
amount of the mortgage loans. This spread, together with earnings on its
equity capital and on its other funds, would provide an adequate income
for NMB. For all of the above on-landing arrangements, the Government
will assume the foreign exchange risk.
Procurement
44.        KIP contracts are unlikely to be of interest to foreign
firms, given their small size, large number, labor intensive nature and



- 13-
short, duration as well as the difficult working conditions in the kampungs.
Therefore, civil works contracts for the KIP (about US$3508 ellion
equivalent) would be awarded after competitive bidding in accordance with
Bnk Guidelines, but 'with advertisements of invitations to bid linited to
local newspapers. All prospective bidders would be required to prequalify
in accordance with established DKI criteria.
45.        Civil works contracts for the sites and services program (about
US$8.8 million equivalent) and vehicles, consisting of garbage and septic
tank vacuum trucks and a fire engine (about US$340,000) would be awarded
after internationaJl competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
Prospective bidders for civil works contracts would be required to pre-
qualify and quialified local contractors -would be allowed a 7½j percent
margin of preference for purposes of bid evaluationr
Disbursoments
46.        The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed against:
a) 50 percent of KIP civil works expendi-
tures certified by NUDC and 50 percent
of sites and services civil woiks
expenditures;
b) 75 percent of local expenditures and 100
percent of foreign expenditures for
consultant services; and
c) 100 percent of the c.i.f. costs for
imported vehicles,
The schedule of Bank disbursements in Annex III is based on a three year
construction period.
47,        Since the first year of the KIP program to be financed began on
April 1, 1974, the proposed Bank loan would finance retroactively up to
$3.5 million of expenditures incurred under the progran prior to loan
signing.
Project Monitorig and Evaluation
48.        A team would be established within NUIC to monitor the economic,
financial and pbysical aspects of both the KIP and sites and services
components of the project, with particular emphasis on the effects of the
project on the people living in the kampungs and the sites and services
area. For this purpose, the consultants to be retained by NUDC would
include an urban sociologist. Fbr the KIP, selected kampungs would be
intensively monitored throughout the planning and execution phases to
assess, inter alia. the impact of commnmity desires on infrastructure
investments., dislocation and resettlement problems, self-help improvements
initiated by people in improved areas, property transfers and rental
occupancies. Ebr the sites and services program a similar evaluation
program would be ccnducted, but would include an assessment of tne success



of the application process in correctly identifying creditworthy
applicants satisfying the eligibility criteria, t1he progress in expand-
ing the core houses, communl.ty response to new neighborhood responsi-
bilities, the mortgage system, and the compliance with property transfer
regulations.
Benefits and Justification
49.        The project is designed to assist ir. the establishment and
strengthening of the Government's institutions established as part of the
Second Development Plan for the execution of urban infrastructure and
housing projects.  Thl experiece gained by NUDC), 2NB3, and the DKI under
this project, as well as the technical assistance provided to IUDC and
to the (h-eater Jakarta Planning Board, would be of importance not only
for this project but would also benefit othel- cities In Indonesia.
50.        The proposed project investments would improve basic standards
of living and labor productivity thrugh:
a) imprved livixg conditions for nearly
20 percent of the urbanized area of
Jakarta (affectirng nearly 20 percent
of Jakarta's population5 or about
890,000 people residing in project
kampungs anid nearly 40, 000 people in
the sites and services area);
b) increased employment opportunities
for low income residents as a result
of imprved access to transport faci-
lities and the expansioln of construe-
-tion activities, of building materials
manufacture and of trade and servioe
sectors in new comqumtl±es;
c) better health for project residents as
a result of investment,s in commuity
and individual sanitary facilities_,
systematic garbage removal, improved
drainage channels, community health
centers, and a less ountaminated water
supply;
d) better educational opportunities for
project residents through a doubling of
the elementary pupil capacity presentlj
available in the projec t kampung
schools and providing three times the
pupil capacity (conpared to the average
for Jakarta) in schools in the site and
services area;



- 15 -
e) vocational training in consttetion
techniques at the site and service area
to aid residents in expading and
improving their houses and in learning
skills needed for eploymt in the
construction sector;
f) the provision of individual home sitea
with core housing for low-income resi-
dnts on mortgae terms, for the first
tim in Indonesia.
51.        If project benefits are measured through imputed rental values
of property in the project ureai/, the wonomict return for both the XIC
ad sites and services componets of the project is estimated at about 17
percent. This figure, of course, does not adequately take into account
the social benefits described in the proceeding paragraphs.
PART V - LEGAL flSThRUIS AND AUTHORITY
52.        The draft Loan Agreemmt between the Republic of Indonesia and
the Bank, the report of the Commttee provided for in Article  I, Section
4 (iin) of the Articles of Agreemnt and the text of a draft resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separate1y.
53.        The special features referzed to in paragraphs 41 to 43 of
this Report are reflected in Sections 3.02 and 3.03 of the Loan Agreement.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would compl with the
Articles of Agreemnt of the Ba*k.
PART VI - _RECOWIDATICN
55.        I recanend that the becutive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

IBRD and IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Cr. No. 127 Irrigation Rehabilitation: USE Million Credit
of September 6, 1968; Closing Date: December 31. l.7
This project includes the supply of earth-moving equipment and
machinery to augment hand labor in rehabilitation work on three irri ation
systems (in Java) and the construction of a fourth (in South Sumatra).
AUl the equipment supplied under the credit is being weell utilized and
disbursements are 98 percent of appraisal timetable.      C ompletion of
the project is expected to be delayed                   in order to
complete much additional needed dxainage work, the financing of which was
not provided for under the credit. These additional costs will be met by
the aovernment. The revised economic rate of return on the project, which
was calculated at 50 percent at appraisal, is now expected to be about 25
percent. The closing date has been postponed to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 154 Highw   s US$ 28 Million Credit of June 20 1963:
The project is progressing satisfactorily. Due to delays in
the delivery of the remaining materials and equipment by suppliers, the
closing date will have to be postponed by six months.
Cr. No. 155  Agricultural Estates; US$16 Million Credit of
June 20.        ls           December 31, 12Th
This credit is for the rehabilitation of two Government owned
estate groups in North Sumatra. The credit became effective six months
after signature, the delay resulting from unforeseen difficulties in the
appointment of management, advisors and visiting inspectors. Delays in
development occurred as oil palm planting material in Indonesia was found
to be genetically unsuited and, an unforeseen sharp fall in rubber prices
seriously restricted the availability of self-generated funds. lELth recent
improvements in management and much higher international prices for rubber
the financial situation of the PM? V is improving.
Now that field and factory standards have been raised to a
good technical level the management has been advised to concentrate on cost
control in order to prepare for the time when produce prices are less
attractive than they are today. The combined efforts of the management,
consultants and IDA supervision missions are      yielding      good
reults 0
V   These notes are designed to infonm the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

October 2   1969: Closing Date:  June 30. 1W
See commnent for Credit No. 334es The closing date has been
postponed by 18 months to June 30, 1975.
Cr. No. 193  FUSRI Fertilizer E2pansion US$35 Million Credit of
aun 17  170 a3amended Hay  9739  Closing Date:
December 31, 197-5
The project has progressed satisfactorily after a new time
schedule was agreed to allow for time required to meet all conditions of
effectiveness and the procurement requirements of all co-lenders. The
urea plant has now been completed, was inaugurated in August by the
President and is producing fertilizer. The gas gathering and transmission
system is nearing completion and sufficient gas is being delivered to the
plant for operation.
Despite capital cost increasea the project has become more
remunerative. Given the substantially lower capital cost compared to
estimates for similar projects presently under consideration, and the
presently expected long-range international prices for Urea, the economic
rate of return, calculated at 14 percent at the time of appraisal, should
now be in excess of 30 percent. Disbursements are expected to be
completed by the Closing Date of December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 194 Agricultural Estates; US$17 Million Credit of
June 15. 1  O; Closing Date:  June 30, 1
This project was for the rehabilitation of two GDvernment-
o-wned estate groups in North Sumatra0  The credit became effective eight
months after signature, the delay resulting from unforeseen difficulties
in the appointment of management advisors and visiting inspectors. Delays
in development occurred as oil palm planting material in Indonesia was
found to be genetically unsuitable, and an unforeseen sharp fall in rubber
prices seriously restricted the availability of self-generated funds.
However, during 1973 a record 3,200 ha of oil palm were planted on PNP VI
and the program will be virtual.y on target. The 1973 rubber program was
reduced following the advice of the last Supervision Mission as PNP IV was
over-extended; if the high standards of replanting now being achieved can
be maintained, it should be possible to increase the size of future programs
again.
Management has improved in the field and factory and reasonable
standards are being maintained. More emphasis is required on cost control
and management has agreed to take the necessary action. Solid progress is
being achieved and PNP VI's financial situation has been greatly helped by
the present higher producer prices. PNP IV has also made marked progress
during 1973 and 1974 and is in a satisfactory financial position,

Cr. No. 195  Irrigation ahabilitation I: US$18.5 Million Credit
of Jue 15, 1970; Closing Date: November 30, 1976
The project includes rehabilitation and drainage works over
136,000 ha. After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of
tender documents and difficulties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is
now prmceeding somewhat better. Problems of quality and progress still
exist, but, the ccnsultants are tackling these vigorously, and this
situation is improving. Costs are likely to exceed the overall appraisal
estimate, but the Government will provide any additional funds required.
Completion of disbursements will be about two years behind the original
schedule.
Cr. No. 210 Telecommunications: US$12.8 Milldon Credit of
Jul 3.2 1970; Closing Date: December 31. 1975
After a slow start, due to procurement difficulties, orders
for all equipment have now been placed. Mhe management consultants have
completed their work but have been retained to implement their recommenda-
tions. The Government has recently increased the tariffs to achieve the
required rate of return and a new charter for PEU1aMTEL has also been
preparedo  The closing date has been postponed by 18 months due to delays
in delivery of goods.
Cr. No. 211  Fisheries; US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13. 19702
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
After a slow start, this project is now proeressing satis
factorJiy. Project management satisfactory to the Association has now
been appointed; contracts with engineering and management consultants
have been concluded and the consultants have begun work and the contract,
for the shore facilities has been awarded.
Cr. No. 216 Technical Assistance II; US$4.0 Million Credit of
Septemrber 15e 1-9701 ClosSlg Date: Decembex.LIL Ll1
This project is progressing satisfactorily, but it has been
necessar to postpone the closing date by one year to camplete disburse-
ments for on-going studies.
Cr. No. 219 Education; US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, ;2.0-
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Project implementation is generally satisfactory. Civil works
are progreasing well and will be completed before end 197$. Tenders for
furniture were invited in June and items will be delivered during the last
month of '1974. Contracts for about 60 percent of the equipment have been
awarded and will be delivered before the TTCs start operations in 19757
The remalning equipment is being retendered because incomplete bids were
received. All equipment will be delivered by September, 1975.    Technical
assistance is provided by ODA. Cost overnms on construction, furniture,
and equ-ipment, and savings on technical assistance will probably result in
a total cost overrun of about 30 percent above the appraisal estimate.
The Gov;ernnent      will    provide funds to meet this overrun.

Cr. No. 220 Irrigation Rehabilitation II- US$14.5 Million Credit of
November , 1970; Closing Date: December 31 1975
This project covers 202,000 ha and includes rebabilitation and
re-introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two
in Java and one in South Sulawesi. Construction remains about two years
behind schedule. The problems with preparation of contract documents,
which have caused this delay, have been overcome and, while no further
delays are expected, it is unlikely that the time lost could be regained.
There has been some increase in overall project costs, which is being met
by the Government. Sensitivity tests run at the time of appraisal showed
that a two year delay and 15 percent cost overrun would reduce the economic
rate of return frcm 25 percent to 21 percent.
Cr. No. 246  Seeds; US$7.5 Millon Credit of May 14, 197l1
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
Project implementation is behinld schedule due to initial
delays in organization, management and effective procurement. The latest
supervision mission has reported that development of the Seed Farm is
hampered by the slow execution of a contract to develop irrigation infras-
tructure. Project agencies and the Government are now discussing steps
which need to be taken for timely completion of the irrigation works. The
establishment of rice-seed research facilities at the project site is
progressing slowly due to difficulties in recruiting qualified local staff
to work at the somewhat isolated site in the absence of adequate salary
compensation under civil service regulations. This matter is now being
reviewed within the Bank before being discussed with the Government. The
seeds certification service is performing well and development of the
Klaten Seed District is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 259  Tea; USt1 million Credit of June- 24, 11;
Closing Date: June 30. 1978
This credit is for the rehabilitation for two groups of
CGovernment-owned tea estates in West Java. Despite management weaknesses
in cost control and efficiency, progress to date is satisfactory and
relationships between management and consultants are good. Recently
revised cost estimates for factory rehabilitation and expansion are sub-
stantially above appraisal estimates and project consultants are reviewing
them.
Cr. No. 260  Highwasl; US$35 Million Credit of June 24, 1271;
Closing Date: September 30. 1975
This project is in Sumatra and consists of construction with
supervision of about 200 km of highway, detailed engineering of further
highway sections and a regional development study. All construction work
is now satisfactorily underway. However, the delay caused initially by
slow progress on mobilizing contractors, difficulties in equipment delivery,
heavy rains and land slides will result in the project being completed about
one year behind schedule. Design standards for the road sections have been
slightly lowered and some savings will therefore be achieved. These and
other savings are expected to offset construction cost increases,

Cr. No. 275 Technical Assistance III; US$4.0 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Closing Dates December 31, 1975
Progress on this project is aatisfactory. The closing date
has been postponed to complete disbursements for ongoing studies.
Cr, No. 288  Secmd Education: US$6g3 Million Credit of
March 2i 1972: Closing Date: December 31. 1976
Due to inexperience of the PIUJ, late selection and appoint-
ment of the consultant architects and late recruitbnt of the technical
assistance experts., project implementation is now about six- months behind
schedule. The PIU hopes to regain part of the time lost by rescheduling
project implementation. Working dravings and furniture and equipment
lists for all project institutions are almost completed. Physical facili-
ties will be completed by Cctober 1976 and all project institutions will
begin operations by the end of 1976. However, this schedule depends
great2y on timely provision of adequate government funds, which becauLse of
an expected cost overrun of US$B.6 million will have to be substantially
increased. Postponement of the closing date by about six months is likely
tc be required.
Cr. No. 289  Irrigation Rehabilitation IV;_US412., Million Credit
of March 9. 12721 CUsing Date:z June_30, 19Y7_
The project is located in East Java and consists of rehabil:.-
tation of the irrigation system and the re-establishment of satisfactor,7
operation and maintenance procedures in five non-contiguous areas total-
ling 229,000 ha, known as Pekalen-Sampean.  It also provides for the
employment of consultants to assist in the execution of Pekalen-Sampean
and for feasibility studies of further irrigation rehabilitation proJects.
Civil works and equipment purchase for the main project, Pekalen-Sampeax±,.
are just beginning and completion of civil works will be about one year
behind schedule.  Consultants for the various studies are at work with
their counterparts. Groundwater investigations will be delayed due to
procurement difficulties. The rehabilitation and storage feasibility
studies are on scheduleo Disbursements are on schedule.
Cr     NJ_00  Po lation  US   .   ilon Credit of Ap l20L 19 2;
Closing Date:s June 30J, 1y7
Progress under the project continues to be hampered by manage-
ment weaknesses and delays in obtaining local currency funds because of
restrictive Government budgetary procedures. Vbhicle procurement, which
has been delayed due to the Goverrunent ban on importing fulJy built-up
cars, is now proceeding satisfactorily. After initial delays, constractiori
of health centers is now proceeding.
Cr. No. 310 DevelopMent Finance; US$10 Million Credit of
June 7, 1972; Closing Date: December 61, 1976
This credit is now nearly fully committed. Disbursements are
expected to rise rapidly.

Cr. No. 318 Inter-Island FLeet Rehabilitation; US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28. 1972; Closing Date: September 30. 1976
Progress on this project is satisfactory but the weak finan-
cial position of PELNIs the Government-owned shipping company and main
sub-borrower, has caused concern. An audit of PELNI has been completed
and in consultation with the Association and BAPINDO, the Government is
taking appropriate action to strengthen PEINI's financial position.
Cr. No. 319 Agicultural Estates IV; US$11 Million Credit of
June 28. 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
This project includes the rehabilitation of a Cbvernment owned
estate group in southern Sumatra. It includes planting or replanting of
11,000 ha of oil palms and rubber; improved upkeep of 12,000 ha of exist-
ing immature and mature plantations; fertilizers, agricultural machinery;
estate housing and vehicles; processing facilities; rehabilitation of the
port palm oil bulking installation; and technical assistance for managements
rssearch, crop diversification and marketing. The project has recovered
from initial delays and has made the best progress of any of the Indonesian
estates projects. There is a need, however, for much increased attention
to training of the top management staff. Agricultural conditions are now
generally very good, rubber production is 50 percent higher than in the
corresponding period of 1973 and financial control is slowly improving.
Increased emphasis is now being placed on estate cost accounting and
accurate budgetting.
Cr. No. 334  Electricity Distribution II; US$40 Million Credit of
September 29, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The Jakarta Distribution Project, financed from Credits 165
and 334-IND (together US$55 million), is now, after initial difficulties,
proceeding satisfactorily. The total foreign cost is presently estimated
at US$56e2 million, about US$1.2 million above the Credit anxunts. The
Government is expected to finance the overrun. Completion i8 expected by
end 1976.
Cr. No. 355 Beef Cattle Development; US$3.6 Yillion Credit of
January 31, 1273; Closing Date: March 31, 1980
Increased costs, due to inflation and exchange adjustments,
will be offset by higher sale prices for cattle but have cased cash
flow problems, which are being resolved.

Cr. No. 358 North Sumatra Smallholder Development US$5 Million Credit
of Febru2a    i  15,73;5 Clsn  Dae    Deeme  _1,18
This credit became effective on August 13, 1973 and has suffered
from severe financial and organizational diffitulties due primarily to the
lack of experience of project maaagement, the remote location of the project
and inadequate Central Goverment support. The Resident Staff has been
following the project closely. Government has taken a nwnber of steps to
overcome the problems and accelerate prooject implementation. Project
progress will continue to be closely monitored.
Cr. No. 387 Education III: US$13.5 Million Credit of
June 1, 1973i Closing Date: December 31. 1981
This credit was declared effective on August 30, 1973. Manu-
script preparation and testing are on schedule and the first year's staff
training programs winl be completed in sufficient time to enable the mobile
teacher training teams to start operation in January 1975 as planned.
Equipment procurement, which has been delayed by about nine months partly
because of the government's reluctance to perndt the import of vehicles is
now -under way. Because of the sharp increase in worldwide paper prices and
ahortage of supply, difficulty will be experienced in obtaining sufficient
paper under the Canadian loan included in the project financing for the
1975 printing schedule, The Central Government has undertaken to release
supplies from its stockpile. The expected cost overrun arising from
increased paper prices is likely to be met by the Indonesian Government.
Project management is good and the team of technical assistance specialists
is operating effectively.
Cr. No. 388 Hihwys 3IU: USS      Million Credit of June 1. 1973;

This credit is for the construction of 124 km. of highway and
two bridges in North Sulawesi and the study and detailed engineering of
further highways in Java, Construction bidding and consultant selection
have been proceeding on schedule. Some cost increases, due to inflation,
are expected, which might be partly offset by savings on other parts of
the project.

The effectiveness of this credit was delayed because it took
longer than expected for the Government to implement legal and institu-
tion changes to amalgamate existing PNPs into larger PT estate groups and
to establish a joint sugar projects unit to provide overall coordination.
These changes have now been implemented and the credit became effective in
April 197h. However, the Government engaged the necessary consultants'
services prior to credit effectiveness and work is proceeding on schedule.
Cr. No. 428 Pulo Gedung Industrial Estates US$L6.5 Killion Credit
of Se tember 1417a Closing Date: December 11 1 86
Despite recent increase in construction costs, the project
remains financially viable because revemues from the sale of plots has
risen proportionately. Construction is proceeding at an acceptable rate
and developed land is being occupied as fast as it is made available.

Procurement Arrangements:   KIP contracts are unlikely to be of interest to
foreign firms given the small size, large number
and short duration of KIP contracts and difficult
working conditions in the kampungs. Therefore,
civil works contracts for the KIP (about US$35.8
million equivalent) would be awarded after com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines,
but with advertisements of invitations to bid
limited to local newspapers. All prospective
bidders would be required to pre-qualify in accor-
dance with established, satisfactory criteria
of DKI.
Civil works contracts for the site and services
area (about US$8.8 million equivalent) and vehicles,
consisting of garbage and septic tank vacuum trucks
and a fire engine (about US$340,000) would be
awarded after international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Guidelines. Prospective
bidders for civil works contracts would be required
to pre-qualify and qualified local contractors
would be allowed a 7-1/2 percent margin of pre-
ference for purposes of bid evaluation.
