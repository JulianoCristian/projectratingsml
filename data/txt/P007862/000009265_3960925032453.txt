HEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
Subject:    Project Completion Note on Paraguay -
First Preinvestment Studies Proiect (Credit 587-PA1
Attached, for information, is a copy of a report entitled "Project
Completion Note on Paraguay - Preinvestment Studies I (IDA Credit 587-PA)"
prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office.
The LAC Region has been unable to prepare a full Project Completion
Report (PCR) for this credit. Because Bank Group lending operations in Paraguay
were suspended in 1984 as a result of poor Government policies, and only resumed
in March, 1992, earlier work on a PCR was never completed. Project files are
incomplete and key Bank and Government staff associated with the project are no
longer available.
The attached Project Completion Note is provided in lieu of a full PCR.
OED plans to audit the credit in conjunction with the follow-on project,
Preinvestment Studies II (Loan 1780-PA), which was classified as an adjustment
operation.  No rating of the operation is possible at this time.  OED will
provide a rating following its audit.

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
PARAGUAY
PREINVESTMENT STUDIES I
(CREDIT 587-PA)
1.          This is a short Project Completion Note for the Preinvestment Studies
I Project to Paraguay which was financed by the proceeds of IDA Credit 587.
2.          The Credit for US$4. 0 million was approved on August 21, 1975, signed
on October 17, 1975, and became effective on April 15, 1976.   Initially,
implementation of the credit lagged with respect to the original schedule due to
delays in hiring new personnel to staff positions required by this credit and
other start-up problems. Timely disbursement vas also adversely affected by the
lack of promotion of this project and the limited demand for preinvestment
finance from the project arising from the discipline imposed by the Preinvestment
Fund rules on the process of awarding contracts. However, substantial extensions
and amendments to the Credit Agreement permitted full disbursement. The last
disbursement took place on August 2, 1983.
3.          This text and the attached statistical information were prepared by
the Trade, Finance and Private Sector Development Division, Department IV of the
Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office (LA4TF) and is based, inter alia,
on the President's Report, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.
4.          A full PCR has not been prepared for this project.  The files were
less than complete, and many Paraguayan and Bank staff associated with the
project in the 1970s and early 1980s are now unavailable. Poor macroeconomic and
other development policies led to the suspension of Bank lending to Paraguay in
1984, shortly after the project was completed, and new Bank operations in
Paraguay were virtually eliminated. As a result, the Bank's earlier efforts to
complete a PCR were not encouraged. In addition, the coup of 1989 weakened the
administrative capacity of the Government and more personnel that had worked on
the project were replaced. Thus, it would b- quite difficult to complete a full
PCR on the project at this time. The following attachment includes the most
relevant information still available on the project.
