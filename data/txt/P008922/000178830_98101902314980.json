applicable to\n            the Bati Raman reservoir, based on its geological structure\n            reservoir rock characteristics and fluid properties, to\n            determine the most technical and economically appropriate\n            enhanced recovery technology; (b) based on the findings of\n            the comparative feasibility study, the development of design\n            parameters and estimated capital cost of the recommended\n            pilot plant, to be followed-up by detailed engineering\n            thereof including the preparation of working drawings,\n            technical specifications and tender documents; (c) obtaining\n            additional core and fluid samples for the reservoir,\n            including provision of specialized equipment and drilling\n            supervisory services, geological evaluation of reservoir on\n            the basis of new core sampling; and (d) specialized training\n            abroad in enhanced oil recovery techniques,
