                         skills needs of employers and higher education; c. Providing professional development for teachers and administrators on new technologies, curricula, assessment and
                         management techniques; and d. Strengthening institutional capacity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During recent months, the implementation of project activities has made significant progress guided by the work of the Director of the Education Support Fund, the Steering
                         Committee and the commitment of the reduced group of professionals working at the PPMU. Some of the achievements include the completion of the curriculum framework; the
                         training of almost 50,000 school managers, 21,000 seconded school managers or deputies, and 24,000 teachers, which represent over 90% of the original target; the rehabilitation of
                         50 secondary schools is almost completed, representing over 70% of the original target, and an additional 20 are due to commence shortly. They will be financed Government funds

                         or project funds if project funds are not available. During the last visit, the World Bank issued no objections for the purchase of sports equipment and musical instruments.
                         There are still almost US$10 million of undisbursed funds that could be used if payment procedures related to school rehabilitation are expedited and planned activities are completed
                         before the project closing date (30 June 2012). Based on available information, the World Bank team estimates that an additional US$7.2 million could be disbursed by the end of the
                         project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Ministry of Education on behalf of the Government of Egypt should nominate a senior official familiar with SEEP to take on the responsibility for organizing and overseeing the
                         preparation of the Government's project completion report. This report should be completed by the end of July 2012. This official should also be designated as the formal contact with
                         the Bank during the preparation and review of the Bank's Implementation Completion Report (ICR).

                         project completion report and to provide inputs to the Bank's ICR.
