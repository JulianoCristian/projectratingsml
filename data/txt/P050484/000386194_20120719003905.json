The SEEP was presented to the Board on April 15, 1999.\n            The credit agreement was signed on April 19, 1999 but only\n            became effective on June 29, 2000. The change is in response\n            to a request from the Government of the Arab Republic of\n            Egypt to extend the closing date from June 30, 2012 to\n            October 31, 2012. If granted this will be the fourth closing\n            date extension for this project. The extension is necessary\n            to complete the rehabilitation of additional 67 schools\n            during the summer so they can meet minimum quality\n            requirements for accreditation and thus help achieve the\n            project's quality of education objectives."}, "docdt": "2012-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
