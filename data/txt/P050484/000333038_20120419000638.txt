                                       equivalent)
     (1) Works                                10,800,000                    90%

     (3) Training                              5,000,000                   100%

2. The project has disbursed a total of SDR30.75 million (US$47.66 million equivalent)
   and the reallocation will make it possible to fully disburse the project funds.

3. During the last year, the project has made significant progress in equipping schools
   with multipurpose science and computer labs, and training teachers, school principals,
   school managers and members of the education boards. Progress has been achieved
   in establishing a solid basis for reforming the curriculum where course descriptions
   and syllabi for core subjects have been developed and a curriculum framework has
   been presented to the Ministry of Education (MOE) management team for approval.

4. The proposed reallocation is necessary to complete the rehabilitation of project target
   schools. This will help these schools meet minimum infrastructure standards required
   for accreditation by the National Quality Assurance and Accreditation Authority
   according to a new education quality initiative undertaken by the MOE. This
   reallocation will help meet the quality improvement objectives of the Project such as
   better alignment of the curriculum with the needs of the labor market, upgrading
   schools and improvement of teachers’ skills.
