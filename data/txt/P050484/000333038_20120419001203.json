The project has\n            disbursed a total of SDR30.75 million (US$47.66 million\n            equivalent) and the reallocation will make it possible to\n            fully disburse the project funds. During the last year, the\n            project has made significant progress in equipping schools\n            with multipurpose science and computer labs, and training\n            teachers, school principals, school managers and members of\n            the education boards. The reallocation is necessary to\n            complete the rehabilitation of project target schools. This\n            will help these schools meet minimum infrastructure\n            standards required for accreditation by the National Quality\n            Assurance and Accreditation Authority according to a new\n            education quality initiative undertaken by the Ministry of\n            Education (MOE). This reallocation will help meet the\n            quality improvement objectives of the Project such as better\n            alignment of the curriculum with the needs of the labor\n            market, upgrading schools and improvement of teachers' skills."}, "docdt": "2012-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
