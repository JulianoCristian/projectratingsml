{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Secondary Education\n            Enhancement Project (SEEP) for Egypt were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: in this first venture into the secondary education\n            subsector, goals for change in content and processes should\n            have been much more modest. Project teams and sector\n            management need to resist the temptation to try to fix all\n            problems in a single operation, particularly, in a first\n            operation in a subsector. The errors and inconsistencies in\n            presentation of the project development objective (PDO) and\n            the gaps in performance indicators obscured the links\n            between interventions and objectives in the SEEP, and\n            hindered project implementation. Statements of a\n            project's development objective should be clear,\n            logical, and consistent, ideally, repeated verbatim across\n            project documentation and throughout the course of project\n            implementation. Key performance indicators should reflect\n            all of the main elements of the PDO. The 2010 project\n            restructuring was seriously late in reflecting changing\n            implementation circumstances. Even then it did not address\n            disconnect between the new activity, upgrading general\n            secondary schools, and the project description and PDO\n            instruments. The restructuring was also directed to senior\n            management, without a documented consideration of whether\n            circumstances may have warranted Board approval. In order to\n            be the constructive tool that it is meant to be, project\n            restructuring needs to be timely and appropriately directed."}, "docdt": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
