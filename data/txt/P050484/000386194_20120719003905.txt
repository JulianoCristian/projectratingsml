                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

1     This restructuring paper (RP) seeks the approval of the regional vice president
(RVP) to extend the closing date of the Secondary Education Enhancement Project
(SEEP), IDA Credit No. 3194-EGT by four months from June 30, 2012 until October 31,
2012.

2       The Secondary Education Enhancement Project (SEEP) was presented to the
Board on April 15, 1999. The Credit Agreement was signed on April 19, 1999 but only
became effective on June 29, 2000. The original closing date was June 30, 2006. The
project has been extended three times. The first extension was until June 30, 2008; the
second extension was from June 30, 2008 to June 30, 2010; and a third extension was
from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012. The proposed change is in response to a request
from the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt to extend the closing date from June
30, 2012 to October 31, 2012. If granted this will be the fourth closing date extension for
this project.

3       The original credit amount was SDR 35.8 million, of which SDR 4.4 remains
undisbursed, equivalent to USD 6.7 million. The project has current commitments
equivalent to USD 6.3 million for goods, civil works and services that based on a review
of their implementation schedule the World Bank team firmly believes that would be
delivered by October 31, 2012.

4      The proposed extension is necessary to complete the rehabilitation of additional
67 schools during the summer so they can meet minimum quality requirements for
accreditation and thus help achieve the Project’s quality of education objectives. The
schools to be rehabilitated have already been identified and the General Administration of
School Buildings (GAEB) has already begun the actual rehabilitation process.

5       The extension will also contribute to complete the evaluation of the teacher
training activity in a more satisfactory manner.

6      The Task Team confirms that: (i) the project developmental objectives continue to
be achievable during the extension period; (ii) the performance of the PPMU continues to
be moderately satisfactory; (iii) the project rating with respect to the PDO and IP is
moderately satisfactory; (iv) the client has prepared a realistic plan that can be
implemented before the revised closing date; and (v) no audit reports are outstanding for


                                             1
the project. Accordingly, the proposed extension is justified and necessary for securing
the sustainability of the impact of the Bank’s supported intervention.
