 2 The project has disbursed a total of SDR34.79 million (US$53.66 million equivalent)
   and the reallocation will make it possible to fully disburse the project funds.
 3 During the last year, the project has made significant progress in completing and
   getting Ministerial approval of a Core Curriculum, rehabilitating project schools to
   bring them up to standards so they can be accredited by the by the National Quality
   Assurance and Accreditation Authority (NQAAA) according to a recent quality
   initiative undertaken by the MOE; equipping schools with multipurpose science and
   computer labs; and training teachers, school principals, school managers and
   members of the education boards.
 4 The proposed reallocation is necessary to complete the rehabilitation of project target
   schools which in turn will help these schools meet minimum infrastructure standards
   required for accreditation by the NQAAA.
 5 The Task Team confirms that: (i) the project developmental objectives continue to be
   achievable after the reallocation; (ii) the performance of the PPMU continues to be
   moderately satisfactory; (iii) the project ratings with respect to the PDO and IP are
   moderately satisfactory; and (iv) no audit reports are outstanding for the project.
   Accordingly, the proposed reallocation is justified and necessary to fully achieve the
   project development objectives.
