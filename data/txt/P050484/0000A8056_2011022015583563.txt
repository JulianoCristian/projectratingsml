                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After 10 years of implementation the project has disbursed 80% of the original project funds, corresponding to US$43.6 million. This leaves a total of US$12.0 million equivalent which
                         must be disbursed during the next 18 months before the project is closed.
                         On 29 June 2010 the project was extended for a third time until 30 June 2012. The extension was granted to facilitate completing the development and validation of the curriculum
                         frameworks; the design of core curriculum subjects; training teachers in the new curriculum framework; and to complete the rehabilitation of project schools so they can meet

                         reason for this is the appointment of a totally new management team that had to get acquainted with the project and with World Bank procedures. However, there are signs that the
                         project is beginning to catch up as reflected in the US$1.1 million that was disbursed during December 2010.
