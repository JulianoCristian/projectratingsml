                         To improve the quality and opportunity in secondary education by: a. Increasing access to general secondary education through upgrading commercial schools
                         to technological general schools and providing flexible options for study within and between branches of the system; b. Better aligning curricula and
                         assessment with the skills needs of employers and higher education; c. Providing professional development for teachers and administrators on new
                         technologies, curricula, assessment and management techniques; and d. Strengthening institutional capacity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After 10 years of implementation the project has disbursed 80% of the original project funds, corresponding to US$43.6 million. This leaves a total of US$12.0 million equivalent which
                         must be disbursed during the next 8 months before the project is closed.
                         On 29 June 2010 the project was extended for a third time until 30 June 2012. The extension was granted to facilitate completing the development and validation of the curriculum
                         frameworks; the design of core curriculum subjects; training teachers in the new curriculum framework; and to complete the rehabilitation of project schools so they can meet

                         Since the project was extended the implementation of the project has not progressed as predicted by the action plan presented as support to the extension request. The main reason
                         for this is the appointment of a totally new management team that had to get acquainted with the project and with World Bank procedures. However, there are signs that the project is
                         beginning to catch up as reflected in the selection of 55 schools for rehabilitation in order to help them comply with minimum accreditation standards. Also plans to train 5,000 school
