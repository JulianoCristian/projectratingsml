institutional development impacts. Lessons highlight the\n            successful measure taken in the delegation of school\n            construction to professional management, since government\n            construction services, and the recruitment of qualified\n            workers, does not provide good performance, nor incentives\n            to guarantee it. However, had the works and goods to be\n            procured been a condition for appraisal, i.e., launching\n            tenders early on, with bid evaluation as a condition for\n            credit effectiveness, transparency and early implementation\n            would have been ensured. Moreover, given the weak\n            implementation capacity, a careful assessment of\n            implications on the work load becomes essential to prevent\n            serious delays. Such a situation would have considerably\n            been relieved, had procurement of works and goods been\n            front-end loaded, allowing extra time to improve core\n            skills. As for the capacity of communities (and families) to\n            finance education, it should be carefully assessed and\n            monitored, as well as other contributions likely to be made\n            - e.g., to primary health care - since, similarly, a\n            sustainable community response will likely depend on their\n            participation in management responsibilities. Regrettably,\n            such arrangements that prod civil society's role in the\n            management of funds, are not yet clear. Monitoring criteria\n            should ensure that priority sector work is implemented,\n            particularly in the transition from project lending to\n            budget support."}, "docdt": "2002-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
