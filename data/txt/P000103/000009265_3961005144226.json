This project will support its\n            implementation, largely concentrating on primary education,\n            with a focus on girls' participation, and has the\n            following objectives: 1) increase access to primary school,\n            with a specific emphasis on girls' participation both\n            at primary and secondary levels; 2) improve the quality and\n            internal efficiency of primary and secondary education; and\n            3) improve the institutional capacity for planning and\n            managing the sector's human and financial resources. To\n            achieve these objectives, the project will: a) expand\n            primary school rehabilitation and reconstruction by\n            beneficiary communities and implement programs to increase\n            girls' participation at the primary and secondary\n            levels; b) develop in-service training for primary school\n            inspectors, pedagogic counselors and school directors, and\n            management training for secondary school heads; c) provide\n            and distribute textbooks and teachers's guides at the\n            primary and lower secondary levels; and d) strengthen its\n            planning and programming capacity and develop its capacity\n            for financial and human resources management."}, "docdt": "1994-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
