INTERNATIONAL BANK FMI RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPIENT
REPCRT AND RECOMNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO FOR A POPJLATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an anount in various currencies equivalent to $3.0 million to the
Government of Trinidad and Tobago. The loan would finance the foreign
exchange cost of a population project designed to support government
policies on family planning. It would be for a term of 25 years,
including 10 years of grace, with interest at 71¼ percent.
2.        The status of previous Bank loans to Trinidad and Tobago is
summarized in Annex I. An economic memorandum on Trinidad and Tobago
and an appraisal report on the proposed project (PP-6a) are being distributed
separately. Country and project data sheets are attached hereto as Annexes
II and III.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
3.        The Bank made its first loan to Trinidad and Tobago, for power,
in 1961. Since then, total Bank lending net of cancellations has amounted
to $46.4 million. Of this, the Bank now holds $28.3 million, including
$16.8 million not yet disbursed. One-half of the lending has been for
power, about one-fifth each for highways and education and the remainder
for an agricultural settlement project. The first power project is
completed and the second one is expected to be completed by early 1972.
After some initial difficulties, good progress has been made in the agri-
cultural project. There are delays in the highway project, due largely
to the poor performance of the initial consultants who were replaced late
in 1969. Progress on the education project has been good, with work
started on 13 out of 20 new schools.
4.        The political stability achieved under the leadership of
Prime Minister Eric Williams, head of the People's National Movement,
was seriously endangered in April 1970, when demonstrations against
the trial of some students in Canada deteriorated into civil disorders.
Since early May 1970 Trinidad has been fairly calm, and in November the
state of emergency imposed last April was lifted. General elections have
been announced for May 24, 1971. Since the family planning program of the
Government is not in dispute among the various parties, a continuation of
the program appears reasonably certain whatever the outcome of the elections.
5.        The latest economic report (WH-192a), distributed to the
Executive Directors on September 3, 1969, highlighted the possibility
that crude oil reserves might not last more than ten years, and that



- 2 -
Trinidad, whose quite high per capita GNP (around $770) is generated
mainly by petroleum, could be faced with a severe cutback in its GNP
if no alternative sources of incGme were developed in the meantime.
Diversification away frcm oil, therefore, appears essential, so as to
provide additional employment opportunities for the rising labor force.
6.        Particular attention was given in the economic report to the
scope for rapid development of tourism as an alternative source of
income and employment. Trinidad and Tobago have a considerable tourist
potential, but the Government has been reluctant in the past to encourage
the expansion of this sector because of its concern that a large influx
of foreign tourists might give rise to difficult social problems.
Trinidad's Five-Year Development Plan, published in 1969, did never-
theless foresee a major increase in foreign exchange earnings from
tourism. However, the political disturbances have resulted in a set-
back to the develojpment of tourist facilities in Tobago, and the out-
look on the demand side is now distinctly less promising than it seemed
two years ago.
7.        By contrast, the outlook for oil has changed con sderably for
the better during 1970. Amoco, a subsidiary of Standard Oil of Indiana,
has confirmed the existence of an important oil and possibly a very large
gas field off the east coast of Trinidad. Amoco now plans to produce
some 5t,OOO barrels a day by the end of 1971 - or about ono-t>ird of
Trinidad's present production - and there are reasonably good chances
that this output will be doubled by the end of 1972. As to gas, the
reserves seem to provide a basis for a liquefied natural gas venture
oriented to the U.S. market.
8.        The promising developments in the petroleum sector have not
alleviated the pressing need for diversification for The sake of
increasing employment, since the petroleum industry offers only very
limited direct employment opportunities. The disturbances of 1970
have brought to the fore the serious unemployment probleas in the
country. Unemployment in Trinidad and Tobago, excluding under§mploymentt,
is around 14 percent and is concentrated among the young and unskilled.
The Govermzent contribution to coping with this problem has been princi-
pally through actions with a long-run impact, for example, by supporting
a faztly planning program and by making the education system more relevant
to the needs of the economy. In the wake of last year's events, the
Govermnent also initiated a number of job-creating activities, mostly
of the small public works variety, to reduce the number of unemployed.
Howe-vr, it has recognized that this is of little permanent benefit,
unless new economic activities can be found. For the medium-term task
of finding jobs, the Govermnent has relied mainly on the private sector
to promote investment in tourism and in manufacturing.  The Government
is giving special attention to projects in the countryside, designed to
slow down the movement of young people to the urban centers of Port-of-
Spain and San Fernando.



9.        The other issue which the disturbances brought to the surface
was the widespread feeling that, while Trinidad had enjoyed political
independence for almost a decade, the economy was still dominated by
foreigners. National participation in major foreign-owned companies
is now being supported by all parties. In 1970 the Government acquired
the branch of the Bank of London and Montreal and converted it into the
first and only nationally held commercial bank. It also bought 51 per-
cent of the ordinary shares of the British-held Caroni Ltd., the largest
sugar comparn in the country.  In the oil sector, a small company, Trinidad
Tesoro, has been set up as a joint venture by the Government and the U.S.
Tesoro Oil Company.
10.       Overall economic growth slowed down in 1970 to about one per-
cent, which was less than the net population increase. However, the
external public debt has remained low, and the service on external
public debt in 1970 amounted to 5.0 percent of exports of goods and
services, net of investment income payments. In these circumstances,
Trinidad is anxious to borrow abroad for productive projects which would
diversify and strengthen the economy, and should be considered credit-
worthy for further external borrowing on conventional terms.
11.       Against this background, the Bank has discussed with the Govern-
ment of Trinidad and Tobago possible Bank lerding operations in fields
where substantial improvements in project preparation and implementation
appear both necessary and feasible, and where Bank participation can help
in building up new institutions or strengtliening existing ones. In
addition to the proposed population project, high priority is given to
directly productive investments, and preparatory work on a development
finance compary operation and a fisheries project is under way, the
latter with FAO assistance. Wiork on a second education project is
scheduled to begin in mid-1971. Financing of economic infrastructure
is also proposed in the next few years to the extent that this will help
the Government to strengthen its administration in this field and main-
tain adequate levels of public investment, particularly in highways.
Preparation of a port improvement project in Port-of-Spain is already
well advanced, and feasibility studies on a second highway project are
about to begin.
12.       Apart from the Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) have, in the
recent past, been the main lenders to Trinidad. So far, IDB's operations
have been 1imited to Fund for Special Operations (FSO) lending for pre-
investment studies, agricultural credit and housing. A large FSO loan
for a water supply project is projected for this year. The IDB also
envisages a 'hard blend" loan for a tourist infrastructure package. CID A
has an active program concentrated at present on transportation studies,
rural electrification and technical assistance. In the field offamily
planning the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) and the
Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) have provided equipment, medical
supplies and technical assistance. The Government's external borrowing
policy has been well coordinated.

PART II - THE PROJECT
13.       The population of Trinidad and Tobago, which was 275,000 persons
at the turn of the century, doubled in the next 46 years and doubled again
in the next 23 years to reach 1.03 million in 1969. This was mainly due
to a large decline in the death rate from 25 per 1000 at the beginning of
the century to 7 per 1000 in 1969. The birth rate remained high from 1900
(37 per thousard) to 1962 (38 per thousand), but has since declined to a
little less than 27 per thousand in 1970, giving a rate cf natural increase
of about 2 percent a year. Because of emigration - largely of skilled
personnel - the rate of population growth has been reduced to 1.4 percent
in 1970. Increased efforts in population planning are essential to redress
the imbalance between population and resources which has slowed down the
improvement in living standards and led to large-scale unemployment,
emigration of skilled personnel and social unrest. In response to these
problems the Government adopted a population policy in 1967. Although
achievements have been substantial in the past two years, the program
experienced a setback in 1970, mainly as a result of the social disturb-
ances. In 1969, over 16,000 women or 6.5 percent of women in the child-
bearing ages accepted family planning services, while in 1970 new acceptors
were fewer than 9,500, which was only half of the Government's target.
14.       The main constraints on the program are:
(i) Organizational: The persons presently in charge of
the program are too low in the organizational structure
of the Ylinistry of Health and do not have the necessary
background and experience to be influential with the
medical and paramedical professions;
(ii) Inadequate physical facilities: In Trinidad 62 per-
cent of births occur in hospitals; this provides an
excellent opportunity for post-partum motivation. The
existing post-partum program had limited success because
of the short stay of women in hospitals (less than 2
days in most cases) and the insufficient number of
trained nurses to cover all cases; the time allotted
to each patient is less than 5 minutes. Family plan-
ning sessions in the health centers are also crowded.
(iii) Insufficient number of medical and paramedical
personnel concerned with family planning: There is
a shortage of nurses in relation to the nurses
trained. In part, this is the result of a substantial



- 5 -
emigratimn of nurses.  Existing facilities and
training curricula do not encourage the training of
sufficient numbers of personnel of high quality
committed to family planning.
15.       The project is designed to overcome these limitations. While
funds will be devoted primarily to the construction and equipment of
buildings, this alone is insufficient to improve the performance of the
whole program. The technical assistance component of the project and the
administrative and other measures accompanying the project therefere
constitute a critical supplement tn the financing of buildings.
16.       The project provides for the design, construction and equipment of
the following facilities:
(i) Medical facilities consisting of:
- a new 100-bed maternity hospital with teaching
facilities at Mmunt Hope, including a family
planning clinic;
- seven new health centers where family planning
and maternal and child health services will be
provided, of which four would have a four-bed
delivery unit attached to them; and one four-bed
delivery unit added to an existing health center;
- a family planning clinic attached to the San
Fernando Hospital to replace the present
inadequate clinic;
(ii) Training facilities to improve training of nurses for
family planning and of other family planning workers,
consisting of:
- building a Family Planning Institute for training
of family planning workers and community leaders
and for administrative offices;
- extension of existing facilities of the Port-of-
Spain Nursing School to increase teaching and
supporting facilities from 200 to 500 students
and dormitories for 100 additional students;
- a new rural community health center at Arima to
train medical, nursing and other personnel in
rural public health work with emphasis on family
planning.
17.       The technical assistance component of the project includes
advisory services to:



(i)  Improve administrative procedures of the maternal and
child health and family planning services;
(ii) Develop a system of continuous evaluation of program
performance and results in terms of its effect on
fertility;
(iii) Introduce family life education in schools to help
create a long-term demand for family planning services
by all sections of the population - men and women;
(iv) Integrate family planning in the basic curriculum of
nurses and improve the training of family planning
workers to create a sense of commitment to the program
by both medical and non-medical workers;
(v) Study the functions of family planning personnel to
secure their most efficient use.
The technical assistance component of the project also provides for an
architect to head the population project section and an external review
mission to evaluate the overall program and make appropriate recommendations
for further expansion.
18.       In addition to the foregoing construction, equipment and technical
assistance, the project includes a number of institutional and administrative
reforms. The most important of these are:
(i)  To overcome the present low status of family planning
within the organization of the Ministry of Health,
family planning would be integrated with maternal
child health (MCH),and this combined service would
be assigned to the present Principal Medical Officer
(PMO) in charge of integrated services. His duties
would be such that he would devote his principal
efforts to the maternal and child health and family
planning program. A third post at the level of
Principal Medical Officer would be created to reduce
the present workload of the PMO.
(ii)  Measures would be taken to slow down emigration of
nurses of whom there is a critical shortage. The
number of nurses who emigrated in 1970 was about
half the graduates in that year. Nurses whose
training will be wholly or partly financed out of
public funds would be bonded to serve a minimum
period of three years in the country's public
service.



(iii) To make the post-partum motivation program more effective,
the Borrower would (a) increase the number of nurse-
midwives engaged in it and would give them special
training for the purpose, (b) extend the program to
other hospitals in the country, (c) arrange for the
follow-up of patients at home six weeks after delivery,
and (d) undertake the construction of a planned
pediatric unit to reduce the pressure on maternity beds
at the San Fernando Hospital, the second largest in the
country.
(iv) To motivate the poorer sections of the population, who
do not deliver in hospitals, the present Family Planning
Aide pilot project (which used non-medical social
workers to motivate women in their homes) would be
extended if found successful. Otherwise an alternative
would be found, in consultation with the Bank, to reach
the poorer sections of the population.
(v) Family planning sessions would be integrated with
maternal and child health services in selected centers;
if found successful this method of delivering services
would be extended to other centers.
(vi) For the purposes of the project, the existing Project
Implementation Unit in charge of the Bank-financed
education project (Loan No. 564) would be reorganized
to include a new Population Project Section, to be
headed by a full-time architect who would probably
be recruited locally on a contract basis. This
section would be responsible for the technical
aspects of the population project. The Project
Implementation Unit would be strengthened for the
efficient carrying out of the construction component
of the project.
19.       The creation of a third post at the level of Principal Medical
Officer and the appointment of a qualified candidate; the provisions relevant
to nurses; and the appointment of an architect acceptable to the Bank to head
the Population Project Section are all conditions of loan effectiveness.
20.       The total project cost, including contingencies but excluding
interest and other charges on the proposed loan during construction, is
estimated at $4.6 million. The proposed loan of $3 million would cover
the estimated foreign exchange component ($2.6 million), plus interest
and commitment charges on the Bank loan during construction.
21.       Contracts for civil works, equipment and furniture would be
let on the basis of international competitive bidding. Bids would be
invited in packages likely to encourage both international and local



- 8 -
contractors. A preference of 15 percent or the existing import duty,
whichever is lower, is proposed for evaluating bids from local manufacturers
of furniture and equipment.
22.       The project is estimated to increase new acceptors from 10,000 in
1970 to 22,000 per year from 1980 onwards. Of this total, 7,000 women would
become acceptors in maternity hospitals and over 5,000 in the project health
centers and family planning clinics.  In addition, 10,200 women are expected
to accept services in other facilities as a result of the training and
technical assistance components of the project. In ccr.sequence, the birth
rate is estimated to decline from 27/1,000 in 1969 to 15.5/1,000 in 1980
instead of 21.5/1,000 without the project. The natural rate of population
increase would be reduced from the current level of about 2.0 percent per
year to 0.9 percent in 1980 instead of 1.5 percent in the absence of the
project. By the year 2000 the population would be smaller than otherwise
by 97,300 or by 6.2 percent and the labor force would be smaller by 37,000
or by 5.2 percent. These demographic trends would improve living standards
of low income groups, and help alleviate the long-term unemployment problem.
The project would also improve the conditicns under which deliveries are
performed and the health and welfare of mothers and children, particularly
among the poorer sections of the population.
PART III - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Loan Agreement between Trinidad and Tobago, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii), of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The pro-
visions of the draft Loan Agreement conform substantially to the pattern
generally found in Bank Loan Agreements.
24.       I am satisfied that the Loan proposed would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IV - REBOOHENDATICTN
25.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
