through the provision of technical assistance to help build\n            up BBD's capacity to identify, promote and assist\n            industrial projects. The project would also offer an\n            opportunity to advise the Government and the Beneficiary on\n            industrial and financial sector issues and policies. The\n            project cost is estimated at US$13.6 million including\n            US$1.3 million in taxes. Foreign exchange costs would be\n            about US$9.1 million or 74 percent of net of taxes cost."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
