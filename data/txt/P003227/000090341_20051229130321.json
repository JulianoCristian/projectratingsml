   performance were both satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            project: Concession bid process should be designed so as to\n            avoid protracted negotiations. The Project should cover all\n            aspects of the concession and restructuring process. Every\n            aspect of the proposed Concession Agreement should be fully\n            discussed with all relevant arms of Government and\n            stakeholders. The Bank should stay involved for at least two\n            years after the concession has become operational. Vigorous\n            social mitigation measures can adjust the adverse impact of retrenchment."}, "docdt": "2005-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
