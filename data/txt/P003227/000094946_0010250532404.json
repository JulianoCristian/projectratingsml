         enable substantial restructuring of Zambia Railways, to\n            increase its operating efficiency, reduce operational costs,\n            and configure its freight services, and tariffs. The\n            components include: 1) railway concessioning, being\n            facilitated by the completion of asset valuation and audit\n            studies. Advisory services will be financed to meet the\n            requirements of the privatization agency to design,\n            negotiate, and implement concession agreements, and, legal\n            assistance will be provided for contract interpretation and\n            dispute resolution, in addition to consultant services and\n            technical assistance (TA) provision; 2) staff retrenchment\n            will be compensated through severance payments, and an\n            additional fifteen percent contingency will be provided to\n            cope with any variations. Pension obligations and\n            liabilities will be funded by the Pension Fund, assured by\n            Zambian Railways Ltd. (ZRL); 3) asset rehabilitation,\n            through the financing of locomotives, and equipment,\n            strengthening of tracks, and procurement of wagon wheels; 4)\n            TA, and consulting services to restructure ZRL, to possibly\n            operate as a downsized state-owned company, but responsible\n            for spinning-off remaining commercial, and non-commercial\n            activities; 5) TA to assess the regulatory framework, and\n            recommend sectoral coverage, and accountability\n            relationships for the regulatory institutions, in addition\n            to TA services in setting an Escrow Fund, to cover\n            retrenchment benefits, operating expenditures, and debt\n            obligations; 6) TA to strengthen the Ministry of\n            Communications and Transport; and, 7) environmental and\n            social mitigation, based on recommendations of the\n            environmental, and social assessments, respectively."}, "docdt": "2000-10-18T00:00:00Z"}
