        potential adverse effects on the environment, resulting from\n            the implementation of the Railway Restructuring Project in\n            Zambia, and, reviews the legislative, and regulatory\n            framework, to determine the remedial measures, and\n            institutional capacities, for compliance and enforcement of\n            environmental and safety-related issues. It is expected that\n            solid, and hazardous waste discharges, such as oil spills,\n            or acid/caustic liquids will occur, while occupational, and\n            safety issues pose serious health concerns. Measures to\n            mitigate adversity call primarily for the development of an\n            environmental policy, and implementation of an environmental\n            management system, ensuring environmental audits every five\n            years. Recommendations suggest the introduction of cleaner\n            production practices, and pollution control equipment for\n            improved disposal of hazardous wastes. Additionally, a solid\n            waste collection, and disposal system should be implemented,\n            including a wastewater treatment plant operation, and\n            maintenance program, and an effluent monitoring program.\n            Site-specific environment, health, and safety plans should\n            be implemented, to include training for operational staff,\n            and inspectors, and, provide appropriate safety attire and\n            accessories. Management review procedures should be\n            responsive to environmental issues, particularly with\n            respect to transported goods. Further issues address the\n            track weed control program, and, the use of wooden sleepers\n            is questioned."}, "docdt": "2000-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
