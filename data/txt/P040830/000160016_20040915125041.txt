   OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthroughexcellenceand independenceinevaluation.


 About this Report
      The Operations EvaluationDepartmentassessesthe programsand activities of theWorld Bankfor two
 purposes:first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank'swork is
 producingthe expected results, and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthrough
 the disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience.As partof this work, OED annually assessesabout 25 percentof
 the Bank's lendingoperations. Inselecting operationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento those that are
 innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations; those for which
 ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhaverequestedassessments; and those that are likelyto generate
 importantlessons. The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport largerevaluation
 studies.
      A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is basedon a reviewof the ImplementationCompletion
 Report(a self-evaluationbythe responsibleBankdepartment)and fieldworkconductedby OED. To prepare
 PPARs, OED staff examineprojectfiles and other documents, interview operationalstaff, and in most casesvisit
the borrowing countryfor onsitediscussionswith project staff and beneficiaries.The PPARthereby seeks to
 evaluateand augmentthe informationprovidedin the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interestto broader
OED studies.
      EachPPAR is subjectto a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally, the
 PPAR is reviewedby the responsibleBank department and amendedasmecessary. The completed PPARis then
sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
 Boardof Executive Directors.After an assessment report has beensent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

About the OED Rating System

The methods offer both rigorand a necessarylevelof flexibilityto adaptto lendinginstrument,projectdesign, or
sectoralapproach. OED evaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Followingis
the definitionand ratingscale usedfor each evaluationcriterion (more informationis availableon the OED website:
http://worldBank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).

Summary

 1.       The Enterpriseand FinancialSector Adjustment Loan, (EFSAL,Loan4159),
inthe amountofUS$95millionequivalent, was approvedonMay 13, 1997, andfully
disbursedintwo tranches, before closingonDecember31,2001. The Enterprise and
Financial Sector TechnicalAssistance Project, (TXLI,Loan3989), inthe amount o f
US$5.0 millionequivalent, was approvedonMarch26, 1996, andclosedon April 30,
2000, after beingfully disbursed. The Capital Markets Development Project, (CMDP,
Loan3999), inthe amount ofUS$9.5 million, was approvedonApril 4, 1996, and closed
on June 30, 1999, after full disbursement.

2.        All ofthe EFSAL's objectives-accelerating the privatization ofthe former
socially-owned enterprises(FSOEs), restructuring andprivatizing the public enterprises
(PES),rehabilitating andprivatizingthebanking system, andestablishing anenabling
environment for corporate andbank governance-were          highlyrelevantto Croatia's
private sector development andfiscal stabilization. However, only one-privatization    o f
the banking system-was      substantially achieved, although at amuchhigher cost than
originally estimated. HundredsofFSOEswere also sold, mostlyvia the route o fmass
voucherprivatization. Butmanylanguishedinthe private sector under poor
management, over-manning, and asset-strippingo fvarious kinds, andthe Croatian
PrivatizationFund(CPF) now holds aportfolio ofpublicly-ownedFSOEsnearly as
numeroustoday as onthe day the EFSALwas approved.

3.        Severalofthe large PESunderwentmodestrestructuring, andcollective losseson
the order o f 1.5 percent of GDP in 1998were converted into a small collective surplus by
2003. However, only onePE-the telecommunications company- relinquishedits
monopoly andwas majority-privatized. The oil company (INA) was partiallyprivatized
in2003, two years after the EFSALclosed, andlikethepower andrailwayparastatals,
retains an effective monopoly. Finally, while the regulatory andenabling environment
for banksexperiencedsharp improvement, suchwas not the case on the enterpriseside.

4.       Becauseonly oneoffour major relevant objectiveswas substantially achieved, the
EFSALoutcomeisratedmoderately unsatisfactory (as comparedto satisfactoryat the time
ofICRreview). The sustainabilityratingofZikeZy remains unchanged, becausethere is
broadsocietalagreementthat privatization ofthe banks andthe telecom parastatalhasbeen
beneficial, andbecauseCroatia's desirefor a closer relationship withthe EuropeanUnion
i s likely,to leadto adeepeningofreforms inthis direction. However, institutional
developmentimpact hasbeendowngradedto modest,reflectingevidencethat, outsidethe
bankingsector, the enablingenvironmentfor private sector developmenthasimproved
little since 1997. Finally, Bank andBorrowerperformanceis downgradedfrom
satisfactoryto unsatisfactory, reflecting, for the Bank, deficiencies indesign and
instrument, and, for the Borrower, insufficient ownership, commitment, and actionto fulfill
the broadprivatization pledgeslaidout inits Letter o fDevelopment Policy.

5.       The majorpurposeo fTAL Iwas to provide advisors, studies, andtraining to
facilitate achievement o fthe EFSALobjectives. A TAL-financed study onupgradingthe
bankregulatory fi-ameworkprovedtimely, as didaudits o fthreebanksthat were rapidly

                                              vi


sold duringthebankingcrisis. Studies identifyingnon-corePE assets andrestructuring
strategieshadanimpact onthe behavior oftwo o f four major parastatalsduringthe time
o fEFSALimplementation. Other studies relatedto EFSALobjectives havebeentaken
upunderthejust-completed SALand/or haveframed discussionsfor apossible
Programmatic Adjustment Loan. Onthis basis, the TAL Ioutcomei s ratedmoderately
satisfactory, slightlyhigher thanthe EFSAL, but a downgradefrom the ICRreview
becauseseveralobjectives concerningprivatization were not reached. The ratings o f
sustainability andBankperformance remainunchangedat likely andsatisfactory,
respectively. ButBorrower performance i s downgradedfrom satisfactory to
unsatisfactory becauseofweak ownership andcommitment to the goals o fthe studies
andconsequentshortfalls inimplementation; andinstitutional developmentimpact from
substantialto modest.

6.       The designofthe CMDP was kept simple, inthe interest of speeding
implementation. Its objectives were to strengthen: the policy framework for capital
markets, especially theregulationo fsecurities; the operational capabilities for securities
depository, registry, clearing, andsettlementfunctions; andpublic understandingo fthe
role o f capitalmarkets. Although beset bymore pressingPSDissues, Croatiahada long-
term interest inpromoting the emergenceo f securitiesmarketsas analternatevehicle for
raising finance, improving corporate governance, attracting foreignportfolio investment,
andspeedingthereallocation ofmismanagedassets intomoreproductive hands.
Therefore, relevanceis ratedsubstantial.

7.       Thanks to the project, and follow-up bythe Borrower, clearing, settlement, and
fiduciary proceduresmarkedlyimproved. Suchwas not the casewithregulation and
expansiono fsecuritiesissuanceandtrading. While at the time ofCMDP closing, the
primarysecuritiesregulatory agency appearedto have gotten offto astrong start, ithas
since laboredunder a series o fbudgetary, judicial, and staff constraintsthat have largely
sidelined it as amarket referee. Only three companies are listed inthe market's top tier,
whereinformation essentialto investment decisionsmustbedisclosedandpublished.
Trading volume relative to GDP has actually contracted. During 1996-2003,commercial
bankfinancing, whichhadbeenscarce andexpensivebeforethisperiod, becamecheap
andabundant, furtherreducingthe allure ofissuingstock. As for the public's
appreciation for the role of capital markets, little appears to have changed. Croatia's
securitiesmarketsare dominated byinstitutions, andare little usedby small investors.

8.      Basedonthese results, the outcome o fthe CMDP is downgradedfrom
satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory, sustainability from uncertainto unlikely, and
BankandBorrower performancefrom satisfactory to unsatisfactory. The Bankfailed to
adequatelyadapt the design(basedlargely on experienceinadvancedmarket economies)
to the Croatian context, while the Borrower abandonedownership ofthe project goals
andlargely ceasedto supportproject implementation. Institutional development impact
remains unchangedat modest.

0 Without complementarymeasuresfor facilitating entry andexit, maintaininghard
 budgetaryconstraints, andimposingcorporatemanagerial accountability,
  privatization is unlikelyto produce significant growth or productivity benefits.

0 Troubled banks shouldbe liquidatedor privatized quickly, andtheir lending
  strictly controlledwhile inthat process.

0 The experiencewith the EFSALsuggeststhat, although additional delays maybe
  incurred andcosts increased, onbalance long-run development benefits are likely
  to be enhancedbycancelingprojects withmajor designflaws and addressingthe
  reformneeds with a superior instrument.

0 Development o fdomestic capital marketsmakes little sense, untilbasic issues for
 private sector development, suchas privatization andfinancial stabilization, have
  beenresolved.

  1.       Background

  1.1      Following independence inJune 1991, civil war andhostilities with neighboring
.countries emerging from the break-up o fthe former Socialist Federal Republic o f
 Yugoslavia caused Croatia's averageper capita income to fall byone-half from 1990 to
  1993. The political situationbegan to stabilize in 1994, and, for three years, economic
 performance markedly improved. However, in 1998, deteriorating fiscal andbalance o f
 paymentperformance, combinedwith over-expansion o f commercialbank credit, and a
 worldwide crisis of confidence linkedto events inEast Asia triggered a serious financial
 crisis. The hasty sale o f 13 "socially-owned" banks, andthe liquidationo f another dozen
 or so, together withthe applicationo ftighter fiscal andmonetarypolicies, restored
 macroeconomic stability in2000, when anew administrationtook power. A subsequent
 resurgence o fearnings fiom tourism, as well as a surge inworker remittances, ledto a
 four-year economic boom. As a result, by2002, Croatia's realper capita incomehad
 fully recovered its previouspeak from 1990.

  1.2      Notwithstandingthese gains, economic reform hasbeen anunevenprocess. While
 financial: stabilizationwas restored, trade liberalized, andthousands o f small and
 medium-sizedenterprises privatized, private sector-led development remains elusive.
 For example, foreign direct investment hasplayed a negligible role inrestructuringnon-
 bankprivatizedcompanies, contraryto the experience inmostother transitioneconomies.
 Industrial exports have also stagnated, hamperednot only byunresolvedproblems of
 enterprise reorganization, but also by the highprevailingwage rate, one-third above the
 average inthe CzechRepublic, twice the levelinSlovakia, and five times the level in
 Bulgaria andRomania.

 1.3       Moreover, public sector indebtedness has grown rapidly, drivenbyinefficient
 spending, a costly, andsubstantially mis-directed, socialwelfare system, the fiscal legacy
 o f a costly rescue o fthe commercial banks, andthe direct andindirect costs o f
 maintaininglargenumbers o fpublic enterprises (PES)andthe Former Socially-owned
 Enterprises (FSOEs) afloat.2 Additional constraints include aninexperiencedand
 politicizedpublic administrationand a semi-dysfunctionaljudicial system.

 1.4       Bythe mid-l990s, anumber o fissuessurroundingthe methods o fprivatization
 hadbeenidentified:

           A residue o fnearly 500 small, commercially less-attractive enterprises (Former
           Socially-Owned Enterprises, or FSOEs) remained inpublic hands, as did 13
           medium-sizedenterprises placedunder the aegis o f the Law on the Rehabilitation
           o f Selected Enterprises, which i s why they were referredto as the "LRSE
           enterprises". Inaddition, ten large public enterprises (PES),dominatingthe
           id-astructureandenergy sectors, remainedlargely autonomous and
           unrestructured, generating annual losses onthe order of2 percent o f GDP.

 ' Average wages inneighboringSloveniaare sixtypercenthigher,but, adjustedfor productivitywhich is
 twice as highas inCroatia, Slovenia's unit laborcostsare also lower.
   FSOEs,generallysmallor medium-sizedenterprises,were givenlegalrecognitionbythe 1991
 TransformationLaw, which establishedthem asjoint-stock companieshavingthe right to privatize. Onthe
 other hand, PESare large, state-ownedenterprises, 10 innumber, which provide core infrastructureand
 utility services, andfor which there was no legalpresumptionofprivatization at their founding.

 0         Auctions stagedbythe Zagreb Stock Exchangeduringthe first wave hadproven
           ineffective     .
           There was apressingneedto transform the bankruptcyprocess from one
           controlledby debtors andpoliticians anddesigned to force debt-for-equity and
           other refinancingterms onreluctant creditors, to one inwhich creditors would
           have a greatervoice, structuring workouts or forcing bankruptcies under court
           supervision.
 0         Cross-links of ownership amongtycoon groups, public enterprises, andbankshad
           produced an avalanche o frelated-party lendingandself-dealing, jeopardizing the
           stability o fthe bankingsystem.
 0         New labor andbankrehabilitation laws were countedonto increaselabor market
           flexibility and address the legacy oftroubled banks.

 1.5       Fromthis diagnosis, the genesis ofthe Enterprise andFinancial Sector
Adjustment Loan(EFSAL), its accompanyingTechnical AssistanceLoan(TAL I),                                         and
the Capitals Markets Development Project (CMDP) emergedto address the most
important bottleneckspreventingcompletion o fthe privatizationprocess.

 1.6       Since 1991, the Bankhas lent atotal o fUS$1,198 millionto Croatia via 22
operations. As o fJanuary2004,12 loanshadclosedand 11hadbeenevaluatedby OED,
o fwhich only 7 hadsatisfactory outcomes.

Economic and Social Progress 1994-2002: Macro Perspectives

 1.7       From 1991to 1993, annual inflationexceeded200 percent, real GDP experienced
a cumulative decline o f28 percent, andrealwages fell by 64 percent. Stabilizationwas
launched inOctober 1993, andquickly succeededinlowering inflationto single-digit
levels andrestoringmoderate-to-high growth (Table 1.1). Debt agreementsreachedwith
extemal creditors in1995-96provided a Wher boost to Croatia's recovery. For the
entire period 1994-2002, real GDP grew an average o f4.3 percent annually, annual

Privatization3

1.8       Throughout the 199Os, Croatia's economy was characterizedbythe dominanceo f
large, unrestructured, publicly-owned enterprises inherited from the periodwhen Croatia
formedpart o fthe former Yugoslavia. At independence, most of Croatia's mediumand
small enterprises were socially-owned, with day-to-day operational managementunder
the control o f a loose coalition ofemployees andmanagers.

1.9       Followingindependence, two waves o fnon-bank enterprise privatization took
place, the first from 1993 to 1996, the secondduring 1997-98. The terms o f the first
wave were framed bya 1991Law for the Transformation o f Socially-owned Enterprises.
Shareso fnearly2,400, mostly "blue chip", enterprises were sold, primarilyto insider
managers andemployees. Collectively, these firms employed roughlyhalfofthe
enterpriselabor force, andgenerateda similar proportion o frevenues. Shareswere sold
at heavily-discountedprices on installment, with low interest rates, andfrequent
forgiveness and extensiono fpayments. For these valuable assets, the Government o f
Croatia (GOC) received an amount equivalent to only 1.4 percent of GDP.

1.10      The secondwave took placeunder the terms ofa 1996Privatization Law.
Vouchersrepresentingclaims onthe remainingFSOEswere distributedgratis to
approximately 340,000 refugees, victims, and fafnilies ofmissing soldiers. These
vouchers, denominatedin"points", representedthe nominalbook value o fthese enterprises
expressedinGermanD-Marks.These couldthenbeusedto bidon actualshares ofthese
enterprises, aprocesswhich took placeinseveralroundsbetweenFebruaryand September
1998. Participantshadthe optionto sell their points to one of sevenPrivatization
InvestmentFunds(PIFs), which is what most o fthemdid, so much so that the PIFswere
ableto gather 93 percent ofall outstandingpointsbythe endo fthe auction.

1.11 Ofthe 471f m s up for second-waveprivatization, mostwere indire financial
straits. Some 20-50 were consideredattractive, but most o fthese were withdrawn from
the massprivatization lists duringthe winter o f 1997. These reverted to the Croatian
Privatization Fund(CPF), where they wereprivatizedby other avenues, oftennegotiated
sales under less-than-transparent terms andmethods. Valuations were inflated, so as to
satisfy the EFSALrequirementthat assets on offer for voucher privatizationbeworth
collectively at leastDM12.5 billi~n.~      Possibly aware that few attractive companies
remained, only two-thirds ofvoucher recipientsregistered their holdings (228,000 out o f
340,000 eligible). Inthe ensuing auctions, bids averagedroughly atentho fthe nominal
bookvalue o fthe firms up for a~ction.~

companies; PIFs, tycoons, andcompany managers for manyo fthe secondwave

(EFSAL,L4159-HR)

Overview

2.1     The EFSALobjectives were fundamentally four-fold: (a) to accelerate
privatization ofthe FSOEs andthe LRSE enterprises; (b) to restructure andprivatize the
PES;(c) to rehabilitate andprivatize the banking system; and(d) to establish the key
elementsofthe enabling environment for enhancedcorporateandbank governance.

2.2     The GOC's Letter o fDevelopment Policyset an optimistic tone about the
magnitude andthe speed ofthe privatization expected. Divestiture o fvirtually all FSOEs
andthe minoritystakesheldbythe CPF inprivatized enterprises was anticipatedbythe
end of 1999, andprivatization o fthe largerPESinthe sectorsof oil, telecommunications,
and the production anddistribution o felectricity within a two-to-three-year timefi-ame.
Four troubled bankswouldberehabilitated, thenprivatized over the next several years.
And the incentives fiamework wouldbeimprovedbylaws alreadyinplace, including
central bank andcommercial bankinglaws passedduring 1992-94; laws liberalizing labor
markets, regulating securitiesmarkets, andestablishingInvestmentFundspassedin
1994-95; a 1996Privatization Law; andnewbanking regulations covering bank
capitalization andprovisioningin 1997.

        FSOEprivatizations wouldbe acceleratedby:

        Mappingthe FSOEsinto four categories, eacho fwhichwas assigneda different
        privatization pathway;
        Introducing massvoucher privatization;
        Strengtheningnon-voucher privatizationthrough modemized regulatorypowers
        accordedto the Croatian Securities Commission (CROSEC) over ZSE auctions;
        Allocating responsibility for the largest privatizations to a Councilo fMinisters,
        aidedbyanew Ministryo fPrivatization, while delegatingresponsibility for
        smaller privatizations (below US$2 million) entirely to the CPF;

        Endowing the CPF with anew, moreprofessionalboard; and
        Endingofallprivatizations underthe Law for Rehabilitation of StateEnterprises
        (LRSE), whichwas responsible for anumbero fdebtor-controlled "cramdowns"
        (forced debt-equityswaps) under soft budgetaryconstraints.

budgetarysupport, expectedto peak at around 3 percent ofGDP in1998, tapering off
rapidly thereafter.

Design,Implementationand Outcome

2.7      FromMay 1997, whenthe EFSALwas approved, untilmid-2000, progress on
enterprise-relatedconditionality was modest. Mass voucher privatization was completed
bySeptember 1998, butwithout givingrise to the restructuring expected. An initialstage
o fINA divestiturehadtakenplace, whereby the oil company swappedits non-core assets
against debts owed to the GOC, andstaffhadbeenreducedbyone third. The paceo f
bankprivatizationacceleratedunderthe duress o faliquiditycrisis during 1998-99. Non-
core assets o fthe Telecommunications Parastatal(HT) were divestedin 1999, and a
minoritystake sold inearly 2000 to a foreign investor.

2.8      Other thanthat, littleprogresshadbeenmadetoward restructuring andprivatizing
the other large PES(INA, HEP, andHZ) or the LRSEenterprises, whose managements
showedlittle interest in, or commitment to, the GOC's privatization pledges. So, inJune
2000, the Bank approachedthe newly-elected coalition governmentto propose several
options for closing the EFSALwithout disbursement o fthe secondtranche. However,
the incoming leadersrequested a closing date extension longenoughfor the GOC to
complete full compliance with all second-trancheconditions. This was basedonthe
GOC'sperceptionthat the EFSALobjectives overlapped inimportant ways with the
GOC's own economicplatformdirected at accelerating energyandrailwayreforms, and
privatizing INAandHT, andthat failure to disbursethe secondtranche would send
marketsthe wrong signal aboutthe administration's reformintentions. Giventhe
operation's major designflaws, alreadyrecognizedbythat time inthe Bank, cancellation
o fthe EFSALsecondtranche, anddesign o f anew, customized adjustmentoperation
wouldhavebeenpreferable.

2.9     Forpurposesof secondtranche disbursement, the key areas o funfinishedbusiness
included: (a) completing privatization o fhalfthe sharecapital heldbythe CPF inthe

                                                   6

FSOEs as o fend-1994; (b) streamliningthe institutionalandincentives fl-amework to
facilitateFSOE andLRSE enterprise restructuring; and(c) restructuringthe PES,
includingprivatizingat least one-fifth of their sharecapital.

2.10     ByDecember 2001, the GOChadmanagedto comply fully with 12o fthe 13
second tranche conditions, andpartially with a thirteenth, requiringthat the 13 LRSE
enterprises bepri~atized.~For this condition, the Bankprovided a waiver, takinginto
account the fact that world shippingmarkets hadplunged into a sharp recession, reducing
bidder interest inany but the most competitive shipyards (which these were not). As o f
end-2003, these five companies remainedunprivatizedandon the public dole.
Collectively, the subsidies andloan guarantees they have received accounted for an
estimated 12percent o f Croatia's public andpublicly-guaranteed debt.8 Onthe final day
o f2001, the secondtranche was disbursed.

2.11 However, beyondtechnical compliance with almost all the second tranche
conditions, it i s instructiveto examine what development benefits have beenreaped from
these actions. Inthis sense, there remains a considerable gap betweenthe promises o fthe
EFSALandits actual achievements.

2.12     The objectives o fthe EFSALwere substantially relevant, clearly relatedto the
priorities highlightedinthe 1995 CAS, butthe EFSALdesign suffered from a numbero f
deficiencies, among which were:

    0    Lack o f any component to deal with the anticipated employment displacement
         effects o frestructuring. The Banktook the positionthat Croatia inherited from its
         membership inthe FormerYugoslavia an economic system which already
         contained a strong safety net capable o f dealingwith any employment effects
         arising from EFSAL-supported ~eforms.~            Thisprovednot to bethe case.
         Croatia's safety net was directed, not so muchtoward the poor or unemployed,
         buttowardpolitically-influential groups, likethe war veterans. Only aminority
         o funemployed(about one-third) received anybenefits. Public employment
         services at the time were limited due to fiscal constraints, while private
         employment services were then virtually nonexistent due to legalrestrictions. lo
         The omission o f an effective labor adjustment component meant that public alarm
         about the employment effects ofreform gatheredmomentum duringEFSAL
         implementation, andmay well have played a factor inthe subsequent major
         delays o fimplementation. The absenceo f anycomponent forjob retraining or
         other safety net benefits was citedby QAG as the principalreason it ratedthe
         EFSAL's quality at entry as unsatisfactory.11 The FYOl SAL addressed some
         aspects o fthis problem, as will a forthcoming SocialProtectionProject.
         Massprivatizationtook place inaregulatory andcompetitive framework,
         administeredby enfeebled institutions such as the CPF, CROSEC, the BRA, and

'Five  shipyardswere putup for auction, but couldnot be sold for lack ofbuyer interest.

l1Interestingly, a December 1995 EFSAL missionproposedmakingsubmissiono fa planto addressthe
social consequences ofenterpriserestructuring a condition for negotiations. However, internal documents
show that, byMarch 1996, this requirement hadbeendropped.

       thejudicial system, whichprovedunwillingor incapableof compelling newly-
       privatized, economically-unviable companiesto restructurerapidly and
       transparently. This should not suggest that privatization should havebeen
       delayed bythese obstacles, since all that was neededwas for the GOC to observe .
       the hardbudgetaryconstraint envisioned. Without public subsidies and
       concessions, most newly-privatized companieswould havehadno choice but to
       restructure. However, once EFSALbudgetaryconditionality hadexpired in 1999,
       fiscal leakagesofvarious sorts-tax         forgiveness, direct subsidies, subsidized lines
       o f credit, etc.-resumed.

    0  The secondtranche conditionality fellwell short ofensuringprivatization ofthe
       "larger part" ofPESwithina suitabletimeframe. For example, a second-tranche
       conditionrequiringsale of at least 20 percent ofthe shares of three ofthe most
       important PES-INA, the power company (HEP), andthe postal and
       telecommunications company (HPT) was easily achievedby sale of 51percent o f
       the shares o fthe telecommunications branch (HT) in2001, effectively givingthe
       Borrower a free handto delay further privatization ofHEP andINA.'* Similarly,
       a secondtranche condition that the CPF privatize at least onehalfofthe FSOE
       share capital it possessedas o f end-1994 didnot impedethat agencyfrom
       subsidizing the newly-privatized enterprises, nor from repurchasingalready
       privatizedcompaniesinfinancial difficulty.
       Flaws inthe newBankruptcy, Labor, and Securities Laws largelyblockedtheir
       intendedeffects, forcing the Bankto revisit these problems duringnegotiations on
       the SAL.

   0   The implementation risks arisingfrom alack ofcommitment to reform within
       some partsof the government, andthe sheer complexity of certainreform
       components, were not properly recognizedduringappraisal. Not only did
       designers grossly underestimatethe lengtho ftime needed for effective reform,
       butalsothey overestimatedthe GOC's capacityto executethosereforms, even
       whenthere was apredisposition to do so. This was onebasisfor the
       ImplementationCompletionReport's rating o fquality at entry as unsatisfactory.
       Inretrospect,the choiceofafast-disbursing instrumentto supportsomany
       complex, politically-sensitive reforms was unwise. Bettermighthavebeen a
       cluster o f sector adjustmentloans with floating tranches, although such
       instruments were not widely available at the time the EFSALwas beingprepared.

       Finally, the strategyfor bankprivatization supportedbythe EFSALprovedto be
       slow, unwieldy, andprone to abuse, once the bankingsystem went from a limited
       to a systemwide crisis. Bank staff soonadvised the GOC to discontinue the use o f
       EFSALrehabilitationprocedures.

2.13   Viewed from adevelopmentimpact perspective, the EFSALhadadecidedly
mixedrecord. Itsbankrehabilitation objective was filly achieved, but inadequateinboth
scope andmethodto the task at hand. Privatizationwould eventually go far beyond the
EFSALfour-bank goal to encompassvirtuallyall commercial banks.I3 Itwouldbe
characterized, not bythe drawn-out process o fpainstakingasset valuation, followedby

 Ninety-two percent of all commercialbank assets are now inprivate, mostlyforeign, hands.

segregationo fbadloans, heightenedpublic oversight, recapitalization at public expense,
andmaybe eventualfullprivatization, asthe Bankandthe Borrowerhadoriginally
contemplated.

2.14    Rather, privatization took place ina swirl ofrapid-fire audits, followedbyrushed
auctions. Once the processhadgotten fully underway, it took little more thanthree years
to sell offmorethan 90 percent o f systemassets. Withnearly all commercial finance
assets now inthe hands o fprofessionally-managedbanks, Croatia's bankingsystemhas
becomea far more efficient, solvent network ofintermediaries thanit was before 2000.
Understrengthenedcompetition, macroeconomicstability, andrenewedsaver
confidence, the cost of credit has declined so rapidly-fiom   over 16percent inrealterms
during 1996to around4 percentin2003-that borrowers show little inclinationto seek
competing forms of finance, suchas the issuanceo fnew equity. The only real question
is: How mucho fthis improvement should be attributed to the mechanisms supportedby
the EFSAL, as opposedto those adoptedwhenthe urgency o fthe crisis compelledthem?
It is arguedherethat, inthe final analysis, the EFSAL-supportedrehabilitation strategy
was, at best, apalliative, an only incidentalinfluence onthe final shape o fthe banking
systemas it standstoday.

2.15    Among the indicators of improved commercialbankperformance, declining
spreads andfinancial deepeningshouldbenoted (Table 2.1). Analytic work provided
further supportfor the view that, by2002, the financial systemhadbecomemoreresilient
andcapableofwithstandingmacroeconomic stress, that banksweregenerally well
capitalized, that non-performing assetshaddecreasedas a fraction o ftotal assets, andthat
supervision was acceptable, albeit inneedof further improvement. Inits 2001 Transition
Report, the EuropeanBank for Reconstruction andDevelopment (EBRD) accorded
Croatia arating of 3+ for bankingreform, inline with Latvia, Poland, and Slovenia, and
just belowtop-ratedHungary, Estonia, andthe CzechRepublic.

2.16    The EFSALdidachieve a substantialimprovement inthe bankincentives
framework. The Central Bank, strengthened bynew authorizing legislation passedin
1999, reinforced byupgradedsupervision rules and enhancedstafftraining, hasmade
major steps toward achieving amodernbank regulatory regime. By2001, boththe
WorldBankandthe IMFcertified Croatia as beinginbroadcompliance withthe Basle
Core Principles for Effective Banking. Moreover, the change o fbank ownership
removedthe corrupting influence o fthe old systemo finterlocking directorates, which
hadso severelycompromised bank lendingdecisions.

assortment o fmanagers, employees, andinvestor groups, on the VarazdinExchange,15
which the PEScontrol with little or no outside oversight.

2.18     Although most bankscollapsed in 1998, such was not the case for largenumbers
o f enterprises which remained intheir debt. These enterprises, andtheir debts, were
transferred to the BRA, which was charged with either restructuringthem or forcing them
into bankruptcy. Very little o f either has occurred. Indeed, the BRA, as o f 2003,
remainedone o f Croatia's largest creditors.16

2.19      Duringthe last 10years, mostprivatizedFSOEshaveneither investedinnew
technology, nor downsized. The slow pace o frestructuringhas meant that already-
privatized firms are revertingto State-ownership at a pace nearly as fast as the rate o f
new privatizations. CPF officials reportedthat, since they had assumedoffice, the
number o fmajority andminority stakes CPFholds inFSOEs had actually increased
slightly, from 1,860 inearly 2000 to 1,888 inearly 2003. Moreover, employees who are
shareholders retainthe rightto sell back their shares to the CPF, rather than completing
their installment purchases. Manyworking ininsolvent enterprises are opting to do
exactly that. As of end-2002, pending CPF share repurchase obligations extended to
roughly 96,000 employees.

2.20     Croatia's private sector remains weaker thanthat inother transitioncountries.
For example, among a sample o ftwelve transitioncountries,17 Croatia's private sector
was found to be thirdsmallest as o fmid-2000, comprising a mere 60 percent o fGDP.
Withinthe private sector, disparate trends havebeenobserved. Newly-establishedprivate
companies, outside the ambit o fEFSALreforms, have enjoyedthe best performance,
experiencing above-average growth, with value-added havingincreased from 9 percent to
16percent o f GDPbetween 1996 to 2000. Onthe other hand, the FSOEs andthe PES,
which were the target of EFSU-supported reforms, have (not surprisingly) done less
well. Their growthhasbeensub-par, withvalue-added for the FSOEs shrinking from 14

2.21       A surveypublishedbythe StateAudit Office (SAO) in2002 found serious
irregularities inthe sale andinthe subsequentmanagement ofroughly four-fifths of the
500 cases reviewed, covering enterprise sampledfrom bothwaves ofprivatization. Asset
stripping, misappropriation ofloanscollateralizedwithcompany assets, repayment of
personaldebts out ofcompany cashflow andassets, andchronic arrears on supply
contract paymentswere commonplace. As of end-2002,430 privatizedFSOEshad
revertedto CPF (public) ownership. Othersmay follow, giventhat the CPF holds
pendingcontractsto repurchasethe shares of96,000 employeesofprivatizedFSOEs.
Finally, the SA0 found that roughly 40 percent ofthe surveyedenterprisesremained
unprofitable throughout the surveyperiodof 1996-2000.

2.22       Morethanhalfo f allprivatized enterprises remainheavily indebtedto the state,
either to the BRAor the CPF.IB Neither ofthese agenciescurrently has the legalmandate
or the institutional capacity to enforce timely repaymentofthese obligations or
bankruptcy onthese companies. A backlogo fcourt cases numberinginthe vicinity of
onemillionlgmeans that the EFSAL-sponsored Bankruptcy Law hadlittlepractical effect.

2.23      Withrespectto the PES,the GOCpledgeto privatize most ofthe public enterprise
sector has, to date, not beenfulfilled, with two exceptions. The first, andmost important,
was the splittingo fHPTintopostal (HP) andtelecommunication (HT) branches, andthe
privatization ofthe latter in2001. Consumershave enjoyed major benefits fkom
improved telecommunications services andlower prices providedbyits Germanbuyer.20
On a lesser plane, INA undertook amajor financial andorganization restructuring during
1997-98, leadingto the salein2001 ofroughly US$500million o fnon-core assets in
tourism, engineering, banks, industries, and social areas, andHT sold its non-core assets
as part ofits sale to a foreign strategicinvestor. Aside from these instances, no further
PEprivatizations took place duringthe implementationperiodo fthe EFSAL.21

2.24      As part ofsecondtranche conditionality, Croatiaapproved anEnergy Law
Regulatory PackageinJuly 2001. But, acombination o fmanagementintransigence,
particularly inHEP, inexperience with deregulation, resistance fkom public unions, and
longtransition periodsmandatedbythe legislationitselP2havebluntedthe impact o fthis
legislation. As notedbythe CEM, as ofmid-2003, the oil, gas, andpower sectors


l8 One indicator o fthe gradual erosion o fthe GOC's pledge to maintainahard-budget constraint upon
troubled enterprisesi s the fact that the BRA was originally intended to operate for a maximumo fthree
years, andto be largely self-financed from the fees charged, andthe assets sold, o f debtor companies. But,
as o fend-2003, the BRAnot only hadnot gone out o foperation, but hadfailed to attain any significant
self-financing capability.

2.25    As for Croatian StateRailroad Company (HZ),the EFSAL.requiredthat
restructuringbeinitiated inamanneracceptableto the Bank. Yet, the 2003 CEM
concludedthat, although operational reforms started as early as 1993 (Le., four years
before the EFSALwas even approved), andthat improvements havebeenachievedin
productivity andorganizational clarity, performance improvements havebeenmodest,
relative to the magnitude ofthe railroad's problems. The company is stillheavily
dependent on state subsidies, which, byinternational standards, arehigh(45 percento f
revenues).24

2.26    Withrespectto the required saleofnon-coreassets, HZ andHEP createdseparate
subsidiaries for these assets, but havenot yet sold themto the private                 A number

Ratings

Relevance

2.27    The EFSAL's objectives were substantially relevant to Croatia's private sector
development, financial sectorreorganization, andfiscal stabilization.



2.28    However, only one-privatization      o fthe banking system-could be said to have
been substantially achieved, albeit at some incremental cost to taxpayers, owing inpart to
delays associatedwith the initialmethods adopted. The three remaining objectives were
partiallyachieved-the incentives framework for banks "yes", the incentives framework
for enterprises"no"; the full restructuring andprivatization o fHT "yes", the full
restructuring andprivatization o fINA andHEP, "no"; the acceleratedprivatization o fthe
FSOEs, "yes'' at the beginning, "no" at the end. Overall efficacy is, therefore, rated
modest.

Outcome

2.29    Outcomei s ratedmoderately unsatisfactory (as comparedto satisfactory at the
timeofthe ICRreview), onthebasisthat the project, while notwithout acknowledged
benefits suchas the solid counselprovided duringsupervision on adjusting the course o f

substantially achieve three ofits four major relevant objectives. The in-depthanalysis o f

greater extent than was knownat the time ofthe ICRreview.

Sustainability

2.30     Sustainability i s consideredlikely (unchanged from the ICRreview), not only
becausethere is broad societal agreement that privatizationo fthe banks andthe telecom
parastatalhasbeen, on the whole, beneficial, but also because, ifCroatiawishes to
progressto the next stage ofEuropeanUnioncandidatemembership, it i s likelythat
 further efforts inthis directionwill beneeded.

Institutional Development Impact

2.3 1 Institutional development is ratedmodest (a downgrade from the ICR review),
reflecting new evidencecollectedbythe mission that the enabling environment for
private sector development, andits govemance, remains short of acceptable, except inthe
bankingsector.

Bank and Borrower Peformance

2.32    Bank andBorrower performance are downgraded to unsatisfactory, albeit
marginally so. The Bank scoredwell for its strategic selectivity andthe quality of
supervision, which was pro-active andpersistent inthe face o f chronic Client resistance
anddelay. However, the flaws inproject designandinthe choice ofaquick-disbursing
instrument to support lengthy, complicated, andpolitically-sensitive reforms became
more evident, as the missionexamined the on-the-ground results. The Borrower's
performance oscillated widely over the courseo f implementation. Performance and
commitment were low prior to mid-2000, highup to end-2002, but declined afterwards.
Efforts to completebankingsector reforms went reasonablywell, once the crisis had
becomehll-blown, butpromises to enact sweeping PEandFSOEprivatizationwere
either not observed, or were later alteredbypolicy actions which significantly diminished
their expectednetbenefits.

Design, ImplementationandOutcome

2.34     The TAL Ishouldbeunderstoodas an ancillary instrument, designedto facilitate
implementation ofthe EFSAL. Hence, the accomplishmentsandsetbacksexperiencedby
the EFSALhadacorrespondingimpact onthe success ofthe preparatoryactivities
financedunderTAL I.

2.35     The statedobjectivesincluded: (i) the GOC incompletingprivatization o f

 studies and consultant services were delivered. However, the impact o fthese services
varied inaccordancewith the fate o ftheir over-riding development objectives.

Privatizingthe FSOEs

2.38      The study ofmassprivatization ofthe FSOEsfocusedonthe mechanics of
notifyingbeneficiaries, identifyingthe supplyo fpotentialFSOEassets andhow they
shouldbebalancedagainstthe volume ofvouchers placedincirculation, the public
information campaignrequired, andthe certification andoperation o fthe PIFs. While
useful, this work devotedinadequateattention to assessingthe appropriatenessofmass
voucher privatization inthe Croatian conditions.

2.39      As experience amongthe early voucherprivatizers-Estonia,               the CzechRepublic,
andRussia-would show, voucher privatization canwork, but onlywithin carefully
circumscribed conditions. Specifically, successfulvoucher privatizationrequires
adequate fiduciary restraints andoversight o fmanagerial behavior, free exit andentry
conditions to the sector to promote desirablechanges inownership, and, inmost cases,
reputable core investors to set the privatized enterprise on a sound adjustmentpath from
the              Bankstaffwereawareo fthe risks, butthought theywere adequatelyhedged
byplansto createthe PIFs, which wouldhave anincentiveto provide intensified
oversight o fFSOEbehavior, at least for the largest o fthese enterprises, to protect their
investment stake. The overhaul o f securities regulation andthe creation o f fiduciary,
clearing, and settlement functions supportedby the CMDP were regardedas additional
safeguards.

2.40      Inthe event, noneoftheseprecautionsworked. The generallypoorquality ofthe
assets on offer-recall     that the best assets had alreadybeenprivatized inthe first wave,
before the TAL was approved4iscouraged foreign investor interest ingathering and
consolidatingvouchers. Moreover, few o fthe newly-privatized FSOEsshowed any
interest ingoingpublic, with its more stringentreporting andoversight requirements.
Andthe CPF, despite Bank remonstrancesonseveraloccasionsduring 1997, removed
manyoftheremaining attractive FSOEsfromthe massprivatization listbeforebidding
started inFebruary 1998.

2.41      Those FSOEswithdrawn from the list were disposedo fthrough direct sales,
tenders, private auctions, etc., under circumstanceswhich lackedtransparency. The
proffered TAL Iassistanceto determine how best to conduct these non-voucher
privatizations was declined. Onthesebases, OED concludesthat the TAL Igoal of
assistingFSOEprivatizationwas not achieved.

Restructuringand PrivatizingthePES

2.42     This objective was partiallyachieved. The TAL-financed studies hadtheir
greatest impact on INA's restructuring andtransfer ofnon-core assets during 1997-99.
O fintermediate impact was the assistanceprovidedto ORESEto promote better
accounting andreporting practices inthe PES,post-privatization regulatory frameworks,
andaplanfor HEPprivatization. ORESEbackeda single, multisectoral regulatory

agency, but eventuallylost this battlewhen the telecommunications branchwas
privatized aheado fthe other PESin 1999. ORESE was also able to develop an elaborate
system o freportingand accounting with TAL assistance. However, a government-wide
reorganizationin 1999 largelysidelinedORESE from the process o fdetermining the fate
o fthe PES,so these proposals hadlittle impact. The EnergyLaw Package o f 2001
adopted some elements o fthe restructuringproposals developed inTAL-financed studies,
buthashadlittle impact since, due to HEPresistance andthe GOC's inabilityto shepherd
throughParliament the necessary enabling legislation. HEPmanagement strongly
resistedthe conclusions o fthe TAL power privatization andbenchmark studies. The only
significant concession it made was to hive o f fthe district heatingunits. Evenhere the
change was more of form than substance, since the heating units remainedunder HEP
management. Ofleast impactwas the shipyardpilot spin-off study. None o fthe five
shipyards has spunoff significant assets to date.

Rehabilitatingand Privatizing the Banking System

2.43    This objectivewas largely achieved. The financial audits andportfolio reviews
were materialto the process o fprivatizing four o fthe five banks originally targeted and,
inthree ofthose cases, were facilitatedbyadvisors andprivatizationprograms
underwrittenbythe loan, although a follow-on TAL I1was also important inthis. Grant
financingreceived from another donor obviatedthe need for the Senior BankingAdvisor
planned for BRA.

Ratings

Relevance

2.44    The relevance o fthe TAL mustbejudged largely on the same grounds as the
EFSAL, since its major purpose was to provide technicalassistanceinthe form o f
advisors, studies, andtraining to facilitate achievement o fthe EFSAL objectives. Hence,
like the EFSAL, relevance wasjudged to be substantial.



2.45    Also likethe EFSAL, the TAL'Sefficacy i s also ratedmodest. Two o fthe three
objectives-technical    assistance onbank privatizationandon PErestructuring and
privatization-were    partially achieved, with study findings standing the test o ftime. For
example, a study on how to upgrade the quality andfunctionality o fthe bankregulatory
framework proved especially timely, as didrapidly-completed audits o fthree banks
which hadto beprivatizedina hurry. Studies identifying non-core PE assets proved
particularly useful for the restructuringplans o fthe oil (INA), andpostal and
telecommunications companies (HPT). Onthe other hand, studies onpreparingthe
power company (HEP) for privatizationwere largelyrejectedbythat company's
management. A studyproposing a single utilities regulatorwas rejectedinfavor o f a
differentplan creating separateregulatory agencies for telecommunications and energy.
A studyto separateHEP's district heatingassetswas legislativelyimplemented, buthas
hadlittle practical effect, since the assets remain under the control o f HEPmanagement.
A studyto spin-off the state-owned LRSEshipyards was not implemented. Stillother
study findings, initially ignoredor rejected, have gained a second life, such as the design
o f a PEperformance reportingsystem, which was revived and implementedinthe SAL,

                                                16

or the planfor HEP restructuring andprivatization, which i s still shapingthe negotiations
over terms ofaproposedProgrammatic Adjustment Loan. Least successfulwas the study
onvoucher privatization, which, while technically sophisticated, overlooked key aspects
o fthe institutional framework that shouldhave, butwere not, corrected.

 Outcome

2.46     Taking into accountthe substantially relevant objectives, but also incompletions
andshortcomings inthe way certain objectiveswere achieved(PE, LRSE, andvoucher
privatization, respectively), outcome is ratedmoderately satisfactory, a downgrade from
the rating o fhighlysatisfactory at the time o fthe 1999ICRreview. The earlier review
reliedheavily on the fact that allbut one ofthe TAL studies hadbeencompleted, butwas
less able to evaluatetheir eventual impact, giventhat the EFSALreforms were still at an
early stage at the time.

Sustainability

2.47    The developmentbenefits are likelyto beas enduringas the reforms they
supported, which, as noted above, are unlikelyto bereversed. Thus, sustainability is
ratedlikely, unchangedfiom the ICRreview.

Institutional DevelopmentImpact

2.48    ID1isratedasmodest, downfromsubstantialatthetimeofICRreview. As
organizations, the central bank the banks, andHT havebeenstrengthenedinmajor ways.
Yet, evenhere, itisworthwhile notingthe important gapsintechnical assistance, mostly
due to Borrower resistance. For example, BRArejectedaproffered advisor to shape
bankprivatization techniques. Inthe lighto fsubsequentresults, this omissionwas
regrettable. Similarly, the Ministryo fPrivatization andthe CPFbothrejected TAL
assistanceonnon-voucher methods ofprivatization, onthe grounds they preferredgrant
financing for same.28Yet, thesewere amongthe areas inwhich apoliticizedCPF Board
was accusedo fcollusion andcorruption.

2.49    Norhave the TAL-financed studies yet been tapped effectively to bringabout
major improvements ingovernance andthe enabling environment, againwith the three
exceptionsnoted above. Among the larger PES,INAhasbeenthe most receptive to
studyfindings, HZsomewhatless so, andHEPandthe shipyard companyhardlyat all.
Among small andmediumFSOEs, the TAL-financed study o fmass Privatization canbe
saidto havehad, at best, nopractical effect, at worst anegative effect inthe sense that it
helped leadthe sector into apolicy "blind alley." Finally, ORESE, whichhadbeen the

policy authority andtechnical capacity ina 1999reorganization, andbecame a non-factor

exception (the HEPbenchmark efficiency study), completed. HEPmanagementandone
high-level ministerwere critical o fthe consultantssuppliedfor the energy studies. For
example, the findings ofthe study on INA's fertilizer subsidiarywere considered
irrelevant, becausethe price assumptionsproved to betoo high. However, the bulk o fthe
evidence, drawn from supervision reports andthe ICR, suggeststhat HEPmanagement
was critical ofthe studies, not so muchontheir technical merits, butrather becauseofthe
threat their conclusionsposedto HEP's autonomy andmonopolistic control. Other than
HEP, the Bankworkedpersistently andeffectively with awiderangeofagencies during
its supervision of ahighly-complex project.

2.51    Most ofthe shortcomingso fthe project stemmed from Borrower actions which
underminedthe expectedbenefits ofthe TAL studies. Examples are the resistancefrom
HEPandthe marginalization ofORESE, akeyTALpartner. Therefore, Borrower
performance is ratedunsatisfactory, a downgrade from the rating of satisfactory at the
time ofICRreview.

CapitalMarketsDevelopmentProject
(CMDP, L3999-HR)

Overview

2.52    Duringthe early-to-mid 199Os, Croatia's financial systemwas dominatedby
commercial banks. The only non-bank financial institutions were insurancecompanies, a
public pension fund, the Zagreb Stock Exchange, andtwo over-the-counter securities
markets, onwhichtrading volume was very low.

2.53    The BankandBorrower assumedthat development o fopen and efficient capital
marketswould foster foreign capital inflow, the returnofoff-shore savings, more
efficient investment allocation, better matching o f economicrisks, andrationalization o f
privatized enterprisesthough ownership consolidation andthe emergenceo f strategic
investors. Forthese reasons, a Capital Markets Development Project was prepared
during 1994-95, andapprovedinApril 1996.

Design, ImplementationandOutcome

2.54    Theprimary statedobjectives ofthe CMDPwere to (i)      strengthen the regulatory
andpolicyframework ofthe capital markets; (ii)    strengthen the infrastructure to support
securitiestransactions; and(iii) deepenthe public's understandingofcapitalmarkets,
including participationas shareholdersofprivatized firms.

2.55    Withinthese objectives, the componentswere as follows:

        (i)    Strengthening the regulatory andpolicyframework of capital markets:

               0   Establishinganddeveloping a securities exchangecommission
                   (CROSEC);

               0   RestructuringilliquidGovernment debt (BigBonds); and

               0   Providingtechnical assistanceto the asset holdingarm o fthe Pension
                   Fund.

                                               18

         (ii) Strengtheningthesecuritiesinfrastructure:

         \           Establishing and strengthening a securities depository, clearing and
                     settlement facility (SDA).
         (iii)   Strengtheningpublic awareness of capital markets:
                     Providing technical assistance to execute a mass media campaign.

2.56     Implementation ofthe CMDPwas expeditious. A few months before CMDP
approval inApril 1996,Securities andInvestment FundLaws were passed, which provided
aninitialdefinition ofCROSEC's regulatorypowers. In1997,a massmediacampaign
was conducted to explain voucher privatization to the public andthe role of capital
markets, including the newly-establishedPIFs, infacilitating broader public ownership of
privatized enterprises. The SDA went into full operation inJuly 1999,three months later
thanoriginally planned. Hence, allcomponents were deliveredinrelativelytimely fashion.
However, developments inCroatiansecurities markets, as well as gaps inthe effectiveness
ofcomplementary institutions, havehadprofound effects onCROSEC andthe SDA.

2.57    Croatian capital markets have not fared well since the CMDP was approved.
Equitytrading onthe Zagreb Stock Exchange(ZSE) remains very modest, andis falling
as a percentage of GDP. At the end of 2002, equity capitalization, which consisted of
two companies, was only 75 percent o fthe levelreachedin1997. The over-the-counter
VarazdinExchangeis controlled bythe PIFs, who operate it largely for their ownbenefit,
with little involvement bythe generalpublic.

2.58    The failure o f capital markets to expand inline with the economy owes to a
number of factors, includingthe unwillingness ofthe GOC to compel privatized
companies to list onthe ZSE, the availability of cheaper bank credit to the larger
companies, the reluctance of Croatian companies to subject themselves to public
disclosure requirements, andthe desire o f owners to maintain close control.

Strengtheningthe Regulatory and Policy Framework of CapitalMarkets

2.59    When the CMDPwas designed andimplemented, capital market development
was a GOCpriority. However, after the project closed, a newly-elected administration
accordedit little importance, as evidencedbyits preference for direct sales ofimportant
FSOEs over public flotation, andits budgetary decisions, which have starved CROSEC
o fthe mostbasic financial andhumanresources neededto do its work.

2.60    CROSEC lives a precarious existence. Its powers are limited andits enforcement
activities ineffective. For example, it can issuebrokerage licenses, but cannot revoke
them, nor does ithave the power to levy fines or impose other penalties for misconduct.
Thejudicial systemhas failed to act on three-quarters of the complaints CROSEC has
referred. The Commission has lost some of its best professional staff, after the
Government sharply cut salaries, and cannot recruit suitable replacements. As a result,
CROSEC has beenunable to impose discipline onmarket participants or curb abuses.

2.61    Pensionfunds lack a satisfactory means for diversifyingtheir portfolios or risks,
and are facing difficulties generating returns from the highlyrestrictive menu o f debt
products currently permitted to them. However, trading inGovernment bonds
experienceda sharp recovery in2002, to nearly triple the level of 1997,stimulated inpart

                                                 19

bythe decisionin2000to makebigbondsinterest-bearing, therebyconverting themfrom
illiquidto liquidinstruments. Overall, this objective was not achieved.

Strengtheningthe SecuritiesInfrastructure

2.62    After initialdifficulties fundingits operations, SDAwas accordedincreased
fieedom to set its own fees. As a result, its finances improved considerably after 2000.
Thenew SecuritiesAct of2002 compelsallnewly-established companiesto register their
shares with the SDA, thus assuringit of a growing clientele. Hence, this objective was
fully achieved.

StrengtheningPublic Awareness

2.63    There is little evidence the wider public has any greater interest in, or appreciation
for, the purposeandfimctions o f capital markets today thanithadin1996, whenthe
public campaignwas launched. CROSEC officials acknowledgethat the Croatianpublic
retains a "bank-centric" mentality, andhasno culture ofinvestinginbonds andequities.2g
Moreover, the unfavorable public perception o fthe massprivatization processhas, if
anything, addedto the public's lack o ftrust inthe fairness, transparency, and safety of
localcapital markets.The low indices ofparticipation intrading provide further support
for this viewpoint. Turnover on the Zagreb Exchangeremains modest, andmarket
capitalization o fallbonds andtraded companies, as a share o f GDP, has fallen sharply
since 1997, firomnearly22 percent o f GDP then to 16percent in2002, although ithas
risen slightly from its low point o f 13.3 percent in 1998.30Thus, this objective was not
achieved.

Ratings

Relevance

2.64    Relevanceis ratedsubstantial. Eventhough it maynot havebeenat the top o f
Croatia's developmentpriorities, successful capital marketdevelopment would have
brought anumber o fbenefits to Croatia, including increasedenterprise and GOC
financing options, improved disclosure rules, anew locus for attracting foreign portfolio
investment, andbetter options for savers andPensionFundmanagers.



2.65    Efficacy is ratedmodest, inlight o fthe meager achievementsto date on securities
regulation, andthe lack o f any clear evidenceo fincreasedpublic interest insecurities
trading. Onlythe establishmento fthe SDA hasproduced tangible, and essential, services
to capital markets.

Outcome

2.66   Basedonthe fact two o fthreeproject objectives were not achieved, the rating for
outcome hasbeendowngraded from satisfactory at the ICRreview stageto moderately
unsatisfactory. The ICRjudgmentwas made in 1999, soon after CROSEC andSDA

 beganto function, with little evidenceto judge their likelylong-term development
 impact, evidencewhich the 2003 missionwas able to collect andexamine ingreater
 depth.

 Sustainability

 2.67    Sustainability is ratedas unlikely,inview ofthe strongresistancemanifestedto
 date inaccepting the additional public disclosure, fiduciary, andownership
 responsibilities inherent inapublic listing. Moreover, the highcompetitiveness of a
 revivedbankingsystemis likely to makerelatively expensiveequityfinancing seem even
 less attractive for a considerableperiodto come. However, passageofthe 2002
 Securities Law amendments mightbreathenew life into the markets.

Institutional DevelopmentImpact

 2.68    Institutional development impact is ratedmodest, as at the time o fICRreview,
reflecting the fact, although the SDA has achieved sustainable self-finance andincreased
 competenceindelivering neededshare registration andclearance services, suchbenefits
will remainmore theoretical thanreal, untilsuchtime as transaction volumes increaseto
 acceptablelevels.

Bank and Borrower PerjGormance

2.69     Bank andBorrowerperformance.arebothratedunsatisfactory, as opposedto
satisfactoryat the time o fICRreview. The Bankapplied a"cookie-cutter" approachto the
CMDP design, with littleadaptationto Croatianrealities, including the lack o fexperience
with"arms-length" regulationofthe private sector. As oneCroatianofficiallamented:
"We builtahousefiom theroofdownward, insteadoffiom the foundation upward."31

2.70     The Borrower largely abandonedownership o fthis project's goals, with the
turnover inGovernment after the 1999 elections. Sincethen, CROSEC hasborne the
burdenofdrasticbudgetary cutbacks andreductionsinwage ceilings whichhave
alienatedsome o fits most experiencelawyers andinvestigators. Nor have mattersbeen
helpedbyarecentcourt decision, whichhaseffectively negatedCROSEC's abilityto
investigate andsanction improperbehavior bybrokers, traders, and other market actors.
Indeed,byabolishing the financial police, the GOC sent anothersignalthat it doesnot
regard securitiesmarketinvestigationsto be o fhighpriority.
