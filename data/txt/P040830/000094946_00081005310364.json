objectives is\n            judged to be satisfactory. This project was designed as an\n            ancillary project, intended to facilitate implementation of\n            the Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL),\n            and therefore should be viewed in that context. To some\n            extent, delays in implementing policy reforms of the EFSAL,\n            particularly in the energy sector, have diminished the\n            impact of some of the preparatory activities financed under\n            the TAL. Project sustainability, where applicable, is\n            considered likely: policy dialogue continues and it appears\n            that the new Government is committed to continuing reforms\n            in order for Croatia to become a full-fledged market\n            economy. World Bank performance in all aspects of the\n            project cycle was satisfactory while the performance of the\n            Borrower's implementing agencies was, overall,\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned include the following: The\n            flexibility in TAL's design allowed project\n            implementation to continue both when technical assistance\n            priorities changed and when alternative financing was found.\n            The project management structure was adapted specifically to\n            support the government's large reform program. The fact\n            that several implementing agencies were each given\n            responsibility for executing their own components avoided\n            creation of a bottleneck which would have appeared had all\n            procurement gone through the Project Implementation Unit\n            that was managing a second Bank-financed project at the same time."}, "docdt": "2000-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
