TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
IN SUPPORT OF ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM
TECHNICAL ANNEX
Chapter 1. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
1. 1.   The overall aim of the Technical Assistance Project is to support the Government's enterprise
and financial sector reform program which will be supported by the Enterprise and Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan currently under preparation. Specifically, the objectives of the project are:
(i)   to assist the Government to complete the privatization of former socially-owned
enterprises;
(ii)   to help in the restructuring and privatization of public enterprises through studies and
advisory services; and
(iii)  to support the rehabilitation and privatization of the banking system.
B. Project Description
1.2.   The proposed project will provide consulting services for studies and advisory services in the
form of short and long-term technical assistance. The total cost of the project is US$6.2 million, of
which US$5 million will be financed by the Bank. The project will be implemented over a period of
two years by the beneficiary agencies, under the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Finance.
Chapter 2. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
A. Agreements Between the Borrower and Beneficiary Agencies
2.1    The Borrower is the Government of the Republic of Croatia (GOC) represented by its
Ministry of Finance (MOF). It has been agreed that the MOF will delegate the implementation
responsibility to the beneficiary agencies. The MOF's Project Coordinator (PC) will be responsible
primarily for monitoring and reporting on project activities. Implementation of the project will be the
responsibility of the beneficiary agencies.
B. Responsibilities of Beneficiary Agencies
2.2    The following agencies will be responsible for the activities to be implemented under the
project. (Chapter 4 of this Annex gives details of project activities.) As described briefly in the
following paragraphs, experts will be financed by the loan to ensure the agencies receive adequate
support to carry out their privatization and restructuring activities. Two of the agencies, the Ministry
of Privatization and ORESE, have already shown the capacity to implement the Bank procurement
procedures, having undertaken the process for four contracts that will be eligible for the retroactive
financing arrangement under the loan (see paras. 4.2 - 4.3). Training in Bank procurement has



- 2 -
already been offered to some staff of these agencies and will be offered to other staff as needed to
facilitate smooth project implementation.
(i)    Ministry of Finance (MOF). Overall responsibility for coordination and reporting
will rest with the Ministry of Finance. The Project Coordinator (PC) will be shared
with the Capital Market Development Project (CMDP), under which financing is
allocated for this purpose. The PC will be selected and financed under an advance
from the Project Preparation Facility for the CMDP and is expected to be in place
before the TA loan effectiveness. The Project Coordinator will have extensive project
management experience and will be trained in Bank procurement and disbursement
procedures.  The PC will reside in the Ministry of Finance to monitor project
implementation and disbursements, assist the beneficiary agencies in the procurement
process as needed, keep project accounts and make periodic reports to the
Government and the Bank. Project activities will be implemented by the beneficiary
agencies which will be expected to report back to the Project Coordinator on a
monthly basis. In each beneficiary agency, a contact person has been identified to act
as liaison and to report to the PC.
(ii)    The Ministry of Economy (MOE) will be responsible for all studies concerning the
power sector. Ministry officials will establish the final workplan for consultants and
will supervise their work. Preparation of various studies will require input from the
state power company, HEP; this work will be supervised by the Ministry of
Economy. Finally the MOE will receive advice on certain aspects of restructuring of
complex industrial enterprises.
(iii)   The Ministry of Maritine Affairs, Transport and Communications will be
responsible for studies in the telecommunications sector. This Ministry will supervise
the State telecommunications company's input for the tariff studies.
(iv)   The Ministry  of Privatization (MOP) is responsible for elaboration of the
privatization policy (including preparation of legislation and regulations) and
preparation of the detailed strategy (including "mapping" of privatization, launching
the public awareness campaign, and promotion with foreign investors). The MOP
will supervise experts who will advise on various aspects of privatization.
(v)    The Croatian Privatization Fund (CPF) is the "sui generis" state Agency,
responsible for privatization of the former socially-owned enterprises (as opposed to
public enterprises). It is also responsible for exercising ownership functions on behalf
of the State for enterprise shares and other selected assets still under Govermnent
ownership, while waiting for their privatization. The CPF will supervise experts who
will advise on privatization transactions and improvement of CPF's internal
operations.
(vi)   The Government Office for Restructuring  and  Economics of State-owned
Enterprises (ORESE) was set up mainly to monitor the performance of large public
enterprises particularly by reviewing and analyzing their financial performance and
assisting them in the preparation and implementation of restructuring programs
(including privatization in selected cases). ORESE reports to the Government through
the Vice-Prime Minister in charge of Economic Affairs.  ORESE will receive
financial analysis and audit expertise and will supervise studies of various activities of
INA, the petrochemical company.



- 3 -
(vii)  The Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA) will implement the Government's program
of rehabilitation for banks.  The BRA will be responsible for:  (a) taking over,
rehabilitating and privatizing at least five troubled banks, including the largest
Croatian bank; (b) cleaning up troubled banks' balance sheets, and managing selected
non-performing assets; and (c) developing a deposit insurance fund. The BRA will
receive accounting, financial and legal advisory services and expertise in bank
rehabilitation.
C. Functions of the Project Coordinator
2.3    The  Project Coordinator who reports directly to the Assistant Minister of Finance will be
responsible for monitoring project activities. Staff of the beneficiary agencies who will work in close
cooperation with the PC have been identified. The functions of the Project Coordinator are:
(i)  to oversee project activities to ensure the successful and timely implementation of the
project by the various beneficiary agencies;
(ii)  to  monitor project expenditures and costs (local and foreign), process loan
disbursement applications, and track disbursements of the Bank loan;
(iii)  to ensure the preparation and distribution of consolidated periodic reports to the
relevant Government and other participating institutions, including the Bank,
reflecting: (a) the status of implementation progress, problems encountered and
corrective actions needed; and (b) current costs of each project component and
estimated costs of completion;
(iv)  to ensure the timely preparation and submission to relevant Government institutions
and the Bank of annual audit reports of project expenditures and accounts;
(v)  to review and revise implementation targets and financial resources needed to support
future actions; and
(vi)  to ensure the preparation of the Government's contribution to the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) within six months after the completion of the project.
D. Implenentation Arrangements
2.4    The beneficiary agencies - the Ministry of Privatization, CPF, ORESE, BRA, Ministry of
Economy and Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications - will be responsible for
implementation of the project which consists of the hiring and supervision of consultants for studies
and advisory services. Each agency will be responsible for its own procurement process and will
report to the Project Coordinator the results of contract implementation and timing, and any necessary
support for future actions.  To date, the Ministry of Privatization and ORESE have started
procurement for the services of consultants to act as advisors and undertake studies (see paras. 4.2 -
4.3). The procurement process followed has been in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency in order that these
contracts may be considered for financing under the retroactive financing arrangement of the proposed
project. These beneficiary agencies have shown the capacity to follow the guidelines with moderate
supervision by the Bank. For this reason it is expected that the process will go smoothly for other
services to be procured by these agencies. Procurement training will be given as needed to staff of
the other agencies to ensure smooth implementation.

E. Role of the Bank
2.5    The project will, on average, require about 14 staffweeks of Bank supervision per year during
implementation, as proposed in the supervision plan below. In addition, supervision of the Technical
Assistance project will be jointly performed with EFSAL supervision. Consequently, the TA project
will also benefit from the expertise of the specialists who, in the context of preparation and
supervision of the EFSAL and in conjunction with the beneficiary agencies, will supervise the work
of the consultants financed by the TA loan.

F. Administrative Arrangements
2.6    The Project Coordinator will be responsible for carrying out all necessary administrative
arrangements recommended and approved by the Government and the Bank. At the outset of the
project, the PC will focus on development and implementation of the new administrative systems.
Chapter 3. PROJECT FINANCING AND COSTS
A. Detailed Financing Plan
3.1    The estimated total cost of the project is US$6.2 million, net of taxes and duties (as agreed by
the Government), including price contingencies.   The foreign component is US$5.6 million,
equivalent to 91 percent of total project costs.  The Bank loan of US$5 million will finance
approximately 81 percent of the total project costs, comprising about 81 percent of foreign exchange
cost (about US$4.5 million), and 79 percent of local cost. The Government has received an advance
of US$800,000 from the Bank's Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to finance audits of nine banks.
3.2    The Government has shown its commitment to the project objectives by financing about
US$1.2 million, the balance of project costs. This comprises three contracts for INA -- a detailed
analysis of its hydrocarbon chain, preparation of a strategic restructuring and privatization program
and the financial audit of the group. In addition, the Croatian Privatization Fund will finance the first
two phases of its reorganization. The financing plan is shown in Tables 1 and 2.

3.5     Technical Assistance.  Qualified firms will be invited to submit proposals for consultant
services in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and
by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). To keep the evaluation process manageable,
no more than six (but at least three) proposals will be invited following a short list acceptable to the
Bank. It is estimated that technical assistance will be procured in 16 packages at a total cost of about
US$4.2 million (excluding the PPF advance). It is estimated that about US$300,000 of the aggregate
for technical assistance will be for individual specialists, and the balance will be for firms.  A
maximum of US$870,000 of the technical assistance will be directly contracted. Table 5 shows
procurement packages for technical assistance.



3.6    In compliance with Bank procedures, the standard consultant contract will be used for all
procurement. Applicable review procedures are discussed in various sections of the Guidelines for
Use of Consultants.   However, in the case of firms for technical assistance contracts under
US$100,000 equivalent, the Bank will require prior review of only the terms of reference and short
lists of potential consultants. In the case of individual consultants, the Bank will require prior review
only of TORs and short lists for contracts under US$50,000 equivalent. In addition, all sole source
contracting will be agreed in advance and pre-reviewed by the Bank. More generally, the Bank's
Country Procurement Assistance Review (CPAR) will be completed early next year after the
Procurement Law  has been passed by Parliament.   Progress of procurement activities will be
monitored by the Project Coordinator, and periodic reports on procurement progress, including
variations in schedule, will be sent to the Bank on a regular basis.

project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1997, and the Closing Date of the loan will be
June 30, 1998. Retroactive financing of up to 10 percent of the loan or US$500,000 will be provided
to cover actual expenditures by the Government, primarily for the early appointment of advisors and
some studies, after October 1995. The disbursement plan is shown in Table 6.

3.8    Disbursements will be made as follows:
(a)   for technical assistance, 100 percent of expenditures, excluding taxes; and
(b)   repayment of PPF.
3.9    Disbursements against contracts for services exceeding US$100,000 equivalent will be made
against normal documentation. For contracts below that level, disbursements will be made on the
basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) with appropriate documentation retained by the Project
Coordinator and kept available for examination by Bank missions. Statements of Expenditures may
also be used for individual consultants for contracts below US$50,000. The minimum size of an
application for direct withdrawal from the loan account is 20 percent of the current amount of the
Authorized Allocation to the Special Account (see para. 3.10).
3.10   Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Borrower will establish a
Special Account in a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the
Bank's share of expenditures. The Authorized Allocation will be US$500,000, representing about
four months of average expenditures made through the Special Account. During the early stage of
the project, the initial allocation to the Special Account will be limited to US$250,000. However
when the aggregate disbursements under the loan have reached the level of US$2 million, the initial
allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of US$500,000 by submitting the
relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every
three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other supporting documents.
This quarterly submission of replenishment applications takes precedence over the minimum
application size stated above in paragraph 3.9. Documentation requirements for replenishment will
follow the standard Bank procedure as described in the Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly
bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower will accompany
all replenishment requests.

E. Audit Timetable
3.11   Project Audits. Project Accounts, the Special Account and Statements of Expenditure will be
audited in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects
Financed by the World Bank (March 1982). The Borrower will provide the Bank no later than by the
end of June of each year (i.e., within six months of the end of each fiscal year), an audit report of
such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements against certified Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs). The separate opinion should mention whether the SOEs submitted during the
fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be
relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications.
3.12   Reporting and Annual Reviews. To enable the Government and the Bank to monitor progress
of project implementation, the Project Coordinator will furnish to the Bank the following reports on a
regular basis: (a) semi-annual descriptive and financial report on each project component, objective
and activity (beginning from the date of loan effectiveness); (b) audited financial statements within six
months after the close of each fiscal year; and (c) records, financial statements, other progress reports
or other types of information that the Bank may request from time to time. The semi-annual reports
will describe in detail the current status of implementation, deviations, if any, from the
implementation plan, and the reasons for deviations and corrective actions being taken. The project
implementation plan and the implementation schedule will be the basis for supervision and reporting.
Based on information provided by the various beneficiary agencies, the Project Coordinator will
prepare the Government's contribution to the Implementation Completion Report within six months of
the Closing Date, covering all related activities during project implementation.
Chapter 4. DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES
A. Detailed Project Activities
4.1    Activities under each component are summarized below. The implementation schedule for
each component appears on pages 14-19.
4.2    Privatization of FSOEs.  The Government of Croatia is launching the second phase of its
privatization program which will include a Mass Privatization Program (MPP), the implementation of
which should begin in the second half of 1996. The Ministry of Privatization (MOP) is recruiting
consultants to advise it in the detailed elaboration of the second phase of the privatization program,
but also to assist in its smooth and rapid implementation. At this point, the following consultancies
are planned (base costs shown in parenthesis).
(a)   Mass Privatization Advisors (US$350,000). Advisors will be needed to assist the MOP in the
detailed elaboration ("engineering") of the MPP, with the utmost concern for smooth
implementation of the program  and sensitivity of the population.  Their task will be to
propose and evaluate various options for all aspects and steps of the program. This will,
among other things, include the selection of enterprises under the scheme, the assessment of
supply and demand for vouchers and shares, characteristics (tradability of vouchers, etc.),
logistics for registration and distribution of vouchers, mechanisms for conversion into shares,
public awareness campaign, establishment and regulatory framework for investment funds.
Terms of reference appear as Attachment 1.  World Bank Guidelines were followed to
procure the services of a consulting firm, and a contract which will qualify for the retroactive
financing arrangement under the loan has been awarded.



- 10 -
(b)  Privatization Advisor (US$20,000). His main tasks will be (1) to provide pragmatic opinions
and recommendations on the feasibility of various privatization procedures and recommend
alternative measures to improve and accelerate the implementation of the program; (2) to
assist the MOP in coordinating the various departments of the Ministry and of the Croatian
Privatization Fund in the implementation of the privatization program; and (3) to help the
MOP prepare progress reports on privatization for the Government and the International
Financial Institutions assisting Croatia. Terms of reference appear as Attachment 2.
(c)   Miscellaneous Advisory Services (US$790,000, total). A variety of advisory services will be
needed to improve implementation of the existing privatization methods and the operations of
the CPF.  Consultant services will be required to assist the CPF in preparing and
implementing transactions of selected large and medium enterprises (US$300,000). This will
include evaluation of enterprises, preparation of prospectuses, elaborating plans for breaking
up large groups into smaller units which will be easier to privatize, assistance in negotiations
with investors, and proposing emergency restructuring measures for enterprises under the
control of the CPF while awaiting privatization. Legal advisory services from internationally
reputed firms (US$150,000) will be used on an ad hoc basis to assist the CPF in complex
negotiations of large transactions with strategic investors. Consultants will also be hired to
improve the CPF's internal procedures and upgrade its management information services
(US$200,000) as a follow-up to the first two phases of the reorganization of the CPF,
currently being implemented.  Privatization and restructuring experts (US$140,000) will
advise the Ministry of Economy on selected aspects of restructuring of a few complex
industrial enterprises undergoing or slated for privatization. Terms of reference for these
assignments will be prepared on a case-by-case basis depending on CPF's readiness.
4.3    Rehabilitation and Privatization of Public Enterprises:
(a)  Advisors - Financial Analyst and Audit Expert for the Office for the Restructuring and
Economics of State-owned Enterprises (ORESE) (US$500,000). World Bank Guidelines were
followed to procure the services of a consulting firm for the above tasks, and a contract which
will qualify for the retroactive financing arrangement under the loan has been awarded.
The Financial Analyst will assist ORESE to improve its performance of the following tasks:
(1) preparation of internal financial statements and other financial indicators for presentation
to the Government; and (2) carrying out financial analyses related to the performance of
major state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the industry and infrastructure sectors. Terms of
reference appear as Attachment 3.
A high level audit expert will assist ORESE in improving its internal auditing procedures. He
will also assist ORESE in carrying out systematic and ad hoc controls and audits of the
activities of SOEs in the industry and infrastructure sectors and train ORESE's auditors.
Terms of reference appear as Attachment 4.
(b)  Kutina Fertilizer Company, Strategic Planning and Restructuring Study (US$450,000). World
Bank Guidelines were followed to procure the services of a consulting firm for the above
tasks, and a contract which will qualify for the retroactive financing arrangement under the
loan has been awarded. The objectives of the study are to inform the Government and INA
on the current and prospective competitive position of INA-Kutina, to identify measures to
maintain and improve its competitive position, to analyze strategic options, to value the
Kutina plant on the basis of its present performance and its potential prospects, to formulate a
plan for the privatization of Kutina as a separate entity from INA and to make preliminary



- 11 -
proposals on various options for its privatization. The study will also recommend a phased
program for the consolidation of the core operations of the enterprise and divestiture of non-
essential operations, and analyze the social and employment implications of consolidation and
divestiture. Terms of reference appear as Attachment 5. The study should be completed by
May 1996.
(c)  INA  Refineries Study (US$200,000).   The added value analysis of INA's complete
hydrocarbon chain has confirmed that one of the worst performing segments of the group's
integrated production chain is the refining, composed of three refineries with substantial
overcapacity and out-of-date technology. The loan will finance a more in-depth analysis to
determine which refinery could be kept in operation with minimum upgrading investments and
which should be closed or alternatively offered for sale to foreign companies.  The
Govemment has proposed to contract this study to the consultants who carried out the initial
added value analysis for the whole group. Draft Terms of Reference appear as Attachment 6.
The study should be completed by June 1996.
(d)  Complementary Studies in the Power Sector (US$300,000).  The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is financing a basic tariff study to design a least-
cost investment plan, as well as institutional and regulatory studies in the sector. Financing
from the TA loan is earmarked for complementary institutional, tariff and regulatory studies
to be identified in about six months' time on the basis of the results from the EBRD studies.
(e)   Tariff Study for HPT (US$100,000). Working with the staff of HPT, the Croatian post and
telecommunications agency, the consultants will review the new structure and levels of tariffs
proposed by HPT. Based on the experience of privatized telecommunications companies
intemationally, the consultants will propose a mechanism for the automatic adjustment of
tariffs. Terms of reference will be prepared after completion of the ongoing study.
(f)   Spectrum Management Study (US$50,000). In order to supervise the initial liberalization of
the telecommunications sector, as it opens to independent operating companies, and the
development of cellular services, the Government wishes to develop the capacity for spectrum
management. The program consists of about four weeks of training on the use of related
computer software.
4.4    Rehabilitation and Privatization of the Banking system:
(a)  Legal Advisor for the Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA) (US$100,000). The BRA will seek
the services of a law firm to assist it and its local counsel in designing the structure of the
purchase and assumption transactions to rehabilitate Privredna Banka Zagreb, the largest bank
in Croatia. Among other tasks, the law firm will prepare documentation for the conveyancing
of assets and liabilities located outside Croatia from the old Privredna Banka Zagreb to the
new. Terms of reference appear as Attachment 7.
(b)  Accounting and Miscellaneous Services for the Bank Rehabilitation Agency (US$50,000). The
BRA will retain the services of a firm for approximately three months to establish the BRA's
accounting and reporting systems and provide hands-on assistance to the agency's staff in
booking the initial rehabilitation transactions and preparing initial financial statements and
reports. Terms of reference are being drafted.
(c) Senior Advisor for Rehabilitation (US$300,000). An experienced bank rehabilitation advisor
will work with the BRA for a total of 18 months over two years. The consultant will, inter



- 12 -
alia, (1) assist the MOF and the BRA in developing legislation required for the successful
function of the program and for the development of a deposit insurance scheme; (2) assist in
developing the BRA's internal organization; (3) assist in developing the BRA's Asset
Management Department; (4) help to develop the Banking Department's capabilities in
supervising the activities of banks participating in the rehabilitation program; and (5) develop
and maintain the technical assistance program for the banking sector. Terms of reference
appear as Attachment 8.
(d) Financial Advisory Services (US$600,000). The BRA will seek a variety of financial advisory
services for (1) assistance in creating restructuring plans for BRA-managed enterprises; and
(2) provision of special audits and valuations required for offering memoranda and public
offering documents for the sale process of BRA-owned equity stakes in banks and enterprises.
Some funding will be provided for the retainer portion of fees to be paid to financial advisors
involved in the sale of BRA-owned equity stakes to international investors.  Terms of
reference appear as Attachment 9.
B. Implementation Schedule
4.5    The detailed schedule of implementation by activity for each sub-component appears on
pages 14-19. The schedule takes into account the work to be carried out during project preparation
and reflects the detailed implementation activities. Based on the level of preparedness of the Croatian
Government, the quality of the work already completed and the need for timely completion of studies
for the implementation of reforms in the enterprise and banking sectors, it is planned that the
implementation will start prior to loan effectiveness.
Chapter 5. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
5.1    While the Project Coordinator (PC) will be responsible for financial control and for routine
implementation activities, including disbursement and reporting activities, the beneficiary agencies
will be responsible for the implementation of the activities within their respective components and will
report regularly to the PC and, through the PC, to the Assistant Minister of Finance. The PC will in
turn make progress reports to the Government and the Bank, noting especially any expected delays in
project implementation. The project liaison nominated by each beneficiary agency will be in charge
of that agency's respective project component and reporting on implementation to the PC on a
monthly basis.
5.2   Supervision of this project will be undertaken in tandem  with the preparation and
implementation of the Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL), the components of
the TA project being integral elements of, or preconditions for, the EFSAL. Continuing supervision,
including close supervision of the work of the consultants, will be provided through planned missions
in connection with the preparation and subsequent supervision of the EFSAL and on-going country
macroeconomic work.
5.3    Reporting by the Project Coordinator and Bank supervision will focus on in-depth reviews of
the consistency of activities for each component and sub-component with agreements reached at
negotiations, performance of the beneficiary agencies, assessment of emerging needs for adjustments
to project parameters, and possible follow-up activities which could be supported by the Bank. Bank
supervision will be based on the semi-annual progress reports and the annual evaluation of project
activities by the Project Coordinator. Progress will be measured against the project implementation
schedule. This will be supplemented by a review of project expenditures and availability of financial



- 13 -
resources, in addition to substantive discussions with technical assistance groups implementing and/or
assisting in the implementation of various components, and discussions with responsible authorities.
A mid-term review of the project will be carried out by February 28, 1997.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
IN SUPPORT OF ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM
Ministry of Privatization
Terms of Reference
Consultants for the Detailed Elaboration of the Mass Privatization Program
1.    With the completion of the first phase of the comprehensive program of privatization of its
Former Socially-Owned Enterprises (FSOEs), Croatia has already privatized a significant portion of
the initial population of about 2600 FSOEs. By mid 1995, some 1190 (mostly small and medium
enterprises - SMEs) had been fully privatized and another 940 majority privatized through various
methods, leaving about 500 FSOEs still totally or majority owned by the State (through the Croatian
Privatization Fund -CPF - and the Pension Funds). CPF's residual portfolio thereby consists of
equity stakes of about DM 6,400 million, ' mainly in these 400 medium and large enterprises, some
of which are in a difficult situation.
2.    For the second phase of the privatization program, which will encompass the residual CPF
portfolio and possibly parts of some of the 10 large Public Enterprises (PEs), the Government of
Croatia is planning to start implementing in mid-1996 a Mass Privatization Program (MPP). The new
privatization law currently under discussion in Parliament lays out the general principles of the MPP
as presently envisaged by the Government. The principles of this MPP will be finalized with the
enactment of this law, currently anticipated for February 1996. Various changes to the existing
privatization methods (which will generally be continued to be applied in parallel to the MPP) will
also be adopted.
3.    The Ministry of Privatization (MOP) is therefore recruiting consultants to assist it in the
detailed elaboration ("engineering") of the proposed MPP (Phase 1). While taking stock of the
experience available with the implementation of similar schemes in many other countries, the
consultants' work should also particularly take into account the specific economic, social and political
situation in Croatia. An overriding objective will be to ensure smooth implementation of the program
- with special concern for the sensitivity of the population, particularly the refugees and other victims
of the war. The MOP may decide, depending on the complexity of the detailed scheme finally
adopted and on the consultants' performance during Phase 1, to retain the consultants for specific
services during the implementation of the program (Phase 2).
4.    As currently envisaged in the draft law submitted to Parliament, the MPP would entitle some
300,000 people to receive free vouchers for an amount of DM 5,000 to 20,000 each, depending on
the category of eligible persons.  The total eligible population (initially displaced civilians, civil
victims of the war, families of missing soldiers) may be increased to 500,000 or more, as the
program is expanded to additional categories of citizens.  Other schemes for free distribution or
compulsory acquisition of vouchers may also be added. Each person would have the choice to freely
exchange its vouchers for shares of enterprises or turn them over to new private Privatization
Investment Funds (PIFs) who in turn will also exchange them for enterprise shares. Overall, there
would thus be a "nominal" mass of at least DM 2.5 to 3.5 billion in vouchers, which should be
I  This is a nominal value which may not reflect the economic or market value of the enterprises.



- 21 -
matched by an at least "equivalent" mass of shares of enterprises. It is the current intention of the
MOP to propose a pool of shares of enterprises selected among the good ones in its present portfolio,
including many of the best. At a later stage, the MOP could envisage also to add blocks of shares of
selected PEs; however, this will be very much contingent on enactment of specific legislation
authorizing the privatization of such PEs, such as in Telecommunications.
5.     The currently envisaged timing for the implementation of the MPP would broadly be: (i)
distribution of the vouchers to the main target population by the third quarter of 1996 at the latest;
and (ii) completion of the exchange of their vouchers for enterprise shares/PIF shares by the end of
1996. The bulk of the consultants' work (Phase 1) is thus expected to take place over the period
February to June 1996.
6.     In assisting the MOP in elaborating the detailed process, the consultants will for every main
component/stage of the design propose and evaluate various alternatives - presenting the advantages
and disadvantages to the MOP in particular and the Government in general - to help them select the
optimum solutions for a cost efficient, smooth and rapid implementation.
Specific Tasks
7.     The consultants will assist the MOP in addressing a variety of issues and in performing
various other tasks, including mainly:
* mapping of CPF's portfolio of enterprises, evaluating and recommending their optimum
privatization track;
* assessing the supply of vouchers/demand for shares versus the supply of enterprise shares;
X characteristics of vouchers (non-tradability, expiration period, conversion procedures &
rates, etc.)
*   need for limiting/delaying tradability of enterprise shares depending on market
evolution
*   logistics of registration and voucher distribution;
* evaluating/influencing the citizens' preference for direct conversion into enterprise shares
or for entrusting vouchers to PIFs;
* alternatives of exchanging vouchers for shares (bidding, number of rounds, price limits,
etc.) with particular concern to avoid a free fall of share prices;
* logistics of voucher exchange/bidding for shares
*   possible need for and form of Government initial support to PIFs
*   regulatory framework for PIFs and eligibility criteria of PIF managers
*   legal aspects
* phasing, detailed planning, critical path
*   choice of coordinating entity
*   review of adequacy of public awareness campaign proposed by MOP
*   cost estimates and financing plan; and
* possibility of expansion of the scheme (more vouchers, additional rounds, etc.).



- 22 -
8.    The consultants will work directly under the Assistant Minister of Privatization in charge of
the MPP (who in turn refers to the Minister of Privatization).  They are expected to assist the
Minister and Assistant Minister from time to time in making presentations on the details of the MPP
to a higher Government Team under the Vice-Prime Minister in charge of Economic Affairs. The
consultants will also work in close collaboration with the other departments of the MOP, as well as
with the CPF. In addition to specific reports marking the successive milestones of the work, the
consultants will produce monthly progress reports to be submitted to the MOP, the Government Team
and the World Bank.

Privatization Advisor
1.    Croatia has now completed the first phase of the comprehensive program of privatization of
its Former Socially-Owned Enterprises (FSOEs). A significant portion of the initial population of
about 2600 FSOEs has now been privatized. By mid-1995, some 1190 (mostly small and medium
enterprises - SMEs) had been fully privatized and another 940 majority privatized through various
methods, leaving about 500 FSOEs still totally or majority owned by the State (through the Croatian
Privatization Fund - CPF - and the Pension Funds). Croatia is now launching the second phase of the
privatization program which will encompass the residual CPF portfolio and possibly parts of some of
the eight large Public Enterprises (PEs). This second phase would, among other things, include a new
Mass Privatization Program (MPP), the implementation of which should start in mid 1996. A new
Privatization law is currently under discussion in Parliament. The principles of the MPP would then
be finalized and various changes to the existing privatization methods, which will generally continue
to be applied in parallel to the MPP, will be adopted.
2.    The Ministry of Privatization (MOP) is recruiting various consultants, first to advise it in the
detailed elaboration of the second phase of the privatization program, but also assist in its smooth and
rapid implementation. One consultant will be a high level privatization advisor, whose main task will
be to provide pragmatic opinions and recommendations on the feasibility of the various privatization
procedures, to assist the MOP in coordinating the various departments of the MOP and of the CPF in
the implementation of the privatization program, and to help the MOP prepare progress reports on
privatization for the Government and the International Financial Institutions assisting Croatia.
3.    The consultant will mainly:
* Assist the MOP in the mapping of the CPF portfolio of enterprises, recommending the
optimum privatization method for the various enterprises/categories of enterprises.
* Advise the Minister of Privatization and his Assistant Ministers by continuously assessing
the progress of the various privatization methods and evaluating the work of the CPF, and
by recommending alternative measures needed to improve and accelerate the
implementation of the program.
* Prepare special reports on specific topics that the MOP will require from time to time and
help the MOP produce monthly progress reports to be submitted to the higher
Governmental Team on privatization headed by the Vice-Prime Minister in charge of
Economic Affairs and to the World Bank.
4.    The consultant will work directly under the Assistant Minister of Privatization in charge of
Strategy and the MPP (who in turn refers to the Minister of Privatization). The consultant will also
work in close collaboration with th- other departments of the MOP, as well as with the CPF.



- 24 -
5.    The consultant is expected to spend a total of 6 weeks in Zagreb during the initial period of
April to September 1996, or about 1 week on average per month - at dates that the MOP will specify
as work progresses. This initial period of six months may be extended depending on the progress of
the privatization program.

INA Petrokemija Kutina Fertilizer Company
Strategic Planning and Restructuring Study
Introduction
1.    The Government of Croatia (GOC) is pursuing an ambitious program of restructuring and
privatization. A key component of this program is the privatization of major state-owned enterprises,
the largest of which is Industrija Nafte (INA). INA is an integrated oil and gas group with a number
of allied operations including the fertilizer production and sales operations of the INA Petrokemija
Kutina Company. The GOC intends to restructure the INA Group to a core group of activities with
non-core activities unbundled so that they can be privatized/divested separately. One of these non-
core activities is the fertilizer operations of Kutina.
Fertilizer Sector Background
2.    Kutina is the sole fertilizer producer in Croatia and operates world scale nitrogen and
phosphate fertilizer facilities at the one site in the town of Kutina. It also produces carbon black.
Due to the limited size of the Croatian market, export markets are of major importance to Kutina, and
maintaining and improving its competitive position in these markets is of prime importance.
Privatization of INA is expected to provide access to the capital required for the medium and long-
term development of Kutina; ensure and enhance access to major export markets, and to raw
materials and intermediates.
3.    Details of the major facilities of Kutina are:
Product      Capacity                          Design and Start-up Date
Ammonia      450,000 tpy                Kellogg 1360 tpd plant SU 1984
Urea         495,000 tpy                Stamicarbon 1500 tpd, SU 1984
CAN          330,000 tpy (as AN)        Two plants, 1000 tpd
Nitric Acid   416,000 tpy (as 100 percent)  Three plants, 1260 tpd
Phos. Acid    150,000 tpy (as P205)      Fison 500 tpd, Sulfuric Acid 1500 tpd
NPK          420,000 tpy                Have MAP, DAP production 10-20-30,
mainly 15-15-15.
500 tpd Pec Nitrophos.
Objectives
4.    The objectives of the study are:
a) To inform the GOC and INA on the current and prospective competitive position of INA.



- 28 -
b) To identify short, medium, and longer-term measures that would maintain and improve
INA Petrokemija Kutina's competitive position.
c) To analyze strategic options and propose a strategy for Kutina.
d) To value the business on the basis of its present performance and potential short and
medium-term prospects.
Scope of Work
5.     The study is to cover all aspects of the fertilizer sector including raw  material supply,
domestic and foreign markets and marketing. At the sector level:
a) meet with the Ministry of Agriculture and other ministries and institutions concerned with
the development of the fertilizer sector and ascertain their plans and policies for the sector;
b) based on an analysis of the development prospects and directions for the sector, and the
organization of the sector in other market economies, review options with the concerned
institutions and recommend a development plan that would address major issues and have
broad support;
c) address specifically in the development plan the promotion of efficient distribution systems
and fertilizer credit;
d) address specifically in the development plan the future role of farm-gate fertilizer
subsidies, and how these can be reduced;
e) review past fertilizer consumption in Croatia and make medium-term demand projections.
6.     At Kutina, the scope of work is to:
f) Carry out a diagnosis of Kutina's operations. This would include:
i)  present and projected access and cost of raw materials and utilities;
ii)  location of production and transportation costs and problems for raw material supplies
and delivery of products to domestic and international markets;
iii) details of production facilities available including age, technology, product grades and
quality, achievable capacity utilization, and major environmental and safety problems
that are an implicit feature of the technology used;
iv) major product markets and their past and projected future development, including
distribution channels;
v)  identification of the core operations of the enterprise that are essential for its future
development and those activities that should be divested;
vi) examine the major cost elements of the enterprise's core operations and the costs of
the other operations;



- 29 -
vii) review the organizational structure of the enterprise and its human resource
development programs; and
viii) review the restructuring and development plans of the enterprise.
g) On the basis of the above diagnosis:
i)  analyze the present and projected competitiveness of the major operations of the
enterprise in export and domestic markets and identify those operations that are
clearly not competitive, cannot be economically restructured, and should be closed
down;
ii) identify those operations that are sustainable in the short and medium term and those
operations that need to be restructured to ensure sustainability. Recommend physical
restructuring plans ' and priorities and justify these with preliminary cost/benefit
calculations to show the impact of the proposed restructuring plans on the enterprise
up to the year 2005;
h) Identify major environmental clean-up liabilities that may have an effect on the value of
INA Petrokemija Kutina. This should include the future costs of closure of the existing
gypsum stack.
i) Analyze the organizational requirements of the enterprise for it to function efficiently in a
market economy and make specific recommendations for organizational changes and the
development of human resources; and
j) Recommnend how the enterprise should organize, operate and finance its marketing and
distribution system. Based on practices in other countries and the cost structure of the
enterprise, review pricing discount policies for sales to efficiently minimize inventories;
7.     At the INA level:
k) Identify those interfaces between INA Petrokemija Kutina and the INA parent company
and its subsidiaries (management, personnel, marketing, finance, material supply, etc.).
Organization of the Studies
8.     The consultants selected will be expected to have in house, or through linkages with other
consultants, the necessary data on historical and projected regional and international fertilizer market
developments, authoritative methodologies for international fertilizer price projections, and data for
comparing the international competitive situation of Kutina.
Restructuring plans should include the costs of bringing individual production units into compliance
with existing environmental standards, or good industry practice, where adequate standards do not yet
exist (this would include drill tower dust abatement, NOx abatement from nitric acid plants and
combustion of synthesis loop purge gas, hydrolysis of urea plant process water discharge, S02
emissions from associated sulfuric acid plants, gypsum disposal from phosphoric acid, etc.



- 30 -
9.     A counter-part team from the INA parent company and INA Petrokemija Kutina will be
formed to work with the consultants. The consultants are expected to work closely with the staff of
INA and provide frequent briefings to the management to ensure that the considerable expertise of
Kutina is utilized and that the views of management on the course of the study are taken into account
at an early stage.
10.   The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the ORESE will supervise the studies and will
constitute a steering committee made up of representatives from other concerned ministries and
institutions to which the consultants will give periodic status reports, and receive advice on aspects of
the study.
Organization of the Work Team
11.   Apart from the necessary business management, economic and financial backing, the work
team should include technical specialists in fertilizer production, specialists in fertilizer distribution
and marketing including the financial aspects of operating distribution systems and assessing domestic
demand in similar agricultural conditions to Croatia.

INA Refineries Study
Introduction
1.    The Government of Croatia (GOC) is pursuing an ambitious program of restructuring and
privatization. A key component of this program is the privatization/restructuring of INA to a core
group of activities.  Central to the formulation of this program  is the position of the oil based
operations of INA.
Refinery Sector Background
2.    INA owns and operates all the refinery capacity in Croatia which consists of the two major
fuels refineries of Sisak (6.4 million tpy) and Rijeka/Urinj (7 million tpy), and the two small specialty
refineries of Zagreb and Rijeka/Mlaka2 producing mainly lube oils and asphalt. Sisak processes all
domestic crude produced in Croatia and receives imported crude via the JANAF pipeline.3 Rijeka can
receive crude at its own port facilities or receive crude via a spur off the JANAF pipeline. There are
no product pipelines linking Sisak and the Zagreb region with the coast, all product transport is by
road or rail.
3.     Prior to the break-up of the Federation, the two fuels refineries were running at low capacity
utilization (approximately 52 percent for Sisak and 50 percent for Rijeka). After the break-up, and
with the consequential loss of markets, capacity utilization has fallen to lower levels; Sisak 26 percent
and Rijeka 47 percent - about one third capacity used at Rijeka has been for third party crude
processing.
4.     Historically INA had a dominant marketing position (about 70 percent and higher market
share) for refined products in Croatia, Slovenia, and Montenegro and a minor position (less than 20
percent) in the other republics; exports outside of the then Federation were minor, amounting to about
10 percent of production. INA retains a dominant position in the Croatian market but this is unlikely
to remain unchallenged as barriers to competition are removed to harmonize Croatian regulations with
those of the EU.
5.     Consultants have recently completed a detailed analysis of the financial structure and position
of INA, including the refinery operations. The analysis showed that for the period studied (1994) all
2      The information we have on file (four years old) is that detailed studies have been carried out for the
closure of Mlaka, due to its pollution impact on Rijeka City, and the construction of equivalent
processing units at Urinj.

refineries had negative operating incomes which, with the addition of capital charges, leads to severe
rates of value destruction.
Objectives
6.    The objectives of the study are:
(a)    To inform GOC and INA on the current and prospective competitive position of the
refinery operations of INA in domestic and export markets.
(b)    To identify measures that in the short term would minimize losses, and in the medium
and longer-term would generate adequate returns on the capital base, and support and
strengthen the INA Group.
(c)    To analyze strategic refinery options and propose a strategy for INA.
(d)    To value discrete refinery units on the basis of present performance, and potential
short and medium-term prospects.
7.     The formulation of a plan to implement the selected strategic plan would be carried out in a
second phase study.
8.     From its present position as the sole shareholder of INA and the prospect in the medium-term
of remaining a major shareholder, the GOC is concerned to maximize the value of the INA Group
both as regards profits and share value. However, the GOC also has an overriding concern for the
development, in the medium term, of competitive markets in Croatia, including the markets for oil
products. Measures proposed in the study must reflect these concerns.
9.    In the short term, major elements of the strategic plan are expected to include measures to
rationalize refinery capacity through closures. In the medium to longer term, investments to improve
facilities and infrastructure may be justified. However, any elements of the strategic plan involving
capital investment must take into account the capability of INA to raise such funds and potential
sources, and to show that this will not lead to unacceptable debt levels.
Scope of Work
10.   The primary focus of the study are the refinery operations of INA. However, these operations
are dependant on other INA operations; to a considerable extent on local marketing and distribution,
and to a lesser extent on local crude production. The study needs to take account of these
dependencies and include an analysis of the interfaces of such operations.
11.    Realistic short, medium, and long-term estimates of domestic demand for refined products
should be made. It is important that these estimates be used to determine the size and configuration of
the refinery facilities that Croatia can support.



- 33 -
12.    The medium and long term share of the domestic market that INA can expect to retain should
be estimated. 4 This estimate should build on demand growth in distinct geographical market areas in
Croatia (e.g., coastal and interior) that are more or less vulnerable to competition from imports.
Account should also be taken of the measures and timetable for alignment of the competitive regime
in Croatia with that of the EU.
13.    Important medium and long-term competitive outside threats to INA's competitive position in
domestic markets should be identified, along with feasible counter measures. Such threats may
include:
(a)    Brand name marketing power of the 'majors', particularly in lubricants;
(b)    Control and expansion of specific infrastructure, such as port receiving facilities and
pipelines.5
(c)    Control of either the Rijeka or Sisak Refinery, and/or their receiving facilities by a
competitor.
14.     The consultants should assess the impact in the short, medium, and long term  of various
measures to bring INA's refinery capacity to a level that can efficiently support a realistic share of
domestic demand. Such measures should include:
(a)    A phased close-down of crude oil refinery operations with the retention of storage and
terminal facilities, etc., needed to support imported product distribution, and local
crude oil export.
(b)    Retention of both fuels refineries with necessary rationalization.
(c)    Closure of one of the fuels refineries with retention of necessary storage and terminal
facilities, etc., for internal distribution.
(d)    Closure/sale of Zagreb and Rijeka/Mlaka.
Organization of the Studies
15.    A counter-part team from INA will be formed to work with the consultants. The consultants
are expected to work closely with the staff of INA and provide frequent briefings to the management
to ensure that the considerable expertise of INA 6 is utilized and that the views of management on the
course of the study are taken into account at an early stage.
16.    ORESE  will supervise the studies and will constitute a steering committee made up of
representatives from other concerned ministries and institutions to which the consultants will give
periodic status reports, and receive advice on aspects of the study. As UBS will need the results of
the study in order to carry out its responsibilites, UBS should have a representative on the steering
4      This process is likely to be an iterative one as the comparative advantage that INA may have in these
markets will depend on the specific measures that are to be adopted.
5      It may be feasible to expand the receiving facilities at Omisalj to include products and to construct a
product pipeline over the existing right of way for the JANAF pipeline.
6      The consultants should carry out an early review with INA to determine to what extent, if
any, the refinery computer optimization models can be used to generate necessary analytical
data.



- 34 -
committee and may need to work directly with the consultant and the INA counter-part team in
specific areas of interest.
Organization of the Work Team
17.   Apart from the necessary business management, economic and financial backing, the work
team should include technical specialists in refinery operation and economics, distribution, logistics,
and international petroleum marketing and trading.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
IN SUPPORT OF ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM
Bank Rehabilitation Agency
Terms of Reference
Financial Services (Assets sales and management)
Summary
1.    The financial advisor will provide a combination of training and services to the Bank
Rehabilitation Agency ('BRA') in the context of preparing the sale of shares owned by the BRA in
one or several banks or enterprises, and assisting BRA in managing selected assets.
Background
2.    The Croatian Bank and Enterprise Restructuring and Privatization program relies heavily on
the newly-established Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA) to carry out or supervise both enterprise and
bank restructuring. Under the restructuring model adopted by the Croatian authorities, the BRA is to
become part or full-owner of five problem banks ('the banks') accounting for about 50 percent of the
banking system's assets, and to seek their subsequent privatization. To rehabilitate the banks, as well
as facilitate their privatization, it is also envisioned that the BRA will conduct, or supervise, the
management of at least some of their troubled assets.
3.    The BRA  itself was established by the Law on Savings Deposits Insurance and Bank
Rehabilitation, adopted by the Croatian Parliament in 1994. It is supervised by a Board chaired by
the Prime Minister and comprised of key Croatian officials. The BRA managing Director was
appointed in July 1995 and is in the process of finalizing the staffing of BRA and arranging training.
4.    In July 1995, the BRA carried out the rehabilitation of Slavonska Banka (SB), as a result of
which it became the owner of [35] percent of SB's shares. The decision to rehabilitate Rijecka Banka
and Istarska Banka, made in February 1996, is expected to result in the BRA's becoming the sole
owner of these two banks. In the near term, similar decisions and outcomes are expected to take
place with two other Croatian banks in need of rehabilitation, Privredna Banka Zagreb and Istarska
Banka.
5.    In addition to becoming the part or full-owner of selected banks, the BRA is expected to play
a major role in managing some of these banks' troubled assets. The BRA's asset management
activities will be carried out using several methods:
-   first, for major assets, the BRA will execute a carve-out from the banks' balance sheets,
and will carry out the management of assets directly, in close coordination with the
relevant Government Agencies, such as the Ministry of Economy, or the Office for
Restructuring of State Enterprises; asset management may entail, in selected cases,
conversion of loans into shares, and the subsequent search for prospective owners of the
enterprises involved;



- 41 -
second, a number of assets will also be carved out from the banks' balance sheets, but
BRA intends to contract their management out to Croatian firms;
third, smaller assets will remain under the management of the banks, and will be
managed by the banks according to policies and procedures which we have agreed with
the World Bank will be applied for this purpose.
I. SALE OF BRA'S SHARES
6.     The sale of BRA's shares in banks or enterprises is authorized by the Law on Savings
Deposits Insurance and Bank Rehabilitation, as amended in [April 1996]. Although a variety of
privatization methods may be considered by the BRA, it is expected that offerings to multilateral and
foreign institutional investors, or to Croatian investors, will be the preferred method.
Tasks
7.     The tasks to be performed by the financial advisor will be as follows:
(a)    Performance of Due Diligence. The financial advisor will perform full due diligence
on the balance sheet and income statement of the banks or enterprises for sale, to the
extent required to prepare a prospectus and other offering documents to international
standards and in compliance with Croatian securities laws. Full access to the books,
records, management, and external auditors of the entities for sale, and to the
management and staff of the BRA, will be provided for this purpose. As far as banks
are concerned, it is hoped that the external auditors will be completing their audit of
1995 financial statements at about the same time as the financial advisor commences
work, and the financial advisor will be required, to the extent possible, to coordinate
with the auditors with the objective of minimizing the duplication of requests for
information.
(b)    Valuation. Using the results of its due diligence and research regarding local and
international securities markets, the financial advisor will provide the BRA with a
range of estimated valuations for the shares under different sales structures.
(c)    Preparation of Documentation for a Domestic Public Offering. The financial advisor
will work in close cooperation with BRA to prepare all required documentation,
including a prospectus, for a Croatian domestic public offering.
(d)    Preparation of an International Offering Memorandum.  In the event that it is
required, the financial advisor will prepare all necessary documentation for the
placement of a portion of the BRA's holdings with multilateral and other foreign
institutional investors.
(e)    Training Component. The financial advisor will be expected to provide on the job
(and other formal, if appropriate) training to BRA staff. The form of training should
include fully integrating staff nominated by the BRA into the financial advisor's team
assigned to this project to ensure that the staff receive exposure to all aspects of the
advisor's work under these terms of reference. Significant weight will be given in the
evaluation of proposals from prospective financial advisors to their willingness to
commit time, personnel, and other resources to this task.



- 42 -
Confidentiality Agreement
8.    The financial advisor will be required to enter into a confidentiality agreement with both the
BRA and any of the entities to be privatized. Proposals regarding this assignment should include a
copy of the financial advisor's standard confidentiality agreement.
Sub-Contractors
9.    Performance of the due diligence work will require the contractor to be able to value bank
assets in Croatia and to work with a large number of Croatian language documents, in addition to
documents in other European languages. At the tender briefing to be held on [    ], the BRA will
supply prospective financial advisors with a list of approved Croatian subcontractors which are
qualified to assist the financial advisor in the performance of his tasks. Tenders should include details
of the Croatian sub-contractor selected by the financial advisor.
II. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
Types of Assistance Required
10.   In order to support the methods of asset management described above, the agency is
requesting that technical assistance support to this function be provided in the most flexible manner
possible.
11.   The BRA requires assistance for two distinct technical assistance projects:
-   first, the provision of general training in the area of asset management. This training
would be requested for all groups working on BRA assets. The BRA intends to adopt
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) based policies and procedures and
accordingly would need the assistance of experts in this area for a period of about three
months;
-   second, over a one year period, assistance would be for very specific purposes related to
the restructuring of particular assets. In these cases the contractor or its subcontractors
would be required to provide expertise with respect to a specific type of company and
would need industry-specific expertise.
In order to manage this process, the contractor/contractor consortium should have a local
representative available to work with the BRA on an as-needed basis to refine the BRA's requests for
specific assistance.
Training Component - Tasks
12.   Financial restructuring skills are available in Croatia and the BRA would not anticipate
needing general training in this area. The Training component would be focused on training BRA
staff and contractors in FDIC case-based management policies and procedures, including, training in
case preparation, file maintenance, and committee/board presentation and decision making processes.



- 43 -
Training Component - Qualifications
13.   A contractor capable of delivering FDIC-trained personnel for this purpose would be most
appropriate.
Asset Specific Component - Project Management
14.   The management arrangement for the provision of the Asset Specific component of technical
assistance will be crucial to the success of the project. We propose that the BRA be the apex
institution for this purpose. In this role, the BRA would request the contractor to provide, within the
scope of the terms of reference, short-term assistance to a specific enterprise under the control of the
agency. The assistance request would specify the exact types of experts required.
Asset Specific Component - Tasks
15.   In order to service the anticipated technical assistance needs under this component, we would
propose that the contractor have available for short-term assignments the following experts able to
perform the specified functions:
-  Financial Assistance (5 experts)
(a) Establish and/or improve financial reporting systems
(b) Install tight but simple working capital and cash flow management and reporting
systems
(c) Assess management accounting needs
(d) Conduct detailed product profitability analysis and establish cost accounting systems
(e) Conduct detailed cost review to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for expense
reduction.
-  Marketing Assistance (5 experts)
(a) Establish and/or expand the sales and marketing function
(b) Assist in preparation of marketing strategy and plans
(c) Seek export opportunities using network of existing contacts
(d) Review and make recommendations regarding sales networks
(e) Conduct detailed competitive analysis in both foreign and domestic markets
(f) Review and make recommendations regarding product pricing strategies
(g) Review and make recommendations regarding product development needs
-  Production (6 experts)
(a) Analysis of standard manufacturing times on the shop floor
(b) Review and make recommendations for actions to improve productivity
(c) Review quality standards and make reconmmendations to bring products into line with
export standards (EU and other)
(d) Review and make recommendations regarding cost reductions and opportunities for
efficiency gains through the use of subcontractors.
(e) Review and make recommendations for production process design and shop floor
layout.



- 44 -
IT/MIS assistance (5 experts)
(a) Assess requirements and make recommendations for the purchase of hardware and
software to provide financial systems support
(b) Design IT support required for budget and cost accounting functions
(c) Review and make recommendations regarding MIS needs
Organization & Human resources
(a) Provide senior and middle management with functional training courses
(b) Provide shop floor training to improve quality, with focus on meeting appropriate ISO
standard.
Asset Specific Component - Qualifications & Tasks
16.   The asset specific component calls for a firm (more likely a consortium of firms) capable of
providing industry specific expertise. The focus of this expertise should be on the issues faced by
large industrial concerns and would include areas such as process engineering, labor rationalization
and retraining, marketing, financial systems, information technology and management information
systems.  The process engineering and marketing sub-components would require experts with
extensive industry specific experience, and the marketing component would specifically require
expertise in the Western European markets which are serviced by the enterprises which will be in the
BRA asset portfolio.
a) Team Leader
The resident team leader would be in charge of coordinating all assignments under the
Asset Specific component of the technical assistance. The team leader would have both an
administrative and an operational role by assuming the responsibility for the timely
implementation of all sub-projects and for providing for quality assurance for the work being
performed. The team leader would:
- assist the Director, Asset Management Department, of the BRA in identifying technical
assistance needs in the enterprises being restructured by the agency and its contractors;
- develop and agree with the BRA and the recipient enterprise terms of reference and cost
estimates for each technical assistance task;
- identify the appropriate experts to be used for each task;
-  monitor and evaluate each technical assistance assignment and propose follow-up actions,
if required; and
- ensure coordination between technical assistance tasks and ensure that opportunities for
efficiencies are utilized.
The team leader should demonstrate exceptional communications skills at the senior
management level and have significant experience in a management role in a consulting firm,
preferably with a specialization in industrial management consulting. The ability to speak
Croatian and/or German in addition to English would be an advantage.



- 45 -
b) Short-Term Experts
Short-term experts should have proven experience (not less than 10 years, at least the last
five of which should be in the identified specialty) as consultants or in industry in one of the
five areas described under the Asset Specific component.  Short-term  experts should be
available for assignments not to exceed four weeks on three weeks' notice from the team
leader.
III. COMMON PROVISIONS

the former SFRY; and, any commercial relationship or other client relationship between the financial
advisor and a government or government-controlled institution in a former member state of the
