opportunities, generate incomes for poor\n            farmers in Oro Province, and protect the habitat of the\n            world's largest butterfly, which is an endangered\n            species.  The project consists of six components.  The first\n            component, smallholder oil palm development includes: (a)\n            planting about 6,500 ha of oil palm in two areas of Oro\n            Province, Popondetta and Kokoda; (b) strengthening extension\n            services; and (c) building and maintaining agricultural\n            roads and social infrastructure.  The second component, main\n            road improvement, entails the upgrading and maintenance of\n            national road sections from Popondetta to Kokoda.  The third\n            component, environmental protection, will protect an\n            endangered butterfly species and its associated ecosystem.\n            The fourth component, institutional strengthening, includes\n            the strengthening of:  (a) the capacity of the Department of\n            Agriculture and Livestock for policy formulation and project\n            preparation in the tree crop subsector; (b) the management\n            of the Oil Palm Industry Corporation (OPIC); and (c) oil\n            palm research.  The other two components are technical\n            assistance to OPIC; and studies in the tree crop subsector."}, "docdt": "1992-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
