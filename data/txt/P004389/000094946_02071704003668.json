Lessons learned from\n            the project experience include: 1) The project provided an\n            example of smallholder tree crop development, as an\n            appropriate model to promote agricultural development,\n            create rural employment, and alleviate poverty, provided the\n            scheme is properly designed, and implemented, with an\n            acceptable international commodity price. In this context\n            however, the experience points at the fact that, in order to\n            benefit fully from this model, it is essential that both the\n            Government, and project agencies place equal importance on\n            complementary initiatives in rural infrastructure, and\n            delivery of technical services, and inputs. 2) The\n            involvement of a number of components in this project, that\n            do not normally pertain to a single government institution,\n            needs to ensure effective means of coordinating activities,\n            and provide attention to issues that can endanger\n            implementation. This coordination was not effective in the\n            project, whereas in an earlier oil palm project, the\n            existence of a Project Management Committee proved\n            successful. 3) To maximize oil palm development along access\n            roads, institutional, and funding arrangements need to\n            enable their timely construction and maintenance, critical\n            to allow fresh fruit collection. 4) In development programs,\n            in particular where attitudes, and behavior of smallholders\n            needs to be adopted, an effective monitoring capability is\n            required, implying the need for a management information\n            system, as well as the ability to analyze data, conduct\n            surveys, and study work as a basis for corrective action."}, "docdt": "2002-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
