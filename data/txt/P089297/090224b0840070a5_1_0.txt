1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and Sector Background Following a period of prolonged civil conflict during
the “Tensions” of 1998 to 2003, the Solomon Islands moved through a period of post-
conflict reconstruction to longer-term development planning. Law and order were
restored with the intervention of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands
(RAMSI) 1 in 2003, progress was made in reestablishing the basic functions of
government and infrastructure and basic services were restored. Combined with the
infusion of major support from donors, economic activity started to recover, and the
Solomon Islands emerged from a period negative GDP growth to reach over 6% in 2006.

Despite the positive GDP growth, development of the rural economy remained sluggish,
due mainly to the breakdown in provision of services and infrastructure necessary to
support economic growth and maintain reasonable living standards. This was reflected
not only in conditions on the ground, but also in the levels of public expenditures on
agriculture and rural development which, in 2003/2004, had fallen to less than half the
levels of the early 1990s (on a real, per head basis) following the general deterioration of
the country’s fiscal position. Efforts to promote changes in technology and productivity
enhancing measures tended to be thwarted by the general unavailability of technical
assistance, agriculture credit and reliable transport, breach of contract, and other factors
which resulted in rising costs and lowering business confidence. Under these
circumstances, the private sector ability to take the lead in service and infrastructure
provision and rehabilitation of service delivery and local infrastructure systems was seen
as a necessary condition for reviving the rural economy.

Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Ministry of Development Planning and Aid
Coordination (MDPAC) led the preparation of a coordinated national strategy for long-
term agricultural and rural development (the Agriculture and Rural Development
Strategy – ARDS), and the World Bank was tasked to coordinate the work. The ARDS
was officially launched by MDPAC in April 2007 and the World Bank was asked to take
the lead in the preparation of the Rural Development Program (RDP) to support the
implementation of some of the key priorities of the ARDS and donor harmonization. The
RDP responded to the World Bank Pacific Regional Engagement Framework 2006-2009,
which emphasized the need to address the root causes of the conflict in the Solomon
Islands by focusing in particular on the need for rural communities in different provinces
to benefit directly from the post-conflict stability – specifically better access to social,
economic infrastructure and services and the promotion of income-generation activities

 RAMSI is a partnership between the people and government of the Solomon Islands and fifteen countries
of the Pacific. It arrived in the Solomon Islands in July 2003, at the request of the Solomon Islands
Government, following a period known as “the tensions” which lasted from 1998-2003, during which there
was conflict between rival militant groups representing the peoples of Guadalcanal and Malaita.



                                                 16
as a basis for more inclusive growth. It sought to move from fragmented, uncoordinated
donor activities, to a joint program of investments implemented by government and
using a single set of procedures. RDP was co-financed by donors involved in preparation
of the ARDS – AusAID, the European Commission (EC) and the World Bank and
subsequently in 2010 by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The original PDO was “to raise the living standards of rural households by establishing
improved mechanisms for the delivery of priority economic and social infrastructure and
services through: (i) increased, cost-effective and sustained provision of local services
and basic infrastructure determined through participatory planning prioritized by
villagers; (ii) increased capacity of agriculture institutions to provide demand-driven
agriculture services at the local level; and (iii) support for rural business development.”

The Key Performance Indictors (KPIs) were: (i) Number of people using the
infrastructure and agriculture services provided; and (ii) Percentage of rural households
satisfied with the quality of infrastructure and agriculture services provided.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
The PDO was changed on September 4, 2013 with the approval of a second Additional
Financing (AF2). The revised PDO was “to increase access to high priority, small-scale
economic and social infrastructure, agriculture and financial services in rural areas.” The
rationale for change was two-fold: (i) that improvements in living standards were
difficult to measure and attribute to project investments; and (ii) data collected via the
baseline survey and ongoing monitoring could be applied to measure access to services.

Also, both of the original PDO KPIs were changed. At AF1, in September 2010, one
indicator was revised and one was added (Indicator #3 in the datasheet). In AF2 all three
existing KPIs were changed in relatively minor ways and one (Indicator #4) was added.
The rationale for the changes was to: improve clarity, enable more accurate use of the
baseline data for comparison, evaluate the impact of the highest demand service areas
(water supply) and permit gender disaggregation. Core indicators from the Bank’s
Participation and Civic Engagement and Agriculture Extension and Research sectors
were also included in AF2.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
Beneficiary targets and categories were set in the PAD. Primary beneficiaries were
defined as individuals in rural communities expected to benefit from improved access to
infrastructure and services (including agriculture support services and financial services),
and were estimated to be 300,000 people. Secondary beneficiaries included civil servants
in the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL), in particular, at the provincial level
and service providers in the private and NGO sectors. In AF1, the target of 300,000
people was narrowed from beneficiaries of Components 1, 2 and 3 to only Component 1,
“beneficiaries of completed subprojects.” This more narrow definition of beneficiaries
was maintained in AF2 to maintain continuity with AF1 and an indicator was added to
specify the proportion of beneficiaries that are women.

1.5 Original Components
Component 1: Local Infrastructure and Services Delivery (US$9.08 million; IDA
US$1.30 million). This component sought to increase access to and use of infrastructure
and services in rural areas through a community-driven development (CDD) approach
including participatory planning, budgeting and execution mechanisms at community
and provincial level. The RDP would finance investments identified by villagers as the
most urgent preconditions for improved living standards, ensure that villagers themselves
played a significant role in determining investment priorities and that a greater share of
funds would actually reach communities. The component would provide (i) annual
allocations for community development grants identified through a participatory
planning process, and (ii) capacity building to support key stakeholders to plan, budget,
implement, and monitor and evaluate sub-projects.

Component 2: Improved Agricultural Services (US$6.42 million; IDA US$0.93 million).
This component aimed to improve access of smallholder households to quality
agricultural services to support rural income growth. The component would provide (i)
annual agricultural service allocations at the provincial level to finance service
agreements with providers to deliver agriculture and related services to smallholders; and
(ii) capacity building of (a) MAL at the national level to facilitate and supervise
provincial service delivery, (b) provincial service providers and (c) rural households.

Component 3: Rural Business Development (US$2.37 million; IDA US$0.39 million).
This component aimed to facilitate rural enterprise development through provision of an
equity financing facility and associated training and technical assistance (TA). A
“Supplemental Equity Facility” (SEF) aimed at alleviating a shortage of project equity
for investment projects of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) involved in rural
business would be established. Investments by SEF grant recipients were expected to
expand business activity in rural areas through increased purchase of agricultural raw
materials, job creation and associated rural expenditure such as transport.

Component 4: Program Management (US$3.7 million; IDA US$0.58 million). This
component would provide support to the Program Coordination Unit (PCU) within
MDPAC for program management which included coordination, communication
activities, planning and implementation scheduling, monitoring and evaluation (M&E),
procurement, financial management, reporting and operation of the Designated Account.
The PCU would be assisted by internationally recruited specialists who would transfer
their skills (both technical and managerial) so that the mainstreamed project activities
would become a part of public expenditure programs.

1.6 Revised Components (N/A)

1.7 Other significant changes
Several changes were made as a part of the first and second rounds of Additional
Financing (AF1 and AF2).




                                           18
On October 21, 2010, the Bank approved AF1 with an IDA grant of SDR2 million
(US$3 million equivalent) and additional trust fund financing of US$3 million. The total
project cost increased from US$21.83 million to US$31.90 million to fill a financing gap
created by high inflation in the first two years of implementation and to scale up
Component 1 geographically from six provinces (Choiseul, Isabel, Makira, Malaita,
Temotu and Western) to eight (adding Central and Guadalcanal). Component 2 was
extended to cover all nine provinces (including all of the above, as well as Renbel). To
allow time for expansion and make up for time lost during slow project start-up, the
closing date was extended from November 30, 2012 to November 30, 2013. The
institutional arrangements were amended slightly to include a Program Support Unit
(PSU) in each province. The Results Framework was amended to improve clarity, and
the Pest Management safeguard policy (OP4.09) was triggered and a Pest Management
Plan was subsequently adopted by MAL in 2011 and incorporated into the ESMF
screening processes, satisfying the legal requirements of the amendment to the Financing
Agreement. The grant became effective on November 23, 2010.

On September 30, 2013, AF2, with another IDA grant of SDR2 million, was approved,
and the total project cost rose from US$31.9 million to US$37.4 million. AF2 filled
financing gaps caused by a combination of exchange rate losses, cancelled EC financing
of US$2.52 million because these unspent resources could not be extended beyond the
funding cycle for the European Development Fund (EDF9), cost escalations and the
additional incremental cost of extending the closing date by another 15 months, to
February 28, 2015. Under AF2, the PDO and Results Framework were also amended as
per sections 1.3 and 2.3. The grant became effective on December 2, 2013.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Background analysis: The project design was informed mainly by the analysis and
recommendations of the ARDS. The ARDS drew extensively on the Solomon Islands
Smallholder Agriculture Study (SISAS) completed by AusAID in 2006, in particular, the
potential for productivity enhancement in specific crops, as well as subject-specific
analytical studies commissioned by the Bank to assist preparation. The project design
also benefited from previous development projects and international experience of
community driven and service delivery projects, in the social, agriculture and financial
sectors, in particular, the Community Development Scheme (CDS) which also financed
small-scale infrastructure. As such, RDP included community procurement and financial
management in an effort to enhance sustainability. The design also reflected lessons
learned from community-driven development (CDD) in other countries and regions
including in post-conflict situations, local and international experience of demand-driven
agricultural services and the extensive reviews of the rural financial sector that were
being made at the time of the design.

Project Objectives and indicators: The original PDO was, and still is, highly relevant for
rural development in the Solomon Islands, but the language “to raise the living standards


                                           19
…” proved difficult to measure and was therefore was revised to, “to increase access to
…”. The original PDO indicators were also revised at AF2 (see Section 2.3 below).
Delays in completing the baseline study, which was only commissioned in 2009 and
completed in 2010, caused delays in the completion of indicators and measurement
results, many of which were not specified in the PAD due to insufficient data.

Project design: Emerging from a crisis, government systems were quite weak and a CDD
approach was appropriate in that it allowed for broad-based development investment
with limited direct government delivery and reduced risk of fraud and corruption. It
recognized the time and effort required to achieve institutional sustainability, working
through and strengthening government systems so that mechanisms could be
mainstreamed to avoid creating parallel structures. The Project was designed as part one
of a long-term two-phase program, recognizing that five years would not be sufficient to
institutionalize a new CDD mechanism. Phase one (initially five years) was designed to
test and gradually scale up effective approaches to promote sustainable, rural livelihoods,
and an eventual phase two (5 to 10 years) would focus on further scaling up,
consolidation and institutionalization. The challenges of institutional sustainability,
which provided some justification for a second phase, are reflected in the World Bank’s
own study – Towards Better Investment in Rural Communities (World Bank Group
Solomon Islands, 2014). The study concluded that Component 1 of RDP created an
effective model for inclusive, community-driven prioritization and resource allocation
for rural service improvement, even though planning systems had not yet been integrated
with provincial and national processes, and sustainable government financing had not yet
been established.

Institutional arrangements: While MDPAC was mainly a coordination agency, it was
selected as the main implementing agency to house the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
due to its relatively high capacity compared to other alternatives. Concerns regarding
MAL’s capacity to manage a large donor project were addressed by channeling funds
through MDPAC to MAL. While there was some healthy tension between MDPAC and
MAL regarding MAL requests for payment, the arrangement was responsive and
efficient. Provincial arrangements worked well, although the initial approach of covering
more than one province with a single PSU was too ambitious and was subsequently
addressed at AF1.

Adequacy of Government commitment: MDPAC led preparation of the ARDS, which
was officially launched in April 2007, paving the way for preparation of the Project.
While SIG had limited analytical and design capacity to undertake analytical and detailed
design work, there was a strong strategic focus on implementing the recommendations of
the ARDS.

Risk assessment: The project summary risk rating was assessed as “substantial” after
mitigation, which was reasonable given SIG’s limited experience with CDD approaches
and its limited capacity.




                                            20
At PDO level, a substantial risk identified was the weak capacity in MDPAC, MAL and
the Provincial Governments, for which the following mitigation measures were put in
place: (i) hiring qualified people to support implementation and work conditions
improvement; (ii) training and capacity building; and (iii) clear operational manuals. In
MDPAC, capacity building was initially hindered by difficulties over appointing an
adequately qualified International Program Management Advisor (IPMA) – three IPMAs
were appointed in as many years – leaving the burden on the National Program Manager
(NPM). Although the NPM proved to be sufficiently qualified and skilled to carry out all
of the required responsibilities the early challenge of changing IPMAs was eventually
addressed.

At the component level a moderate risk identified was the possibility of weak private
sector and or NGO agriculture service provision, leaving the burden on government
services. The following migration measures were put in place: (i) capacity building of
private service providers and other non-state actors (NSAs); and (ii) contracting of
service providers to instill confidence. These mitigating actions were insufficient to
manage the risk of weak private sector or NGO service provision.

Section 2.2 Implementation
Project restructuring. The project was restructured twice, once to expand geographic
coverage and fill financial gaps resulting from inflation and slow project start-up, and a
second time to fill a significant financial gap left from inaccurate estimation of costs at
the time of the first restructuring and a substantial amount of cancelled EU funds.

Establishing a CDD mechanism. As expected from experience in other countries,
establishing CDD mechanisms proved to be complex and time consuming while the
simple mechanisms used to deliver extension services to farmers under Component 2 and
financing to rural businesses in Component 3 were more straightforward and efficient.
The first round of grants took an especially long time to deliver, as processes were being
established and learned. Efficiency was gained over time, but extensions of the closing
date were needed to complete subproject cycles and there were additional management
costs associated with these extensions.

Geographical challenges. The remote, island nature of the country makes the
procurement and delivery of supplies, as well as technical support (e.g. engineers), time-
consuming and expensive. Four PSUs were initially established to serve the initial six
participating provinces, but another four PSUs were later established, partly to cover the
two new provinces added with AF, and partly to provide more intensive coverage by
having one PSU per province.

Cancellation of EU Funding. The cancellation of $2.4 million in EU financing in 2010
left a shortfall which was not compensated for in AF1, and had to therefore be addressed
in AF2. This cancellation of funds was due to the closure of the 9th European
Development Fund (EDF9) funding window prior to full utilization of the funds, which
was in turn due to the slow start-up of the project.




                                            21
Leveraging power of grants. Community development grants not only leveraged
community cash and in-kind contributions, but also ward (Member of Provincial
Assembly), provincial government, and national Member of Parliament co-financing.
Around 14% of sub-projects received co-financing contributions of between 1% and
35% of the total value of the grants. While no SIG cash contribution was planned at
appraisal or AF1, SBD30 million was contributed as part of AF2. This built the base for
an annual allocation for RDP under the follow-on project, RDP 2 (Cr. 5574, Grant
D0220).

Private Sector Participation. Project preparation did not sufficiently assess the
availability of private service providers nor did it put in place any activities for their
development during implementation, leaving the burden for service delivery during
implementation on an already under-capacitated MAL. As an alternative to private sector
or NGO agriculture service contracts, the provision of financing for the Monthly Action
Plans (MAPs) of provincial MAL extension offices proved an efficient means of
delivering demand-driven agriculture services to farmers. Participatory Rural Appraisals
(PRAs) across the country established a detailed work program for agricultural extension
offices to respond to over time, rebuilding the connections between MAL and farmers,
which had deteriorated during the civil conflict.

Slow up-take of SEF. There was initially low uptake on Supplemental Equity Financing
(SEF) largely because of a failure by MDPAC early on to plan to work with participating
commercial banks to promote the availability of this facility to eligible rural businesses.
While total financing was cut back, following the initiation of activities to promote SEF,
the uptake increased sharply and outcome targets were met well in advance of project
closure.

Mid-Term-Review (MTR). The MTR was conducted before Component 1 completed a
full subproject cycle, so the lessons were limited and full operational costs were not yet
known. As a result, the budget produced for AF1 was ill informed and thus insufficient
for the planned scale-up into additional provinces. This was one of the main reasons
underpinning the justification for AF2.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Design: M&E arrangements included the use of a baseline, household survey and
establishment of a Management Information System (MIS) comprising sub-project
physical information, financial management data used to generate statements of
expenditure and program management information used to generate reports.
Measurements focused significantly on access to services and satisfaction with service
and infrastructure quality. For Component 2 the M&E system did not attempt to measure
changes in farmer productivity or production, but rather responsiveness to farmer needs
and the application of improved farming methods. For Component 3, the Central Bank of
Solomon Islands (CBSI) supported MDPAC to collect data from participating
commercial banks on the loan performance of their SEF recipients and to conduct spot
check interviews with beneficiary SMEs to assess the impacts on business operations.
Also, selected core sector indicators (CSI) from the Bank’s “Participation and Civic


                                            22
Engagement and Agriculture Extension and Research” sectors were added at the time of
AF2.

Implementation: Implementation of the baseline survey took a long time and did not
allow for the setting of several baseline indicators until 2010. Since the baseline survey
asked questions at the household and village levels, it did not align with some of the
original individual-oriented indicators in the PAD, and therefore, some results indicators
needed to be adjusted at the time of AF2. Effective project monitoring and reporting
were hampered by delays in establishment of an effective MIS. Three different systems,
designed by three different consultants were developed over the course of the Project.
The utility of the system improved each time and data was nonetheless systematically
collected; the system was sufficiently well structured to contribute effectively to
management decision-making. The Bank engaged experienced information technology
consultants to assist SIG and the basic data required for monitoring and evaluation were
gathered. A new, publicly accessible, web-based MIS was functional at project closure,
providing a robust system for use in RDP 2.

Impact Evaluation: An impact evaluation of Component 1 and 2 was implemented
through a partnership with the University of New South Wales: Evaluation of the
Solomon Islands Rural Development Program (2013). The evaluation survey was based
on a sample of 80 villages, with an overlap of 63 villages from the baseline survey, using
a non-randomized trial methodology. The small sample, the nature of the methodology
and the fact that some baseline villages were not surveyed, did somewhat limit the
evaluation’s scope for making causal inferences and before and after comparisons. The
evaluation did, however, provide the data needed to report on several results indicators
and a range of other topics that have helped improve project design. An impact
evaluation was also conducted specifically for Component 3: Evaluation of the
Supplemental Equity Facility of the Rural Development Program (2013). One of the
main conclusions and recommendations of the Evaluation was to require SEF grant
recipients to submit more baseline data in the future to allow for a broader assessment of
impact and to monitor indicators over time such as jobs created and additional revenue.
In retrospect some of this data was difficult to collect at the end of the Project.

Utilization: Most conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation of Components 1
and 2 along with the MTR and other Donor Review and Implementation Support
Missions were incorporated into AF1 and AF2, and on an on-going basis, into action
plans. The Component 3 evaluation was conducted after operation of this component had
ceased in 2013. The findings from both evaluations significantly informed the design of
RDP2, including simplifications in fiduciary systems and capacity building for
Community Helpers in Component 1, a shift in approach to more effectively leveraging
the private sector in Component 2, and narrowing the focus of a successful Component 3
to agriculture and livestock to deepen the impact in this sector.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards


                                           23
At appraisal, the Project was assessed as a category “B” project with the following four
safeguard policies triggered: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01), Forests (OP/BP
4.36), Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) and Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10). With the
processing of AF1, a fifth safeguard, the Pest Management (OP 4.09) policy, was
triggered due to the use of pesticides for farming under Component 2. An Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was adopted as the main risk management
instrument for covering the triggered policies at the time of appraisal and a Pest
Management Plan (PMP) was adopted in 2011 following the triggering of OP 4.09.

The ESMF and PMP were successfully implemented, and all policies were satisfactorily
complied with. In general, the ESMF provisions for Component 1 were overly complex,
(e.g. lengthy screening documentation and certification at subproject completion),
relative to the risks at the time of appraisal, so minor simplifications were made during
implementation. Some minor social and environmental and social safeguard issues
emerged over the course of the Project. For example, disputes over the use of natural
resources for community contributions such as sand, gravel, timber and land, as well as
inter-ward religious differences, led to the cancellation of a small number of subprojects.
The requirement that all subprojects be certified as ESMF compliant was difficult to
implement due to the limited specialized staff (only 1 or 2 officers) and the wide
geographical coverage of the subprojects. This became a bottleneck to the final
certification of subprojects. The use of spot audits would likely have been sufficient to
manage the identified risks, and has been incorporated into the RDP 2 design.

Fiduciary

Procurement: Six ex-post procurement reviews were conducted, and while they did not
identify any significant procurement issues, some minor concerns did arise and were
documented in agreed procurement action plans. Early on, procurement was hampered
by difficulties in finding suitably qualified candidates for many key PCU, MAL and
provincial positions, an insufficient level of technical assistance from the Procurement
Specialist hired by the Project and incomplete procurement plans. While record-keeping
was inadequate at times, there were no cases of mis-procurement, and the Procurement
Plan was completed at project closure.

Community procurement: Although procurement for sub-projects initially had serious
delays and cost overruns, these were largely addressed by the development of a range of
actions including: (i) PCU negotiating and drawing up price lists from a range of
suppliers in Honiara; (ii) PCU sending price lists to Subproject Implementation
Committees (SICs); (iii) SIC selecting suppliers and placing orders with accompanying
payments made by checks through the PCU; (iv) PCU organizing transportation of
materials; and (v) PCU, sometimes with the assistance of a Community Helper and or a
SIC member(s), supervising delivery of materials at the dock and loading onto ships. The
system reduced the time taken for procurement by several months in most cases and
secured an estimated 10 percent price reduction for materials and transport. Importantly,
it was reported to have no negative effects on communities’ ownership of construction


                                            24
processes, although it did place an extra time burden on the PCU. The system served also
to highlight issues such as the unreliability of charter ships and unpredictable price rises
due to weather conditions and prolonged journeys. Overall procurement policy was
complied with.

Financial management: Annual audits were completed albeit late with the exception of
the 2013 and 2014 audits. The latter two audits were submitted on time, as they were
completed by a private firm rather than by the Auditor General’s Office. Several
financial management issues arose mainly around staffing and reporting (especially over
outstanding staff advances) for which action plans were developed and implemented.
Periodic reviews were conducted by the Bank to review and improve operations, and the
recommendations and actions resulted in significant time savings, particularly via
automated salary payments and contract renewals. Three cases of misuse of funds, all by
PSU finance officers, were found and satisfactorily resolved. Financial management
policy was generally complied with.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
As at project closure, 79% of the completed subprojects had an Operations and
Maintenance (O&M) plan, including identified sources of financing, roles and
responsibilities. These O&M activities will continue to be implemented by communities
and supported by RDP Community Helpers. Extension activities implemented under
Component 2 will continue to be supported by MAL extension staff as needed.

Preparation of a follow-on operation, RDP 2, began nine months prior to the closure of
RDP I with the intention of ensuring continuity in the institutional arrangements across
the two projects. RDP 2 became effective on February 27, 2015 – a day before the
closure of RDP I. The design of RDP 2 drew heavily upon RDP I. RDP 2/Component 1
(Community Infrastructure and Services) largely replicates Component 1 of RDP I. This
component also incorporates sub-projects that remained incomplete following the closure
of RDP I, providing support to ensure that all of these subprojects are satisfactorily
completed. RDP 2/Component 2 (Agriculture Partnerships and Support) combines
elements of Component 2 and 3 of RDP I but with a much greater focus on private sector
partnerships with farmers. The SEF has been carried over to RDP 2, but it is targeted at
exclusively at the agriculture sector. This component also includes a dedicated disaster
recovery sub-component to support replacement and or repair of community
infrastructure, agriculture and livestock assets and infrastructure affected by the April
2014 flash floods in Guadalcanal.

Rating: Substantial

Relevance of the PDO




                                            25
The original PDO of raising living standards was highly appropriate in SI which was just
emerging from several years of civil strife, and the rural economy was sluggish due
inadequate services and infrastructure. Upon preparation of the Interim Strategy Note
for the period 2010 – 2011 (March 12, 2010, Report No. 53496-SB), the project PDO
was reflected in Strategic Area 3 of the ISN, improved public administration and
management. The link to public administration was reflected through the PDO focus on
“establishing improved mechanisms” for the delivery of services. As mentioned in
Section 1.1, RDP was a direct outcome of the Solomon Islands’ ARDS of 2007 which
emphasized the need to strengthen local governance and service delivery, make growth
more inclusive by strengthening the agriculture sector and managing natural resources
more sustainably.

The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Solomon Islands (FY 13-17),
also attaches high priority to supporting rural communities. Strategic Area 2,
“underpinning improvement of public service provision” includes, in particular, a key
outcome on “increased access to rural services”. The CPS recognizes that most rural
areas do not feel the presence of the state and that a system for the equitable delivery of
basic services is needed. SIG’s National Development Strategy 2011 – 2020 also focuses
on social and economic development through the equitable distribution of public
resources and economic benefits across the country. Modest revision of the PDO in 2013
did not affect its relevance to the above referenced Bank and government strategies and
policy.

Since RDP 1 approval, successive governments have continued to place rural
development as a top policy priority. SIG provides substantial and ongoing rural
development financing through constituency development funds (CDFs), province-
oriented funds, specifically the PCDF; and community-oriented grant funds such as RDP.
RDP remains the only mechanism to respond directly to community demand on an
equitable basis, nationwide and its relevance is further signaled with the follow-on
project.

Relevance of the Design and Implementation

The overall design and implementation arrangements remain relevant for the SIG
approach to rural development and the Bank strategy. Under Component 1 the CDD
approach remains relevant for enabling access to and use of infrastructure and services in
rural areas through participatory planning, budgeting and execution mechanisms at
community and provincial level. National and provincial government capacity remains
insufficient to meet the needs of rural communities, and there is still a weak connection
between the needs of communities and the support that they receive from government.
Communities are motivated to manage their own development and they are able to
access the skills needed for implementation.

MAL capacity had been drastically depleted by the crisis and RDP helped to both rebuild
capacity and the connections to the needs of farmers. Going forward, MAL does not
have sufficient resources to continue to offer extension support to all farmers and is


                                            26
therefore shifting its focus to leveraging the capacity of the private sector to support
farmers. This focus on marketing and commercialization is reflected in MAL’s new
corporate structure and strategy, which emphasizes private sector engagement and
reducing the reliance on the public sector. This change in focus is reflected in the design
and the implementation arrangements of Component 2 in RDP 2.

The SEF remains a relevant instrument for addressing the constraints of rural businesses
in accessing finance, proving that rural business is very responsive to investment
opportunities if access to finance is facilitated. Commercial banks remain prepared to
offer this Facility to their customers, so it has been carried forward as a component of
RDP 2.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial. This assessment is based on achievements of the original PDO as
well as the revised PDO (revised with project restructuring and additional financing in
2013), each measured over the full duration of the Project. The period up to 2013 did not
involve any changes to the PDO, but changes were made to the grant amount and KPIs at
AF1 in 2010. At AF2 in 2013, the PDO was revised, and there was a change in the grant
amount and changes in the KPIs.

Original PDO and KPIs (including those modified at AF1)
The original PDO was “to raise the living standards of rural households by establishing
improved mechanisms for the delivery of priority economic and social infrastructure and
services through: (i) increased, cost-effective and sustained provision of local services
and basic infrastructure determined through participatory planning prioritized by
villagers; (ii) increased capacity of agriculture institutions to provide demand-driven
agriculture services at the local level; and (iii) support for rural business development.”
The original KPIs in the PAD were: (i) number of people using agriculture and
infrastructure services provided; and (ii) percentage of rural households satisfied with the
quality of agriculture and infrastructure services provided. While the PDO remained the
same, the KPIs were modified at AF1 to: (i) Percentage of villages with satisfactory
access to functioning infrastructure; and (ii) % of villages with improved access to
effective agriculture services. Assessment of the original PDO is complicated by the
adjusting of KPIs at AF1 in 2010. The revised KPIs mainly divided one of the original
KPIs into two separate KPIs, one for the CDD component and one for the agriculture
component. As such, this assessment will refer to the original indicator of “number of
people” as PDO 1, and then satisfaction with infrastructure as PDO 2 and satisfaction
with agriculture services as PDO 3. Both the original KPIs and the revised KPIs remain
useful measures of the PDO, so the assessment of PDO achievement will be based on a
combination of both types of KPIs.

The institutional objective reflected in the PDO reference to “establishing improved
mechanisms” was substantially advanced during implementation, but the longer-term
challenges of achieving such an outcome were acknowledged from the outset, hence the
proposal to implement RDP in two five-year phases. A whole new architecture for


                                            27
community-driven service delivery had been built and delivered within four cycles of
community financing, and agriculture extension services were successfully being
delivered in response to participatory needs assessments. These systems were improved
beyond the ad hoc delivery of community infrastructure by previous donor funded
activities as well as agriculture extension services that were mainly supply-driven and
poorly financed prior to the Project. The presence of strong, inclusive community
participation processes for both ward development planning and financing as well as
agriculture extension services was confirmed through the household and community
surveys conducted as part of the 2013 project impact evaluation.

Revised PDO and KPIs

The PDO was revised at AF2 to make it more easily measurable, as “improved
mechanisms” are difficult to measure as are improvements in “living standards.”
Therefore, the PDO was narrowed to focus on access to services, and worded as such:
“to increase access to high priority, small-scale economic and social infrastructure,
agriculture and financial services.” The KPIs were modified to add one impact indicator
(convenience/time savings of water access), adjustments were made to align with the
baseline data collected, and a total beneficiary measure which was dropped at AF1 was
reintroduced. The indicators at AF2 were: (PDO 1) percentage decrease in travel time to
access improved water sources; (PDO 2) % of villages with satisfactory access to
infrastructure and or services; (PDO 3) % of households who have changed agricultural
practices, including varieties, as a result of agricultural advice; and (PDO 4) number of
beneficiaries of completed community development projects/which are women.

Access to Infrastructure

In the PAD, a target value of 300,000 people was set for PDO 1, “number of people
using agriculture and infrastructure services provided.” This indicator was meant to be a
combined total of beneficiaries from Component 1 and 2. On PDO 4, at the time of AF1,
the means of calculating total beneficiaries shifted from a combination of Component 1
and Component 2 beneficiaries at the time of the PAD, to a more narrow focus on
Component 1 subproject beneficiaries. As such, the target should have been reduced. The
target was kept at 300,000 at the time of AF2 as the total number of subproject
beneficiaries appeared to be trending towards a 300,000 outcome based on subproject
design documentation. At project closure, 198,340 people were benefitting from
completed subprojects, or two-thirds of the target. There were still 77 subprojects that
were not yet operational at closure. All project funds had been disbursed to these
subprojects and, on average, they were about 80% completed by October 2015, six
months from project closure. With support provided under RDP 2, all of these
subproject are expected to be completed by March 2016, at which point there will be a
projected total of 262,099 beneficiaries comprising 87% of the target. This shows that
PDO4 is expected to be nearly achieved, especially taking into account the fact that the
number of beneficiaries for component 2 is not reflected while it was included in the
target. If the 26,000 farmers benefiting directly from participation in agricultural
extension activities were added to the total beneficiaries for Component 1, the project


                                           28
total would be 288,099 beneficiaries, quite close to the original KPI target (96% of the
target).

For PDO 1, there was a 13.5% decrease in travel time to access improved water supply
sources, which was over and above the target set at 10 percent. For PDO 2, there was a
92% increase in the number of villages reporting satisfactory access to infrastructure and
or services (calculated as a basket of services such as education, health, energy, water
supply, and transport weighted according to the percentage of subproject types financed
by RDP), which far exceeded the target of a 10% increase. In hindsight, the target should
have been set higher as there is little in the way of rural community investment and RDP
should have been expected to have a higher impact.

With an estimated rural population of around 415,000 according to the 2009 Census, the
total number of rural people benefitting from improved access to infrastructure would
eventually represent around 63% of the rural population. This represents significant
geographic coverage. Table 1, below provides a breakdown of the types infrastructure
rural communities are, or will be, benefitting as a result of RDP. Overall the quality of
the infrastructure is comparable to other similar modalities within the country and
globally, with technical audits conducted at the time of subproject completion to confirm
technical quality and to train in operations and maintenance. While the target for female
beneficiaries was 50%, the reported number of women beneficiaries is only 33%. This is
mainly due to underreporting by beneficiary communities as the national population
breakdown is 51% male, 49% male and this breakdown should be reflected in the
reported numbers.

*Includes all (complete and incomplete) sub-projects

There were mixed, but largely positive, results regarding intermediary indicators in terms
of access to infrastructure and services, many of which are evidence of the establishment
of effective, new systems for the delivery of public services. The baseline and end-line
household surveys 2 conducted for the impact evaluation found that 48 percent of
households in target planning units had participated in sub-project decision-making,
which was only a little over half the target set at 80 percent. On reflection, the target was
set unreasonably high as it is difficult to include such a high percentage of the
community in community decision-making meetings as they have varying village and
outside responsibilities which occupy them. In fact, 48% is a significant result with
respect to the establishment of effective participatory planning systems in CDD projects
globally. The total number of consultation participants was counted through sign-up
sheets rather than household surveys. The target of 30,000 participants was exceeded at
30,380, but the target for women was underachieved at 9,936, with a target of 12,000.
The target of 80% of sub-projects with arrangements for community engagement in post-
project operations and maintenance (O&M) was essentially achieved at 79% reported
from monitoring data collection. The target of 15% of total subproject financing from
communities was exceeded at 36%. This is a strong indication of community
commitment and ability to generate local co-financing, including from provincial
government, ward members (elected officials) and national Members of Parliament
(MPs). The household surveys also found that 94% of community members and 93% of
women, felt project investments reflect their needs, exceeding the targets set at 80% for
both total community members and women. Finally, the percent of representatives in
community based decision-making structures, specifically in SICs, were women came
out to 29%, just shy of the target of 30%.

Access to agricultural services

On PDO 3, 11.2% of households received agricultural advice and changed agricultural
practices, including varieties, well below the target set at 35 percent (but five times the
2% baseline). The main reason this number is low is that the calculation is based upon
the percentage of households who changed agriculture practices using both households
that received advice and those who did not. In other words, the result is 11.2% of all
households interviewed, not just households that received advice. If the calculation is

 The baseline (household) survey was conducted in two rounds in June 2009 and May 2010, interviewing
both men and women, and covering 1,388 households in 76 villages across the first four provinces to
participate in the project.



                                                   30
based only on households that received advice, the result would have been an impressive
48%, 138% of the target. An uptake rate of nearly 50% reflects a high level of relevance
and responsiveness of the agricultural extension advice provided.

The intermediate indicators for Component 2 were also generally positive. The
household survey found that 49% of villages in participating provinces were provided
with agricultural services, which was just below the target set at 50%. This also
represents a significant increase in access to agricultural services as this is nearly twice
as much as the 28% of villages that reported receiving agricultural advice at the time of
the baseline. Also, 79% of wards in participating provinces were provided with
agricultural services, which was below the target set at 90 percent. Nonetheless, these
high rates reflect wide geographic coverage. Table 3 provides a breakdown of the
agricultural services and beneficiaries reported by MAL.

More than one-half of beneficiaries received either cash crop (33%) of food crop (34%)
services, 18% benefitted from livestock services, 8% benefited from quarantine services,
(8%) and less than 1% received farmer association services. Targets for the total number
of individuals participating in provincial agricultural activities, and the percentage of
which were women, were both exceeded. The targets of 30,000 individuals/40 percent of
which women was exceeded with 37,004 individuals/46% of which were women,
reported, respectively.

Services provided were also highly demand-driven with 12,763 people/43 percent of
which were women, attending participatory needs identification. The total number of
participants was slightly under the target of 13,000, while the percentage of women
participating exceeding the target of 40 percent. Another indicator of the responsiveness
of agricultural services to specific farmer needs was the demonstration of 60 different
technologies (a core Bank core sector indicator), exceeding the target of 50.

Rural enterprise development and increased access to financial services

The original PDO language related to Component 3 referred to “rural enterprise
development” and was subsequently changed to "increased access to financial services”
at the time of AF2. The original language was broader than the revised language, but the
types of activities did not change nor did the intermediate indicators change to reflect any
revision in focus. There were three intermediate indicators aimed at measuring


                                            31
Component 3: (a) (Intermediate Outcome (IO) 20 (number of businesses established or
expanding in rural areas; (b) IO 21, profitability of the businesses established (revised to
"Percentage increase in turnover of businesses established" at AF1); and (c) IO 22,
increase in income or employment arising to rural people from businesses established
(revised to “average number of jobs created per SEF-supported business" at AF2).

For IO 20, as there was no initial target value, a value of 100 businesses was set at AF1.
This was subsequently revised downward to 50 businesses at AF2 to reflect slow initial
uptake by the participating banks. A year before project close the funds allocated for
Component 3 were exhausted and 65 businesses had benefitted from the SEF, 130% of
the revised target, 65% of the AF1 target. Unfortunately, IO 21 proved too difficult to
measure as SEF recipients did not have comparable, reliable data when interviewed for
an evaluation conducted after the component activities were completed. IO 22 also had
no original target value, was dropped at AF1, but then reinstated at AF2 with a target of
an average of 5 new jobs created by each SEF recipient. This target was exceeded with
an average of 5.8 jobs created per SEF-supported business. The original PDO reference
to “rural enterprise development” was substantially advanced by rural job creation as
well as strong uptake in supplemental equity financing which allowed rural enterprises to
invest more significantly in their business activity.

This component’s contribution towards achieving the revised PDO focus on increasing
access of rural households to high priority, financial services, can be seen in terms of its
leverage ratio of 1:3, i.e. every USD1 of project funds raised USD3 of recipient equity +
participating bank credit. Only one business, or 1.5% of the total, defaulted on the bank
loan received. This compares favorably with a similar CBSI program where default rates
are at 18%, indicating the likelihood of sustainability for benefits generated to date.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

While there are similar assessments of CDD projects in other countries that might
provide useful comparisons to assess Component 1 efficiency, cost levels are highly
dependent upon the economic environment within each country. Solomon Islands has
particularly high costs due to the distance from foreign supplier markets, and due to the
cost of domestic transport from the very few supply centers (e.g. Honiara is the primary
supply center for most provinces) to remote, infrequently visited locations around the
country. With only 66% of the target subprojects being complete and requiring additional
resources from RDP 2, the cost of facilitating subproject completion will continue to
increase until all of the ongoing subprojects are complete.

The quantification of the Project economic costs and benefits for Component 1 was
conducted ex-post using the RDP I design as an input into the RDP 2 design. A summary
of the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) for a selection of sub-projects is
presented in Table 6.

    Economic Internal Rate of Return

The EIRRs for selected sub-project categories range between 12 and 39 percent, which
fall within the range of returns for comparable projects. The result of the water sub-
projects, which report an EIRR of 21 percent, is particularly positive given that the
percent decrease in travel time to access improved water sources is one of the PDO KPIs
and hence a core measure of project achievement. A recent World Bank study reported
EIRRs of 18-53 percent for CDD infrastructure projects, which in comparable terms,
suggests the delivery of sub-projects is relatively efficient. The sub-projects are also,
based on the sample, efficient in absolute terms.

Unfortunately, there are no standard designs and bills of quantities to allow for a one-to-
one cost comparison of similar facilities (i.e. aid posts, or school classrooms) across rural
infrastructure projects similar to RDP, but an unpublished background paper on technical
sustainability prepared as an input to the Bank-published “Towards Better Rural
Investment in Solomon Islands” did include a comparison of costs and approaches
between similar projects within the country. The other projects examined were: Micro-
projects Program I (MPP I), Micro-projects Program II (MPP II), Rural Advancement
Micro-projects Program (RAMP) and the Provincial Capacity Development Fund
(PCDF). The report found the cost of RDP-financed subprojects to be comparable to
other similar projects in the Solomon Islands.

With respect to small-scale buildings, the paper concluded that, while the average cost
per m2 for different structures varies, the average cost per m2 for typical RDP structures
“is broadly consistent with international practice for low-cost permanent structures.”
Table 7 below provides a cost comparison of three common building types constructed
under RDP: kindergarten/kindy (single storey ground level masonry structure); nurse aid
post (ground level); and staff housing (raised building structure). All are timber-framed
structures. Although the variations in cost per m2 for the kindys and staff houses are
rather wide (25-30%) this is not inconsistent with the geographical/local variation.

The technical sustainability paper also examined RDP financed water supply schemes
taking account of the cost per beneficiary, per standpipe and per gallon. These show very
consistent costs when compared on a standpipe basis (See Table 8, below). While the
scope and design varied considerably from system to system, average costs remained
broadly consistent over time.

Note: Of the 137 schemes, some 71 are gravity fed, 45 rain fed. 4 are wells. 5 pumped
schemes and the balance of 12 are sanitation projects)

For Component 2, due to the lack of information or rigorous evaluation of past activities,
the absence of basic agricultural data on yields and farm systems, the demand driven
nature of the investments and the substantial non-quantifiable benefits, it is difficult to
calculate economic returns. A cumulative project total of US$3.79 million was
transferred to provincial MAL offices for conducting Participatory Rural Appraisal
(PRAs) to identify farmer needs and to subsequently deliver extension activities. A total
of 12,763 farmers were consulted and 36,954 farmers received extension support as a
result. Total combined beneficiaries of these activities (acknowledging that most farmers
would benefit more than once) comes to 49,717 activity beneficiaries. If this number is
divided by the total cost of US$3.79 million, the average cost per beneficiary is
US$76/per beneficiary. While it is not possible to establish exact and comparable figures,
a scan of nonprofit and private providers of agricultural services in similar circumstances
for similar purposes indicate costs of around USD50-100 per beneficiary.

Project costs also need to be set within the relatively recent tumultuous political
economy of the Solomon Islands. Following the period of prolonged civil conflict
during the “Tensions” of 1999 to 2003 (and soon after the food, fuel and financial crisis
of 2008 and the economic aftermath) the Solomon Islands moved through a period of
post-conflict reconstruction to longer-term development planning. The Solomon Islands


                                               35
however remains a “fragile state,” among the 18 IDA member countries with a (Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating below 3 in FY15. The destruction of
infrastructure and depletion of government services during the tensions placed a
significant extra cost-burden on the Project. The Project not only provided for the
construction of infrastructure, often where it has been completely degraded or was
simply absent, but it also contributed to re-building of the almost entirely depleted
agricultural extension and support services of the MAL.

For Component 3, total financing for SEF-financed projects came to SBD34.2 million, or
about US$4.3 million. Only SBD7,880,292, or about US$985,000 (at September 2015
exchange rates) was financed by SEF, slightly less than 25%. This is a significant
leveraging factor for investments in rural areas. Administrative costs for RDP are also
quite low, with the commercial banks bearing most of the responsibility for
administering the funds, and RDP mainly just responsible for proposal screening,
monitoring and evaluation. While the administrative cost of this component was not
explicitly tracked, but rather bundled within overall Project Management costs, it could
be estimated as perhaps a total of 4 months of the Program Managers time plus another 2
months of other staff time totalling approximately SBD300,000, or US$37,500. As a
percentage of total SEF-financed project cost (US4.3 million), administrative costs come
to about 0.9%. There are also processing and management costs on the part of the
commercial banks which are not included here, but which should be considered
leveraged private co-financing of the management costs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The overall outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory is justified based on combined
measures of relevance as substantial, efficacy as substantial and efficiency as modest.

Relevance: The PDO, design and implementation remained relevant and are rated
Substantial.

Efficacy: While the results of each indicator are mixed, the overall summary of results
when factoring in a weighting across pre and post-AF2 restructuring is Substantial. The
total number of individuals benefitting from “completed” subprojects is well short of the
300,000 target (198,340), but most of these subprojects have been completed since
project close as they were near completion at that time. The results of agriculture and
livestock activities were also better than the AF2 PDO indicator revealed. In contrast to
the 11.2% of households that had both received and applied advice (short of the 35%
target), 48% of households who received advice changed their farming practice. This is a
high response rate for extension advice. There was a 92% increase in satisfactory access
to infrastructure and services which far exceeded the 10 percent target.

Efficiency: While the lack of comprehensive data and analysis makes this difficult to
assess, based on a mix of surrogate measures and anecdotal information, the overall
Project was Modest. Subproject costs are comparable to other similar projects in the
Solomon Islands, and on par with similar rural infrastructure projects internationally.
Agriculture and livestock services were also relatively efficient from a per-beneficiary


                                           36
perspective and also in leveraging MAL staff resources. The cost of administering SEF
was very limited compared to the management time and investment by participating
commercial banks.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts: The original PDO was to raise the living standards of rural households
by establishing improved mechanisms for the delivery of priority economic and social
infrastructure and services by the public and private sector. While there was no explicit
reference to poverty in the PDO or any deliberate targeting of poor rural households,
certain aspects of the Project had an impact on a surrogate measure of poverty – food
security. The Evaluation of the Solomon Islands Rural Development Program (2013)
reported a statistically significant difference between advice received and food security.
On average, 90 percent of households who did receive advice, compared with 85 percent
of those who did not receive advice, were able to grow, catch and or buy enough food for
everybody. In other words, households that received advice were more likely to provide
an adequate food supply for everybody in the household. The 92% increase in
satisfaction with water supply, health, education, electricity and other basic services
reflect improvements for those who are “service poor,” the majority of those living in
rural areas.

Gender Aspects: These aspects are reported in Section 3.2. The KPI results for selected
gender disaggregated indicators show that the Project achieved or almost achieved
gender equality. Gender aspects were also addressed in the Evaluation of the Solomon
Islands Rural Development Program (2013). There are several key findings from the
Evaluation that illustrate on the one hand the importance women played in the Sub-
project Implementation Committees (SICs) and the effects of increased female
participation in the Project process on the other. First, women played an important role in
the SIC committees: (i) a community leader survey asked participants if they thought the
Project processes enabled women to influence decision making more than other
community projects – on average 85 percent responded positively; (ii) when the same
participants were asked how the Project enabled female engagement, close to 45 percent
listed women in the SIC as a driving factor; and (iii) on average around 85 percent of the
SICs included women. Secondly, increased female participation resulted in increased
effectiveness (i) when SICs included women 95 percent were reported to be effective
compared with 65% when they did not include women; (ii) when SICs included women
40 percent of community leader groups reported meetings occurred often while when
SICs did not include women 75 percent reported meetings rarely occurred; (iii) when
women were involved in the sub-projects selection process close to 69 percent of groups
reported the sub-project was complete compared with 57 percent when women were not
involved; (iv) when women were involved in the subprojects selection process, 37
percent of groups reported disagreements or disputes compared with 57 percent when
women were not involved. Beyond the positive impacts of the project for rural women,
female membership of SICs and WDCs is still well below equal and efforts are planned
to address this imbalance in RDP 2.

Social Development: The main social development achievements are reported in Section
3.2 and reflected mainly in the KPI results under Component 1. In general, the Project
has contributed to community empowerment and cultural change in rural development in
the Solomon Islands. Communities, by participating in project processes, have been able
to gain control over physical assets provided for by the sub-projects but as well, and
potentially more significantly, to build their capacities to gain greater voice and
ultimately more control in their communities. In particular, SICs have played an
important role in enabling community empowerment or ownership of their assets and
attributes. The Project has also contributed to cultural change in the way in which
community services are provided. There is a long and pervasive legacy of handout-
driven development in the Solomon Islands, through such mechanisms as the
constituency funds, which have ignored the sorts of planning and investment decision-
making processes that are at the core of the CDD approach. The fact that around 14% of
sub-projects did receive co-funding contributions in addition to community contributions
of between less than 1% and up to almost 35% of the total value of the sub-project
investment, suggests that the Project’s sphere of influence may be greater.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
One of the main strengthens of the project was the capacity that it built in the two main
areas of intervention: community-driven development and agriculture and livestock
services to farmers. In the case of CDD, four rounds of sub-grants allowed MDPAC to
refine its practices over time and establish a mechanism that can be continued into the
future as one of the government’s primary investments in rural development. Provincial
governments have also developed their roles over time and integrated the CDD approach
into their operations, albeit there is much greater scope for the use of participatory
planning and other CDD processes. With respect to agriculture and livestock services,
MAL has rebuilt following the crisis and is delivering ongoing extension services across
the country once again. The Project has also financed a restructuring of MAL that is
intended to modernize its services, focusing more on private sector partnership and
agribusiness.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The main unintended impact of the Project, as already noted in (a) above was the fact
that around 14% of sub-projects did receive co-funding contributions from local
government and constituency funds in addition to community contributions. While such
co-financing was provided for in the design, there were no targets or outcomes envisaged.
Given the significant amount of funding available through constituency funds, this co-
financing experience will provide a base for expansion in the future.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiary assessments took place at regular intervals of the Project and informed the
design, implementation, MTR and completion. These beneficiary assessments employed
a variety of methodologies including interviews with beneficiaries, a survey of a non-
random sample of beneficiaries, participatory evaluation workshops with community
beneficiaries and case studies.


                                           38
The main beneficiary survey involved the Evaluation of the Solomon Islands Rural
Development Program (2013) through a survey interview of 80 villages equally
distributed across four provinces. The main findings, for Component 1 and 2 only, are
summarized in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate. The overall risk rating at the time of approval was Substantial risk.
Much of this risk stemmed from the low capacity, post-conflict fragile state context of
the country. Over the course of the project, the political environment has become more
stable, with less frequent leadership transition, and the fiscal environment has become
more predictable. With the successor project already under implementation, support will
be provided to some project activities that were at highest risk of sustainability such as
the community subprojects. RDP 2 will continue to provide Community Helpers to assist
communities to operate and maintain their infrastructure investments so that their full
value is realized. This is a difficult cultural shift, so it will take time, but there is
considerable evidence from completed subprojects that communities are willing to make
such a commitment. Even subprojects that are being well maintained will remain at risk
to natural disasters such as the tsunami that damaged three subprojects in Temotu in
2012 and the flash flooding that caused extensive damage to rural infrastructure,
agriculture and livestock assets in Guadalcanal.

A main long-term and structural risk remains over the lack of institutional integration,
horizontally and vertically, of national and provincial plans and priorities. While this was
not an intended outcome of the Project it remains relevant for the delivery of a CDD
platform in the country. Funds flowing through a combination of mechanisms including
constituency-oriented funds; province-oriented funds (i.e. PCDF); and community-
oriented grant funds (e.g. RDP) remain uncoordinated and overlapping. Government
financing is currently prioritizing Constituency Development Funds (CDFs), with
approximately 90% of government funds for constituency, provincial and community
(e.g. RDP) funds going to CDFs. While SIG has committed to regular annual financing
of RDP 2, the amount remains insufficient to fully finance the CDD mechanism. A shift
in priority from CDFs to CDD will likely be needed in order for the RDP delivery
mechanism to be integrated into government systems and sustained in the long term.

Farmers will continue to be supported in RDP 2, but with a shift from public sector
extension to private sector partnerships. There will be less funding available to provincial
MAL offices to conduct extension activities, so this does risk some modest reduction in
outreach to farmers. But the shift to private sector provision should ensure that private
sector services are provided for the most commercially-oriented agricultural production,
while government maintains support to subsistence farmers. The Supplemental Equity
Facility is being supported in RDP 2. Enterprises financed through RDP have performed
well in loan repayment and this is a strong indication of the sustainability of these
investments.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank responded rapidly to acute post-tension
needs and in the interests of expediency, acted as the Project’s main promoter and lead
development partner in the rural development and agriculture sector. The Project’s PDO
was overly broad and difficult to measure, but highly relevant. The original PDO
indicators, although later modified, remained effective measures of project outcomes.
While baseline data was not available for many of the indicators at the time of Board
approval and the survey instruments did not capture some important information, the
baseline survey provided a solid base for later comparison and the generation of project
outcome data. Project design aimed to accommodate the capacity constraints at the time
while also building a base for institutionalizing new mechanisms of rural service delivery.
The project design appropriately recognized the time and effort that would be required to
achieve institutional sustainability, working through and strengthening government
systems so that mechanisms could be mainstreamed, to avoid creating parallel structures.
However, it underestimated the amount of time needed to establish new CDD
mechanisms and considerable time was lost at the beginning of the project which
required two extensions of the closing date. While it has required more time to establish,
the community implementation model was the most appropriate approach to rural
infrastructure investment as there are few capable NGOs, provincial governments still
lack outreach to the community level and community engagement is required to counter
the prevailing tendency for rural assistance to be delivered as hand-outs. The multi-donor
financing approach proved resilient over the course of the project, with four donors
providing financing in stand-alone funds, with the Bank providing overall coordination
and fiduciary management. One area where the Project was overly optimistic concerned
the strategy to employ private sector and or NGO service providers to deliver agricultural
services. The project design could have put in place measures to enhance the capacity of
NGOs and the private sector in agricultural service delivery, which would have lightened
the heavy service delivery burden placed on what was an already under-capacitated MAL.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Slow project start-up and insufficient implementation
progress made it difficult to appropriately calibrate financing needs, design
improvements and results targets at the time of AF1. As a result, the additional financing
proved to be insufficient and a second round of additional financing and restructuring
was needed. The Bank’s ability to understand and effectively respond to changing
circumstances on the ground in a fragile, small island state, was substantially
strengthened with the placement of an international recruited staff (IRS) TTL in Honiara
in 2011. Between AF1 and AF2, extensive procedural simplifications were incorporated
into Component 1, in particular, clearing many obstacles to the achievement of results
targets. AF2 was supported by the Bank and DFAT, and SIG even agreed to provide


                                            40
substantial co-financing for the first time since the project was approved. Without AF2
financing, only three cycles of subprojects would have been financed, and the ambitious
outcomes that were set at AF1 (five cycles of subprojects) would have been unattainable,
even at a scaled-back level.

While there were no significant procurement issues, some minor concerns did arise,
which were documented and dealt with under the mission action plans. Financial
management supervision was complicated by the delays in completion of annual project
audits, but the Bank addressed this issue towards the end of the Project by agreeing with
the Ministry of Finance and Treasury that Project audits could be undertaken by
independent audit firms. After this was agreed, audits were submitted on time. Safeguard
policies applicable to the Project were supervised periodically through ad hoc field visits
and, as with procurements, some minor issues did arise, which were documented and
successfully dealt with under the mission action plans.

The Bank provided extensive support to SIG to address the slow development of an MIS
and reporting system. The results of this effort were slow to emerge, but intermediate
systems were developed and used and the end of the Project had launched a web-based
platform. Overall, the Bank provided extensive support to SIG, particularly over the last
three years of the project, to address a range of implementation challenges, and position
SIG for increased effectiveness in the implementation of the follow-on project, RDP 2.
In addition to SIG’s desire to proceed with a second phase of RDP and provide ongoing
co-financing, all of the original RDP donors, the EU, DFAT, IFAD and the Bank agreed
to provide financing, reflecting confidence in both government implementation capacity
and Bank supervision.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. As the MTR was conducted in year three of the
project (as planned), before a full subproject cycle had been complete, the Bank’s ability
to assess the full extent and cost of scaling up requirements at the time of AF1 was
limited. The placement of a country-based IRS TTL in 2011 allowed the Bank to provide
the kind of intensive support needed to respond to the shortcomings of AF1, other
ongoing challenges and effectively implement a national CDD and agriculture project in
a fragile, small island state. The Bank has maintained this intensive in-country support
through the preparation and implementation of RDP 2, incorporating the many lessons of
RDP I and significantly enhancing the likelihood that the institutional mechanisms built
through RDP 1 and 2 will be sustained thereafter.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The performance of the Auditor General’s Office
was poor, but this was acknowledged and MoFT allowed for audits to be conducted by
independent auditors so that annual audits would no longer be submitted after the legally


                                            41
required deadline. SIG provided additional financing at AF2, an indication of their
increasing desire to support RDP with government financing. However, while these
funds were approved in late 2012 and expected to be disbursed in early 2013, these funds
were not transferred until the very end of the 2013 (on December 31, 2013), thereby
significantly delaying the implementation of most Cycle 4 subprojects and contributing
to the significant incompletion rate at the time of project closure. Nearly all incomplete
subprojects were from Cycle 4. The Financial and Economic Development Unit (FEDU)
in MoFT is the Bank’s primary government counterpart in Solomon Islands. FEDU was
generally supportive, but not particularly active during preparation, nor were they
engaged during implementation (e.g. they did not participate in any supervision
missions) or at completion (no participation in draft ICR feedback sessions).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. MDPAC was the lead implementing agency
responsible for overall project management, including fiduciary and safeguard
management, intergovernmental coordination, etc. MDPAC, in particular the Project
Coordination Unit it hosted, performed well throughout the project, beginning with
foreign consultants as significant supports, and then tapering off to nearly full national
consultant delivery. With the exception of a six-month gap in financial management
leadership (which took time to recover from), finances were well-managed and
procurement procedures were followed according to Bank requirements. While MAL
received funds through MDPAC, they had significant responsibility for the flow of funds
and implementation of activities in all provinces. This was a complex coordination task,
but it was well-managed with strong accounting for finances and activities, if only a bit
of high expectations as to what could be accomplished by provincial staff. While the
initial hiring and contracting process took a long time, both ministries managed their
consultants and contractors well. The project proved to be a strong incentive for
performance as the Ministry had been previously starved for resources, so once resources
were made available, staff were eager to implement extension activities. Perhaps the
most significant weakness of implementation was the time taken to set up a monitoring
and evaluation system, and to use the system to guide management decisions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Government commitment and effort as a whole were
strong throughout design and implementation, despite the limited engagement of
FEDU/MoFT. Establishing new community-based systems in nearly every rural ward of
a geographically disparate country was a difficult task, but MDPAC was proactive in
problem solving and adaptation, and was well-positioned to continue to strengthen the
model in RDP 2.

6. Lessons Learned

As there is already a follow-on project that has been designed and become effective,
several lessons have already been identified through workshops and consultations and


                                           42
incorporated into the RDP 2 design.

The Evaluation of the Rural Development Program (October 2013) evaluation found that
RDP has significantly contributed to women’s empowerment. Community leader groups
that were surveyed for the evaluation stated that the Project enabled women to influence
decision-making more than other community projects. Over 50 percent of those surveyed
reported that the project processes encouraged women to be more active in their
communities. The project SIC membership was often the first major community
responsibility of the women involved. In 81 percent of villages surveyed, the community
leader groups reported that women on the Sub-project Implementation Committees
participated more in village activities than before joining the SIC. Close to all
community leader groups reported that being in the SIC increased the status of the
female members. Thus womens involvement in decision-making bodies such as the SICs
and Ward Development Committees can empower women and provide a platform for
broader community engagement and leadership.

While most of the Component 1 design elements operated effectively during the Project,
there were some areas for improvement. These include: community procurement is
preferred by communities, but is costly and time consuming; centralized
technical/engineering support is costly and inefficient; community projects cannot
usually be completed within one year, as originally planned; and community projects do
not receive adequate Community Helper support due to lack of performance incentives
and inadequate training. Thus operational effectiveness can be improved by providing
more flexible community procurement arrangements, decentralizing technical support by
training Community Helpers to provide a wider array of technical support, and
lengthening the community project delivery time.

In Component 2, the capacity of the MAL has been substantially improved, but several
lessons have been learned: overreliance on public sector service delivery has deprived
the private sector of opportunities to deliver similar services; public sector financing
cannot sustain the levels of operational funding for extension services provided under
RDP I; participatory community consultation approach leads to services which are too
diffuse to have a significant impact on commercial production of any one crop; there has
been a lack of attention to commercial development of the agriculture sector, focusing
mainly on farming techniques rather than marketing. Some of these lessons are reflected
in MAL’s new corporate structure and strategy, which emphasizes private sector
engagement and reducing the reliance on public sector service delivery, which incurs
high recurrent expenditure levels. Thus service delivery especially for commercial
agriculture should be guided by the public sector but led by the private sector.

Component 3 has confirmed that rural business and commercial banks are responsive to
investment opportunities if access to finance is enabled through facilities such as the
SEF. Thus financial facilities can be used effectively to promote rural business
development.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners*

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The draft ICR was provided to the Borrower for comment and subsequently discussed
directly with SIG counterparts during a Bank mission. Adjustments suggested by the
Borrower were incorporated in the text.

(b) Cofinanciers

IFAD fully supported the findings and conclusions of the ICR. In particular IFAD found
that the performance of the World Bank in project supervision and loan administration
including the management of resources from several financiers, was highly
effective. This was increasingly so in the final three years of implementation.

DFAT considered the overall report balanced and fair on both the successes and areas for
improvement. The only specific concern was in relation to gender, on which it
considered the Project to have underperformed by not undertaking enough analysis and
specific actions to address inequalities in the project design.

European Commission (EC) did not provide comments.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

The Project did not conduct an economic analysis to produce the net present value
(NPV) or economic internal rate of return (EIRR) either for the Project overall or for the
individual components. This was due to the lack of information or rigorous evaluation of
past activities, the absence of basic agricultural data on yields and farm systems, the
demand driven nature of the investments and the substantial non-quantifiable benefits.
The analysis in this section assesses where possible the project effectiveness and
efficiency for each of the Components based on a mix of surrogate measures and
anecdotal information including some limited ex post analyses conducted using RDP I
Component 1 data during design of RDP 2.

While there are similar assessments of CDD projects in other countries that might
provide useful comparisons to assess Component 1 efficiency, cost levels are highly
dependent upon the economic environment within each country. Solomon Islands has
particularly high costs due to the distance from foreign supplier markets, and due to the
cost of domestic transport from the very few supply centers (e.g. Honiara is the primary
supply center for most provinces) to remote, infrequently visited, locations around the
country.

Unfortunately, there are no standard designs and bills of quantities to allow for a one-to-
one cost comparison of similar facilities (i.e. aid posts, or school classrooms) across rural
infrastructure projects similar to RDP, but an unpublished background paper on technical
sustainability prepared as an input to the Bank-published “Towards Better Rural
Investment in Solomon Islands” did include a comparison of costs and approaches
between similar projects within the country. The other projects examined were: Micro-
projects Program I (MPP I), Micro-projects Program II (MPP II), Rural Advancement
Micro-projects Program (RAMP) and the Provincial Capacity Development Fund
(PCDF). The report found the cost of RDP-financed subprojects to be comparable to
other similar projects in the Solomon Islands.

With respect to small-scale buildings, the paper concluded that, while the average cost
per m2 for different structures varies, the average cost per m2 for typical RDP structures
“is broadly consistent with international practice for low-cost permanent structures.”
Table 1, below, provides a cost comparison of three common building types constructed
under RDP: kindy (single storey ground level masonry structure); nurse aid post (ground
level); and staff housing (raised building structure). All are timber-framed structures.
Although the variations in cost per m2 for the kindys and staff houses are rather wide
(25-30%) this is not inconsistent with the geographical/local variation.

The technical sustainability paper also examined water supply schemes executed and
completed under the various rural development projects in the provinces, providing an
indication of the average cost per scheme. While the cost variation is wide, ranging from
a very low cost in Western (SBD 3,036) to a maximum in Central (SBD 25,512), most
cluster around the average of SBD 5,248 – indicating a broadly consistent approach to
the design of the schemes and competitive pricing of the schemes. See Table 2, below

Secondly, the quantification of the Project economic costs and benefits for Component 1
was conducted ex poste using the RDP I design as an input into the RDP 2 design. A
summary of the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) for a selection of sub-projects
is presented in Table 3.

    Economic Internal Rate of Return

The EIRR for selected sub-project categories range between 12 and 39 percent, which
fall within the range of returns for comparable projects. The result of the water sub-
projects, which report an EIRR of 21 percent, is particularly positive given that the
percent decrease in travel time to access improved water sources is one of the PDO KPIs
and hence a core measure of project achievement. A recent World Bank study reported
EIRR of 18-53 percent for CDD infrastructure projects, which in comparable terms,
suggests the delivery of sub-projects is relatively efficient. The sub-projects are also,
based on the sample, efficient in absolute terms.

For Component 2, a cumulative project total of US$3.79 million was transferred to
provincial MAL offices for conducting Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRAs) to identify
farmer needs and to subsequently deliver extension activities. A total of 12,763 farmers
were consulted and 36,954 farmers received extension support as a result. Total
combined beneficiaries of these activities (acknowledging that most farmers would
benefit more than once) comes to 49,717 activity beneficiaries. If this number is divided
by the total cost of US$3.79 million, the average cost per beneficiary is US$76/per
beneficiary. While it is not possible to establish exact and comparable figures, a scan of
nonprofit and private providers of agricultural services in similar circumstances for
similar purposes indicate costs of around USD50-100 per beneficiary.

Project costs also need to be set within the relatively recent tumultuous political
economy of the Solomon Islands. Following the period of prolonged civil conflict
during the “Tensions” of 1999 to 2003 (and soon after the food, fuel and financial crisis
of 2008 and the economic aftermath) the Solomon Islands moved through a period of
post-conflict reconstruction to longer-term development planning. The Solomon Islands
however remains a “fragile state, ranked 47 on the often-quoted Fund for Peace “fragile
states index”, just next to Lebanon (46). The destruction of infrastructure and depletion
of government services during the tensions placed a significant extra cost-burden on the
Project. The Project not only provided for the construction of infrastructure, often where
it has been completely degraded or was simply absent, but it also contributed to re-
building of the almost entirely depleted agricultural extension and support services of the
MAL.

For Component 3, total financing for SEF-financed projects came to SBD34.2 million, or
about US$4.3 million. Only SBD7,880,292, or about US$985,000 (at September 2015
exchange rates) was financed by SEF, slightly less than 25%. This is a significant
leveraging factor for investments in rural areas. Administrative costs for RDP are also


                                                 55
quite low, with the commercial banks bearing most of the responsibility for
administering the funds, and RDP mainly just responsible for proposal screening,
monitoring and evaluation. While the administrative cost of this component was not
explicitly tracked, but rather bundled within overall Project Management costs, it could
be estimated as perhaps a total of 4 months of the Program Managers time plus another 2
months of other staff time totalling approximately SBD300,000, or US$37,500. As a
percentage of total SEF-financed project cost (US4.3 million), administrative costs come
to about 0.9%. There are also processing and management costs on the part of the
commercial banks which are not included here, but which should be considered
leveraged private co-financing of the management costs.

In the absence of economic analyses it is not possible to conclude on the relative or
absolute efficiency of Component 2 and 3. The AF1 does indicate that Component 2
activities could lead to an increase of smallholder incomes by three-fold over 10 years in
the case of cocoa production and two-fold in the case of pig production, which were two
major activities in the project area, although this was not substantiated. Also, the AF1
suggests that the component activities could promote improved nutrition by encouraging
the consumption of local produce to reduce the cost and dependency on imports, but
again, this was not substantiated. In the case of Component 3 each SEF-funded
businesses created on average up to 6.2 jobs and while not documented there is some
albeit anecdotal evidence that these businesses created secondary employment in several
service businesses. For example, a farm contractor visited during the ICR mission
reported that in addition to employing full-time 6 machine operators he also employed,
on casual basis, persons to service machinery, provide manual farm labor and for office
administration. The failure to conduct a comprehensive and thorough economic analyses
however remains a shortcoming of the Project.

Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

A series of informal workshops were held following the end of the project in 2015 along
with MAL and MDPAC. These workshops focused discussions around the following key
questions: (i) had the Project Development Objective (PDO) been achieved? (ii) how has
had the Project performed? (iii) how had the Bank performed? (iv) how had the
Borrower performed.

The overall impression of the Project’s achievements, performance and that of the Bank
and the Borrower were positive to very positive. A frequent comment was the
“specialness” of RDP’s approach in allowing communities to fully participate and to
decide on their own priorities. There was general recognition that communities required
information and assistance to decide on priority needs and to technically design and
implement interventions, which remains a very real challenge in the Solomon Islands.

There was a general request for more routine reporting both face-to-face and in writing,
greater transparency in handling transactions especially in the case of sub-project
financing under Component 1, more communication concerning the purpose and
achievements of activities under Component 2 and strengthened linkages between
provincial governments, the Project Support Units (PSUs) and the RDP in Honiara.

Component 4 – Program Management
Finance
RDP is a multi-donor supported project managed by the World Bank. The original RDP
financing agreement was for US$ 20.4, this was increased twice, once after the mid-term
review in 2010 and following a project restructuring in 2013. The final total funds
available for the program were USD 37.4 million. Overall RDP drew down SBD 275.50
million from all sources to implement the Project. Approximately USD 2.72 million of
the EU funds could not be drawn down before the expiry date of these funds in 2010.

The actual expenditure by component are shown in table 1. The percentage of funds
allocated to component 1 was originally 42% of the total budget this increased to 50%
following the second additional financing and restructure, however, the actual
expenditure for Component 1 was 52% of the total expenditure. Component 2 was
originally allocated 29% of the budget, which reduced to 25% following the second
additional financing, and restructure and the actual expenditure for Component was 24%
of the total expenditure. Funds for component 3 were reduced from US$2.37m to
US$1.17m during the Mid-Term Review (MTR) as the uptake of this facility was low at
that stage and additional funds were needed to effectively implement component 1.
Component 4 costs increased form the original planned 17% to 20% of the total project
expenditure.

*Includes subproject completed and in use and certified complete subprojects

Table 2 highlights the following;
    A total of 378 community infrastructure subprojects have been approved for
       implementation by the Provincial Allocation Review Committees (PARC)
    283 (75%) subprojects have been completed and 77 (20%) are in still in the
       implementation phase
    Eighteen (5%) of the subprojects approved have been terminated due to issues
       that could not be resolved by the project
    Of the 77 subprojects in the implementation phase the majority are close to
       completion. Some have run out of funds and the communities are trying to raise
       the funds to complete the subprojects

For cycle 1, 93% of the subprojects have been completed, 83% of cycle 2 subprojects
have been completed, 77% of cycle 3 subprojects completed and 66% of cycle 4
subprojects have been completed and in use. Cycle 4 sub-project implementation has
progressed well and the completion time has reduced significantly compared to that for
Cycles 1 and 2 with half of the subprojects being completed within 12 months of
receiving funds.

The number of beneficiaries currently benefiting from (that is have access to) the
completed subprojects is 198,340 people, which is about 38% of the population of the
Solomon Islands, at least 73,385 of which are female. Approximately 250,900 will



                                                   63
benefit when all the current 77 ongoing subprojects are completed which is about 49% of
the population of the Solomon Islands.

A total of $57,130,102 was paid to subproject accounts for subproject implementation
during RDP. Of this $41.40m has been acquitted and as of the last bank statements
available (31st December 2014) $3.23m was still in subproject bank accounts and
$12.50m was still to be acquitted. During 2015 an additional $1.25m was acquitted
which included the deposit of $182,286 cash returned from completed subprojects into
the RDP account.

The bulk of the funds released to subprojects for cycle 1 have been acquitted with only
$214,230 (3%) to be acquitted. Overall 80% of the funds disbursed to subprojects have
been acquitted and 69% of the total un-acquitted funds (USD11.61m) are from cycle 4
subprojects and 2% and 5% are from cycle 1 and cycle 2 respectively.

Community and other contributions
At the time of design, the average cost of a subproject was about SBD230,000, with an
average of approximately SBD62,000 (26%) planned to be voluntarily contributed by the
community. Based on a sample of 38 completed subprojects where data on the full final
cost of the subproject has been gathered as a part of financial certification, the average
cost of a subproject is slightly over SBD295,000 with an average of about SBD106,000
coming from community contributions and SBD5,000 coming from other contributions
such as provincial government or constituency funds. As shown is Figure C1.6, below,
on average, RDP funds comprise 63% of the total subproject cost, community
contributions 36% and others about 1%. This is more than double the results target
percentage of 15% community contributions.

Operations & Maintenance
As of project completion, 214 completed sub-projects had received O&M Training and
had O&M Plans in place. It is planned that RDP 2 will continue to work with
communities to develop O&M plans and follow up and reinforce the implementation of
O&M plans.

SIC composition
The average SIC size was seven members of which on average two members were
women. The evaluation of Component 1 found that female members that join the SIC
increasingly participated within and outside the community. Female memberships and
engagement was also found to have positive correlations with project outcomes.
Households believe that female participation enhancing cooperation between groups.
Most communities seem to understand this and as a result suggest increased women
representation as a main suggestion in terms of improving SICs.

Component 1 evaluation summary
Compared to the baseline significant improvements were found in access to roads,
markets, water, sanitation and electricity, ranging from 11.3 to 1250 %. However, at the
same time there was a decline in access to primary schools and health centers. In general


                                           64
it was found that RDP villages fared better than non-RDP villages in terms of access to
most of these services. For example, the rate of improvements in access to roads, markets
and water was higher in villages, which had related RDP projects. Similarly, the rate of
deterioration in access to primary schools and health centers were lower in villages that
had related RDP projects. This suggests that the RDP has had an impact in improving or
providing stability in the access of basic services in the villages that they serve.

Improving access to water was one of the main targets of component 1 of the RDP. It
was found that on average there was a decrease in the time taken to fetch water in both
the wet and dry seasons. This was driven mostly by improvements in villages that
decided to choose water related projects. In the baseline survey these villages generally
reported longer times in fetching water in both wet and dry seasons compared to villages
that did not choose water related projects. This is evidence that the RDP processes with
regards to community driven selection performed well. In the follow up, we found that
the time required to fetch water in the wet season was lower in RDP villages that
selected a water project compared to villages that choose not to do water projects. In the
dry season, fetching water is still quicker in the villages that did not choose water
projects. However, the difference in time taken across these two types of villages in the
dry season has been drastically reduced. This is evidence that RDP projects have
generally performed well improving access to, as well as the time taken, to fetch water in
both dry and wet seasons.

Moving forward, the RDP needs to address the issue of sustainability of improved
services. Evidence from access to primary schools, health services as well as water
suggest that if coordinated efforts are not put into maintenance of resources there could
be deterioration in the future. The analysis suggests that communities lack knowledge as
well as experience on how to maintain existing infrastructure projects. Alarmingly, a
significant portion of the existing project recipients has no plans for future maintenance
of their projects. Given that these are community projects (as opposed to private ones)
the incentives at the individual level, to provide efforts unilaterally, are also very little.
Thus, it is imperative that RDP designs strategies to raise awareness about the
importance of timely maintenance of existing infrastructures. In designing these
strategies, consulting existing research on inducing cooperation in common property
resources management would be very helpful.

RDP Processes: Selection to implementation
One of the most important features that make RDP unique is its objective to foster
community participation in every step from project selection to implementation. One of
the rationales for this approach is that community participation induces ownership and as
a result reduces the inherent perverse incentives associated with consumption of benefits
from common property resources. The first strategy that RDP utilized to achieve
community participation was by allowing villagers to select their own projects. In our
survey we find that the majority of the households actively took part in the project
selection process. We also find that people who did not attend selection meetings could
not attend because of prior commitments.




                                             65
To enhance community participation during the implementation stage, RDP required
each village to elect a sub-project implementation committee (SIC). The main purposes
of this committee were (a) to be a liaison between the community and RDP and (b) to
ensure necessary steps were taken for timely completion of sub-projects. It was found
that villagers were relatively satisfied with the SIC and believed it was an effective
method of coordinating the sub-project. However, households also believed that if the
representation of women and youth increased then these committees would perform even
better. Households also believed that there is scope for improvements in SICs financial
and project management as well as SICs ability to coordinate activities within the
community.

It was found that the general quality of RDP projects was good. Households also
believed that the quality of RDP projects were better than similar projects undertaken by
other agencies. An important reason for this high level of satisfaction amongst villagers
is related to RDPs processes to engage the community. However, communities also
identified challenges and impediments that they faced. The leaders in the community
reported that the level of meaningful community participation (in terms of providing raw
materials) was either low or slow. They also identified the RDP process of funding limits
as well as delays in the disbursement of funds as cumbersome and detrimental to the
timely completion of projects. In remote villages distance from suppliers provided an
additional challenge.

The evaluation found that women generally participated less in the selection of RDP
projects and when they did participate they were more passive compared to men.
However, the various strategies undertaken by RDP did have impacts over time. Most
households believed the RDP process encouraged greater female engagement. In fact
households report that female members that join the SIC increasingly participated within
and outside the community. Female memberships and engagement was also found to
have positive correlations with project outcomes. Households believe that female
participation enhancing cooperation between groups. Most communities seem to
understand this and as a result suggest increased women representation as a main
suggestion in terms of improving SICs.

Component 2 - Improved Agricultural Services
With the assistance from RDP the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock has
significantly rebuilt its capacity to support farmers through staff training, activity-based
planning and improved budget processes. At the end of the project nearly 37,000 farmers
from all 9 provinces have participated in extension and training activities and the results
targets for Component 2 have generally been reached.

Component 2.1 Strengthening Service Delivery to the Provinces
The type and nature of the service delivery provided under RDP depended on the needs
and aspirations of the farming communities. Participatory Rural Appraisals (PRA) was
the main method used to determine the priority needs and wants of communities.




                                            66
Provincial service delivery activities over the life of RDP are summarized in the
following tables. A total of 336 communities which included 12,763 farmers were
consulted (PRA or other consultative process conducted) to determine their priority
needs in regards to agriculture. The number of community consultations was higher in
the first year or two of RDP engagement in a province and then tapered off. This is
expected as the initial effort is to determine the farmers’ needs and then start addressing
them, in the subsequent years fewer consultations were conducted as the program rolled
out to new communities.

Following the community consultations activities were designed to provide services to
address the farmers priority needs identified during the PRAs and other consultations. A
total of 1,084 activities involving 36,954 farmers were conducted over the project period.
The activities covered 56 different technologies in the areas of food crops, cash crops,
livestock, resource management and biosecurity. The number of activities conducted
with farmers started to slow in 2013 and declined in 2014 (Table 3) due to limitation of
funds for component 2.

Sub-Component 2.2: Strengthening Support to Provincial Service Delivery –
Headquarters
This included Increased Staffing In 2007 MAL had a severe manpower shortage with
109 vacant positions. By mid-2008 MAL had recruited over 100 new staff, which was
significantly more than the 35 initially committed as the SIG contribution in the project
design.

Rehabilitating Offices and Housing- there was a big need for rehabilitation of MAL
offices and housing at the start of RDP. Unfortunately the budget initially allocated for
these activities was not sufficient to cover all the needs of MAL also during
implementation there were budget shortfalls and the activities and expenditure was
reprioritized to ensure that service delivery was the priority. RDP assisted with the
rebuilding of 9 MAL offices and houses.




                                            67
Equipping provincial services included providing boats and vehicles for transport, office
equipment and computers, veterinary equipment and other field and laboratory
equipment
Funding of Operating Costs
RDP assisted MAL with the funding of the cost of operations, where funds were
available from the MAL recurrent or development budgets or other projects these were
used to fund the activities entirely or in conjunction with RDP funds, if funds were not
available RDP funded the whole activity as long as it fitted the requirements of RDP and
was in the work plan approved at both the provincial and HQ levels. Often the RDP
finding was used to complement the Ministry’s development funds, RDP funds would be
used for logistics (travel costs etc) and farmer training while the development budget
funds would be used to provide inputs for the participating farmers.

Conditions of service for MAL staff generally improved during the program, staff had
access to better facilities (office equipment and transport, some refurbished office and
housing), than previously, had their skill level improved through training, clear processes
and procedures to follow and access of operational funds to enable them to provide
services to farmers and the ability to develop and implement work plans at the local level
all this helped to improve the community perception of MAL.

Upgrading Service Quality
A total of 212 staff (or 95% of all provincial staff both MAL established and non-
established and provincial staff) have been trained in participatory techniques, 95 in
Modern Extension Interventions, 79 students have now successfully completed the SPC
Para Vet training, 67 participants have attended the Field Epidemiology Course for
animal health and 57 have received Management development training. Currently 10
MAL staff studied for Degrees 4 supported by RDP and 6 by SIG. The training
evaluation results from participants’ course satisfaction and relevance feedback were all
quite high average scores, over the 114 training events the participants evaluation score
averaged 4.7 out of 5 highlighting the participants’ satisfaction with the training
delivered. Overall the results from the participants training feedback evaluations, the
MAL staff survey and the MAL Managers surveys indicate that the training provided by
RDP has been of quality, appropriate, and useful which although there is still more to be
done has contributed to changes in the work practices, efficiency and effectiveness of
officers with in MAL.

Technical Assistance assisted the ministry capacity in the following areas: Livestock,
Participatory Extension and On-Farm Research, Agricultural Information, Quarantine,
Pest management and Integrated Pest Management (IPM), Human Resource
Development (HRD) and MAL organizational structure and support.

During 2013 RDP supported a comprehensive “Project Evaluation, Organizational
Capacity Assessments and Diagnostic Report” for MAL to “strengthen sustainable
agriculture development in the Solomon Islands”. In early 2014 an executive summary of
the Diagnostic Report was produced together with a cabinet paper to seek government




                                            68
approval for the recommended structural changes to the ministry “Strengthening industry
and market linkages for MAL” which was endorsed by Cabinet in July 2014.

Component 2 evaluation summary
The main goal of component 2 was to increase the take up of improved farming practices,
which RDP believes will lead to better livelihood and development. The main instrument
that was developed to achieve this goal was village level dissemination of agricultural
advice/information and related services through the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock (MAL). The rationale was that improved access to better information would
lead to improved agricultural practices.

Results from the follow up survey show that compared to the baseline, households were
more likely to have received agricultural advice from MAL. Generally, a majority of
households that received advice were satisfied with it. This meant that in a significant
number of cases households changed farming practices upon receiving advice from MAL.
This led to increased agricultural output for these households. However, the intensity of
this process was low: at follow up in June 2013 three quarters of the households did not
receive advice from the MAL and when they did about half of them changed practices.
This alludes to the important need to improve both the scope of dissemination of
agricultural advice as well as the take up rate upon receiving advice.

One of the reasons for suggesting the aforementioned improvements is because there was
a statistically significant relationship between receiving advice and food security. The
follow up results showed that 1 % increase in advice received is correlated with a 6 %
decrease in the probability of being food insecure. The non-existence of this relationship
during the baseline further justifies the rationale for having this strategy as one of the
core objectives of RDP. It also alludes that increasing the rate at which advice is
disseminated will lead to higher level of food security.

Component 3 – Rural Business Development
Demand for Supplementary Equity to enable rural industries to meet requirements of the
banking system for loan eligibility has been strong with grants extended to 57 businesses,
which is in excess of the target. The SBD7.7 million in supplemental equity provided by
RDP has leveraged SBD31 million in commercial bank loans. This component, which
has been completed, supported the creation of about 350 new jobs and several businesses
would not have been able to secure loans if not for the additional equity financing
offered by RDP.

An independent evaluation report commissioned by IFAD found the following;
    The number of jobs created is in the range of 350 to 400;
    Additional income from jobs created under the Project is directly related to the
       increase in employment. If a typical unskilled wage of SBD500 per fortnight is
       assumed for 350 new jobs, then the additional annual wage payments would be
       SBD4.55 million. Since semi-skilled and skilled workers are paid more, this is
       an underestimate;



                                           69
      The main direct beneficiaries of the Project are business owners and their
       employees who have bigger, more profitable businesses or more and more secure
       employment. In some places farmers supplying coconuts (and copra) or cocoa
       and other farm products benefit because businesses buying and providing
       technical support for these commodities have had SEF grants to expand or
       improve their activities. Communities have benefited through improved
       economic services – more support for agricultural activities, better supply of
       goods and services and more reliable transport. In many cases communities have
       also benefited from donations to local youth, women’s, health and other
       community organizations from expanded and more profitable local businesses;
      Of the total of 58 businesses that received SEF grants, 36 are based outside
       Honiara and Guadalcanal. These 36 may all be counted as “businesses
       established or expanding in rural areas”. Eleven of the businesses based in
       Honiara and Guadalcanal are buyers of farm products from other provinces.
       Eighty percent of businesses that have received SEF grants are either based in
       rural areas or their business depends on products from rural areas;
      While business turnover has generally increased, reported annual changes vary
       between -78% and 115% for any one year since receiving an SEF grant. Some of
       these changes are due to changing economic conditions, especially for
       commodity traders, but some are clearly linked to new funding that has provided
       for business expansion; and
      The strength of this procedure is shown by the fact that out of 65 loans there has
       been only one default. This performance may be compared with the 18% bad
       loan rate for the CBSI loan guarantee scheme

Annex 8: Comments of Co-financiers and Others Partners and or Stakeholders

From IFAD: “IFAD fully supports the findings and conclusions of the ICR. In particular
IFAD found that the performance of the World Bank in project supervision and loan
administration including the management of resources from several financiers, was
highly effective. This was increasingly so in the final three years of implementation.”

From Department of Foreign Affairs (previously AusAID): “Overall the report looks
well balanced and fair on both the successes and areas for improvement. The only
specific question … is in relation to gender (Section 3.5). It rates itself alright against its
criteria and has favorable evidence, but … it oversells the representation, which … isn’t
50/50. Overall RDP underperformed on gender in phase 1.”

No comments were received from European Commission (EC).
