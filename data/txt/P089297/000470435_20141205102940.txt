Executive Summary

The purpose of this report is to analyse the impacts of the Rural Development Programme
(RDP) of the Solomon Islands. RDP is an initiative to facilitate development in rural Solomon
Islands. It focuses on participatory development, demand-responsive provision of Government
services and creation of a supportive economic environment for small-scale rural development to
foster employment and income growth. As a part of this evaluation process, a follow up survey
was conducted in eighty villages, equally distributed across four provinces (Choiseul, Malaita,
Temotu and Western) between June and July 2013. In each village we utilised two survey
instruments, a) a household survey which was administered on ten randomly chosen households
and b) a second questionnaire administered on community leaders (which also included
members of the RDP’s subproject implementation committee). The data collected in the baseline
survey, conducted between 2010 and 2011, was the main basis for comparison and subsequent
impact evaluation.


A total of 80 villages were surveyed in the follow up an overlap of 63 with the baseline survey. A
number of caveats must be taken into account when interpreting these results: 1) The surveying
in both the baseline and follow up do not follow a randomised controlled trial methodology
making it difficult for causal inferences. 2) A number of villages are not re surveyed from the
baseline making it difficult to draw inferences from before and after comparisons.

Component 1

Compared to the baseline we find significant improvements in access to roads, markets, water,
sanitation and electricity, ranging from 11.3 to 1250 %. However, at the same time there was a
decline in access to primary schools and health centres. We find in general that RDP villages
fared better than non-RDP villages in terms of access to most of these services. For example, the
rate of improvements in access to roads, markets and water was higher in villages which had
related RDP projects. Similarly, the rate of deterioration in access to primary schools and health
centres were lower in villages that had related RDP projects. This suggests that the RDP has had
an impact in improving or providing stability in the access of basic services in the villages that
they serve.


Improving access to water was one of the main targets of component 1 of the RDP. We found
that on average there was a decrease in the time taken to fetch water in both the wet and dry

                                                                                                6
seasons. This was driven mostly by improvements in villages that decided to choose water
related projects. In the baseline survey these villages generally reported longer times in fetching
water in both wet and dry seasons compared to villages that did not choose water related
projects. This is evidence that the RDP processes with regards to community driven selection
performed well. In the follow up, we found that the time required to fetch water in the wet
season was lower in RDP villages that selected a water project compared to villages that choose
not to do water projects. In the dry season, fetching water is still quicker in the villages that did
not choose water projects. However, the difference in time taken across these two types of
villages in the dry season has been drastically reduced. This is evidence that RDP projects have
generally performed well improving access to, as well as the time taken, to fetch water in both
dry and wet seasons.


Moving forward, the RDP needs to address the issue of sustainability of improved services.
Evidence from access to primary schools, health services as well as water suggest that if
coordinated efforts are not put into maintenance of resources there could be deterioration in the
future. Our analysis suggests that communities lack knowledge as well as experience on how to
maintain existing infrastructure projects. Alarmingly, a significant portion of the existing project
recipients have no plans for future maintenance of their projects. Given that these are
community projects (as opposed to private ones) the incentives at the individual level, to provide
efforts unilaterally, are also very little. Thus, it is imperative that RDP designs strategies to raise
awareness about the importance of timely maintenance of existing infrastructures. In designing
these strategies, consulting existing research on inducing cooperation in common property
resources management would be very helpful.

RDP Processes: Selection to implementation

One of the most important features that make RDP unique is its objective to foster community
participation in every step from project selection to implementation. One of the rationales for
this approach is that community participation induces ownership and as a result reduces the
inherent perverse incentives associated with consumption of benefits from common property
resources. The first strategy that RDP utilised to achieve community participation was by
allowing villagers to select their own projects. In our survey we find that the majority of the
households actively took part in the project selection process. We also find that people who did
not attend selection meetings could not attend because of prior commitments.




                                                                                                     7
To enhance community participation during the implementation stage, RDP required each
village to elect a sub-project implementation committee (SIC). The main purposes of this
committee were (a) to be a liaison between the community and RDP and (b) to ensure necessary
steps were taken for timely completion of sub-projects. We find that villagers were relatively
satisfied with the SIC and believed it was an effective method of coordinating the sub-project.
However, households also believed that if the representation of women and youth increased
then these committees would perform even better. Households also believed that there is scope
for improvements in SICs financial and project management as well as SICs ability to coordinate
activities within the community.

It was found that the general quality of RDP projects were good. Households also believed that
the quality of RDP projects were better than similar projects undertaken by other agencies. An
important reason for this high level of satisfaction amongst villagers is related to RDPs processes
to engage the community. However, communities also identified challenges and impediments
that they faced. The leaders in the community reported that the level of meaningful community
participation (in terms of providing raw materials) was either low or slow. They also identified
the RDP process of funding limits as well as delays in the disbursement of funds as cumbersome
and detrimental to the timely completion of projects. In remote villages distance from suppliers
provided an additional challenge.


We find that women generally participated less in the selection of RDP projects and when they
did participate they were more passive compared to men. However, the various strategies
undertaken by RDP did have impacts over time. Most households believed the RDP process
encouraged greater female engagement. In fact households report that female members that join
the SIC increasingly participated within and outside the community. Female memberships and
engagement was also found to have positive correlations with project outcomes. Households
believe that female participation enhancing cooperation between groups. Most communities
seem to understand this and as a result suggest increased women representation as a main
suggestion in terms of improving SICs.

Progress across Provinces
The improvements in access to basic services were not similar across provinces. There was a
systematic pattern: we found that Temotu did not perform as well as other provinces. In fact we
found that access to most infrastructures drastically deteriorated in Temotu. This in part can be



                                                                                                 8
explained by a small number of villages which suffered floods. In terms of component two
indicators, the disparity across provinces were less pronounced and not systematic.

Component 2

The main goal of component 2 was to increase the take up of improved farming practices, which
RDP believes will lead to better livelihood and development. The main instrument that was
developed to achieve this goal was village level dissemination of agricultural advice/information
and related services through the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL). The rationale was
that improved access to better information would lead to improved agricultural practices.


Results from the follow up survey show that compared to the baseline, households were more
likely to have received agricultural advice from MAL. Generally, a majority of households that
received advice were satisfied with it. This meant that in a significant number of cases
households changed farming practices upon receiving advice from MAL. This led to increased
agricultural output for these households. However, the intensity of this process was low: at
follow up three quarters of the households did not receive advice from the MAL and when they
did about half of them changed practices. This alludes to the important need to improve both
the scope of dissemination of agricultural advice as well as the take up rate upon receiving
advice.


One of the reasons we suggest the aforementioned improvements is because we find a
statistically significant relationship between receiving advice and food security. In the follow up,
we find that 1 % increase in advice received is correlated with a 6 % decrease in the probability
of being food insecure. The non- existence of this relationship during the baseline further
justifies the rationale for having this strategy as one of the core objectives of RDP. It also alludes
that increasing the rate at which advice is disseminated will lead to higher level of food security.

Targets: Achievements and Failures

The RDP had set itself targets against which their performances were to be evaluated. With
regards to improvements in access to basic services the target set was to increase the proportion
of villages with satisfactory access to basic services by 10 % compared to the baseline. For water
the target was more specific, which was to decrease the travel time to access improved water by
10 %. In terms of meeting these targets RDP has shown good progress. On both the indicators
RDP has met their objectives. (Component 1 Indicators).

Targets were also set with regards to intermediate achievements of RDP processes. From the
table below we can also see that the performance have been satisfactory. Intermediate indicator
six has already been achieved, whereas indicator one is very close to being achieved. However,
RDP is off target with indicator three.

improvements were made compared to the baseline, the rate of progress has been slow.

Recommendations

Component 1: Infrastructure
         A clear definition of what constitutes clean water needs to be identified.
         We recommend RDP introduces targets based on overall coverage rate in addition to
          percentage improvements between baseline and follow up surveys.
          We recommend that the RDP creates a results framework for the province level.
         The distinction between private type and public type usage projects needs to be made and
          based on these distinctions best practice strategies for improving outcomes in both private
          projects and public projects will have to be formulated.
         It is recommended that the RDP trains communities on best practices in management and
          allocation of water resources to improve maintenance.


Component 1: RDP Processes

        The RDP should devise strategies to improve participation, such as coordinating with
         churches and other community groups to provide advance notices about meetings.




                                                                                                            11
      Raise awareness about the importance of timely maintenance of infrastructure to ensure
       project sustainability. Particular focus should be on people who are given responsibility for
       operations and maintenance.
      Improve monitoring of CH’s especially those further away from (in terms of distance) from
       PSUs. A possible suggestion would be for communities to maintain log books to record CH
       attendance in meetings.
      We recommend that the RDP make it mandatory for women to be included in future project
       implementation and maintenance committees.

Component 2:

      MAL officers must increase participation at MAL events including training and consultation.
      We recommend undertaking research into costs involved in changing farming practices to
       identify why take up of advice is limited and how it can be improved.
      MAL should encourage communication and learning between those households that
       received advice and changed practices and those that did not.
      To improve outreach MAL should provide passive ways through which farmers can reach
       out to them. For example, a help exchange could be set up where farmers from any village
       are able to telephone MAL officers seeking advice.

Section 1: Introduction

Background

The Rural Development Project (RDP) is based in the Solomon Islands Ministry of
Development Planning and Aid Coordination. RDP is an initiative to facilitate development in
rural Solomon Islands. It focuses on participatory development, demand-responsive provision of
Government services and creation of a supportive economic environment for small-scale rural
development to foster employment and income growth. The Project comprises three
components:


Component One:         Delivery of Local infrastructure and services
Component Two:         Improvement of agricultural services
Component Three:       Rural enterprise development


This report is concerned with an evaluation of components one and two based on data from the
baseline survey carried out between June and July 2009 (and subsequently April/ May 2010) and
a follow up survey carried out in between June-July 2013.


Format of this Report
This report comprises of seven main sections. Section 2 outlines the research methodology,
providing an account of various processes that were utilised to ensure an unbiased evaluation.
Section 3 reports the basic sample characteristics at both the village as well as household level. In
section 4 and 5 we present the results from component 1 and in section 6 and 7 we provide the
results from component 2. In the final section we provide specific recommendations, in light of
the findings of this report, to improve the various components of RDP.
Section 2: Methodology

Sample Design

The baseline study sample consisted of four provinces - Choiseul, Malaita, Temotu and Western
provinces. It comprised a mix of villages that had an RDP sub-project approved but not yet
commenced, and villages that had applied for a sub-project but were still awaiting the outcome
of the project selection process. Up to 20 households were selected for interview in each village.
Age/gender discussion groups were also formed from eligible villagers who were available and
willing to participate at that time.


The follow up involved surveying 80 villages equally distributed across the same four provinces,
RDP villagers were chosen using a three state sampling strategy:


    1. All 76 villages were taken from the baseline sample. 13 villages were dropped, 5 because
         they did not have a sub project and 2 due to distance. 4 villages were dropped 4 in
         Malaita and 2 in Western due to unforeseen circumstances such as the weather.
    2. Eleven Cycle 3 communities (3 in Choiseul, 5 in Malaita, and 3 in Western, were
         randomly chosen to ensure 20 communities in each).
    3. Communities that were unreachable were replaced with randomly chosen cycle 3 villages
         in the same ward.

In nearly all of the 80 villages RDP subprojects were completed or were near completion. Up to
10 households from each village was selected for interview. In addition, in each village a
community leader’s questionnaire was administered. In this discussion typically the village chief,
a female representative and members of RDP's sub project implementation committee's were
present.


Scope of the study


The scope of the study was determined by the RDP monitoring and evaluation framework. All
questions in all survey instruments (both baseline and follow up) were closely linked to the
project’s results monitoring table to provide indicators to capture the primary areas of impact

                                                                                               14
and outcome defined in project documentation. The baseline survey provided a benchmark
against which impacts were to be determined.
The main topics that this report looks at (i) changes in poverty including changes in household
access to and quality of infrastructure, income generation, (ii) participation in development
process, particularly RDP processes for both component 1 and 2, (iii) review of implementation
and challenges of the RDP processes for both component 1 and 2 and (iv) changes in farming
practices and subsequent impact on livelihood which comes under component 2. In addition the
report provides recommendations on how to improve RDPs functions based on these findings.


Survey Instrument


The core survey instruments from the baseline survey that were used in preparing this report
were household surveys, and surveys from discussions with men, women, young men and young
women focus groups. In the follow up survey we used data from the household survey and
community leader’s survey. We also used general observations (from sessions logs) based on
field visits to supplement our analysis.


All the core survey instruments were designed in consultation with RDP officials and were pilot
tested in four villages in Guadalcanal and Malaita provinces. The complete set of questionnaires
and other survey instruments are attached with the report.



Recruitment and Training


For both the baseline and follow up surveys, the interviewers were experienced fieldworkers.
Initially interviewers were given a week of intensive training in the use of the data collection
instruments prior to the pilots. During the pilots, their performances were monitored and further
sessions were carried out to fine tune their skills to ensure that they were properly trained.


The training process included teaching interviewers strategies of approaching villagers,
introducing survey teams and explaining the purpose of the surveys, consent procedure, detailed
explanation of each question to be asked and practice or mock interviews3. Field work for the

 The baseline and follow up survey enumerators were given training to ensure randomisation in the collection
of household data.

                                                                                                          15
baseline survey was conducted by the Australian National University while the follow up survey
was conducted by the University of New South Wales.


The follow up survey was implemented by four province teams. Teams included 2 post-graduate
students from either the University of San Francisco or the University of New South Wales, 1
RDP Employee (Community Helper) and 2 interviewers. It was ensured that RDP employee
were not present during any of the household surveys or the community leaders discussion to
guarantee the integrity of the instrument.




Field work.


The baseline field work was completed in 2 phases. The first phase was June/July 2009. Because
of the extreme remoteness of some villages and seasonal rough seas, teams were unable to reach
all target villages in Choiseul, Western and Temotu in the required timeframe with the funds
available. It was therefore necessary to carry out a second round of fieldwork in April /May
2010. The follow up survey field work was implemented in June/July 2013.




Data entry and cleaning


For the baseline survey a team of experienced keyboard users with competence in Microsoft
Excel were recruited to undertake data entry in Honiara. All numeric data were entered into
prepared templates and any open ended answers were transcribed verbatim. On-the-spot
checking and cleaning was implemented during data entry. When data entry was complete
frequency tabulations were run with computer software (PASW Statistics 18) and out-of-range
values were checked and cleaned.
In the follow up survey all datum were entered by the post-graduate students in the field.
Entered data was checked for consistency and subsequent mistakes if found were corrected.
Upon completion of data complete frequency tabulations were computed using Stata 11 and
irregular data entries were checked and cleaned.




                                                                                           16
Data Analysis and limitation of data analysis


As mentioned earlier the basis of analysis in this report is the baseline and the follow up surveys.
Given the different characteristics of the various datasets multiple techniques were utilised to
analyse the data collected. The statistical software ‘Stata’ was used to conduct most of the
analysis. Multivariate analysis was undertaken to answer questions on food security and
schooling.    Interpretations of these models are discussed in their respective sections. The
limitations of our analysis are presented below.


1. The main limitation of this evaluation is the fact that it does not follow a randomised
controlled trial (RCT) methodology. As a result it is not possible to make causal claims about the
impacts of RDP. However, given the aims and objectives and the working processes of RDP it
would have been difficult to conduct an RCT to ascertain impact evaluation. However, there are
multiple second best strategies that are available all of which rely on having a control and a
treatment group. Given the nature of sampling where all of the villages chosen for follow up
survey were villages which had RDP involvement thus making it difficult to identify causal
effects directly.


2. Between the follow up and baseline 65 villages were surveyed in both. This fact along with the
non-random selection of villages for both surveys, create additional complications with analysis.
In this report we compared a set of instruments from 80 non randomly surveyed villages (follow-
up) with a set of instruments from 76 non randomly surveyed villages (baseline). Thus the main
findings of the study should not be extrapolated beyond that of sampled villages without
exercising further caution. The non-random nature of sampling also prohibits us from
undertaking any meaningful tests of formal hypothesis.


3. In the baseline survey, (i) the selection of households were not entirely random, (ii)
participants for the four age/gender discussion groups were selected on the basis of availability
and willingness to participate and not randomly.


4. In the follow up survey, (i) the number of people in the community leaders questionnaire were
not always the same (as the number of SIC members varied based on availability). Also, given
that one of the aims of this instrument was to critically analyse the RDP processes including the
SIC, which most of the respondents were a part of, this information gathered may be biased.


                                                                                                 17
Nevertheless, these respondents were the most involved in the RDP process thus they had the
best knowledge on how to improve it. Finally, response rates for certain questions both in the
community and household questionnaire were very low which made it difficult to interpret some
results at the province level. In these cases as a result we present country level comparisons.



Section 3: Setting

Most villages in Solomon Islands are small. On average each village in the follow up survey had
78 households. The largest village had 500 households and smallest had 8 households. The
distribution of village sizes is presented in the appendix (Annex 1. Distribution of Village Size).
Most of the villages are governed by traditional village chiefs. In some cases elected leaders and
church leaders also help with governance. Most villages have churches (in some villages multiple
churches) which also act as the community hall for meetings. On average every village has at
least one church service a day. In most villages the three most important sources of livelihood
come from selling produce (fish, crops, livestock), cocoa/copra and other cash crops or from
logging royalties. In around 80 % of the villages more than three quarters of all villagers depend
on a subsistence (or semi-subsistence) economy. In 34 and 17 % of the sampled villages, there
was at least one person within the community involved with logging or mining. In 53 % of the
villages, the national MP had relatives.

The average household size in our sample was 5.54 people4 equally split across gender. Around
70 % of the households reported having at least one child attending school or kindergarten.
Additionally, 35 % of households reported having at least one child below the age of 5. In 58
(42) % of cases household survey respondents were male (female). The average age of household
responders was 43.7 years. The majority of households reported having access to rainwater
catchments for drinking water in the wet season. 82 % of households used solar lamps for
lighting their households. However, 72 % of households reported that they defecate in the Sea or
River and 3% in the bush. In terms of access most surveyed areas were located remotely: only
32.5 % of the villages reported that the time required to reach their provincial capital from their
village is less than two hours. On average the travel time between villages and their respective
provincial capital was 8.6 hrs. On the other hand, the average travel time to Honiara was two and
a half days. People from 68 % of the villages use ship or OBM canoe to travel between their

2009 census.

                                                                                                                     18
   village and their provincial capital. Most of the surveyed villages were located on the coast with
   very little access to proper roads. Boat transport is the main mode of transport in most
   provinces.




   Section 4: Access to Infrastructure

   This section will examine access to infrastructure. It will be divided into three main parts. The
   first part will look at water access including the first results indicator. The second section will
   examine access to other infrastructure including; schools, health centres, roads, markets, water,
   sanitation and electricity. The last section will examine RDP processes including; implementation,
   construction, participation and gender.

   Indicator one examines the percentage decrease in travel time to access improved water supply.
   Improved water supply sources are defined in question D9 of the household survey which asks:
   has your household’s access to clean drinking water improved during the past few years? Results
   are shown in Table 4. Overall, households experienced a 13% reduction in access to improved
   water sources. Results differ between provinces (Table 5). Choiseul and Temotu experienced a
   23.5% and 76% increase in travel time to improved water sources respectively, while Malaita and
   Western provinces had a 40% and 15% decrease in travel time, respectively, to access improved

time to access improved water sources. These results are analysed further below.

From Error! Reference source not found.5, we observe a significant decrease in travel time to
fetch drinking water in the wet season. Malaita (73 %) and Choiseul (63 %), show the biggest
improvement in travel time over the past 5 years. On the other hand, Temotu had a 9 % increase
in travel time to fetch water. Overall in the wet season, villagers experienced a 49 % decrease in
travel time to collect drinking water.

The dry season also saw significant improvements in some provinces. In Choiseul and the
Western province, travel time decreased by 46 % and 32 % respectively. However in Temotu
travel time increased by 127 %. Overall, the travel time to fetch water increased on average by
0.5 minutes per day. This increase was mainly driven by Temotu.

Another way of ascertaining access is to analyse the proportion of households or villages with
satisfactory access to water6. In the baseline, only 34.2 % of the villages reported satisfactory
access to water. This figure improved to 72 % during the follow-up survey. This translates to a
110.5 % increase between the two surveys. In terms of performance, the Choisuel province
exhibited the highest levels of improvements followed by the Western province. In terms of the
overall status of access to water, the Choisuel also had the highest rate. Although Temotu
registered a 53.3 % improvement, the overall status of access to water services is still low at 40 %
(Figure 2).

There has been a marked improvement in access to water services in all of the four study
provinces. On average, 71 % of the households reported that they have satisfactory access to
water. In the baseline, the corresponding number was 33.3 %. There is progress in terms of

 quality as well. Over 54 % of the households at follow up indicated good access to water. This is
 a 280 % increase compared to the baseline. In terms of performance, Choiseul province rated
 the best with almost 95 % of the households reporting having satisfactory access to water. In
 Temotu, on the other hand, the majority of the people still report having poor access to water
 (Table 6).

 Greater access to water is important for development outcomes7, however unless this access is
 accompanied by basic sanitation and improved water quality, health improvements will be
 marginal. Table 7 reports the main source of drinking water for a household between the
 baseline and wave 1. The main source of drinking water in the wet season 8 varied markedly
 across the sampled villages and provinces. However, a number of trends appear: the majority of
 households, 56%, use rainwater as their main water source. This is up from 24 %, an increase of
 128 %, from the baseline. Households report that rainwater is stored in tanks provided by
 projects such as CSP and RDP. This water source is protected and is less likely to be
 contaminated given the low level of industrial activity in the study provinces.

The movement towards rainwater tanks is associated with a decrease in the usage of springs,
boreholes and rivers throughout the provinces. It was found that households decreased their
usage of springs and rivers by 52%, and boreholes and wells by 38%. These water sources are
more likely to be polluted, particularly as a number of streams are prone to flooding.

In summary, these results show a significant improvement in the access to and quality of water
sources throughout surveyed villages. These results are confirmed in Figure 3. Overall, 60% of
households believe their access to clean drinking water has improved over the past few years.
Such improvements are recorded to be highest in Choiseul where 91% of households
experienced greater access to clean water. The lowest findings are in Temotu and Western
provinces, where 42% of households believed their access improved.

4.1.2) Factors that improved Access to Water.

Since the baseline in 2009/10, households have notably had better access to quality water
sources. Improvements in quality and access are often funded by a number of different
organisations including the local community, the RDP and the Solomon Islands’ Government.
Error! Reference source not found. lists the organisations responsible for funding the
improvements to the water system in each province.

On average, for all villages, the RDP was the largest contributor to the improvement of water
supply, funding 25% of all cases. The community funded an average of 20% of the water
improvement projects, while the Solomon Islands’ government contributed to 8% of the
projects. However, large differences exist between provinces. Foreign governments and NGOs
were the largest contributor to water projects in Temotu (20% and 25% respectively) and in
Western province, the majority (40%) of projects were funded by unspecified other parties.

As mentioned in Figure 4 the RDP plays an important role in the access to water through water
projects. To clearly identify if these projects are associated with improved access, we report the
mean time to fetch water for those villages with an RDP water project. The same is done for
RDP villages not choosing water projects, in other words RDP villages which did not select a
water project. A greater difference in the time taken to fetch water between villages with an
RDP water project and RDP non-water project villages9 would demonstrate that RDP water
projects are crucial in improvements in access to water.

The results in Error! Reference source not found. through to Figure 8 show that in the baseline,
villagers who selected an RDP water project took on average 14.5 minutes to fetch water in the
wet season and 42 minutes in the dry season. In comparison villages which selected projects
(other than a RDP water project) took 7 minutes to fetch water in the wet season and 19 minutes
in the dry. This result infers that at the baseline RDP water project villages had considerably
lower access to fresh water compared to other project villagers. This means RDP project
selection is correctly providing water projects to those villages which need it most.

Furthermore, as mentioned, at the time of the baseline survey RDP water project villagers had
much lower access to water sources, however, by the completion of the follow up survey RDP
water project villagers travelled less to access water compared to other project villages. Figure 5
shows that, on average, villages with a water project had large decreases in time to fetch water,
on average 79% in the wet season and 40% in the dry (Error! Reference source not found.). All
provinces saw a decrease in travel time except Temotu where travel time increased by 63% in the
wet season and 41% in the dry. These results are in direct contrast with all non-RDP water
project villages in which travel time decreased by 39% in the wet season (Figure 7) but increased
by 1% in the dry season (Error! Reference source not found.).

The above results thus provide evidence to support four important conclusions:

      1) Villages that are most in need of improved access to water sources are, on average,
         selecting these projects. This provides confirmation that the method of selecting RDP

                                                                                                                  26
   projects is correctly matching projects with needs and thus improving returns from
   investments.
2) Villages with RDP water projects saw significant improvements in access to water, much
   higher than the general trend of improvements seen in non-water project villages. Results
   are especially salient in the dry season. Non-water projects saw, a 1% increase in the time
   taken to fetch water. This was largely driven by Temotu and Choiseul which saw
   increases in travel time by 55% and 450%, respectively. While in villagers with RDP
   water projects, travel time declined by 72% (Choiseul) while Temotu saw a 10 times
   smaller increase in travel time compared to non-RDP water projects.
3) Travel time to collect water in villages with RDP water projects are now lower than non
   RDP project villages, which is a significant achievement and will not only have health
   benefits but will also maximise labour for productive activities.
4) Access to water has noticeably declined in the Temotu province. This is a worrying trend
   and is difficult to explain, based on survey responses. We conjecture that a number of
   factors may be driving these poor findings: 1) natural disasters that cause damage to
   infrastructure such as tsunamis and earthquakes often occur in the province (4 villages
   report either an earthquake or tsunami effect their village in the last year); 2) the Reef
   Islands may be driving this result. The Reef Islands are a significant distance from both
   Santa Cruz and Honiara, and have relatively poor access to most infrastructures including
   water. Furthermore, the small and highly dispersed population also make up 35% of the
   Temotu sample. Temotu is examined further in section 5.

Section 5) Access to Infrastructure

One of the key goals of the RDP, highlighted in component objectives, is to improve access to
infrastructure in rural Solomon Islands. In this subsection, we report data on the level of
satisfactory access to primary schools, health centres, roads, water supply, sanitation and markets
for both the baseline and follow-up surveys.

The key indicator outlined in the results framework for evaluating the impact of component 1 of
an RDP is the proportion of villages with satisfactory access to infrastructure. It is important to
note that data for both baseline and follow-up surveys were collected at the household level and
thus an indicator variable for the villages had to be computed using household level data. The
way we created the indicator variable for each infrastructure is described below. Each household
in both the baseline and wave 1 survey was asked whether their access to particular
infrastructures was good, satisfactory or bad. For each village, we tallied the total number of
responses which indicated that their access was at least satisfactory. If this tallied number was
more than 50 % of the total number of respondents in that village, then the village was classified
as having satisfactory access to that infrastructure. However, one can argue that our choice of
50% as the cut-off point is arbitrary. Thus, we conducted the same exercise with a more
stringent cut-off point criterion of 70 %. Under this criterion, for a village to be classified as
having satisfactory access to a particular infrastructure, at least 70 % of the households in that



                                                                                                 29
village would have had to indicate so. In our analysis, we also present results using this stricter
criterion as a robustness check.

5.1.1) Access to Primary Schools
In general, the level of access to primary schools in the surveyed provinces is good. On average,
around 83 % of the sampled households believe that their access to primary schools is
satisfactory. From Figure 9, we can observe that there has been an overall decrease in the
number of villages with satisfactory access to primary education from 88 % to 82.3 % between
the baseline and follow-up survey. However, this is mainly driven by data from the Temotu
province. For the Temotu province, this drop was 28.8 %. If we exclude data from Temotu, we
actually observe a 12.8 % increase in the percentage of villages with satisfactory access to primary
schools. In terms of performance, the Western province has shown the most progress with a 7.3 %
increase in the indicator variable. Results using the 70 % cut-off (Appendix 2) validate our main
observations of incremental improvements. Using this second criterion, we see improvements in
Malaita and Choiseul and deterioration in the Temotu and Western provinces.

In terms of the quality of access, there have been improvements in all of the four study
provinces with an average of 62.2 % of people expressing that their household has good access
to primary schools. In terms of improvement, Choiseul province performed the best with 93.8 %
reporting good access. This was followed by Malaita and Western province (Table 9). The
overall level of (at least) satisfactory access to education is relatively high (79 % on average) in
the study areas. Also, all provinces reported 70 % (at least) satisfactory access to primary
education. However at the same time, dissatisfaction with access to education also increased in

                                                                                                 30
all of the provinces. This implies that the improvements in infrastructure have only improved the
access of people who already had prior access to primary schools. Even though this is significant,
it would be worthwhile to look into why 20 % of the population still have poor access to primary
education.

One of the important features of RDP is that it is based on the needs of the community. Our
data finds evidence of this. From the baseline survey, we can observe that the villages that chose
to undertake education-related sub-projects had almost 27 percentage points lower levels of
satisfactory access to primary education compared to villagers who chose other projects to
participate in. Thus, in terms of targeting, the RDP performed well according to its mandate. In
terms of delivery, however the performance has been mixed. Although there has been only a
marginal increase of 1.6 % satisfactory access, the overall quality of access has improved with
almost 50 % of the population stating that they have good access compared to 32 % in the
baseline. Furthermore, there has been an increase of 8 percentage point in dissatisfactory access
to primary education in villages choosing not to undertake education-related project. This
highlights the success of the RDP. However, approximately 36 % of people have not benefitted
from RDP improvements (Table 10).

5.1.2) Access to Health Services
There have been improvements in the satisfactory access to health care services between baseline
and follow-up surveys in two of the four study provinces. The degree of improvement was
highest in Malaita (41.5 %) and lowest in Temotu, which registered a 51 % decrease in the
indicator (Figure 10). Choiseu province saw an 11.3 % decline whereas the Western province
experienced a 4.2 % improvement in access to health services. The results from the 70 % cut-off
indicator depict a better overall picture. There are improvements in all of the study provinces
barring Temotu. Indeed, if we restrict our sample to omit Temotu province, the magnitude of
improvement is around 30 % (Appendix 2).This report finds an overall decrease of 6.5 % in the
proportion of villages with satisfactory access to health services.

There has been a decrease in the satisfactory access to health services in two of the four
provinces. This drop was the highest in Temotu where almost 68 % of the households reported
having poor access to health facilities, an increase of 72.6 % compared to the baseline. There
have been improvements in both the quality and quantity of access to health care in Malaita and
Western provinces. In Malaita, 47.5 % and 22 % of the people report having good and
satisfactory access to health services. In Western province, the corresponding figures are 37.9
and 33.3 %, respectively. In fact, aside from Temotu, all the other three provinces recorded
improvements in the quality of access to health care (

In terms of targeting as well as performance, the RDP villages did well. On average, villages that
chose to undertake health projects had poor access to health services (56.5 %) compared to
villages that chose to undertake other projects (31.2 %). In terms of performance, the villages
that chose RDP health projects registered an improvement of 36 % in satisfactory access. This
increase is quite remarkable given that the villages that chose not to undertake health projects
registered a deterioration of 18 %. There were improvements in terms of quality as well. RDP
villages, on average, improved good access by 205 % and at the time of the follow-up survey,
almost 50 % of households in these villages reported that they had good access to healthcare.
The corresponding figure for non-RDP villages is 15.4 percentage points lower, at 34.1 % (Table
12).

5.1.3) Access to Roads
There have been substantial improvements in the satisfactory access to roads in all study
provinces. On average, 49.4 % of villages indicated that they have satisfactory access to roads in
the follow-up survey compared to a 32 % in the baseline survey. This translates to a 54 %
increase. The degree of improvement is the highest in Choiseul where 25 % villages have
satisfactory access to roads compared to 0 % in the baseline. The improvement is slowest, not
surprisingly, in Malaita as the province originally had good levels of access to roads shown in the
baseline (Figure 11).

5.1.4) Access to Markets
Figure 12 presents the proportion of villages with satisfactory access to markets at both baseline
and follow up. From the table, we can observe that access to markets has improved in all
provinces except Temotu, where there was a 72 % decrease in the proportion of villages with
satisfactory access to markets. The level of improvement was the highest in Choiseul, followed
by Western and Malaita. However, it is important to note that in the Western province, 37 % of
the villages still do not have satisfactory access to markets. On average, there has been a 40 %
increase in the proportion of villages with satisfactory access to markets in these three provinces.
Our robustness results verify our main observations that access has improved in all provinces
except Temotu (Appendix 2)

  Access to markets has shown mixed improvements. On one hand, satisfactory access increased
  in Choiseul and Western provinces whereas, on the other, it decreased in Malaita and Temotu
  provinces. In terms of quality, households in Choiseul reported having the highest level of
  satisfaction (68.3 %) followed Malaita (47.2). Less than a quarter of households in Temotu and
  Western province reported having good access to markets. In particular, it is alarming that
  around 85 % of households in Temotu province reported having poor access to markets (Table

  5.1.5) Access to Sanitation Facilities
  The overall level of access to sanitation is very poor in the survey areas. Only 9 % of villages
  across the four study areas have satisfactory access to sanitation facilities (Figure 13). There is
  disparity in access across location as well, with no villages in Malaita and Temotu registering
  satisfactory access to sanitation. Western province registers that 26% of its villages with having
  satisfactory access to safe sanitation facilities. The results from the robustness indicator also
  present the same dire conditions. These improvements however have very little meaning because
  of the aforementioned poor general conditions that still exist.

                                                                                                  35

 The level of access to sanitation facilities in the Solomon Islands is very poor. At the time of the
 follow-up survey, 92 % of households across all four provinces reported having poor access to
 sanitation facilities. The level of access is highest in Western province with 33.5 of the
 households reporting satisfactory access to sanitation facilities. Improvements have also been
 very slow with a 10 % decrease in poor access between baseline and the follow-up surveys (Table
 14).

 Table 15 reports the type of sanitation facilities used by different households. The statistics from
 the table reinforce the fact that sanitation needs to be identified as a priority area for future
 development. During the follow-up survey, almost three quarters of the respondents reported
 defecating in open spaces. In fact, only 20 % of the people on average use toilets with flush or
 pour flush. There has been very slow progress across time as well with very little change in
 access to safe sanitation facilities (6 percentage point improvements) between baseline and
 follow-up surveys.

5.1.6) Access to Electricity
There have been improvements in access to electricity in three of the four study provinces
(Error! Reference source not found.). During the baseline survey, no villages in Choiseul and the
Temotu provinces had satisfactory access to electricity, while the corresponding numbers in the
follow-up survey were 95 and 25 %, respectively. The Western province also improved its access
from 12 % to 95 %. However, there has been a decline in access to electricity in Malaita from 7 %
of villages having satisfactory access to a reduced 5 %. The robustness results also validate our
main observations (Annex 8).

There have been drastic improvements in the access to electricity in Choiseul and Western
provinces and modest improvements in Malaita and Temotu provinces. On average, there has
been a 46.6 % reduction in poor access to electricity across the provinces in the Solomon Islands.
There has been an increase in quality as well, with 36 % of households reporting having good
access to electricity.

This is perhaps reflected in the statistics from Annex 8. From the table, we can see that more
than 80 % of households during the follow up used solar lamps to light their houses. This is a
drastic improvement compared to 6.3 % utilisation of solar lamps during the baseline. It is not
surprising, as a result, that the usage of kerosine lamps has decreased from 92.9 % to 17 %
during this time period.

The usage of solar energy for other electricity needs of the household use other than lighting has
also improved. Compared to the baseline, 65.5 % point more households use solar for electricity
needs. The usage rate of generators has also increased by 4.2 percentage points (Table 18).

In relation to the impact of the RDP, the evidence has been mixed, both in terms of targeting as
well as performance. During the baseline, satisfactory access to electricity was 2 % in the villages
that chose to undertake electricity projects compared to 5 % in the villages that did not. Given
these low levels of satisfactory access to electricity in general, very little can be said about
targeting. In terms of performance, the villages that did not choose to undertake RDP projects
did better. On average, satisfactory access increased 49 percentage points in villages that chose
not to pursue solar projects compared to 30 percentage point increases in villages that decided to
pursue solar projects. In terms of quality, the villages which did not choose to undertake solar
projects also performed better (Table 19).

Finally we look into who have actually funded these projects. Figure 15 shows the breakdown of
who funded projects when households reported that their access to electricity has improved.
From the figure we can see that the main driving force behind the improvements in access to
electricity has been the members of the parliaments. In almost all the provinces over the last few
years MPs have been distributing solar lamps. Thus our finding is not surprising.

5.1.7) Construction of the variable to measure achievements.
The criteria set in evaluation framework for RDPs progress to infrastructure is to achieve 10
percent improvements in proportion of villages with satisfactory access to infrastructure between
the baseline and the follow-up survey. This poses a challenge because every village has at most
had one RDP infrastructure project. Thus it should only be expected that a village's access
should only increase in the particular type infrastructure that RDP has funded i.e. if a school is
built in a village then that villages access to schooling should increase. To come up with one

                                                                                               40
variable which captures overall access to infrastructure is thus challenging. Moreover, the
proportion of each type of project to that of the total project is also not equal for each project.
For example, there has only been one RDP project related to improvements in road access
where as there have been numerous projects aimed at improving water supply. In view of these
facts, we created an index variable. In creating this index variable we only used information from
access to water, health, education and electricity infrastructure. This is because these projects
accounted for 90 percent of all RDP projects. We used a weighted average to calculate a villages
infrastructure access. The highest value this indicator variable could take was 1, which would
indicate that every individual that was surveyed in this village had at least satisfactory access to all
infrastructure. The lowest value conversely was 0, which would indicate no one would have
satisfactory access to any infrastructure. The formula for how the index was created is given
below




Here the     is the weight given to that infrastructure . For our calculations we used weights of
0.215, 0.360, 0.159 and 0.167 for school , water, health and electricity. These values were
computed on the basis of the intensity of type RDP projects in the sample villages. For example
of the total number of villages that chose to do any one of these four types of projects 21.5
percent chose schooling project, 36 percent chose water projects, 15..9 percent chose health and
16.7 chose electricity projects. Based on this we created the target indicator. Improvements in
this indicator is presented in Table 20.

From the table we see that RDP has achieved its targets. Proportion of villages with satisfactory
access to infrastructure has increased from 34 percent to 65.8 percent, a 92.4 percent increase.
Thus in summary, the performance of the RDP in improving access to infrastructure has been
good.



5.2.1) Temotu Examined
The Temotu province throughout this report has shown either no improvement or a decrease in
access to infrastructure. This is a worrying trend and requires further analysis. This section will
examine differences between the baseline and the follow up survey for the Temotu province to
understand this decline.

Of the 20 villages surveyed during the follow up in Temotu 19 were also surveyed in the
baseline. This provides us with an important comparison sample. At the baseline 2779 household
members are reported to reside in surveyed villages compared to 7917 in the follow up an
increase of 180%. In terms of other comparable village characteristics, at the baseline each village
had on average 3.5 businesses while at the time of the follow up Temotu had on average 11.45
businesses. This is a significant change especially in terms of population which may have put a
strain on infrastructure access.

Temotu’s poor performance may in part be due to the decline of a small number of villages,
these outliers may not be a true reflection of outcomes throughout Temotu. To examine this we
report access to primary school, health services, water supply and roads between villages.
Satisfactory access to primary school declined in 8 villages. The decline was most significant in
Malapu, Lipe, Bania and Taipe. Lipe for example at the baseline reported 70% satisfactory access
compared to 20% at the time of the follow up. Satisfactory access to health services declined in
12 villages throughout Temotu. The decline was largest in Malapu, Nyimoa, Manoputi, Balo,
Noipe, Bania and Manevi. Strikingly, 100% of Bania’s surveyed baseline households reported
satisfactory access to health services compared to 0% at the follow up. Satisfactory access to
water declined in 14 villages. Nearly all households in these villages reported access to water was
poor. Finally, satisfactory access to roads decreased in half of all surveyed villages. However, the
decline was less than 15 percentage points in nearly half of villages. The largest declines were
seen in Malapu, Nyimoa, Laro, Mrnrg and Bania.

These results provide evidence that poor access to primary schooling and roads can be explained
by a small number of outlier villages (4 villages in the case of schooling and 5 villages in the case


                                                                                                  42
           of roads). A number of characteristics appear similar between these villages: 1) Nearly all villages
           experienced high levels of rain over the last year. This may have destroyed roads and reduced
           access to primary schools. 2) The population of these villages increased by more than the
           province average. This increase in population could strain access to services such as schools.

           The finding above however, show that declines in access to health services and water occurred in
           over half of all villages and thus, poor service access is not driven by a small number of villages.
           Another explanation for this decline may be due to misreporting of access by households. This
           could occur for instance if households were not selected randomly, or differ in their definition of
           access. This issue can be examined further by comparing these household results with the
           community leader survey in which community leader groups were asked if services had improved
           in the village in the last four years. In terms of health services 35% of community groups in
           Temotu identify that access improved over the last four years. While, 15% of community groups
           in Temotu reported improvements in access to water supply.. These results are consistent with
           the household survey and provide evidence that community leader groups and households rank
           access to infrastructure in a similar manner.

        It is possible that the decline in access may be due to enumerator bias. To examine this issue, we
        report results for each enumerator in Temotu. Table 22 examines the difference in responses per
        village by enumerators. Results show significant differences between enumerators across villages.
        Differences are largest in Manoputi, Nifoli and Neo-Malo. These results imply, that the decline
        in Temotu may be partly driven by one enumerator who may have underestimated community
        access to infrastructure in a number of villages.

In summary, results are unclear as to the reason why access to infrastructure declined in Temotu.
For some services such as schools and roads, the decline in access can be attributed to a small
number of villages which suffered high rain and in some cases earthquakes and tsunamis.
However, the decline in health services and water supply, occurs in most villages and cannot be
explained by survey results. This area should be examined for further research. Comparing
survey results with NGO’s such as World Vision which run water projects in Temotu would be a
start and allow survey results to be checked for robustness. Consultation should also occur with
the team leader and CH’s to gather other opinions as to causes of these poor results.

Intermediate results indicator six asks what percentage of households in the communities
received project funding and felt the project investments reflected their needs. To answer this,
we used household question F5- Overall, how satisfied were you with the way in which the
<sub-project> was selected? Respondents often perceived this question as an evaluation of the
sub-project rather than a question on the selection process11. Figure 16 shows that overall, 81.4%
of the surveyed households were very satisfied with the sub-project while 12.5 % were a little
satisfied and 6.1% were not satisfied. Malaita had the highest level of dissatisfaction with 8.7% of
households not satisfied with the sub-project. In comparison, Choiseul had the highest level of
satisfaction (93%). The report finds that RDP reached its target. On average 94% of households
felt projects investments reflected their needs.




10The follow-up survey does not directly answer this question. Instead, we use household survey question F5-
Overall, how satisfied were you with the way in which the <sub-project> was selected? Arguably, respondents
tended to answer this question based on what they thought of the sub-project, rather than the process.

11   Evidence of this comes from the general observations by the field team

                                                                                                                       46

Figure 17 shows the results for female respondents only. The outcome is very similar to all
households shown above. On average, 80.7% of female respondents reported they were very
satisfied with the sub-project, 12.7% were a little satisfied and 6.7% were not satisfied. At the
province level, Temotu had the highest level of dissatisfaction with 10.7% of female respondents
not satisfied with the sub-project. The report finds that the RDP reached its target. On average
94% of women feel projects reflect their needs.

5.3.2) SIC Management
An important component of the RDP process is the Sub-Project Implementation Committee
(SIC). The SIC is in charge of organising and managing the sub-project from design through to
organizing maintenance/operation of infrastructure/service after subproject completion. SIC

                                                                                              47
membership is minimally composed of a (i) Chairman, (ii) Secretary, (iii) Treasurer; the Technical
Officer Representatives of different interest groups within the community (women, youth, clans
etc.)

Figure 18 shows, on average, 66 % and 20 % of households were either very or partly satisfied
with the SIC committee respectively. On the other hand, 13% of households reported that they
were not satisfied with SIC. Large differences existed between provinces: Temotu had the
highest level of dissatisfaction (18%), while Choiseul had the lowest (8%).

Households were subsequently asked if they thought the composition of the SIC should be
changed and if so, how. Nearly half (46.5%) of the households reported the composition of the
committee should not change. Of those that reported that the composition should change, 27%
indicated that the committee should consist of more women members. This is especially
prevalent in Malaita, where 43% reported the need to increase female participation. In contrast,
6% of households believe more men are needed on the SIC committee. It should also be noted

                                                                                               48
that Temotu differs in this respect: 40% of households reported that the SIC should have more
men. Finally, on average, 14% of households reported more youths are needed on the SIC
committee.

The involvement of all members of the community, including women and youths, is vital to
ensure community ownership and sustainability. These results infer that the composition of the
SIC is lacking both women and youths. Interestingly, men are often the strongest promoter of
women’s involvement. On average, 25% of males reported the need to increase women’s
involvement. Participation and its associated benefits will be discussed further in section 5.

Questions about what the SIC committee did well and could have done better were also asked
during the survey. Error! Reference source not found. reports household opinions on what tasks
the SIC performed well in. Nearly 20% of households reported the SIC performed well in tasks
related to financial and project management. Nearly 65% of all households reported satisfaction
with the SIC’s ability to motivate and coordinate the community while 46% believed the SIC was
able to communicate progress to the community. Results were similar across provinces.

Figure 21 reports households’ suggestions on how the SIC could have done better. In nearly
40% of cases, households reported dissatisfaction with the SIC’s financial and project
management 12 . This issue was more widespread in Temotu (45.3%) and Choiseul (60%). A
number of households also reported that motivating and coordinating the community could also
have been improved (28%). Furthermore, households also reported the need to increase
communication and cooperation between SIC and the community. Interestingly, a number of

12   4.7% of households report both satisfaction and dissatisfaction with SIC’s financial and project management.

                                                                                                                    49
households reported both dissatisfaction and satisfaction with the same issues (see Figure 20 and
Figure 21). This could indicate that the categories may have been too broad as the SIC may have
performed well in some sub-areas but less well in others.

Community leader discussion groups were also asked a number of questions based on the SIC.
The groups were firstly asked if having an SIC was an effective way of coordinating the sub-
project implementation. Overall, 90% of groups reported that the SIC was an effective way of
coordinating sub-projects. The results were consistent across provinces (see Table 24).

of coordinating the sub-project.

The groups were further asked if they could recommend a better option than having SIC (Table
25). The responses to this question indicate that respondents were confused: majority of
comments that were made suggest methods of improving the SIC rather than providing
alternatives. Nevertheless, we categorised all valid comments into three general fields. In
Temotu, the groups reported the SICs should add committee members, that is, either adding


                                                                                                50
new members such as women or additional committee members from the community. Overall,
16% of leader groups reported that there should be no change and that the SIC is ‘the best
option’. The last category is a “New SIC”. This indicates 20% of all leader groups believe the
SIC would be better run under an alternate committee. The majority of suggestions are to use
the church committee or any other existing committee instead of the SIC.

In summary, the villagers were relatively satisfied with the SIC committee and believed it was an
effective method of coordinating the sub-project, however there appears to be a greater need for
female and youth involvement. This will lead to greater consensus within the community,
ensuring community ownership, participation and sustainability. Households, also believe, that
financial and project management and community coordination needs improvement.




5.3.3) Implementation challenges
The community leader discussion groups in each village were asked to name the two biggest
challenges to sub-project implementation. Figure 22 presents the results. Overall, the biggest
challenge appeared to be community participation (55%). This was closely followed by
purchasing raw materials (40%) and RDP procedures (31%). At the province level, the results are
similar with the biggest impediment to implementation in Choiseul, Malaita and Western being
community participation while in Temotu, RDP procedures were reported to provide the biggest
challenge.

  9/20 community groups responded to this questions. However, the answers to this question were not
able to be categorised as the answers varied and did not relate to the actual question.

As we show later in Figure 28, a large proportion of households reported RDP projects were
either incomplete or not functioning. It is therefore important to directly examine the biggest
challenges faced by incomplete projects. Results in Figure 22, show that villages with incomplete
projects suffered from similar challenges faced by the average villages. Community participation
and purchasing raw materials was the biggest challenge implementing a sub-project in both these
types of villages.

Households were also asked about RDP processes and what they would change. Subsequently,
they were asked to outline procedures to improve sub-project construction and implementation.


                                                                                                      52
Results differed significantly across provinces (Figure 23). The surveyed households in Western
province indicated timing14, information flow to and from the community and funding limits
should improve. Temotu households overwhelmingly reported the procurement system needed
the most improvement. On the other hand, the surveyed households in Malaita indicated the
funding limits, timing and accountability of the committees needed improvement. Lastly,
Choiseul, similar to Temotu, reported procurement and timing were in need of change to
improve sub-project construction and implementation.

In summary, the biggest challenge to RDP project implementation appears to be community
participation.        Over 80% of community leader groups reported either poor community
participation or the contribution of raw materials by communities were significant impediments
to project implementation. These results are true across completed project villages and
incomplete project villages. Another important impediment in RDP procedures is timing and
funding limits. Improvement in these areas will have significant impacts on the implementation
of projects by improving the timeliness of project completion and thus would improve the
proportion of sub-projects which have been completed and are functioning.

Issuing individual bank accounts to communities was not only an important method of
distributing RDP funding but also a method enabling villagers to learn financial skills. Bank
accounts were opened by CHs in most communities to provide SIC access to implementation
funds.


14   Timing is not broken down into specifics in the household survey.

                                                                                            53
To ascertain the usefulness of bank accounts, all community leader groups were asked if there
was a benefit for the SIC in having a sub-project bank account. The results are reported in Error!
Reference source not found.. Overall, 78% of surveyed village leader groups reported a strong
benefit in having a sub-project bank accounts.

Village leader groups were further asked to identify the benefits of having a SIC bank account
(Figure 25). Over half of the groups identified that bank accounts improved the community
members’ book keeping skills. Furthermore they indicated that as a result of these bank accounts
members got the chance to use cheques. However, these results varied significantly between
provinces. The biggest impact of having an SIC bank account appeared to be the benefits of
learning accounting in both Choiseul, Malaita and Temotu, while in Western province as well as
Malaita, bank accounts made it easier for the SIC to access money.

Table 26 reports the proportion of community groups that plan to keep a bank account after
RDP. Overall, more than half of the villages reported they were likely to keep a bank account
after the RDP while 28.5% will not. These results, along with the other results reported in this

section, suggest SIC bank accounts were directly correlated with the transfer of skills to the
community and were often seen as beneficial to the community.

5.3.5) Ward Development Committee

A Ward Development Committee (WDC) was established in each ward, by the decision of an
open community meeting in which different clans, associations, women and minority/vulnerable
groups were present. WDC was composed of: the Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA); a
representative of a traditional authority; a Church representative; a women’s representative; and
male and female youth representatives. Other representatives could have been be nominated by
the communities. The WDCs usually met in an “open session” once per year to review the sub-
project requests submitted by each village in the ward. In addition, they were responsible for
considering cost estimates and preparing ward infrastructure maps.

All households were asked if they knew any members of the WDC. Overall, 40% of households
reported they knew at least one member of the WDC (Figure 26Error! Reference source not
found.). Two follow-up questions were asked to those households responded that knew WDC
members. Firstly, they were asked if they ‘believed the RDP Ward Development Committee
properly represented groups in the village?’ . Figure 27 reports that 75% of households
believed the WDC committee properly represented the community. Results are less than
homogenous at the province level. Close to half (52%) of the Temotu households believe that
the WDC does not properly represent their village.

It is possible that these results were driven by the sub-section of households that responded that
they knew WDC members. Households, for example, may know WDC members because they
had disagreements or similarly live in the village, leading to a bias in the result. Therefore, these
results should be interpreted with caution.

A quarter of households indicated that more women are needed in the WDC when asked if the
WDC membership should change (Table 27), while 33% believe the composition of the WDC
should not change. At the province level, 15% of households in Choiseul indicated no change in
composition should occur compared to 63% in Western province. Further, on average, 19% of
households believed the WDC should comprise more youths.

In summary communities appear to be satisfied with the WDCs. However, satisfaction was
lower in both Temotu and Choiseul provinces. Results also show that WDCs should include
more women and youth especially in Temotu and Malaita provinces.

5.3.6) Sub-Project Quality
Figure 28 examines the proportion of sub-projects which have been completed and are
functioning in a village. On average, 52% of households reported projects were completed and
functioning in their village. However, there was heterogeneity across provinces. In Western
province, 30% of projects were completed and functioning while 45% were completed in
Temotu. This contrasts with 69% in Choiseul and 62% in Malaita. In 35% of villages,


                                                                                            56
households reported contradictory results: for these villages some households reported projects
were complete and functioning while some reported otherwise. This may be due to households’
varying definitions of a complete and functioning project. It also may be due to a lack of
communication within villages.

Households that reported a project was completed and functioning were subsequently asked if
they were satisfied with the quality or standard of the sub-project construction (Figure 29). More
than half of all the households reported that they were very satisfied with the construction
quality while 20% were partially satisfied. In contrast, 8% of households were not at all satisfied
with the quality.

When asked what factors improved project quality, nearly half of the respondents indicated
community management, while 30% reported direct community purchasing led to the improved

                                                                                                57
quality of the sub-project (Table 28). Training and design also played a role, according to
households. These results are fairly consistent throughout the provinces, except in Malaita where
less than 1% of households indicated direct community purchasing helped improve the quality.
These results are interesting as the majority of factors that led to the improvement in quality can
be generalised into community participation, such as training and direct community purchasing
and management. This could be a reflection of the effectiveness of community participation and
ownership.

A caveat to these results is that households also discussed other factors that could have
improved the quality of the sub-project. This question appears to have confused some
participants. There were numerous inappropriate responses because some respondents believed
they were being asked what methods could be used to improve the sub-project. Thus, the
interpretation of the analysis based on this question should be taken with caution.

Community leader discussion groups were asked to comment on the technical quality of
construction compared to other similar infrastructure built in the community or nearby. The
results are reported in Figure 30. The majority of communities (73%) reported that the quality of
an RDP sub-project was better than similar infrastructure, while 20% of leader groups indicate
an RDP project is of similar quality to other infrastructure projects.

Every household was asked what factors negatively impacted the quality of the sub-projects
(Figure 31). More than 50% of all households reported distance from supplier being a big
impediment to sub-project quality while 45% of households indicated inadequate funding
negatively impacted project quality. Other factors, such as the SIC not functioning (16.5%) and
poor community cooperation (17.2%) were also important.

In summary, these results suggest that the majority of households and community leaders were
satisfied with the quality of the RDP sub-project. An important reason for this high satisfaction
is in part high levels of community engagement. However, inadequate funding and distance from
suppliers is still an impediment to project quality especially for those provinces further away
from Honiara.



5.3.7) Sub-Project Maintenance
Community leader groups were asked a series of questions about sub-project maintenance,
beginning with ‘Has any maintenance already been carried out on this subproject?’ Figure 32
shows relatively low levels of maintenance were carried out. Overall, 20% of respondents
reported maintenance had been carried out on sub-projects. These results are not unexpected as



                                                                                                        59
a significant proportion of projects are incomplete. Looking only at those villages with complete
projects close to 26% of community leader groups reported maintenance was carried out.

The second question in this set asked community leader groups if maintenance was planned for
the sub-project (Figure 33). Close to 70% of community leader groups plan to implement
maintenance. The main difference between provinces was that less than half of the surveyed
community groups in Malaita plan future maintenance compared to 90% in Western province. In
comparison to other similar projects in the community (see Figure 34Error! Reference source not
found.), maintenance plans are more common for RDP programs (67% vs 50%).

Under the auspice that maintenance will occur in the future, village community leader groups
were subsequently asked how this maintenance will be funded (Figure 35). Methods of funding
differ widely at the province level. Close to half of all community leader groups in Western
province reported that maintenance will be funded through monthly subscription fees. In
Temotu, funding is expected to come through fundraising and user fees, while in Malaita,
maintenance will be funded through monthly fees and fundraising.

for maintenance. The results are shown in Figure 36Error! Reference source not found.. Overall,

province.

The results from this section are interesting. Only a quarter of communities undertook
maintenance for their sub-projects while more than half reported maintenance will be carried out
in the future. It is also worrying that a large number of communities are either not planning to
carrying out maintenance in the future or are unsure from where the funding will come. Further,
they often don’t have experience implementing maintenance in other similar non-RDP projects.
Poor implementation of maintenance may be, in part, due to a lack of skills and experience,
especially by the SIC committee who are held responsible for implementing the maintenance in
most villages. These results seems to be consistent with the baseline in which households were
asked what needs to be done to keep buildings and facilities in this village in good condition and
working properly?’. In most cases, households were aware maintenance was important yet lacked
the skills and organisation to implement this maintenance.

        In this section we analyse the level of participation in RDP projects across study communities. In
        particular we look at processes that work and what some of the avenues for future
        improvements. However, the starting point of our analysis is the medium term indicator that
        RDP has set for itself in the results framework: percentage of households in target planning units
        participating in RDP Community Development Sub-project decision making. Figure 37
        represents the level of participation across all four study provinces. From the table we can see
        that overall participation rate was well below RDP targets. Only 47.9 households reported that
        they participated in the selection of the RDP sub-project. The highest participation rate was in
        Temotu (58.8 %) and lowest in Malaita (39.0 %). The main reason why people did not participate
        was because they were away (24.0 %), being busy (14.0 %) or lack of awareness (9.0 %). If we
        restrict our sample to just have people who were present during the sub-project selection process
        then participation rate increases to 71.9 % which is 8.1 percentage points lower than RDP
        targets.

As a part of the survey, households were also asked to identify ways in which participation could
have been improved. The three most important avenues that households identified were for the
SIC/RDP/CHs to provide 2 weeks’ notice (37.5 %), liaise with the church to make
announcements (42.7 %) and hold meetings in the evenings (36.1 %) (Figure 38). The
suggestions made by the households are consistent with the main reasons for not participating in
meetings. The best possible strategy would be to provide two weeks’ notice through the
churches for meetings to be held in evenings.

Households were also asked to identify who had the most influence over selection of RDP sub-
projects. Most households indicated that the entire community had the most influence over the
choice of sub-projects (72.4 %). The second and the third most important influence came from
village leadership (43.4 %) and religious leadership (22.0 %). Their influence was particularly high
in Temotu province. The WDC and the MPA had very little influence in the selection of projects
at the village level (Table 30). Based on these responses it is clear that indeed the selection of
sub-project is based on community’s needs and desires. However, our results would have been
stronger if we had over 50 % of the community participating in the selection process.

In terms of participation in implementation of sub-projects most households helped out either
by providing labour (83.8 %) and/or food (57.9 %). Another 10 % of the households reported
that they provided money or material towards the sub-project implementation. Finally, 92.1 % of
the households believed that community participation was essential in implementing the project
and 94.6 % of them believed that community contributions should be mandatory by RDP as it
used to be.

In summary, the level of participation in the sub-project selection was well below RDP targets.
However, it seems that the non-participation was not due to lack of interest amongst the
members of the community. If meetings were better advertised and were held at better times
(evenings) participation rates would have been substantially higher. The fact that majority of the
community understand the need for community participation in the implementation part
reinforces this observation.



5.5) Gender
It has long been understood 15 that to ensure effective development outcomes, development
projects must encourage the voice and participation of women. Women’s integration into
development projects establishes an equal gender power relation and is an equality-based
approach. The RDP program has set guidelines that encourage women to participate and
contribute to the development projects that directly involve them.




5.5.1) Engagement of Women in RDP
The community leader survey asked participants if they thought RDP processes enable women
to influence decision-making more than other community projects. In nearly all cases, the
community leader groups reported RDP processes enabled women’s involvement (Figure 40).
This is consistent throughout all of the surveyed provinces. When asked how RDP processes
enabled female engagement, close to 45% of all community groups listed women in the SIC as
being a driving factor (Figure 41) while 30% of community groups reported that the RDP
processes provided an opportunity for women to present their views and 51% reported RDP
processes encouraged women to be more active.

An important RDP recommendation is that the SIC should be comprised of different interest
groups within the community, including women. Figure 42 reports the answers to E16 from the
community leader survey which asked participants if the SIC includes women. Overall, 90% of
the surveyed SIC committees include women. At the province level, Choiseul had the lowest
proportion of SICs with female members (80%) while Temotu had the highest (95%).

The results from Figure 43 show that RDP SIC membership is often the first major community
responsibility of the women involved. In Temotu, the province with the highest female SIC
membership, in 85% of cases, it is these women’s first major community responsibility while in
Choiseul, the province with the lowest female SIC membership, it is the first major community
responsibility for 61% of female SIC members.

These results show that the RDP processes have increased female community engagement
through SIC committee membership. However, these findings demonstrate that women are
active in the RDP process but not in other areas of the community. To examine if engagement
increased female participation in other village activities, community leader groups were asked ‘If
there was/is a women on the SIC, has her/their activity in the village changed since joining the
SIC?’ (Figure 44). In 81% of villages, the community leader groups reported women on the SIC

                                                                                               68
participate more in village activities than before joining the SIC. At the province level, 44% of
community leader groups reported the female SIC members, on average, participated to the
same degree in community activities.

village changed since joining the SIC?’ shows that on average, 80% of female SIC members
participate more in activities outside their community (see Figure 45). However, the results for
this question may have confused participants, and they may have been unable to differentiate this

5.5.2) Effects of Female Participation in the RDP Process.

Section 5.5.1 established that women play an important role in SIC committees. It is often the first
form of community engagement for women which leads to spill-over effects, increasing female
community participation. This section will examine the effects of increased female participation
in the RDP process16.

Figure 47 examines SIC composition and the proportion of community groups which consider
SIC to be effective. When SICs included women, in 94% of cases, community groups reported
the SIC to be effective. On the other hand, when the SICs excluded women, only 62% of
community groups reported the SIC to be effective.

The SIC is often responsible for organising meetings and informing community groups of
important activities and changes. When women were a part of SICs, close to 40% of community
leader groups identified community meetings occurred often, while 41% report community

     We report the results at the country level rather than province level due to the small number of observations.

                                                                                                                      71
meetings occurred sometimes. In contrast, when SICs did not include women, meetings rarely
occurred 75% of the time (see Table 31).

These results however, may be driven by a small subset of villages which could have performed
poorly, irrespective of SIC composition. It is therefore important to examine this issue further.
Table 32 shows that when female SIC members are reported to be more active outside the
village community, meetings are held often in 44% of villages and sometimes in 75% of villages
while in communities where SIC membership does not increase female engagement inside the
community, meetings are held often in these villages 17% of the time and sometimes 75% of the
time.

Conflict within communities, such as disagreements or disputes before or during the
construction, is a large impediment to RDP project completion. Interestingly, when female SIC
members are more active outside the community, conflict occurs in 30% of villages compared to
41% in communities where female SIC members are less active (Table 33). The hypothesis
behind these results is that SIC female members being more active inside the community leads to
improved village participation and greater ownership. This results in less frequent community
conflict, as members feel included in the process and design. However, due to the small sample
and possibility that villages in which women are more active are inherintantly different to villages
in which women are less active.

Another important issue is the involvement of women in the selection process. A key design of
the RDP program is community-driven development. Community driven means that the
communities will be responsible for the identification and the implementation of their own sub-
projects, thereby encouraging community ownership. Table 34 uses the baseline question WA 5
from the female discussion group to examine the proportion of communities that reported

                                                                                                  72
women were involved in the selection process 17 and if the project is now complete. Overall,
when women were involved in the selection process, 68.5% of villages reported the project was
complete while when women were not involved in the selection process, only 57% of the villages
reported the project was complete.

In terms of participation we can see that women are less likely to participate. On average 53.2 %
of men participated in sub-project selection meetings compared to 39.7% for women (Figure
48). Even in terms of intensity of participation, women seemed to be more passive then men.
On average 24 % of women reported to have neither spoken nor voted in selection meetings.
The corresponding number for men was only 6 %. Men also generally spoke more than women
in meetings. 78 % of men reported to have spoken in meetings compared to 47 % for women
(Figure 49).

In summary, the RDP process encourages greater female community involvement, which occurs
predominately through the SIC committee. Female members that join the SIC increasingly
participate within and outside the community. This increased female participation directly
correlates with greater RDP project outcomes. Specifically, when SIC committees comprise
female representatives, there is likely to be less disagreement and disputes and more community
meetings. However, it may also be the case that communities that have greater female
participation have other characteristics that lead to greater project outcomes. This could be an
area of further study to examine these villages and identify such characteristics. Nevertheless,
these results showing female participation in the selection process and membership of the SIC
are a strong signal that the RDP process creates wider community participation. This directly
increases the probability that the RDP project will be successful.

5.6) Economic Activity and Services:
5.6.1) Primary School Attendance
It has been widely recognised that education is a powerful instrument for reducing poverty.
However, unfortunately access to education is often limited in the Solomon Islands. Not all the
surveyed villages had primary schools and only a few had secondary schools. For those without
access to schools, it can be difficult and expensive to ensure the education of children.

A number of RDP projects focus on improving access to primary education through building
libraries, staff houses and other improvements in primary school facilities. Table 36 and Table 37
examine if these projects had impacts on the proportion of eligible children attending primary
school18. In general, 67% of eligible females were attending primary school while 62% of eligible
males were attending. The proportion of females attending primary school is similar to the
baseline while the proportion of males attending declined slightly. These percentages are similar
compared with national estimates.

Table 37 specifically looks at primary school sub-project villages. In the baseline, these villages
had much lower female participation compared to other villages. By the time of the follow-up
survey, female participation had increased by 15% however, participation is still lower compared
to non-sub project villages 19 . Male participation, on the other hand, decreased between the
baseline and the follow up. However, the decline was smaller in RDP sub-project villages.

     Eligible children are defined as children of primary school age and or those that are attending primary school

Sub-projects that provide sanitation, health services and other improved services may also have
an impact on primary school attendance. For example, improved water supply and health
services may reduce how often a child is sick, making it less likely they will drop out of school 20.
We utilise a tobit21 regression to analyse the factors that affect the proportion of eligible children
in each household who attend primary school. The results are reported in Table 38 for females
and Table 39 for males.

For females a reduction in travel time to primary school is statistically associated with improved
primary school attendance. Furthermore, Malaita and Western provinces are more likely to have
eligible females attending primary school. Other than this, improved access to services such as
health clinics and women’s centres are not directly associated with female attendance at primary
school.

   We test this only on the follow-up survey which appears to be a more reliable indicator of primary school
attendance. This is because in the baseline, households were not asked how many children live in each household,
thus it is difficult to gauge the number of children in each household who do not attend primary school.
21 Tobit models are statistical estimation models used when the dependent variable contains many censored

observations (zero’s). Interpretation is identical to ordinary least squares

RDP health clinic and community centre are two factors that appear statistically correlated with
improved attendance at primary school for males. This is likely because communities with this
infrastructure are likely to have other positive characteristics that encourage males to attend
primary school.

In summary, these results provide evidence that improved access to some infrastructure is not a
leading determinant of female primary school participation. It is likely that a number of other
factors that play a role in determining outcomes are not measured here. However, communities
that improve health clinics and community halls are likely to have a greater proportion of males
attending primary school, a signal that improved infrastructure is associated with primary school
attendance.

 Agricultural innovation is an important tool to increase production and incomes at the village
 level and makes up a key component of the RDP project. The main driver of agricultural
 innovation under an RDP comes from agricultural officers who visit villages to disseminate
 training and advice. Indicator three examines this issue asking “What are the Percentage of
 Households who changed agricultural practices including varieties, as a result of agricultural
 advice”. Those households which change agricultural practices and receive d advice are
 considered to have changed practices as results of advice. While all other households which do
 not change practices and receive advice are considered to not have changed agricultural practices
 as a result of advice. In other words, households which change practices and do not receive
 advice or households which receive advice and do not change practices are not considered to
 have changed practices as a result of advice.

                                                                                                                 78
The baseline shows that, on average, 2% of households changed agricultural practices as a result
of receiving advice. At the province level, 2% of households changed practices after receiving
advice in Choiseul and Temotu while 2.8% changed practices in Western province. By the time
of the follow-up survey, the proportion of households that received advice and changed
practices improved markedly to 11.20%, an increase of 413% from the baseline. Large advances
were seen in Choiseul (5.26%), Malaita (19.19%) and Temotu (12.63), increasing the proportion
of households that received advice. A much smaller increase was seen in Western province
where the number of households changing practices after receiving advice increased by 147%

To explain the above changes, it is important to examine the proportion of households that
changed practices and then identify the factors driving this change. Figure 50 shows the
proportion of households that have changed agricultural practices over the last 4 years. Farming
methods have changed on average by 192% from the baseline. The largest changes were seen in
both Choiseul (561%) and Malaita (180%). Strikingly, these results are much higher than those
shown in Table 41. For example, in wave 1, 40% of households changed farming methods, yet
only 11.20% changed farming methods due to the advice received. This, in part, is due to the
proportion of households that actually received advice. Figure 51 shows that, on average,
Malaita, Temotu and Western all saw increases in the proportion of households that received
advice, however Choiseul saw a decrease in the proportion of households that received advice.
Strikingly, the proportion of households that received advice is still much lower than those that

than RDP.

Figure 50: Households whose farming methods have changed over the last 4 years. shows that
households are changing farming practices but, this is only partly due to agricultural advice.
However, when households actually received advice (see Table 43) are, on average, likely to
change their practices 50% of the time. There are considerable differences at the province level,
with Choiseul and Malaita increasing the proportion of households that changed practices when
they received advice by 310% and 110% respectively, while much smaller differences are seen in
Temotu and Western.

Of those that received advice and changed practices, satisfaction in the advice has grown since
the baseline survey. On average, 61% of households are always satisfied with agricultural advice,
up from 47% in the baseline. Western province is the most satisfied with agricultural advice, with
76% of households saying they are satisfied in contrast to 45% of Temotu households which are
always satisfied with farming advice. In comparison, households are less likely to be sometimes

Interestingly, this increase in satisfaction in Western and Temotu is correlated with an increase in
farm output due to agricultural advice. The results are reported in Figure 52. Overall, 73% of
households reported an increase in crop or farm output due to agricultural advice, this result has
not changed since the baseline, even though a larger proportion of households are receiving
agricultural advice.

In summary, the results for indicator 3 are modest. The proportion of households that received
agricultural advice and changed their farming practices has increased from the baseline.
However, there are two important reasons for the slow pick-up in agricultural methods: i) only
25% of households have received or asked for advice from agricultural officers. If households
don’t receive advice, their opportunities to improve farming practices are limited; ii) on average,
50% of households take up the advice and change practices. This means that a large proportion
of households never change their practices even after receiving advice. This directly contrasts
with the high level of satisfaction and improvement in output due to the advice received. This
alludes to the important need to improve take up and agricultural advice to a larger number of
households. Evidence from past take up may help convince households of the advantages of
changing their farming methods; iii) when households are asked if MAL officers provided
consultation in a village, household answers varied in nearly all villages, with some households
reporting ‘yes’ to this question while others reported ‘no’. This provides evidence that MAL
officers are holding consultation sessions in villages, however, participation in these consultation
sessions is low. This could be a reason why the take up of MAL advice is seen in only a quarter
of households.

One: Percentage of villages

to whom agricultural

provided.


Indicator one examines the percentage of villages in participating provinces to whom agricultural
services have been provided. Province level results for intermediate indicator one are shown in
Figure 53. Agricultural services are defined as all the services provided by MAL and other
service providers including receiving agricultural advice from MAL officers and any training,
demonstrations, workshops, trials or other new activities or developments in agriculture in this
village within the past four years. Overall, 49% of villages received agricultural services from
MAL. Agricultural service provision is lowest in Western province (38%) and highest in Malaita
(59%).

As mentioned previously, an issue with this measure is the percentage of villages receiving a
service is defined from the household survey. In most cases some villagers reported receiving a
service while others did not. To overcome this, for each village, we tallied the total number of
responses which indicated that they received a MAL service. If this tallied number was more
than 50 % of the total number of respondents in that village, then the village was classified as
having received a MAL service. However, it could be argued that if at least one household
receives an agricultural service in a village then that village has received a service. Using this
metric, only four villages (2 in Malaita, 1 in Choiseul and 1 in Western) do not receive any MAL
services. This represents over a 95% MAL service coverage, significantly larger than the 49% rate
reported above. These results infer, that MAL service coverage is wide, nearly all surveyed
villages receive at least some MAL service, however within each village only a small proportion
are involved in agricultural services.

households received a service are classified as receiving a MAL service. It is also important to note that these
results are almost identical to the results at the household level.



All householders were asked if there had been any new developments such as training,
demonstrations, workshops and trials in agriculture in their village in the past 12 months. 22
Similar to the baseline, there was considerable inconsistency in responses at the village level. In
85% of villages, results were contradictory with some households saying ‘yes’ to the survey, while
others in the same village saying ‘no’. This suggests that many villagers may not be aware of the
methods used by their neighbours and further, participation in consultations was limited.

Table 45 shows that the proportion of households that reported new developments and activities
in their village increased by 146%, on average, throughout all provinces. The results were largest
in Choiseul and Malaita where new developments in agricultural increased by 150% and 350%,
respectively. These results may be, in part, driven by an increasing spill-over of knowledge of
agricultural activities in villages, however changes are also likely due to an increasing number of
activities and developments.

Those who said there had been new developments in agriculture were asked to indicate who had
funded the developments (see Table 52). In over 85% of cases, new developments, such as
training and workshops, were run by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL). This is a
significant improvement from the baseline where, on average, 53% of households indicated new
activities were carried out by the Ministry. Breaking down changes at the province level, Choiseul
and Western had the largest increase in new activities implemented by MAL. The large increase
in MAL activities coincides with a decrease in new developments implemented by NGO’s and
other private donors. The proportion of households receiving training and other developments
by NGOs declined by 65% while other private donors decreased agricultural activities by, on
average, 30%.

7.2.2) Consultation
All household respondents were asked if anyone from their household had participated in
consultations with MAL. Figure 54 shows that overall 17.6% of respondents said ‘yes’ in the
follow-up survey compared to 10.6% in the baseline. Households in Choiseul were most likely
to have joined a consultation (19.5%) and those in Temotu least likely (11.85%). This pattern is
interesting, especially in Malaita where MAL increased consultations by, on average, 462.67%, a
significant increase and now it has the highest consultation rate of all the provinces. Such a large
increase in a relatively short period should be looked at as a lesson for other provinces.

Of those that took part in community consultation, on average, 78% of baseline households
described their needs and priorities to MAL, compared to 64% in the follow-up survey. This is a
decrease of 18.5% and shows that communities are less likely to make suggestions to the
Ministry. This decrease can be explained, at least partially, by the large increase in the total
number of households that took part in consultation with MAL in the follow-up survey
compared to the baseline.

priorities to MAL, these suggestions are likely to be acted upon 57% of the time. This is an
increase of 58% from 36% in the baseline. These results should be taken with caution due to the
low response rates, as the results may be biased. Also household responses differ within villages,
suggesting responses were not always disseminated throughout a village and thus participation in
consultations was somewhat limited.




7.1.2) Changes in farming practices

As seen in Figure 50, on average, farming methods have changed in 40% of households, and
these changes are, in part, due to the RDP in addition to other NGOs and governments.
Changes in farming methods are wide-ranging, as shown in Table 46. Fertilizer and herbicide
usage decreased, on average, by 32% and 100%, respectively in the surveyed households while
pesticides saw a small increase in take up.

Changes in irrigation and drainage declined by 26% and 58%, respectively to zero percentage for
all surveyed households expect those in Western province. This decline in take up, albeit from a
low base, may in part be due to the large initial costs of the change, or because irrigation is less
important in wet environments. The largest changes in agricultural methods were seen in
cultivation in which close to 21% of households changed methods in this area, an increase of
300%. Similar changes in soil improvements, crop varieties and livestock were seen in all
provinces (on average, 30% of households changed their practices in these areas).

7.2.1) Type of Advice Sought
All householders were asked if they had received advice from MAL in the past 12 months. Those
that responded ‘yes’ were then asked to indicate the type of advice they received.

Figure 56 reports these results. Responses were diverse, with categories often not being mutually
exclusive. The crop category consists of households who received advice specifically about crop
varieties or crop management. Training refers to any unspecified training undertaken by MAL.
Responses in this category include “how to use the right tool for farming” to ‘workshop on how
to grow cabbages’. The largest category, planting, refers to how to plant agricultural crops
including pruning and planting seeds. The second last category, soil, refers directly to advice
about soil type including managing and improving soil fertility while livestock includes advice on
livestock, such as pigs and poultry.

The results show that advice on cocoa is relatively stable and makes up around 20% of advice
disseminated. Advice on training, crops and soil all increased markedly, ranging from 200%
(crops) to 94% (soil). As mentioned, the largest group is planting which makes up over 50% of
advice received, with the majority of advice being ‘how to plant ‘ and ‘how to prune’. Livestock
advice declined from 17% to 10% of the advice received. This suggests that villagers are mostly
concerned with agricultural activities rather than livestock or perhaps MAL programs are more
likely to focus on agricultural activities. Finally, as shown and mentioned in Error! Reference

7.3.1) Food Security
An important issue directly related to food production is food security. All households were
asked whether their household food supply was adequate. This variable was converted into a
‘yes’/’no’ variable, with ‘sometimes’ counted as ‘no’. On average, in the baseline, 40% of
households reported they are either sometimes unable to grow, catch, and/or buy enough food
for everybody. This is in contrast to 15% of households who reported the same in the follow-up
survey (Figure 57).

Figure 58 examines the relationship between households’ adequate food supply and advice
received from MAL. Column 2 of Table 47 reports the proportion of households that received
advice from MAL and have an adequate food supply, and the third column reports the
proportion of households that did not receive advice and have an adequate food supply. The p-
value reports the probability that the means are statistically different. The results show that in the
follow up, on average, 90% of households who received advice are able to grow, catch, and/or
buy enough food for everybody. In comparison, 85% of households that did not receive advice
have an adequate food supply. The means are statistically different, inferring households that
received advice are more likely to provide an adequate food supply for everybody in the
household.

These results are in direct contrast to Table 48 which examines the same questions for the
baseline sample. In the follow-up survey, on average, 60% of households that received advice are
able to grow, catch or buy enough food for everyone, while those that did not receive advice
have an adequate food supply 58% of the time. These means are not statistically different to each
other, implying that at the baseline, households who received MAL advice are not more likely to
have an adequate food supply.

The difference between the baseline and follow-up survey are important and need to be
examined further to identify the mechanisms driving an adequate food supply. To analyse this

                                                                                                   91
further, we run a standard Probit model which allows us to control for households and other
factors that also determine food supply. The results are reported in Table 49. The first column
in the table reports the variables used in this model. The second provides the marginal effects, in
other words, the impact of a one-unit change in a variable on the probability of having an
adequate food supply. The last column provides the p-values. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates
the variable has a statistically significant impact on having an adequate food supply.

The Probit model shows that a 1-unit increase in the probability of receiving advice leads to a
6% increase in the probability of having an adequate food supply. This is statistically significant
at the 5% level. Further, households that sold food crops are more likely to have an adequate
food supply. Specifically, an increase in the probability of selling food crops leads to a 10%
greater probability of having an adequate food supply. Differences also exist between provinces.
Malaita and Temotu are statistically more likely to be food insecure compared to Choiseul 23.
Other variables, such as MAL consultation and household factors such as the number of people
in the household, are statistically insignificant determinates of having enough food for everyone
in the household.

  Choiseul is the benchmark case that all other provinces are compared against. For example a negative marginal
effect for Temotu indicates that Temotu is less food secure compared to Choiseul.

                                                                                                                  92
In summary, these results are similar to those reported in the baseline report (see page 25). The
main difference is the impact of MAL advice. In the baseline, MAL advice was not correlated
with food security, contradictory to the results above. A number of factors could be driving this:
i) households that seek advice may be inherently different to those that don’t, for example, they
may be more motivated to improve farming practices, thus leading to more food for the
household; ii) increasing food security could also lead to an increase in the take up of advice by
MAL. The rationale underlying this is that as households have greater food security, they are
more likely to take risks and change their practices leading to a greater increase in the advice
taken up. Evidence to prove both these hypothesis is difficult as motivations and risk
preferences are often unobserved; iii) MAL advice may be leading to increased farming output,
improving food supply for the family.

To examine if this is the case, we ran a separate Probit (results not reported) including the
variable “Did the advice help your household produce more or better crops and/or livestock?”
This variable is statistically significant at the 1% level, indicating households that receive advice
and report an increase in crop output are 15% less likely to be food secure. This provides
evidence for argument iii).

7.3.2) Food Security and Markets.
Households in the Solomon Islands are predominately subsistence farmers. However, over the
last decade, this has begun to change. Of those households surveyed in the baseline, 57%
reported selling food compared to 71% of households during the follow-up survey. This is a
large increase that could have an important impact on the livelihoods of rural households. To
examine this relationship, we compare those households that received advice and sell crops. The
results are reported below.

Table 50: The proportion of households that sell crops and either received advice or
didn’t receive advice.

Table 50 shows that households that received advice are more likely to sell crops. In the baseline,
64% of those that received advice sell crops while only 56% of those that didn’t receive advice



                                                                                                  93
sell crops. A similar difference is seen in the follow up. In both cases, the difference in the mean
between those that received advice is statistically significant at the 10% level.

Table 51 shows a Probit Regression model of the correlates of households selling crops. A
household’s ability to sell crops is derived from household question H3 ‘Does this household
grow crops? (including food and cash crops such as cocoa and copra). The results show that the
gender of the survey respondent is negatively correlated with the probability of a household
selling crops. If a household sells livestock or if they have an adequate food supply, they are, on
average, more likely to sell crops. In addition, if a household attends a MAL consultation, they
are, on average, 12% more likely to sell crops. At the province level, Malaita and Temotu are
statistically less likely to sell crops compared to Choiseul.

In summary, these results are very similar to the food security analysis above and thus, the
conclusions are similar. Households that receive some MAL consultation are more likely to sell
crops. However, the results should be interpreted with caution as we are unable to ascertain a
direct causal relationship.

Section 8: Recommendations
8.1.1) Component 1: Infrastructure Services Recommandations.


 1) A clear definition of what constitutes clean water needs to be identified. This is
    important to understand whether the RDP is funding projects that provide only marginal
    improvements in water quality. Additionally, if multiple options do exist in terms of
    project choice, communities will be able to choose projects that provide the highest
    benefits to costs ratio.
 2) One of the shortcomings of the RDPs results framework is that it identifies percentage
    increases/decreases between baseline and follow up surveys only at the national level.
    We propose two additions:
    (i) We recommend that the RDP introduce targets based on overall coverage rate in
    addition to percentage improvements between baseline and follow up surveys.
    ii) We recommend the RDP creates a results framework at the province level. This will
    ensure that the improvements in basic infrastructure are equitable across all the
    provinces. The framework should be modelled on the current framework used at the
    country level.
 3) RDP projects are currently classified as community projects. However, in terms of usage
    these projects vary greatly. Some such as electricity are often user pay while others such
    as water tanks are free to use. This distinction between private and public usage projects
    needs to be made and based on these distinctions best practice strategies for improving
    outcomes in both private projects and public projects will have to be formulated.
    Experiences from similar developing countries can be consulted in developing such
    strategies.
 4) Allocation of water, especially in the dry season, is vital in ensuring the health benefits
    from most water projects. This can be done in at least two ways:
    (i)     Training: It important that RDP train communities on best practices in
            management and allocation of water resources. Given the potential of conflict it
            would be best to involve village chiefs in this process.




                                                                                            96
     (ii)    User fee: Community members could be charged a small user fee for every unit
             of water they consume. This will reduce wastage and ensure water is used only
             for purposes that generate benefits. At the same time it will also generate funds
             for maintaining quality of the water sources.



8.2) Component 1 RDP Processes- Recommendations:

  1) We find that improved participation from members of the community leads to greater
     project completion rates as well as higher quality construction. The RDP should devise
     strategies to improve participation. This is especially pertinent going forward, when most
     projects will be moving into a maintenance phase.
  2) Communities lack skills, experience and knowledge in project maintenance and
     management. It is important that those who are given responsibility (O&M committees)
     are trained and understand the importance of timely maintenance to ensure project
     sustainability.
  3) Communication and dissemination of information is identified as one of the major
     sources of community dissatisfaction with the RDP processes. For example,
     communities often do not understand the reasons behind RDPs procurement process or
     how it is implemented leading to reports of dissatisfaction. To overcome this issue CH’s
     and TL’s must ensure information is dispersed throughout the community.
  4) Connected to the previous point, villages that are further away (in terms of distance)
     from PSUs often have more issues with CHs’ and consequently lack information. RDP
     must devise a strategy to improve monitoring of these CHs’. A possible suggestion
     would be for communities to maintain log books to record CH attendance in meetings.
     This will allow the community and RDP to monitor CHs’ effort levels. In addition,
     random visits by TL’s or other monitors without prior notice will improve monitoring.
  5) We find that when women are involved in RDP processes including the SIC, projects
     implementation is more likely to be successful. In addition women’s status in the
     community improves due to participation in these processes. As a result, we would
     recommend RDP to make it mandatory for women to be included in future project
     implementation and maintenance committees.




                                                                                             97
8.3) Component 2 Recommendations:
    1.   Close to 25% of households received or asked for advice from agricultural
         officers. If households don’t receive advice their opportunities to improve
         farming practices are limited. MAL officers must therefore increase participation
         at MAL events including training and consultation.
    2.   Half of all households that receive agricultural advice do not use the information
         to change agricultural practices. However, those that do change practices are
         more than satisfied with the results. The low take up of advice may in part be
         because farmers are risk adverse and changing practices is costly. We recommend
         undertaking research into costs involved in changing farming practices to identify
         why take up of advice is limited.
    3.   Following point ii) to encourage take up of practices MAL officers should
         provide information to households on the benefit of changing practices. This
         could be in the form of posters. Alternatively, MAL should encourage
         households that have changed practices to explain the method of change in
         addition to the benefits. This could take place in meetings and consultation
         organised by MAL
    4.   To improve outreach MAL should provide passive ways through which farmers
         can reach out to them. For example, a help exchange could be set up where
         farmers from any village are able to telephone MAL officers seeking advice.
         Alternatively particular farmers from villages could be appointed by MAL to
         liaise with MAL officers. The important issue here is to provide a quick and easy
         mechanism through which advice can be sought.
    5.   Finally, as a general recommendation it is important to stress the importance of
         improving agricultural productivity in improving livelihoods. At this point in time
         most villagers do not see the link between higher yield and better livelihood
         outcomes. This is because most villages do not have access to markets nor do
         they have access to proper storage facilities. Unless an appropriate supply chain
         network is developed, whereby farmers can sell their products in big markets the
         true effect of providing agricultural advice will not be realised.




                                                                                         98
8.4) Future Methodology:
This section will provide an outline on what survey questions and methodology were successful
and subsequent recommendations.

Response rates in the community survey were relatively high, on average 85% of community
groups responded to questions. Response rates were either low or inconsistent in a number of
cases: 1) When community groups were asked to provide percentages or estimate numbers (such
as A11) 2) Open ended questions about the RDP process. For example, Community groups
were confused when asked questions about what could have been done better, as they often used
this to discuss negative or positive aspects of the program rather than provide suggestions. 3)
Response rates often declined significantly towards the end of the survey, implying the survey
may have been too long.

Response rates in the household survey were slightly lower than that of the community. On
average between 70-80% of survey questions were answered. Response rates were either low or
inconsistent in a number of similar questions: 1) Questions based on village level impacts. These
question types are difficult to interpret in household surveys due to inconsistencies, as some
households believe a service was provided to a community while others did not. 2) Questions
where households reported time to access infrastructure such as question D2 varied significantly,
in many cases reported time ranged from10 minutes to over 60 minutes to access the same
resource from the same village. 3) Questions about RDP process and implementation such as
G8-G15 were often broad categories. This lowered the power of these questions, as specific
responses were not able to be measured.

Recommendations:

    1) One of the main issues we faced with regards to assessing improvements in satisfactory
        infrastructure is that there was no set definition of satisfactory access. These terms need
        to be defined for the analysis to be objective. For example to ascertain access to
        electricity households can be asked whether they have enough electricity to power 2 light
        bulbs during the night. If RDP is indeed hesitant of using a top down approach in
        defining these terms, it can always conduct research within the community and get a
        sense of what the communities think satisfactory access should be.
    2) Another significant issue with the household survey is the lack of questions to ascertain
        household's wealth and income. Questions should be asked such as the number of
        mobile phones, type of roofing and method of cooking (i.e. gas or wood) to ascertain

                                                                                                  99
    measures of wealth. This is important as it will allow for future researchers to see the
    impact of RDP services on wealth which is a significant factor that determines poverty.
3) One of the problems with households surveys is that respondents have tendencies to
    misreport. Self-image issues, strategic deception and even plain mistakes do occur when
    answering questions. To ensure that these kinds of errors are minimised provisions for
    spot checking should be incorporated within the survey framework. For example if a
    household reports having access to electricity it would be worthwhile to actually check
    whether they do.
4) Open ended questions often led to confusion and thus lead to discussions that are often
    off topic. These questions need to be more focused. For example individual questions
    about SIC procurement process should be asked rather than asking respondents to
    describe the benefits and drawbacks of SIC procurement process.
5) It is general practice in health questionnaires to have multiple shorter recall periods. It is
    also customary to ask further questions to check for robustness. For example, to
    ascertain whether any children health, it is customary to ask the primary caregiver
    whether the child (to be called out by his/her name) was sick (by mentioning symptom)
    in the last two days? Followed up by robustness questions on prevalence of the sickness
    yesterday and today?
6) The health section in this survey was very poorly designed. There was very few
    questions on hygiene practices which is a important factor that affects overall health of
    households. In future evaluations which most likely will try to quantify health
    improvements, having a well thought out section on getting information hygiene
    behaviour would be vital.
7) Quantify improvements in access to infrastructure. Provide participants with the
    information that very satisfied with water access is the same as rating access between 8-
    10 out of 10. While satisfied is equivalent to 5-7 out of 10, and not satisfied is equivalent
    to rating access less than 5/10.
8) Questions regarding water sources should identify the quality of these water sources. In
    other words, respondents should also be asked if water sources are ever polluted, or if
    the water source is covered (such as a bore hole). This will provide better identification
    of quality.
9) School attendance questions must ask household the number of children who do not
    attend Kindy but who are eligible to attend. Without this question, it is difficult to infer
    the proportion of students that attend Kindy.


                                                                                             100
10) Community leader surveys provide more consistent and higher order responses to those
   questions about community infrastructure. Community leader surveys should be used
   when community access and infrastructure is of interest rather than only household
   surveys.




                                                                                        101
Appendix 1:

Session Logs
All evaluation teams took notes on key RDP observations and discussions with community
members. Summaries of key issues are provided below24.

Choiseul
In a number of communities, respondents were unsure how projects are prioritized by the
communities and then how they are ranked and chosen by the WDC.

Enumerators found that communities that were unhappy with the SIC were unwilling to publicly
criticize the committee. Therefore, questions based on the SIC may be underestimates of how
satisfied community members are with the committee.

According to enumerators, the distribution of information is a key issue. In some villages,
community members were unsure of RDP’s role.

Malaita
In general, RDP issues often arose because of poor communication between the CH and the
community. For example, Sulugwalu and Foufu communities did not generally understand the
RDP implementation process. Sulugwalu, in particular, complained that the selection of SIC was
done by the CH without the knowledge of many villagers.

-In Kikiri, a rain water tank was built. Community members were generally happy with the
project but were unable to manage the water supply and complain about the people who waste
the limited amount of water in the water tank.

Temotu:
In general, the procurement process was communities main issue. Materials often took months
to arrive in Lata and villagers were often not updated on the current status. For example, the
Malapu community were unhappy with the procurement process, believing they should be able
to collect their own materials.

Another important observation was the differences between the Reef Islands and Santa Cruz.
Distance and basic infrastructure on the Reef significantly increased the time it took to complete

a project. This is likely one of the main reasons why close to 70% of projects on the Reef are
reported as incomplete.

In general, community members in the Reef Islands were more unhappy with CHs compared to
those communities in Santa Cruz. This, in part, may be due to monitoring. CHs in the Reef
Islands were monitored less often compared to Santa Cruz, increasing free riding by the CHs .
