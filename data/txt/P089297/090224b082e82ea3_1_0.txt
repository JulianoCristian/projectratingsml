Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 At the time of the project closing date, more than 300 small-scale infrastructure subprojects were completed providing more than 225,000 beneficiaries
 (more than half of the rural population) with access to improved education, health care, water supply, and other priority rural services. The project will
 fall short of its target of 300,000 rural beneficiaries due to approximately 20% of subprojects being incomplete at the time of the project closing
 date. Support for the completion of these subprojects will be provided through the next phase of RDP support, RDP II. Satisfaction with the services
 received and their targeting of community needs is very high. Nearly 37,000 farmers have also been provided with agricultural services (advice and
 training), leading many to improve their practices and productivity. In addition, 58 business received project grants that helped leverage about six times
 as much in private sector financing to invest in building businesses that benefit owners and employees and serve rural populations.
 An Implementation Completion Report will be completed by August 31, 2015. A mission to facilitate preparation of this Report is planned for the first two
 weeks of June 2015.
