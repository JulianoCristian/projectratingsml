Islands were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:  the\n            evaluation of the rural development program evaluation found\n            that RDP has significantly contributed to women\u2019s\n            empowerment. Community leader groups that were surveyed for\n            the evaluation stated that the project enabled women to\n            influence decision-making more than other community\n            projects. Over 50 percent of those surveyed reported that\n            the project processes encouraged women to be more active in\n            their communities. The project SIC membership was often the\n            first major community responsibility of the women involved.\n            In 81 percent of villages surveyed, the community leader\n            groups reported that women on the sub-project implementation\n            committees participated more in village activities than\n            before joining the SIC. Close to all community leader groups\n            reported that being in the SIC increased the status of the\n            female members. Thus women\u2019s involvement in decision-making\n            bodies such as the SICs and ward development committees can\n            empower women and provide a platform for broader community\n            engagement and leadership."}, "docdt": "2015-12-19T01:09:02Z"}
