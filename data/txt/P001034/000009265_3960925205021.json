The project achieved\n            some of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was partially successful, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was marginally satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, at the time of appraisal, closer\n            attention needs to be given to accurate assessment of work\n            volume and definition of realistic and appropriate physical\n            standards. Second, detailed engineering studies should be\n            available before credit effectiveness to allow an early\n            start-up of the project. Third, detailed terms of reference\n            for training should be prepared in order to implement an\n            adequate training program and be able to assess its\n            execution. Fourth, more resources should be allocated by the\n            Bank for supervision. Fifth, the impact of a significant\n            change in the political, economical, and financial situation\n            of the country on the project should be assessed and the\n            project should be redefined on the basis of this assessment.\n            Sixth, detailed review of documents and rigorous adherence\n            to the Bank's procurement guidelines do not in\n            themselves guarantee a good performance of the contractor.\n            Finally, setting up new institutions or reforming existing\n            ones requires careful and time-phased design of components."}, "docdt": "1993-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
