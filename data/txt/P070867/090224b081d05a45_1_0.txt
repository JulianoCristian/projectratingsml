                         Overall aspects: the project performance and implementation pace is good. The project performance is moderately satisfactory due to: (i) the impact on livelihood of the activities

                         supported by the Component 2: Promotion of Integrated Ecosystem Management Practices should be measured and documented; (ii) the success of subprojects for rehabilitation of
                         degraded areas was affected by Brazil's worst drought in 30 years; and, (iii) disbursements of the 86% of the GEF resources.

                         Component 1: Institutional and Policy Support for Integrated Ecosystem Management

                               Subcomponent 1.1: Participatory Institutional and Policy Framework for Integrated Ecosystem Management - Ceara has done important policy reforms. Actually Ceara is a
                         model for rethinking Caatinga issues and trying to mainstream into public policies. Performance indicator target of number of policies fulfilled 133%

                                Subcomponent 1.2: Integrated Management of Protected Areas - This subcomponent is moving forward, studies for the creation of new protected areas are under execution,
                         but there is still unfavorable political climate in the federal and state governments for creation of new protected areas, particularly those with strict protection. As consequence, the
                         creation of new protected areas is still behind schedule.

                              Subcomponent 1.Development of Institutional Capacity and Knowledge for Integrated Ecosystem Management - Overall this subcomponent has been effectively used for
                         educational outreach, training events and technical assistance.

                         Component 2: Promotion of Integrated Ecosystem Management Practices - 132 subprojects in both states were supported. Performance indicator target of number of subprojects
                         fulfilled 88%. 13% of the subprojects are closed, 33% have completed their technical activities and their financial reports are under preparation, and 54% of the subprojects are still
                         being implemented.

                         Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation, and Project Management - Project management and administration is moderately satisfactory.

                         Audit: The audit report received on May 13, 2013 from Tribunal de Contas do Estado da Bahia- TCE/BA corresponds to the year ended December 31, 2012 and was considered
                         acceptable by the Bank. Risk ratings for both FM and PROC remain unchanged and there are no issues.

                         Safeguards: Bank specialists for environment and social safeguards supervised these aspects of the project in April 2013. There are no compliance issues.
