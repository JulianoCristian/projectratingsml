                         The project's global environmental objective and its development objective are the same: to contribute to the preservation, conservation, and sustainable
                         management of the biodiversity of the Caatinga in the states of Bahia and Ceara, while improving the quality of life of its inhabitants, through the introduction of
                         sustainable development practices.

                         The main findings of the Mid-Term Review is that the project was correctly designed, responds to priority questions, and despite its small size is already yielding important synergistic
                         results including positive impacts on public policies for the caatinga biome, establishing multiple partnerships, and effectively mobilizing local populations to adopt integrated
                         ecological management methodologies through replicable demonstration subprojects. Examples include a new state PA law, a new municipal environment quality law and effective

                         While the project accomplished considerable technical achievements and disbursements improved in 2010 (67% of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and counterpart
                         resources in the 2010 Annual Operating Plan were contracted), overall disbursements are still behind (by the end of 2010 which is Year 3 the accumulated project execution is only
