1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1. The Caatinga comprises an area of approximately 844,000 km2, or about 11 percent of the
national territory. It extends throughout the States of Piauí, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba,
Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia and Minas Gerais. Rainfall is irregular in terms of
temporal and spatial distribution; rivers are intermittent; and soils located on top of crystalline
rocks are shallow, resulting in significant and quick surface runoff. Droughts are a frequent and
normal characteristic of the Caatinga.
2. The States of Bahia and Ceará were selected as project sites since together they encompass
about 50 percent of the biome (70 percent of Ceará’s and 50 percent of Bahia’s live within its
boundaries). The governments of both states were interested in addressing biodiversity issues
and ecosystem management, and the Caatinga was one of their top priorities.
3. The Project was aligned with the Global Environment Facility’s (GEF) Multi-Focal Area
through Operational Program (OP) 12, Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM), by
contributing to the long-term protection of Brazil’s globally important ecosystems and the
uniqueness of the Caatinga Biome. In keeping with IEM Strategic Priority 1 (IEM-SP1), the
Project was aimed at providing capacity building and technical assistance to strengthen the
policy, regulatory, and market frameworks for environmental protection, while at the same time
strengthening the institutions and information systems needed to support IEM approaches. The
project design also conformed to the IEM-SP2 by promoting on-the-ground investments to
implement IEM approaches within specific protected areas and natural landscapes. The Project
also contributed to: (i) the preservation and conservation of the Caatinga’s globally significant
biodiversity, consistent with the Biodiversity Focal Area and (ii) the reduction of land
degradation and desertification, consistent with the Land Degradation Focal Area. The Project
was also in line with the GEF’s Strategic Priorities of “Mainstreaming Biodiversity” (BD-SP2)
and “Implementation of Sustainable Land Management Practices” (SLM-SP2).
4. The Project was fully aligned with the environmental development objectives (DO) of the
Bank’s Brazil 2000-2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which emphasized the need for
priority actions in environmental and natural resources management and the protection of fragile
ecosystems3.
1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators
5. For this Project, the PDO and GEO were the same. For purposes of this ICR, “PDO” refers to
the objectives of both the Bank and the GEF. The PDO was “to contribute to the preservation,
conservation, and sustainable management of the biodiversity of the Caatinga Biome in the
Project States, while improving the quality of life of its inhabitants, through the introduction of
sustainable practices.”

  The project PAD (page 13, footnote 6) erroneously cites the Bank’ s Country Strategy for this Project. The Project was designed
under the 2000-2002 CAS.



                                                               1
6. According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), key PDO indicators were:
        Integrated Ecosystem Management and biodiversity considerations mainstreamed in 6
         sectoral policies or plans by participating states (GEF SP2 tracking tool).
        6 existing PROBIO protected areas (150,184 hectares) are consolidated, with improved
         management effectiveness compared to baseline (GEF SP1 tracking tool).
        2 new areas (60,000 hectares) of PROBIO priority areas created by the state of Bahia
         under specific SNUC/IUCN criteria.
        Two new RPPNs (Private Natural Heritage Reserve) established by the state of Ceará.
        20% of degraded lands as measured by vegetation cover, in the project areas have been
         rehabilitated when compared with baseline.
        Communities implementing production-related subprojects show 15% improvement in
         their income compared to similar rural productive activities.
1.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
7.   Not applicable. PDO and indicators were not revised.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
8. Public beneficiaries included the State Governments of Bahia and Ceará as well as a number
of public and private institutions with jurisdiction over elements of environmental management
and social development (including the Federal Ministry of Environment, protected area
administrations, water and land managers, and managers of a number of public/private programs
and projects related to local development and agricultural issues, among others).
9. Communities and community associations and civil society associations were anticipated to
benefit mainly from Project Component 2, which provided funding for the implementation of
approximately 150 subprojects4. Both states included communities and community associations
as eligible beneficiaries of subproject investments. Groups of particular interest included
indigenous peoples and quilombos5; the gender dimension was specifically considered, aiming
towards active gender equality in Project implementation.
10. Support was provided to the meetings of civil research associations and networks. Municipal
governments that were enrolled to actively participate in the beneficiary selection processes,
gained experience in managing IEM practices with a supervisory role.
1.5 Original Components
11. Component 1: Institutional and Policy Support for Integrated Ecosystem Management (GEF
US$3.24 million), was designed to strengthen the institutional and policy frameworks required to
improve the environmental management and conservation of the Caatinga Biome. This
component targeted local institutions committed to IEM and conservation of the Caatinga, and
provided new or strengthened existing policy mechanisms, especially for state government


4
  The PAD’s main text and component description stated that 200 subprojects were to be implemented. However, the PAD’s
Results Framework (Annex 3) only included 150 subprojects as the relevant Intermediate Outcome Indicator. Project
implementation, M&E and bank supervision consistently applied the 150 subprojects figure, which is also used in this ICR.
5
  Quilombos are descendants of fugitive Africans, brought as slaves to Brazil, who have lived together in the same locality
and are linked by community bonds.

actors. Component 1 directly aimed at fulfilling the “contribute to the […] sustainable
management of the biodiversity” portion of the PDO.
12. Component 2: Promotion of Integrated Ecosystem Management Practices (GEF US$5.1
million), was allocated slightly more than half the GEF contribution, and focused primarily on
developing and implementing approximately 150 IEM subprojects. These subprojects essentially
represented the primary field intervention of the Project, both from biodiversity conservation and
human livelihood perspectives. Subprojects were organized in six categories of activities: (i)
rehabilitation of degraded areas; (ii) conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; (iii) water
and land resources management; (iv) development of sustainable and cost-effective productive
systems; (v) cultural and social development; and, (vi) fostering environmental incentives.
Component 2 was directly related to achieving the PDO section on “improving the quality of life
of Caatinga’s inhabitants, through the introduction of sustainable practices”.
13. Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation, and Project Management (GEF US$ 1.66 million),
included not only standard Project M&E, but also aimed towards building solid monitoring,
evaluation and management structures in both states where the Project was to be implemented.
Two separate but coordinating management teams (MT) were established, once in each state. For
actual biodiversity M&E the Project decided on the use of GEF’s Biodiversity Tracking Tools.
Planned Project funding for Component 3 amounted to 16.6 percent of the GEF contribution; this
relatively high amount was due to the need for developing a duplicate M&E system (one for each
MT in each state). Even so, State Governments were expected to provide twice the GEF
contribution for this component in additional financing.
1.6 Revised Components
14. Not applicable. Project components were not revised.
1.7 Other significant changes
15. No other changes beyond the restructuring previously mentioned did occurred.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
16. Project discussions began in early 2000 between the Bank and the States of Bahia and Ceará.
Initial and revised project concepts were completed by February 2001, but a GEF PDF-B request
was only endorsed by the Brazilian Government and submitted to the GEF for project
development funding in 2004. It took the proponents another three years until a PAD was ready
for appraisal; once approved, the Project became effective in September 2007.
17. From initial concept stage until its revised EOP date of October 31, 2013, the project was
under the umbrella of four Bank CAS for Brazil (2000-2002, which provided the initial
background for project design; 2003-2007; 2008-2011; and 2012-2015, which has been used to
rate the relevance of objectives at EOP). Due to the normal duration of Bank projects (between 4
and 5 years), preparation and implementation under multiple CAS is not unusual. However, in
this particular case 13 years elapsed between initial discussions and the conclusion of the project,
a fact that during the drafting of the ICR raised questions about the continuous relevance of the
project and the rationale for Bank intervention as compared to the country’s context at initial
design stages. While relevance of objectives is discussed separately in section 3 of this ICR, a
review of all four CAS showed that, albeit under somewhat different formulations, the

                                                 3
sustainable management of Brazil’s (and particularly the country’s Northeast’s) biodiversity,
poverty alleviation and improved water and land management remained consistent Bank
development objectives for the country and therefore sufficiently justified ongoing Bank
involvement.
18. Project and subproject sites were carefully evaluated, and priorities for intervention were
established based on PDF B-funded and external social and scientific research. As described in
the Project concepts, PDF B documents, pre-PAD Project brief and Executive Summary6, this
period provided plenty of opportunities for the Project proposal to be extensively discussed with
public and private federal, regional and local stakeholders, including a large number of potential
beneficiaries and executing agencies in both states. This and the fact that the PDO remained
relevant throughout a 13-year timeframe, have led to consider Project Preparation Satisfactory.
19. The Project had a compound PDO with three outcomes: “to contribute to (i) the preservation,
(ii) conservation, and (iii) sustainable management of the biodiversity of the Caatinga Biome in
the states of Bahia and Ceará”. One major output was also included (“improving the quality of
life of its inhabitants”), as well as a key activity for implementation (“the introduction of
sustainable practices”). Final Project design included six PDO indicators that only partially
reflected the outcomes mentioned above: while direct measurements of outcome (iii) were
possible with these indicators, achievements related to the preservation and conservation of
biodiversity (outcomes i and ii) had to be inferred from other sources of information, e.g., the
successful establishment and management of protected areas or the recovery of degraded lands.
This perceived weakness in Project design was compensated by adding 11 EOP intermediate
outcome indicators (IOIs) that included specific and measurable conservation milestones (e.g.,
decrease in numbers of reported fires, number of hectares rehabilitated with riparian vegetation,
decrease in downstream sedimentation in subproject areas, number of initiatives launched to
protect endangered species, among others).
20. Project design displayed a rather high level of complexity. The fact that the Project was to be
implemented in two states, each with its own land, water and conservation management
structures, required a duplication of technical management structures and an additional layer of
coordination, monitoring and evaluation. The Project included 150 subprojects that had to be
managed on a case-by-case basis and new management approaches, added to the potential for
problems during implementation. In order to manage the Project, technical structures (the
management teams) were conceived, one in each state. The Project had 6 PDO indicators and 23
IOIs, which made Project M&E particularly challenging.
21. The Project’s main public and private actors were highly committed to the Project’s
successful implementation. All four Bank CASs, the PDO and the overall Project design not only
reflected Bank and GEF policy but were also aligned with Brazil’s, Bahia’s and Ceará’s various
sustainable development policy documents and frameworks. The Project design could have
benefited from a more realistic assessment of the State counterparts’ true capabilities as opposed
to the level of official enthusiasm displayed prior implementation.

22. During restructuring only modest changes to operational budgets were required, mainly as a
result of the one-year extension granted for EOP. Safeguards were properly assessed and
managed during Project design. The Bank’s operational policies 4.10 and 4.12 were triggered.
23. The Project’s risk assessment framework has been considered the single major design flaw
that contributed to the need for the Bank and the recipient (Fundação Luis Eduardo Magalhães,
FLEM) having to do major efforts to keep the Project on track after a less-than-ideal first half.
24. For a Project with the design complexity, to be implemented in the Brazilian biome that is
(climatically speaking) the most vulnerable and susceptible to desertification biome, the risk
assessment lacked the necessary depth of analysis to provide realistic mitigation measures and
corresponding risk ratings. The assessment:
   Acknowledged the weak institutional capacity of State actors, but failed to recognize the
    difficulties in bringing them up to the standards required for successful implementation.
   Failed to adequately assess possible difficulties for achieving proper coordination and
    continuity; changes in staff at state levels were not considered at all in the risk assessment,
    which resulted in unexpected (but in theory foreseeable) regional policy changes and lengthy
    learning curves to convince new staff to continue with Project activities and interventions
    initiated by their predecessors. In a fact, “political commitment” was expressly not
    considered a risk in the PAD.
   Acknowledged the possibility of economic disruptions, but fell short of evaluating the
    various scenarios that could cause these disruptions, which in turn would have required more
    specific mitigation measures and risk assessments.
   Did not include climate variability7 as one of the major risks. Designing and implementing
    innovative land and water management mechanisms and technologies as a response to
    drought were part of the activities included in the PAD. The final Project evaluation report
    produced by the client in October of 2013 also noted that the risk assessment framework
    missed to consider climate variability8.
25. In 2010 the semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil was hit by what is considered one of the
worst droughts in the past decades, affecting about 10.6 million people. In 2011, 56
municipalities in Bahia and 13 in Ceará were placed under a state of emergency; by 2013 all
municipalities included in the Project were under emergency status as well. The impact of this
drought has been considered by the Implement Agencies, Recipient, and the Bank supervision
team in various ISRs and during the Project’s Midterm Review (MTR) as one of the factors that
negatively impacted the Project during the second half of its implementation.
26. The Project’s design and quality at entry met the theoretical requirements with sufficient
detail to reasonably achieve the PDO, although some design flaws required indirect M&E
approaches during implementation. The risk assessment framework was lacking; during
implementation the Bank supervision team and the local implementing partner were able to

compensate for most of the Project’s overall design shortcomings, albeit not without significant
efforts. As a result, the Project design and quality has been rated as Moderately Satisfactory
2.2 Implementation
27. According to the ISRs and Aide-Memoires, implementation was hampered by three main
factors that, despite ongoing supervision and efforts by the Bank and implementation agencies,
ultimately contributed to the low level of achievement of certain project outcomes:
   Issues with interagency coordination and communication as well as a lack of understanding
    of the Project by stakeholders created major delays during the first two years of
    implementation. In Bahia, where high staff turnover and varying degrees of institutional
    commitment to the Project were recurrent, implementation did not progress as expected.
   Absence of an initial baseline of degraded areas and of subproject beneficiaries’ income did
    not allow the proper M&E of two project indicators. By EOP, the late development of
    baseline data implied that a complete measurement of project progress was not possible.
   The onset of a severe drought in 2010 placed additional pressure on local implementing
    agencies and partners that were already stretched thin by the efforts to mitigate the drought’s
    impact. This ICR assesses of the effects of this event on overall project performance. In fact,
    the drought affected the implementation and outcomes.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
     2.3.1 M&E Design
28. The Project contained a Results Framework that included six PDO indicators and a number
of IOIs. To varying degrees depending on individual indicators, the framework reflected the
wide range of proposed Project interventions and activities. Direct measurement of the outcome
related to contributing “to the sustainable management of the biodiversity of the Caatinga Biome
in the States of Bahia and Ceará” was possible with these indicators; however, progress related to
the “preservation” and “conservation” of biodiversity (PDO Outcomes i and ii) had to be inferred
from the results provided by the IOIs. Arrangements for results monitoring were described in
detail and provided, under ideal conditions, an adequate vehicle for M&E.
29. Two of the six PDO indicators of the Results Framework were converted into IOIs in the
“Arrangements for Results Monitoring” table. This apparent error was then carried over to the
ISRs, where it remained until EOP. This was considered an error because no documentary
explanation has been found to justify this change. The ISRs also tracked only four of the 23 IOIs
originally included in the PAD, and none of these four allowed for direct measurements of
progress toward the preservation and conservation of biodiversity.
30. Two IOIs (dealing with the measurement of reductions in downstream sedimentation and the
establishment of corridors within 1,200 ha of land under conservation-friendly use) were
removed by the client following discussions with the Bank during the 2010 MTR. Although the
explanations provided were relatively satisfactory, a discussion of measures to compensate for
these missing indicators9 could not be found.


9
  Aquino’s final project evaluation report (2013, page 29) suggested that after the removal of these IOIs, adjustments
to PFO indicators 5 and 6 would have been appropriate.


                                                          6
31. A discrepancy - related to the way in which a key indicator was drafted and measured - was
detected. Key indicator six, which deals with measuring the increase in income among target
communities, was redrafted and its measurement approach was changed in the Project’s Grant
Agreement (GA) as compared to the original PAD version. However, project ISRs maintained
the original PAD version throughout the Project’s life, while for the ICR the client used the GA
version. Thus, this indicator was not used for project evaluation purposes, because there would
appear to be a lack of consistency between ISR and field reporting.
32. It is considered that the M&E design had weaknesses that were not properly addressed during
the rather lengthy period of Project preparation and at entry. Two have already been mentioned:
(i) difficulties in achieving proper coordination and buy-in of Project requirements; and (ii) the
lack of PDO indicators to directly measure progress toward the achievement of part of the PDO.
Some of the PDO indicators and IOIs lacked baseline values; this was especially the case in
biodiversity conservation-related indicators. The collection of baseline information was expected
to be one of the main activities for Project year 1. However, baseline values were not available
until later during Project implementation.
33. The lack of baseline information was considered an important design flaw. The Project
preparation teams (both on the client and Bank sides) had seven years to produce a sound M&E
system based on available information. In fact, GEF PDF B financing approved in 2004 was,
among others aspects, specifically aimed at designing “appropriate baseline studies and
indicators for selected sites“ and establishing “indicators and a monitoring and evaluation plan to
detect environmental, physical, ecological, and socioeconomic changes induced by Project
actions”. A properly designed M&E system at appraisal should not have needed to rely on ‘zero’
baseline values (unless something was to be created from scratch, as was the case of the new
protected areas). The M&E design performance has been rated Unsatisfactory.
           2.3.2 M&E Implementation
34. Despite the overall design flaws, where indicators and baseline values did exist and the
system was applied according to the PAD’s guidelines, the Project did an admirable job of
collecting accurate and relevant data. Thus, the M&E of individual subprojects generated large
quantities of information. Bank ISRs, mission reports and internal subproject progress reports
provided extensive examples of different levels of achievement that allowed FLEM and
implementation agencies to adjust component and subproject execution. An indicator report
produced by FLEM as part of the project’s closure process provided detailed descriptions of
indicator achievement with supporting data10. M&E implementation was hampered by problems
related to the overall delays in Project implementation previously discussed, although the impact
on actual (but limited) data collection and quality was not considered significant. M&E
implementation performance has been rated Moderately Satisfactory.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
35. The Project had no safeguard and fiduciary compliance issues. ISRs throughout the Project
life consistently rated safeguard compliance as Satisfactory, a rating with which this ICR agrees
because there is no evidence that any of the safeguards triggered ware handled in an

inappropriate manner. Financial management and procurement were regularly reviewed and
audited. Beyond minor shortcomings that did not affect Project implementation, no issues were
identified. Fiduciary compliance was consistently rated as Satisfactory by the ISRs, a rating
with which this ICR agrees.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
36. The Project does not include post-completion operations of Project investments.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


37. Preliminary Project conceptualization began in early 2000 and continued through various
design phases until Project appraisal and approval in 2007. Project implementation began in
2007 and closed in late 2013. This means that the Project was designed and implemented under
the frameworks of GEF replenishments 2 to 5; Bank CAS/CPS 2000-2002, 2003-2007, 2008-
2011, and 2012-2015; and Brazil’s national development policies. In addition, GEF
replenishment 6 will begin on June 1 of 2014.
38. Since 2012, the Ministry Environment (MMA) and the Brazilian Climate Change Fund have
being investing to support initiatives for the creation and management of protected areas. The
First Caatinga Regional Conference was held in 2012, during the United Nations Conference on
Sustainable Development (Rio +20), which formalized the commitments to be undertaken by
Federal and State Governments, parliaments, the private sector, civil society, local community
associations, and academic for the promotion of this biome sustainable development.
39. One of the four strategic objectives of the Bank’s current Brazil CPS for 2012-2015 is to
“improve the sustainable management of natural resources and enhance resilience to climatic
shocks while maximizing contributions to local economic development, and helping to meet
rising global food demand.” The PDO remains Highly relevant to the Banks country strategy.
40. The Project was developed under GEF 2 guidelines as a multifocal initiative under
Operational Program (OP) 12: Integrated Ecosystem Management. The Project was considered
to contribute toward the GEF’s Strategic Priorities of “Mainstreaming Biodiversity” (BD-SP2)
and “Implementation of Sustainable Land Management Practices” (SLM-SP2). OP12 was
reviewed in 2005 and multifocal approaches were discontinued for GEF 4. By the time this ICR
was completed, GEF 6 had already begun (as of June 1, 2014). PDO relevance has been
compared against GEF 6 Programming Directions11. Of these, the Project’s PDO contributes
directly to: (i) all four biodiversity goals (to improve sustainability of protected area systems,
reduce threats to biodiversity, sustainably use biodiversity, and mainstream conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity into production landscapes/seascapes and sectors); (ii) climate
change goal two (to promote conservation and enhancement of carbon stocks in forest, and other
land use, and support climate smart agriculture); and, (iii) land degradation main goal (to arrest

and reverse current global trends in land degradation, specifically desertification and
deforestation, by promoting good practices conducive to Sustainable Land Management). As a
result of GEF 6’s new program priorities, the PDO remains Highly relevant.
41. In 2004, a National Action Program (Programa de Ação Nacional de Combate à
Desertificação e Mitigação dos Efeitos da Seca, PAN-Brasil) was formulated under the
sponsorship of the MMA and in cooperation with civilian society groups from the eleven states
of Brazil’s Northeast Region. PAN-Brasil mainly provides cross-cutting strategic guidelines,
e.g., for the strengthening of smallholder farming and greater sustainability in agriculture, trade,
and industry. PAN-Brasil became an official program and was incorporated in the Federal
Government’s Pluriannual Plan (Plano Plurianual, PPA) of investments, with emphasis placed
on its role in promoting the transversality of the subject of “Combating Desertification”. In 2008,
twenty institutions established the Caatinga Cerrado–Eco-Productive Communities Initiative,
which seeks to harness and encourage the gathering of experiences and references by networks,
partnerships and enterprises with regard to eco-productive practices. It has partners and
supporters in the Brazilian Federal Government, German Cooperation and NGOs. Thus, at
country level the Caatinga Biome’s conservation and the PDO remain Highly Relevant.
42. Considering the PDO’s relevance with respect to Bank, GEF and country priorities is high
and the framing of the objective allows a direct relationship with these priorities, the relevance of
Objectives has been rated       .


43. Sections 2.1 and 2.3.1 of this ICR provide a detailed description of the project design and
results framework, including perceived strengths and weaknesses and the effects these had on
overall project implementation. Overall, the Project was well researched and prepared, although
the risk assessment framework was relatively weak and failed to fully identify important issues.
Project components were linked to the PDO and proposed activities covered the range of
expected outcomes and outputs. The PDO was clearly stated and links to intermediate and final
outcomes were present, although not in the most straightforward and measurable manner. The
causal relationship between funding and outcomes was clear. The PAD included detailed
budgeting elements that demonstrated clear thinking and due diligence during project
preparation.
44. The PDO was clearly stated and links to intermediate and final outcomes were present, albeit
not in the most straightforward and measurable way conceivable. The causal relationship
between funding and outcomes was clear; in fact, the PAD included detailed budgeting elements
that demonstrated clear thinking and due diligence during project preparation. The results
framework could have been better organized and have included results specifically aimed at
contributing towards the biodiversity preservation and conservation section of the PDO.
45. Overall project design was considered Satisfactory because its weaknesses were not
critically detrimental to the Project’s various levels of performance; increased efforts by the
Bank and client teams to compensate for these shortcomings were successful; and design
elements provided the enabling conditions for several major project achievements. As a result,
the Relevance of Design has been rated Substantial.




                                                 9
3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
46. The Project had a compound PDO with three outcomes: “to contribute to (i) the preservation,
(ii) conservation, and (iii) sustainable management of the biodiversity of the Caatinga Biome in
the states of Bahia and Ceará”. For purposes of this ICR, the three outcomes have been reviewed
and sub-rated separately. Overall PDO achievement has been rated by taking into account the
sub-ratings and the relevance of each of the individual outcomes. Given the sometimes confusing
concepts of “preserving” and “conserving” biodiversity, the PDO achievement was measure by
using universally accepted definitions and applying these to the individual Project components.
47. Preservation of the Caatinga’s biodiversity. “Preservation” was understood to reflect the
concept of “untouchability” of biodiversity and ecosystems. As a result and for purposes of this
ICR, this outcome was linked to Project component 1.2 (the establishment of protected areas)
and subprojects aimed at protecting and recovering endangered species. Other components and
outputs were fully aligned with either the conservation or sustainable management of
biodiversity and therefore did not contribute to the achievement of this particular outcome.
48. With regards to the establishment of new protected areas, two new Private Reserves Natural
Heritage (Reservas Particulares do Patrimônio Natural, RPPNs) were created in Ceará, covering
282 ha. Project activities contributed to the consolidation of 11 protected areas, a total of
366,988 ha, with improved management effectiveness compared to the baseline. (This exceeded
by five the target value of six). Studies for the creation of new protected areas were conducted in
Bahia, but there was an unfavorable political climate in the State Government for creation of new
protected areas, particularly those with strict protection. The establishment of two additional
protected areas in Bahia was never completed, because the difficulties encountered with that
state during Project implementation also prevented the achievement of this output. Although the
implementing agencies will continue the proposed protected areas creation process and reported
50 percent achievement stemming from some progress made in three prospective areas, the final
indicator is considered zero.
49. With regard to the protection and recovery of endangered species under Component 2, the
Project supported 49 subprojects focused on the recovery of degraded areas, including two
endangered flora species, and nine endemic flora species. The Bahia team carried out efforts to
reintroduce the Little Blue Macaw, also known as Spix’s Macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii) in the São
Francisco River region. The work in the Curaçá region involves DNA analysis of the captive
population, analysis of historical habitats of this macaw, and qualification of supervisory agents,
among other aspects. However, there is no consolidated information about the success of these
initiatives on flora or fauna in terms of recovery and protection of endangered species.
Considering the low level of impact achieved by these activities during the Project’s lifetime, the
achievement of this part of the PDO has been rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
50. Conservation of the Caatinga biodiversity (i.e., protection or restoration under sustainable-
use criteria) was an outcome to be achieved through various activities in Components 1 and 2.
The PDO-included output of “improving the quality of life” of the Caatinga’s inhabitants was
also considered as being mainly conducive toward achieving this outcome, because local buy-in,
participation and acknowledgement of conservation as a tool for increasing livelihood is widely
accepted as a key component of efficient natural resources management.
51. Results for this outcome were mixed. A total of 438 ha were rehabilitated in both project
states, representing 8 percent of the degraded area and 40 percent of the Project’s target value as

                                                10
per the baseline. It is important to note that the baseline value was established late in the Project,
and that the abovementioned implementation difficulties contributed to delays in creating a
proper enabling environment to successfully carry out many of the activities. According to the
client-commissioned final evaluation report by Aquino (2013), more research and longer M&E
time frames are required to properly assess success in recovery and restoration initiatives such as
those funded by the Project. A number of subprojects were highly successful and provided
technological, environmental and socioeconomic alternatives to the target communities. On the
other hand, many subprojects failed to achieve their expected targets.
52. One key issue was a severe drought that affected the Caatinga beginning in 2010. Lack of
water affected many of the subprojects, turning the communities’ and authorities’ attention away
from the Project and toward more pressing problems, and physically impacting the
implementation of some activities (especially those related to planting). The ICR team assessed
the reported impact of the drought on project outputs and considered that, although extreme
weather has the potential to disrupt any Bank intervention, in this particular case a drought (even
a severe one), which is a common feature of the Caatinga environment and one of the drivers of
this Project’s development and implementation, did not constitute a sufficiently valid argument
to fully account for the partial lack of outcome achievement. As a result of all of the above, the
achievement of this portion of the PDO has been rated Moderately Satisfactory.
53. Sustainable management of the Caatinga biodiversity was the main outcome of Project
Component 1 and one in which the ICR team believes the Project was highly successful.
Capacity building, institutional strengthening, policy development and adoption, outreach and
technological enhancement were outputs that were fully and successfully achieved. The ICR
team acknowledged the efforts made by client and Bank teams to promote the implementation of
this project component at various levels of state and local governments and community
stakeholders, resulting in the drafting and adoption of policies and strategies aimed at
implementing integrated ecosystem management (IEM). Targets were achieved or exceeded.
Besides its expected outputs, the Project was able to promote strong working partnerships among
traditionally unharmonious entities and groups and was featured in the Rio+20 Conference. In
light of the available documentary evidence provided by the client, the achievement of this
portion of the PDO has been rated Highly Satisfactory.
3.3 Efficiency
54. The economic analysis highlighted the fact that the project design itself incorporated cost-
effectiveness considerations to maximize implementation effectiveness and ensure the cost-
effective achievement of the Project’s objectives by serving as a catalyst for (i) mainstreaming
biodiversity considerations in the policy and legal frameworks of the States of Bahia and Ceará;
(ii) developing institutional capacity to support sustainable and biodiversity-friendly land
management; and (iii) promoting cost-effective and biodiversity-friendly demonstration
investments in sustainable agriculture, pasture management, and natural resources. The
economic analysis also emphasized that economic factors, together with environmental ones,
guided the Project’s design and rationale and included a full Incremental Cost Analysis.
55. At the preparation stage, the Incremental Cost Analysis considered that under the baseline
scenario (i.e., without GEF funding) there would be very limited support (an estimated US$7




                                                 11
million) for the conservation of the Caatinga’s unique biodiversity. The rate of biodiversity loss
was considered alarming12 and these losses were expected to continue at a similar or higher rate.
Land degradation, uncontrolled fires and accelerated desertification would be likely to continue.
The cost of not addressing environmental degradation would be considerably higher than the
costs of investments in sustainable land, water and biodiversity management. The GEF
alternative would achieve globally significant improvements in conserving the Caatinga’s
biodiversity and decreasing land degradation with a total incremental cost of US$23.06 million,
US$10 million of which was from the GEF. At the end of the Project’s duration, 98 percent of
the funds were disbursed in the planned period. The US$10 million GEF grant leveraged
US$19,53 million in counterpart funding to work toward providing global environmental
benefits. In the absence of this Project, the Bahia State Government would nevertheless spend
US$13,43 million and the Ceará State Government US$5,14 million on this type of project.
56. In Bahia, 1,760 families were beneficiaries of subprojects, 917 of these families benefited
directly from income improvement activities and 52 percent of grantees experienced an
improvement in their income. In Ceará, 2,145 families were beneficiaries of subprojects, 1,025
of them benefited from income improvement activities, and 48 percent experienced an
improvement in their income. For the overall project, 50 percent of grantees improved their
income compared to their conditions prior to project intervention. The main benefits estimated
refer to family income improvement from agroforestry subprojects and were achieved in three
ways: (i) productivity and sales increases; (ii) diversification of production and focus on adding
value; and (iii) less need to buy products outside the community (see Annex 3 for details).
57. The Project’s efficiency has been rated Moderately Satisfactory.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
58. The ICR team rated the Project’s overall outcome as Moderately Satisfactory. This has
been justified as follows:
        Relevance was rated Substantial. The Project’s design and objectives were highly
         relevant to the goals, intentions and context underlying the initiative.
        Efficacy was rated Moderately Satisfactory. Of the three PDO outcomes, achievement
         in one was Moderately Unsatisfactory, in another Moderately Satisfactory and in the
         third Highly Satisfactory.
        Efficiency was rated Moderately Satisfactory. Although Project funding was spent in its
         entirety and no fiduciary issues were recorded, the lack of overall outcome achievement
         prevented the Project from providing the expected or best value for the money invested.
59. The Project managed to provide significant incentives to the States of Bahia and Ceará to
continue working on improving their environmental management. The Project also offered a
number of socioeconomic alternatives to its target communities. However, the Project failed to
fully reach its objectives of preserving and conserving biodiversity.

  The native Caatinga forest cover decreased from 64 to 41 percent in the period between 1984 and 1997. Less than
1 percent of the biome was contained within protected areas and over 37 percent of the Caatinga’s numerous
endemic species were threatened.


                                                       12
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
60. No additional overarching themes, or ones previously not covered, have been identified.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant
61. The difficulties faced by the Project were not easily to overcome and that some of these
would continue. For example, quick turnover in public institutions was a problem that was not
considered to be solvable in the foreseeable future and that would likely continue to create
obstacles for smooth inter-institutional, inter-border protected area management. Changes in the
political context were less likely, since the conservation and sustainable management of the
Caatinga have been a consistent priority for successive state governments, but they may
negatively impacting the continuity of the Project’s outcomes.
62. Extreme weather and the resulting hardship, combined with insufficient options (both
socioeconomic and environmental) for the local communities are a recurrent feature of the
Caatinga, and regional and local governments and civil society stakeholders do not appear to
have a short- or medium-term solution. Brazil’s Northeast has had a prominent presence in the
Bank’s CPS/CASs, and this is not expected to change in the near future. It is very likely that
changes in the region’s political, socioeconomic and environmental context will continue to take
place.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory.
63. The Project had a number of weaknesses that stemmed from its preparation and design
phases, an inadequate M&E system, and an incomplete risk assessment framework. Many of the
problems during the first half of implementation were the result of unexpected difficulties in
making local counterparts understand the intricacies and implications of the Project and in
adequately coordinating actions across state borders.
64. The Bank did an unquestionable job in terms of its standard operational criteria, including
assessing the overall strategic relevance and approach, properly evaluating the social
development aspects, establishing adequate fiduciary and procurement guidelines and
procedures, and correctly identifying safeguard issues and responses. Better judgment and due
diligence, as well as a more in-depth analysis of the realities on the ground and a more technical
approach to conservation- and context-specific M&E could have gone a long way toward
preventing many of the later problems. Although not every contingency can be anticipated, there
are at least three key instances in which the Bank displayed unsatisfactory performance: (i) An
inadequate risk assessment was conducted, especially with regard to the possible appearance of
extreme weather (droughts); (ii) sufficient due diligence appears to have been lacking in the
assessment of the true capabilities and political context of State counterparts (from the
documentation, it appears that the risk was known but not sufficiently acted upon by the Bank);
and, (iii) the Bank could have done a much more thorough job in terms of assessing the viability
of the proposed M&E system, especially with regard to the biodiversity. After seven years of

                                               13
preparation the Bank should not have allowed a project with missing ecological baselines or
biological indicators without adequate protocols to confirm their field feasibility.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
65. The Bank and client teams did an admirable job in resolving implementation issues that
became immediately apparent once the Project began. Although the PDO was not fully achieved
as expected, project successes are the result of the efforts of these two teams. The Bank
supported the client in resolving issues with interstate cooperation and by helping with the
adoption and implementation of policy and socioeconomic activities. The Bank adequately
fulfilled its fiduciary supervisory duties. ISRs were prepared and supervision missions were held
regularly.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
66. The Bank could have been more proactive and could have displayed more technical
proficiency in terms of problems with the M&E system, especially with regard to degraded areas
and creation of protected areas. Overall, monitoring and evaluation remained the weak points
during supervision. As a result of the above, the Bank’s overall performance has been rated
Moderately Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
67. The project recipient is a nongovernmental institution, the Luis Eduardo Magalhães
Foundation (FLEM). A grant agreement was signed by the Bank and FLEM, and a technical
cooperation agreement was signed by FLEM and the Governments of Bahia and Ceará.
Technical implementation of the Project was under the overall responsibility of the States’
Management Team (MT-BA and MT-CE). The MTs were responsible for the technical
oversight, management and monitoring of Project activities.
68. In the ISRs, government performance was consistently rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
The ICR team agreed and also rated government performance as Moderately Satisfactory. This
rating reflects the elements of the governments’ performance: (i) beneficial implementation of
community subprojects and institutionalization of participatory planning and implementation
mechanisms to convince poor rural communities that environmental investments have value; (ii)
increased capacity to convene and coordinate activities, and to build networks with civil society
stakeholders; (iii) late willingness by state and local counterparts to understand and execute the
Project’s approaches; (iv) extremely slow progress throughout project implementation, and
rushed execution in the final stages, mostly due to issues with interagency coordination and
communication; (v) faulty assessment of implementation risks throughout implementation, due
to the fact that climate variability and political scenario were not addressed; and (vi) a faulty
monitoring and evaluation system that did not allow project progress to be measured adequately.

69. FLEM is a nonprofit foundation. It was declared an institution in the public interest. As the
local recipient, it carried out the Project’s fiduciary management and overall field supervision.
FLEM’s performance was consistently rated as Satisfactory by successive Bank missions and
audits. FLEM has also been credited by the ICR team as a key player in ensuring the Project’s
ongoing implementation despite many difficulties, including its role as a bridge builder among
state players who, at one point during implementation, were unwilling to work with each other
and were placing the Project at risk. The FLEM performance would have been rated Highly
Satisfactory; however, like the Bank, FLEM failed to properly identify and react in a timely
manner to some of the issues (especially with M&E) that were present at entry and then became
apparent during implementation. The FLEM’s performance has been rated Satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
70. In Bahia, three agencies were involved in project implementation: (i) the State Company
for Development and Regional Action (Companhia de Desenvolvimento e Ação Regional,
CAR); (ii) the State Secretariat of the Environment (Secretaria do Meio Ambiente, SEMA); and
(iii) the State Institute for the Environment and Water Resources (Instituto do Meio Ambiente e
Recursos Hídricos, INEMA).13 Through its offices located in targeted project areas, CAR had
favorable conditions for the implementation of subprojects. Project activities were an essential
contribution to the adoption of methodologies for integrated management of the ecosystem
within its routines. CAR’s performance is rated as Satisfactory. The participation of SEMA and
INEMA in project implementation was affected by the State’s reform of the Environmental
System, which profoundly changed its structure and reorganized its staffing. This process
affected the implementation of activities for Outcomes 1, 2 and 3. The performance of SEMA
and INEMA is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
71. In Ceará, the State Council for Environmental Policies and Management (Conselho de
Políticas e Gestão do Meio Ambiente, CONPAM) was designed as the project implementation
agency.14 CONPAM used its coordination mandates to facilitate the Project’s implementation,
with the support of the participating institutional bodies such as the Committee for the Caatinga
Biosphere Reserve and the State Council for the Environment. CONPAM managed to build
partnerships with relevant municipalities and its performance is rated as Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




13
   CAR is a public company linked to the State Secretariat of Development and Regional Integration (Secretaria de
Desenvolvimento e Integração Regional, SEDIR) with the mission of promoting regional development through socio-productive
inclusion.
14
   CONPAM’s aims are to formulate plans and implement the State Environmental Policy in a coordinated and cross -sectional
manner, thus enabling the constitutional premises of protection and conservation of the environment. CONPAM activities imply
intersectoral involvement among the various government levels (federal, state and municipal), with other authorities and with
representatives of civil society, to ensure greater efficiency.



                                                            15
72. The ICR team rated the Project’s overall borrower performance as Moderately Satisfactory.
This has been justified as follows:
      FLEM’s performance was rated Satisfactory;
      CAR performance is rated Satisfactory;
      The performance of SEMA and INEMA is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory; and
      CONPAM performance is rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
73. Bank performance left much to be desired. Despite available time and resources, lack of
quality at entry and suboptimal initial supervision were directly to blame for many of the
subsequent problems during implementation. Bank projects, at least with regard to GEF
operations, should begin with fully developed baselines and include full sets of carefully selected
indicators that have adequate protocols and have been field tested prior to effectiveness. Risk
assessment frameworks need to be taken more seriously. All risks (including climate-related
events, natural catastrophes and other similar instances, where appropriate) should be properly
assessed, and response scenarios should be evaluated and rated realistically.
74. Many of the problems that affected project performance were related to the states’ political
and sociocultural context. This is not a justification but rather a reminder that project design and
preparation need to take these variables into account, and Bank teams have the primary
responsibility of ensuring that every aspect of any given country’s culture is built into a project.
The “unexpected” during implementation is generally a result of poor planning or insufficient
due diligence; it is not acceptable for relatively large investments in which plenty of time and
resources have been available during the preparation phase.
75. Despite its shortcomings, the Project demonstrated that subgrants channeled through
properly supervised subprojects and implemented by local stakeholders are a highly effective
means of achieving project outputs. This, as well as a strong recipient (in this case, FLEM), with
strong coordination ties to the Bank team and close fiduciary supervision, have proven to be a
successful implementation arrangement.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

76. The ICR team held a meeting with implementing agencies and the recipient on June 10,
2014, in Salvador, to present and discuss the draft ICR. In addition, the following comments
were received:
      It was registered the inexistence of cartographic bases aiming the recovery of degraded
       areas, during the preparation phase of the Project. In the state of Ceará, during the
       implementation phase, high resolution images were acquired. Land use mapping and soil
       occupation in the scales of 1:10,000 and 1:100,00 were carried out, generating maps and
       atlas, produced by CONPAN and FUNCEME in 2009, which served as baseline for the
       calculation of the areas to be recovered and closing the data gap previously existent in the
       direct intervention area of the Project;
      Regarding the Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) of the subprojects, a system for
       monitoring and controlling of contracts and subgrants was implemented by the PMUs,
       fed by the respective Management Units, supporting the financial management of FLEM;

                                                16
   Regarding the PDO indicator number 6, The recipient and implementing agencies argue
    that the PDO indicator number 6 with regards to income improvements among
    beneficiary communities should be considered insofar as it has been achieved no matter if
    it is defined in the terms established in the Grant Agreement or in the terms established
    in the PAD; and,
   It was acknowledged the support of the World Bank staff during the implementation
    phase, which was considered as a contributing factor for the success of the Project.

Additional Comments:
This component was designed to promote the adoption of an integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach for the biome in Bahia and Ceará.
It also sought to change attitudes and behaviors toward conservation, and to foster a policy and regulatory framework supportive of the IEM
approach. Proposed policy reform actions under this component included (a) development of a market framework as an underlying incentive for the
transition toward IEM; (b) support for the consolidation and expansion of the states’ systems of protected areas, and for imp roving their
management; (c) development of capacity for assessment and monitoring; (d) support for efforts toward the conservation and sustainable use of
biological diversity important to agriculture; (e) support for institutional strengthening of the relevant actors, including civil society stakeholders;
(f) support for specific state efforts to reduce threats to the biome; (g) development of capacity for designing and monitoring pilot projects; and (h)
strengthening the capacity of agencies, NGOs, and indigenous and quilombola communities to effectively implement activities aimed at protecting
ecosystems. A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) would be carried out to systematically evaluate the broader environmental and social
implications of government policies, plans, and programs; and to ensure that environmental considerations are mainstreamed into the early phases
of planning and decision-making. The assessment would then inform efforts to strengthen the policy and legal frameworks of the two states.
Strategic environmental assessments have been completed in both states. Training events, educational outreach and awareness raising campaigns
have been carried out. Technical assistance has been provided.
Under this component, the state of Ceara has done important policy reforms. Actually Ceara is a model for rethinking Caatinga issues and is trying
to mainstream into public policies. Seven policies have been mainstreamed in Ceara and one in Bahia. Ceara policies include: new state protected
area law, new state policy to combat desertification, strengthened state policy for environment at municipal level (Selo Verde), strengthened fire
prevention program (PREVINA), new state policy of integrated management of solid waste, new state forest policy, new state policy for
environmental services. In Bahia a new municipal environmental law (Itatim) and 4 municipal environmental councils created. The performance
indicator target of number of policies fulfilled 133%.
Studies for the creation of new protected areas have been carried out, but there was an unfavorable political climate in the federal and state
governments for creation of new protected areas, particularly those with strict protection. As consequence, the creation of new protected areas felt
behind schedule. In Bahia: (1) the preparation of the management plan for APA Serra Branca (67,237 ha) was completed; (2) various activities
were carried out for FLONA Contendas do Sincoré (11,000 ha), including the creation of a capacity building center and the implementation of tree
nursery subprojects; (3) environmental education activities have been carried for the State Park Morro do Chapeu; and, (4) the
environmental/biological diagnostics and the socioeconomic studies aiming the creation of one new conservation area in the municipality of Curaca
have been completed. In Ceara: (1) equipment for monitoring fauna has been acquired for the RPPN Serra das Almas; (2) the management council

(4) two RPPNs have been created, comprising 283 ha.

Additional Comments:
132 subprojects in both states (72 in Ceara and 60 in Bahia) have been supported. The Project benefited 3,905 family farmers in the Caatinga
biome. A share of 49.7 percent of these beneficiary families has benefited with income improvement activities. Performance indicator target of
number of subprojects fulfilled 88%. In Ceara, 52 subprojects for rehabilitation of degraded areas are underway, to recover 690 ha, involving1,295
family farmers. In Bahia, 12subprojects for rehabilitation of degraded lands are underway with 1,225 family farmers. In 2012, Brazil's northeast
struggles with the worst drought in 30 years, prompting authorities to declare a state of emergency. This has negatively affected success of
subprojects for rehabilitation of degraded areas, as well as the domestic water supplies and productive subprojects. Subprojects expected to improve
incomes include 60 subprojects in Ceara and in Bahia. The survey to monitor the improvement started in June 2013. 24 subprojects focused on
rehabilitation of riparian vegetation (352 ha).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. The Final Evaluation randomly-selected Project-financed community subprojects to assess their
economic results. The sample reached 137 families, including Project beneficiaries and the control
group. An economic analysis examined this sample as well as secondary data for the target
municipalities.
Scope
2. A total of 3,905 family farmers have benefited from community subprojects: 1,760 family
farmers in the State of Bahia and 2,145 family farmers in the State of Ceará. Of this total, 1,942
family farmers (917 in Bahia and 1,025 in Ceará) have directly benefitted from income-
improvement activities. They represent 49.7 percent of total beneficiaries: 52.1 percent of
beneficiaries in Bahia and 47.8 percent of beneficiaries in Ceará. For the overall project, 50
percent of the direct beneficiaries have improved their income compared to their conditions
prior to project interventions.
Methodology
3. The Project conducted a specific study to quantify the rate of economic improvement. The
study used a control group (non-project beneficiaries) as a reference baseline. The methodology
applied by the study includes:
       Review of project documents and reports;
       Review of scientific bibliography and research methodologies applied for poverty,
        environment and local community issues;
       Analysis of secondary data for target municipalities, particularly from the 2006
        Agricultural Census;
       Interviews with key stakeholders involved in project implementation, including state
        agencies, technicians, researchers and local NGOs;
       Operational planning of field work, pre-assessment of questionnaires and definition of
        target groups, selection of projects to be visited in both states, and training of staff to fill
        out the survey forms;
       Use of questionnaires with 137 families, including the control group (panel analysis:
        with and without intervention); and
       Evaluation of the results of primary and secondary research.
Results
4. Income improvement in agroforestry subprojects was achieved in three ways:
       Increases in productivity and sales;
       Diversification of production and focus on adding value; and
       Reduction in the need to buy products outside the community; and savings in household
        expenditures.

Increases in productivity and sales
5. Using as a reference the basic crops (maize and beans) produced by small landholders in the
Caatinga Biome, the study found that the production of project beneficiaries was much higher
than in the control group at the time of the study.
6. In Bahia, maize production among beneficiaries was 231 percent higher than among the
control group. This result was repeated in Ceará where beneficiaries’ production was 280
percent higher than that of the control group.
7. The same trend was observed with regard to bean production. Beneficiaries produced more
than the control group in both states. In Bahia, the beneficiaries’ production was 318 percent
higher than that of the control group, whereas in Ceará the beneficiaries produced 358 percent
more than the control group.
8. Figure 1 below shows the performance of the beneficiaries of the Mata Branca Project in a
comparative analysis with the control group (nonbeneficiaries) in the two states, focusing on the
income earned from the production of the Semi-arid Northeast’s two main crops: maize and
beans.
               Figure 1: Average Annual Household Production (60 kg sack), 2012-2013




9. First, the data summarized in this figure shows that the production of maize and beans is
significantly higher among beneficiaries than among non-beneficiaries.
10. In the last twelve months, beneficiaries who applied organic fertilizers in their plots
achieved maize production rates equal to 8.6 sacks per hectare in Bahia and 9.5 sacks per
hectare in Ceará. Meanwhile, producers in the control group achieved a much lower
productivity level: 2.6 sacks per hectare in Bahia and 2.5 sacks per hectare in Ceará. Therefore,
productivity gaps between beneficiary and control groups equaled 331 percent and 380 percent
in the States of Bahia and Ceará, respectively.
11.     The same trend is repeated in the case of bean production. Small landholders who have
benefited from the Project show annual productivity rates ranging from 3.9 sacks per hectare in
Bahia to 7.9 sacks per hectare in Ceará, while the control group in the two states shows only 1
sack per hectare in Bahia and 1.6 sacks per hectare in Ceará. In other words, production is
around four to five times lower in the absence of the Project.

                                                28
12. As shown in Figure 2, below, these results also prompt a significant increase in family
income for the two crops: R$689 compared to R$165 (Bahia), and R$1,878 compared to R$410
(Ceará). For other crops, the sample lacks sufficient data.




Diversification of Production
13. Another possibility for increasing income is diversification of production since livelihood
diversification is expected to reduce social vulnerability and poverty, and to improve social
resilience and shared prosperity. Diversification of production is also expected to increase
opportunities of access to specialized markets with products of higher added value.
14. Evidence shows that this is actually happening with the Project`s beneficiaries, although
there are not enough data for a robust statistical analysis.
15. Thus, the survey also shows that although members of the control group continue to focus
on the production of maize, beans, lettuce and cassava, diversification of agricultural production
was clearly visible among Project beneficiaries by the introduction of other vegetables, fruits,
roots and tubers crops with higher market value According to the analyzed samples, new
products include, among the most cited, tomato, okra, onion, watermelon, beets, scarlet
eggplant, potato, cajá chestnut; parsley and popular pepper. Banana, papaya, grape and guava
area also produced.

Economies in Monthly Household Expenditures
16. Fieldworks data show that saving in monthly household expenditures have also been
achieved by Project beneficiaries. As detailed below in Table 2, the data confirm this argument,
particularly for the state of Ceará (R$ 356 to R$ 506).

  Monthly expenditure for food
   increased to% of families
   during the current drought            54              64             41               45

17. However, in the State of Bahia, it was also noticed that, during the current drought,
increases in food costs affected a smaller percentage of beneficiary households compared to
non-beneficiaries. Thus, it may be inferred that savings were experienced by households in both
states, albeit to a lesser degree than expected due to the adverse impacts of the current drought.
18. These results need to be analyzed in the context of the current drought in the Semi-arid
Northeast Region. Due to the current drought in this region, many producers have been unable
to produce anything during the past agricultural year. The data collected suggest that pastoralists
(among both the beneficiary and the control group) suffered the most. Among agricultural
producers, however, the portion of beneficiary producers unable to produce was much lower (20
percent in both states) than the portion of non-beneficiary producers (44 percent in Ceará and 45
percent in Bahia). The beneficiary families’ vulnerability may thus be regarded as lower than
that of households in the control group. These findings suggest that the Project has helped to
make its beneficiaries more resilient to climate hazards.
19. It is likely that the results of this indicator would have been better in the absence of drought
and of delays in implementation of the community subprojects.
20. In any case, there is no doubt that savings in monthly expenditures through the use of
agroforestry systems is a realistic possibility for the families who participated in the Mata
Branca Project.
Conclusion

                                                30
21. In broad terms, the main benefits estimated are related to family income improvement by
agroforestry subprojects. These benefits were achieved in three ways: (i) increase in
productivity and sales; (ii) diversification of production and focus on adding value; and (iii) less
need to buy products outside the community.
22. Using the production of basic crops (maize and beans) as a reference, project participants’
production was much higher than that of the control group. In Bahia, maize production was 231
percent higher; in Ceará it was 280 percent higher.
23. The same trend was observed with bean sales, which were 318 percent higher for project
beneficiaries in Bahia and 358 percent for beneficiaries in Ceará than among the control group.
24. The study’s findings also show that, although members of the control group continued to
focus on the production of maize, beans, lettuce and cassava, diversification of agricultural
production was clearly visible at the project level through the introduction of tomatoes, okra,
onions, watermelons, beets, eggplants, potatoes, chestnuts, parsley and chili peppers. Bananas,
papayas, grapefruit and guava were also introduced. There is evidence that diversification of
production is actually taking place with the Project’s beneficiaries, although there are
insufficient data for a robust statistical analysis.
25. Field-work data collected among family farmers who have been benefited from the Project
confirmed that it generated savings in monthly household expenditures. Differences in savings
between beneficiary and control groups were intensified in Ceará (R$356 to R$506).
26. The analysis also shows that the beneficiary families’ vulnerability in the face of the current
drought was lower than for households in the control group. This result suggests that the Project
has also helped to make its beneficiaries more resilient to climate hazards. Other benefits may
have been generated but these were not assessed.

                                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Project Description

1. The Project for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of the Caatinga Biome in the
States of Bahia and Ceará (the Mata Branca GEF Project) is conducted by the respective state
governments with funds from the Global Environment Fund (GEF). The World Bank handles
counterpart contributions by both states and their implementation.
2. The scope of the Project adheres to the Project for Conservation and Sustainable Use of
Brazilian Biological Diversity (PROBIO), which defined priority areas and actions for the
Caatinga Biome, highlighting the preservation, conservation, sustainable use and management
of biodiversity in the States of Bahia and Ceará. The Project is also aligned with the National
Biodiversity Strategy, particularly with regard to the process of awareness raising, mobilization
and environmental education of local populations, as well as raising the level of awareness and
decision making by local stakeholders with regard to sustainable coexistence with the Caatinga.
3. Mata Branca’s general objective is to contribute to the sustainable management,
conservation and preservation of the biodiversity of the unique Caatinga Biome in the States of
Cearáates of Ce while simultaneously improving the quality of life of its inhabitants through the
introduction of sustainable development practices. To contribute to the reduction of
anthropogenic pressure and the consequent degradation of the biome’s natural resources, the
Project was structured with the following components: (i) Support to institutions and public
policies for Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM); (ii) Demonstration subprojects:
promotion of IEM practices; and (iii) Monitoring and evaluation (M&E), outreach and project
management.
4. The Project had a budget of US$23.06 million, including: US$10 million in GEF funds as a
non-reimbursable financial cooperation; a US$6.10 million contribution by each state; and
US$1.4 million from the beneficiaries. In Bahia, the executive bodies are the Regional
Development and Action Company (CAR) and the Secretariat of Environment (SEMA) with
coordination by the Secretariat of Development and Regional Integration (SEDIR) and financial
management by the FLEM.
Ongoing Relevance

5. The Project is considered a pioneer in addressing the integrated management of the Caatinga
ecosystem. As a strategy, the Mata Branca Project implements institutional coordination,
planning and demonstration of appropriate technologies for the sustainable development of the
Caatinga Biome. Positive results of a structural and operational nature have been reflected in the
State Governments of Bahia and Ceará, thus providing various lessons learned. Component 1,
when it promotes successful institutional coordination in various activities, highlights this
process as an exercise to improve the use of this practice in state governments. Experience in
identifying issues and drafting environmentally sustainable demonstration subprojects should
also be recognized. These have proved important for knowledge and dissemination of practices
in this type of work and have thus allowed them to be disseminated in the states.


                                               32
6. The Project was implemented in two stages, with the broad participation of the technicians
involved and various activities dealing with preservation, conservation and productive inclusion
with income generation. In addition to public policies and biodiversity conservation, it is
worthwhile to note the benefit gained by about 10,000 families through the implementation of
132 subprojects for the rehabilitation of degraded areas, conservation and management of
biodiversity, management of soil and water resources, technological alternatives as a means for
sustainable livelihoods, cultural and social development, and environmental incentive efforts.
Effectiveness

7. The consultants’ observations and findings indicate that the following factors were
instrumental to the achievement of the Project’s objectives: (i) improvement of the political and
institutional structure aimed at the Caatinga’s integrated ecosystem management; (ii) increased
interest by the Governments of Bahia and Ceará incorporation of the Mata Branca Project’s
learning in public policies for the Caatinga; (iii) increased demand by rural producers for
environmentally sustainable practices; (iv) the relationship of trust between the project teams
and direct beneficiaries who have demonstrated a growing sense of empowerment. These data
are positive for future sustainability; (v) adoption of a system of incentives and conditionality
for the implementation of subprojects; (vi) contribution of cross-cutting actions in
environmental education to the apparent increase in awareness of the need to strengthen the
protected areas system; (vii) conduction of workshops and training to support the expansion of
knowledge for integrated ecosystem management; and (viii) the provision of human, financial
and technical resources for the implementation of the monitoring system, thus allowing the
systemization of data and the organization of information for decision making.
8. It should be emphasized that the most important non-controllable variable—the challenge of
prolonged droughts, which require decision making and strategic initiatives to deal with such
phenomena—negatively impacted the range of the Project’s Performance Indicators 5 (damaged
areas) and 6 (increased income).

Efficiency

9. The following aspects may be highlighted as benchmarks for the Mata Branca Project’s
success: (i) institutional support by CONPAM and CAR, maintaining daily and direct
coordination, respectively, with the UGP-CE and UGP-BA; (ii) availability of financial
resources for the procurement of services and support for planned activities; (iii) existence of
willingness and interest of local communities to participate in the Project; (iv) appropriate
project design given the key factors found in the 2007 version of the PAD; (v) openness of the
World Bank and GEF to negotiations and renewal of the Grant Agreement in June 2012; (vi)
level of motivation of the UGP, FLEM and partner institutions’ teams; (vii) various initiatives
and demonstration subprojects with innovative features in the biome that increased local
demand and internalization through the adoption of environmentally sustainable practices; (viii)
the unplanned initiative of the Environmental Pact in the Inhamuns region, involving 12
municipalities; and (ix) the Project’s use of a specific computerized system, the Management
Information System (MIS), with five modules, which meets the Project’s needs perfectly.

Lessons Learned, Sustainability and Dissemination

                                               33
10.      Based on lessons learned and identified in the program’s documentation, and on contact
with the coordination team and interviews with direct beneficiaries, the following strategic
priorities for sustainability and expansion of the program may be considered: a) Public Policies;
b) Preservation and Conservation of the Biome; c) Integrated Ecosystem Management; and d)
Sustainability and Dissemination.
11.      With regard to strategic priority a) Public Policies, relevant actions are expected to be:
(i) the improvement of existing policies created within the Mata Branca Project (Phase 1); (ii)
design and implementation of new policies; (iii) support for sector partnerships; (iv)
strengthening/creation of structures for aggregation and synergy; (v) thematic platforms
targeting the development of sustainable businesses; (vi) advocacy on issues related to public
policies; and (vii) coordination of government bodies with the private sector (the third sector).
12.      With regard to strategic priority b) Preservation and Conservation of the Biome, the
following recommendations are made: (i) consolidate and expand the work with protected areas;
(ii) streamline the integrated actions to recover degraded areas and use conservation practices;
(iii) conduct studies, prepare strategic plans, and implement C&T programs; (iv) strengthen
environmental education and health programs (v) establish connectivity to enhance ecological
corridors in watershed projects; and (vi) raise the awareness of governments and the private
sector on the implementation of infrastructure projects.
13.      With regard to strategic priority c) Integrated Ecosystem Management, the following are
considered fundamental themes: (i) associations; (ii) sustainable production and management;
(iii) technical assistance; (iv) market access; and (v) training to encourage innovation.
14.      Regarding strategic priority d) Sustainability and Dissemination, the following priority
actions and possible projects are considered, without overlooking others: (i) creation of
revolving funds such as the matching grant mode, which involves the interest of beneficiaries;
(ii) financial guidance and access to credit; and (iii) transfer of the methodology to other regions

Dear Madam,

Considering the Implementation Completion and Result report, the state of Bahia was surprised
by some reviews and requests that is considered: (i) the complexity of the legal framework for
the creation of Conservation Units in Brazil associated with the presence of traditional
communities; (ii) the assistance of BIRD managers was satisfactory, (iii) (iii) the relevance of
the social with the environment integration, which allowed a change in the mentality of the
beneficiaries, in favor of an environmental awareness and effective preservation, immeasurable
for the Project; and (v) continuity of actions linked to to the Mata Branca Project in Bahia and
Ceará.

Sincerely,



Cássio Luis da Silva Biscarde
Mata Branca Project Coordinator

Mrs. Nádia Holtz da Nova Moreira
Technical Superintendent – SUDES da FLEM

Dear Superintendent,

Please find the considerations on the Implementation Completion and Result Report - ICR n.
0003138, which deals with the Mata Branca Project.

1 - In the preparation phase of the Project , it was registered the inexistence of cartographic
bases aiming the recovery of degraded areas. In the state of Ceará, during the implementation
phase, high resolution images were acquired. Use mapping and soil occupation in the scales of
1:10,000 and 1:100,00 were carried out, generating unseen maps and atlas, produced by
CONPAN and FUNCEME in 2009, serving as baseline for the calculation of the areas to be
recovered and closing a data gap existent in the direct intervention area of the Project;

2 - Regarding the Monitoring & Evaluation (M & A) of the subprojects , a system for
monitoring and controlling of contracts and subdonations was implemented by the PMUs, fed
by the respective Management Units, supporting the financial management of FLEM;

3 - Include the assessment of income improvement of the communities (15%), since the
indicator established both in the Contract and in the PAD proves the scope of this indicator;

4 - Register the support of the World Bank staff in the implementation phase, contributing to the
success of the Project.

Sincerely,


Maria Tereza Bezerra Farias Sales
Mata Branca Project Coordinator
