                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's global environmental objective and its development objective are the same: to contribute to the preservation, conservation, and sustainable management
                         of the biodiversity of the Caatinga in the states of Bahia and Ceara, while improving the quality of life of its inhabitants, through the introduction of sustainable
                         development practices.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is based on two supervision missions carrried out from November 22 to 25, 2011 and April 16 to 20, 2012 with the participation of the Grant Recipient, Fundacao Luis
                         Eduardo Magalhaes (FLEM) and the executing two States: Bahia and Ceara with which FLEM has Cooperative Agreements. The Aide Memoires and post mission letters to the
                         client are attached.

                         Over we rate the project performance as satisfactory due to: (i) the outstanding progress made toward attaining the development objective; (ii) excellent progress on the project’s
                         performance and intermediate indicators, including exceeding the target for public policies, significant progress on recuperation of degraded areas and improved income generation,
                         attainment of 75 percent of the project targets with respect to protected areas, and 80 percent of intermediate indicators achieved (see section on indicators for details); (iii) robust

                         implementation of the 2012 Annual Operating Plan; (iv) disbursements totalling 64 percent of the GEF resources and expected to reach 80 percent by October 2012; (v) and overall
                         counterpart contributions exceeding what was originally programmed by 45 percent. Safeguard compliance and fiduciary ratings including financial management and procurement
                         are all Satisfactory. There are no outstanding issues with respect to the project audits. Updated GEF tracking tools have been forwarded to the GEF.

                         We are also pleased to note the mainstreaming of the project’s objectives and methodology by the governments of Bahia and Ceará via inclusion of broader and longer-term focus
                         on the caatinga biome in the PPAs of both States, and inclusion of Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) approaches beyond the project target areas and for other biomes.
                         Among other achievements, the GEF Caatinga Project has also fostered strong partnerships with a wide variety of other governmental agencies at different levels, NGOs and the
                         National Counsel for the Caatinga Biosphere Reserve; recently won the Medal of Honor of O2 Merit award; and will be prominently featured in the upcoming Rio+20 Conference.
                         Furthermore, the project has leveraged considerable additional resources from other State agencies and municipalities, as well as NGOs such as The Nature Conservancy and the
                         Caatinga Association. The project can now be said to exemplify the incremental costs approach of the GEF with its goal of providing catalytical support to broader mainstreaming of
                         initiatives by clients.

                         Some highlights of project's considerable achievements include the following. The project has had a real impact on improved policies for the semi-arid biome, for example, supporting
                         the creation of municipal environmental counsels at the municipal level in Bahia, and state policies to combat desertification in Ceara, along with project assistance to the Ceara fire
                         prevention program that helped drastically reduce the number of fires in the dry seasons. Two pioneering strategic environmental impact assessments were done (one completed
                         and one in process), as well as a study on payment for environmental services. The project has also accomplished a lot in terms of the creation and consolidation of protected areas
                         especially those containing threatened biodiversity, and has exceeded some of the original targets. The 132 community subprojects, involving more than 10,000 small producer
                         families including traditional populations (indigenous and quilombolas) and/or inhabitants in near protected areas, have disseminated and helped test new information on integrated
                         ecosystem management, introducing new technologies such as intensive agroforestry systems, alternative energy sources, recuperation of degraded lands and others, contributing to
                         income generation, strengthening community organizations, and providing models that are beginning to be disseminated beyond the project target areas. The project carried out a
                         robust program of institutional strengthening and capacity building which reached an estimated 2,500 diverse stakeholders including decision makers, as well as environmental
                         education outreach that reached the majority of schools in the project areas. The project M&E system is also working well, including a system for physical and financial monitoring of
                         the project as well as evaluation of project impact and intermediate indicators.
