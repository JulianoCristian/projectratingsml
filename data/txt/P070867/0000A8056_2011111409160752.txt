                         The project's global environmental objective and its development objective are the same: to contribute to the preservation, conservation, and sustainable
                         management of the biodiversity of the Caatinga in the states of Bahia and Ceara, while improving the quality of life of its inhabitants, through the introduction of
                         sustainable development practices.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is based on a full supervision mission from June 27-30 and July 4-8, 2011 in Ceara (CE) and Bahia (BA) states.

                         The Recipient of the Grant is a foundation, FLEM, which has Cooperation Agreements with the two State implementing agencies, CAR in BA and CONPAM in Ceara (CE).

                         Overall, project implementation is maintained at Satisfactory. Previous action plans set have been largely complied with. The performance of the project is stronger in Ceara than in
                         Bahia.

                         The main findings of the mission were that it is clear the technical achievements of the project are considerable. Outstanding achievements have been accomplished in Component
                         2, subprojects, and M&E is well advanced. In Ceara a pathbreaking strategic environmental assessment was carried out, widely debated, and has influenced numerous policies for
                         the biome. Both states have had active training and capacity building programs. Disbursements have improved but attention is still needed to further accelerate disbursements.

                         It is especially noteworthy that one-third of the project's target performance indicators have been attained, largely due to achievements in the state of Ceara where six policies aimed
                         at improving integrated ecosystem management were adopted or improved and two RPPN protected areas were created. The performance indicator for IEM subprojects in
                         Component 2 for the two states was 150 and as of August, 2011, the number of approved subprojects was 148.

                         Lastly, the clients are interested in extending the Closing Date of the project by one year, particularly to continue the work on monitoring and evaluation. It was agreed to discuss this
                         further at the next mission, planned for November 2011.
