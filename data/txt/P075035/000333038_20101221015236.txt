 1.     The project has improved integrated water and environment management by
 improving the technical capacity and cooperation of the central, provincial and local
 governments in water and environment planning and management and by enhancing the
 knowledge management skills of its technical staff. As a result, the project has
 successfully reduced pollution loads to the rivers (and to the Bohai Sea) and groundwater
 overdrafting in the project areas of the North China Plain.

 2.      A reallocation of Grant funds among the disbursement categories is necessary to
 hire additional consulting services. Currently the Grant has cost savings on the order of
 US$211,865, achieved mostly through competitive bidding for civil works, goods and
 international workshops. Due to a recent policy change restricting overseas study tours,
 savings of about US$82,295 have accrued. The total savings of US$294,160 will be
 reallocated to the consulting services category in order to hire additional consulting
 services to: (a) collect M&E data needed to evaluate the project's achievements as the
 project draws to a close; (b) improve the quality control of project outputs; and (c) hold
 domestic workshops to enhance project sustainability.

                         Extension of Closing Date

          CHINA -- HAI BASIN INTEGRATED WATER AND ENVIRONMENT
                           MANAGEMENT PROJECT
                                  (P075035)

                                  Restructuring Paper

1.      The closing date for China, Hai Basin Integrated Water and Environment
Management Project, TF053183, P075035, will be extended from December 31, 2010
until June 30, 2011.

2.     Project implementation is on track, as explained in Annex 1 of this Restructuring
Paper. The objectives of the Project remain highly relevant and very likely to be
achieved.

3.      The first extension was granted in May 2008 to allow additional time for project
implementation, after start-up delays were encountered due to project management
difficulties in understanding the innovative concept and approach of the project.

4.       A second extension of the Grant closing date to June 30, 2011 is needed for two
main reasons. First, under Component 3, the project is funding a "Small Cities Financial
Support Program", to help Hangu and Dagu, two small district cities in the coastal
districts of Tianjin, to meet their financial obligations. The concept is to provide output-
based aid during the early years of wastewater treatment plant operations. The relevant
wastewater treatment plant was just completed in September 2010 under another Bank
operation. Construction of the plant was delayed when the Tianjin Municipal
Government changed its policy on pollution control in late 2009. The change required
the wastewater treatment standards at the plant to be upgraded from Class II to Class I ­
A. Upgrading the plant delayed construction, and this, in turn, translated into a six-month
delay in implementing the Small Cities Financial Support Program offered under this
project.

5.      Second, an additional six months will be needed for the Ministry of Water
Resources and the Ministry of Environment Protection to review and clear the outputs of
the project and carry out the necessary follow-up to determine how best to extend the
project approach beyond the original project areas of the Hai Basin, which will enhance
the project's sustainability.
