                         management approach for water management and pollution control in the Hai Basin. Improvements and impacts have been seen in many areas, particularly: (a) improved
                         cooperation between MWR, MEP, river basin authority, municipal/ provincial and county governments; (b) enhanced data and information sharing among the related implementing
                         agencies; and (c) reduced waste-water discharges from cities and counties to the Bohai Sea.
