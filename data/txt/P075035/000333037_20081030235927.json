It has globally important ecological resources\n            and provides significant fishery benefits to China, North\n            and South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Fish and shellfish stock\n            in the yellow sea are dependent on the Bo Hai Sea as a\n            reproduction and nursery area. Currently, the Bo Hai Sea is\n            under considerable stress. Pollution, the reduction of\n            freshwater inflows, overfishing and habitat loss has\n            diminished its ecosystem functions. The most seriously\n            affected areas include the estuaries and coastal areas. A\n            lack of effective pollution control for surface and\n            groundwater draining into the Bo Hai Sea has contributed to\n            mass mortality of aquaculture species and an increasing\n            frequency of harmful algal blooms known as 'red\n            tides.' The project's overall objective is to\n            revive the Bo Hai Sea environment with an integrated\n            approach to water resources management and pollution control\n            in the Hai river basin. It is designed to improve integrated\n            water and environment planning and management, provide the\n            necessary institutional support and capacity building, and\n            reduce municipal wastewater discharges into the Bo Hai Sea.\n            The project also serves as a link to water and environmental\n            management issues for two World Bank-financed operations in\n            the Hai Basin: the Second Tianjin Urban Environment and\n            Development Project, and the Water Conservation Project."}, "docdt": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
