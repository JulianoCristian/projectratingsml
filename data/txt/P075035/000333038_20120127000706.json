outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            targeting reduction in consumptive water use and based on ET\n            (Evapotranspiration) can be a powerful instrument for water\n            resources management in conditions of competing water demand\n            for multiple uses, particularly in physical water scarcity\n            areas arid and semi-arid regions in the World. Time is\n            required to change mindsets and demonstrate the necessity of\n            new and advanced concepts and approach, although there have\n            been initial and good outcomes during a very short period of\n            implementation. A new project focusing on implementation of\n            the existing new approach, policy interventions and\n            technologies developed under this project is needed as a\n            follow-up to resolve the potential issues or problems which\n            may be emerged during the project implementation.\n            Coordination of a large network of decentralized management\n            units requires well resourced and highly experienced central\n            coordination. Incentives are required to make the water\n            consumption approach work at farm level. Government\n            investment for not only engineering works but also for\n            supporting agronomic and cropping pattern improvements and\n            improving irrigation management thereby raising farmer\n            incomes and reducing water consumption are important. In the\n            case of the Hai Basin, proximity to large urban markets, it\n            will be important to facilitate cropping change to large\n            extent to produce higher value products per unit of water.\n            Water User Association (WUAs) proved to be an important\n            mechanism that resulted in farmer benefits and water saving."}, "docdt": "2011-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
