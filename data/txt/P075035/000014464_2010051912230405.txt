Description of the Project
 
The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in reducing pollution in the 
Bohai Sea by developing an integrated approach to water resource management and 
pollution control in the Hai Basin. 
The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof 
as the Recipient and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives: 
Part A
:
Integrated Water and Environment Management
1. 
Carry out the following studies focused on primary areas of concern at the Hai 
Basin level: 
(a) 
A study analyzing the legal, policy and institutional frameworks governing water 
resource management and water pollution control in the Hai Basin and identifying 
barriers to and developing practical solutions for coordination among various government 
ministries (in particular, MWR and SEPA) to facilitate integrated water and environment 
management at the basin and local levels.  
(b) 
Studies: (i) evaluating the linkage between the environmental condition of the 
Bohai Sea and Bohai Bay and developing spatial and temporal pollutant control actions 
to maximize beneficial effects on the Bohai Sea and actions to maximize ecological 
benefits in the receiving marine environment; and (ii) with respect to the Hai River that 
evaluate and develop recommendations on the minimum flows, the scheduling of flows, 
and water quality requirements necessary to maintain the environmental functions of 
wetlands in the river. 
(c) 
Studies: (i) analyzing water balance in the Hai Basin necessary to support a 
sustainable river-aquifer system; (ii) evaluating factors that affect water savings and high 
efficiency water utilization (including examination of existing water rights and well 
permit systems); and (iii) analyzing the management of wastewater and re-use of treated 
wastewater. 
(d) 
A study analyzing factors that inhibit reduction of pollution levels in the Hai 
River and developing a basin-wide action plan for pollution control. 
(e) 
A study analyzing water use in Beijing and developing a plan to limit water 
usage to the amount of water available. 
2. 
(a) 
Based on the results of the studies carried out under Part A.1 of the 
Project, develop Integrated Water and Environment Management Plans (“IWEMPs”),

velop a Strategic Action Plan (“SAP”), including a long term government 
investment plan,  for the Zhangweinan sub-basin, with specific focus on water pollution 
and a SAP for the Hai Basin, with specific focus on capacity building and integrated 
management; each SAP to identify actions to reduce water consumption and water 
pollution, to improve coordination among different agencies, and to establish improved 
water management arrangements at the local level.

demonstrate the management and addressing of complex issues, including effective 
control of wastewater discharge, pollution control combined with environmental 
improvements, real water savings techniques and management, and effective 
management of water rights and well permits and carry out the initial phases of IWEMPs.  
Part B

water quality information at the basin level, which system may be applied, on an 
integrated basis, at the basin and local levels and provides direct support for 
evapotranspiration-based water management.   
2. 
Design an evapotranspiration management system that will eliminate 
groundwater overdraft and provide more surface water for ecological purposes.  
Part C
:
Tianjin Coastal Wastewater Management
1. 
Carry out in Tianjin a comprehensive study on wastewater management in cities, 
which have been selected under Part E of the project described in Schedule 2 to the 
STUDEP Loan Agreement or selected in agreement with the Bank, to evaluate the
