The project\n            has improved integrated water and environment management by\n            improving the technical capacity and cooperation of the\n            central, provincial and local governments in water and\n            environment planning and management and by enhancing the\n            knowledge management skills of its technical staff. As a\n            result, the project has successfully reduced pollution loads\n            to the rivers (and to the Bohai Sea) and groundwater\n            over-drafting in the project areas of the North China Plain.\n            A reallocation of grant funds among the disbursement\n            categories is necessary to hire additional consulting\n            services. Currently the grant has cost savings on the order\n            of US$211,865, achieved mostly through competitive bidding\n            for civil works, goods and international workshops. Due to a\n            recent policy change restricting overseas study tours,\n            savings of about US$82,295 have accrued. The total savings\n            of US$294,160 will be reallocated to the consulting services\n            category in order to hire additional consulting services to:\n            (a) collect monitory and evolution (M&E) data needed to\n            evaluate the project's achievements as the project\n            draws to a close; (b) improve the quality control of project\n            outputs; and (c) hold domestic workshops to enhance project sustainability."}, "docdt": "2010-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
