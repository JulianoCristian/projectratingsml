improve health and environmental conditions. It will assist\n            in establishing effective institutions in the sewerage\n            sector and developing appropriate financial and operational\n            policies. The project consists of the construction of a\n            sewage treatment plant, pumping stations, force mains and\n            about fifty kilometers of trunk sewers. Also it will provide\n            for the establishment of a new sewerage authority for\n            Aleppo. Other items to be financed: the construction of\n            workshops, provision of operational equipment and vehicles,\n            training and technical assistance for project management,\n            construction supervision, and financial, organizational and\n            engineering studies."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
