A Bank loan for US$70.0 million equivalent was\n            approved on May 13, 1986, and the project was co-financed by\n            the European Investment Bank (EIB). The loan, approved on\n            May 13, 1986 and signed on May 27, 1986, was terminated on\n            December 31, 1987 for failure to become effective after four\n            extensions. Since no progress was made towards the\n            resolution of the debt service arrears, the terminal date\n            for effectiveness was not extended beyond December 31, 1987.\n            Consequently, the Bank terminated the loan agreement in\n            accordance with section 12.04 of the general conditions. The\n            objectives of the project were to: (i) develop sewerage\n            services in Aleppo and improve the health and environmental\n            conditions of its inhabitants; (ii) improve the quality of\n            water in the Kouek river; and (iii) formulate and develop\n            institutional and financial structures for the sewerage\n            sector in Aleppo and train staff for that purpose. There is\n            one principal lesson to be drawn from this experience: loans\n            to countries with overdue payments which could lead to a\n            non-accrual situation should not be presented for Board\n            approval until such a condition is resolved. In this case,\n            the loan was approved when there were debt service payments\n            overdue for more than 30 days. A firm decision of the Bank\n            not to process and present a loan to the Board could have\n            two favorable effects: (i) it would send a strong signal to\n            the Government for meeting overdue payments; and (ii) it\n            would help prevent additional project processing costs."}, "docdt": "1996-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
