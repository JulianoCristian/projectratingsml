Some\n            lessons learned includes: the main lesson here is that the\n            client's leadership capacity cannot be underestimated\n            in development and implementation of successful projects.\n            Integrity, dynamism, bold decision making, and vision\n            characterize some of the leadership strengths in the\n            project. The systems development approach that was adopted\n            was strength of the project. This is an advisable strategy\n            in governance and corruption fraught environments. For the\n            project, the data from the Ministry of Basic Education\n            (MINEDUB), and other related ministries served as the\n            baseline data for overall monitoring and evaluation.\n            However, timely and accurate data for project implementation\n            were not available. The strength of the EFA-FTI project was\n            its relative simplicity. It was designed to support a policy\n            which the government had already put in place. It helped to\n            accelerate and scale up government's efforts, while\n            focusing on systems development and institutional\n            strengthening. The weaknesses in this area caused\n            significant delays in disbursements for the project. The\n            mitigating factor was that the disbursements related to\n            salary reimbursements for payments already made by the government."}, "docdt": "2012-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
