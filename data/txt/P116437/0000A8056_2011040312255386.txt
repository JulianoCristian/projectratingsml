                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Grant supports the Contract Primary Teacher Program of the Government of Cameroon. 37,200 contract teachers were recruited in primary education between 2006 and 2010
                         and deployed in areas where Pupil Teacher Ratios were the highest. This program therefore aims at reducing inequality in the distribution of teachers and decreasing the PTRs
                         across regions of Cameroon. The Grant supports this program by reimbursing the Government for part of the salaries of the 37,200 contract teachers. The Grant Agreement was
                         signed on November 11, 2010 and became effective on January 12, 2011. We are in the early stage of implementation and no request for reimbursement has been submitted so far.
