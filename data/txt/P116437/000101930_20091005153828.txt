B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The objective of the Year II CF Grant will be to improve the quality of primary education by 
ensuring an adequate number and distribution of trained teachers. The indicators for this Grant 
will be the reduction in PTRs and further reduction in the randomness of teacher allocation 
across provinces. Specific goals for these indicators will be finalized during appraisal.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The Year II CF Grant will support one component namely the payment of contract 
teachers'salaries. It will pay the salaries of 13,300 teachers supported through the Year I Grant 
and an additional 5000 teachers recruited in 2009. The Manual of Procedures developed with 
technical support from AFD for the hiring and payment of teacher salaries will be used for the 
implementation of the Year II CF Grant. The Grant will also be used to finance two annual audits 
-
the first audit will occur after the first tranche disbursement and the second after the final 
tranche disbursement. In addition, the Grant will finance one programmatic evaluation after the 
disbursement of the second tranche. The evaluation will be a sample assessment and will include 
the quality of recruitment, regularity of salary payments to teachers and teachers'presence and 
instruction in the classroom.
