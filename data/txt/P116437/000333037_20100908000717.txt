The project development objective is to reduce class sizes by recruiting and retaining more teachers in 
the public education system, as well as deploying them in an equitable manner. 
 
Project description 
 
Ref. PAD Section B.C., Technical Annex 2 
 
The project will contribute to the payment of the salaries of 37,200 primary public school contract 
teachers recruited during FY07, FY08, FY09 and FY10 during (a) the period from January 2010 
through the date which is four months after the Effective Date, and (b) part of the remainder of the 
2010 and 2011 school year.  
 
The indicators for this project will be the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios (PTR) and reduction in the 
variation of PTR across regions. PTRs are measured by dividing the number of teachers by the number 
of students within regions and for the nation. The variation of PTR is calculated by regressing the size 
of specific schools against the number of teachers in each specific school.

Section A.   
STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE  
I. COUNTRY AND SECTOR ISSUES 
A. 
Country Background
 
1. 
At the end of World War I, different parts of Cameroon were occupied by the French and the 
British. The Republic of Cameroon received its independence from the French in 1960 and the 
parts controlled by the British merged with it in 1961. English and French are its official 
languages. With a population of approximately 18 million, Cameroon has about 200 linguistic and 
ethnic groups.  Cameroon is made up of ten regions -- eight Francophone and two Anglophone. 
Strategically located in west and central Africa, its neighbors include Nigeria, Chad, the Central 
African Republic, Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. Since independence, Cameroon has 
remained a stable country with President Paul Biya in power since 1982. 
2. 
Until the mid 1980’s, Cameroon’s economy progressed steadily with a real GDP growth of 13 
percent from 1977 to 1981 and 8 percent from 1982 to 1985. Subsequently, the drop in prices for 
both agricultural products and petroleum caused a sharp decline in growth and revenue. Over the 
next two decades, Cameroon’s trajectory of economic development fluctuated with periods of 
growth and decline in GDP growth. In 2000, with the high level of external debt, Cameroon 
became a “Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)” and eligible for corresponding financial 
provisions.  
3. 
Macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustment have since served to improve the fiscal 
situation and provide a framework for development. The Gini per capita based on purchasing power 
parity is US$2,120. Between 2000 and 2002, the real GPD growth rate was 4.23 percent decreasing to 
3.32 percent been 2003 and 2007. Due to the financial crisis, economic growth is predicted to decline 
further in the coming years. 
4. 
The Government of Cameroon (GoC) is committed to development and a reduction in poverty. 
The first Poverty Reduction Strategic Plan (PRSP) was produced in 2003 and a PRSP for 2010-2019 is 
currently being prepared. From 1996 to 2003, poverty declined by 13 percentage points. Currently, about 
40 percent of the population is below the poverty line and the GoC intends to reduce poverty levels to 25 
percent by 2015.  
B. 
Sector Issues
 
5. 
Four ministries are respectively responsible for primary, secondary, technical and higher 
education. The education system is structured in slightly different manner in the Francophone and 
Anglophone parts of the country.  In both parts, primary education consists of six years with unified 
objectives and curriculum. Subsequently, all students can choose between general and technical 
secondary education. Whereas the first cycle of general secondary education is five years and the second 
cycle two years in the Francophone regions, it is respectively four  and three years in the Anglophone 
regions.  Although the National Assembly passed a law in the 1990’s to make the Francophone and 
Anglophone secondary education systems uniform, it has never been promulgated by the President. After 
secondary education, students can choose to attend university or attend post-secondary technical 
education.  
6. 
The evolution of the education system has been uneven.  Up until the 1990s, equitable access to 
quality primary education was amongst the top in the Africa region.  However, following drastic budget 
cuts, primary education Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) fell approximately ten percentage points during 
Page  10
2
the 1990’s from 94 to 84 percent.  The contraction of the education budget greatly affected the teacher 
corps.  Civil servants salaries were drastically cut in 1993 and there was a mandated restriction of teacher 
recruitment. Consequently, pupil-teacher ratios (PTR) grew to over 60 students per class, with 
considerable variations between regions. Communities and regions resorted to their own strategy for 
addressing the growing need for teachers in schools, which led to the creation of three parallel teacher 
corps: civil servant teachers, temporary teachers 
(Enseignants vacataires)
 and community teachers 
(Maîtres des parents)
.
1
7. 
Over the last decade, with the assistance received through Cameroon’s HIPC status, education 
indicators have steadily improved. Literacy rates in the population above 15 years of age grew by 7 
percentage points between 2001 and 2007. Primary Education GER regained the ground lost and reached 
100 percent by 2000.
2
In spite of the progress made, the Country Status Report (CSR) published in 2003 
indicated that critical interventions would be required if Cameroon was to meet the MDGs of universal 
primary enrollment (UPE) by 2015.
3
For example, the increase in girls’ enrollment was not as high as 
expected, especially in some of the most disadvantaged regions. Completion rates were low at 65.4 
percent for boys and 53.9 percent for girls (CSR, 2003). More importantly, the Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) 
rose from 51:1 to 58:1 between 1990/93 and 2001/02 due to increased enrollment in primary education. 
PTR of 40:1 suggested by the FTI indicative framework for universal and quality primary schooling was 
yet to be achieved. In addition, the envisioned increase in the school population from 2.5 million to 4 
million by 2015, as reported in the CSR, would make it necessary to double the number of teachers. 
8. 
The GoC prepared an Education Sector Strategy (ESS) to map out the future direction of the 
education system.  To specifically meet the MDGs of universal primary enrollment (UPE), gender equity, 
and completion rates of 100 percent by 2015, the ESS included the following options: reduction in 
repetition; expansion of the number of teachers, reduction of teacher/pupil ratios; increase in pedagogical 
resources and improvements in the system of governance in education.  One of the key strategies was the 
recruitment of contract teachers who follow a different career path and are remunerated according to a 
different salary scale than civil servant teachers.  The expansion of this teacher corps was meant to ensure 
medium term financial sustainability. 
9. 
After taking into consideration budget resources and contributions from other partners, the 
government calculated that there would be a financing gap of US$47 million to finance the 
implementation of the ESS.  On the basis of this assessment, the ESS served as a basis for the GoC 
request to join the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) and for the preparation of the 
request to the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund (CF).
4
The EFA-FTI CF Committee agreed to provide a US$47.3 
million grant to be distributed as two annual grants (Year I - US$22.5 million and Year II - US$24.8 
million).  The project financed under the grant would contribute to the remuneration of contract teachers, 
whose salaries would eventually be integrated into the national budget.  The strategy received the 
endorsement of local partners in July 2006 and was approved by the CF Committee in October 2006.  The 
1
Temporary teachers were recruited on 2-year term contract renewable once, paid under government budget or HIPC earmarked 
funds. Although most of them had pre-service training, this was not a requirement for their recruitment. Community teachers 
were teachers hired and paid by Communities and Parents Teachers Associations. 
 
2
Gross enrollment rates overstate the proportion of children in school.  Because of very high repetition rates, Cameroon has a 
substantial number of overage students.
 
3
“In spite of the positive trend, primary completion rates have reached only 60 percent, a level close to that prevailing in 1990, 
and remain significantly lower than the Millennium Development Goal target of universal completion of primary education.” 
(2003 Country Status Report, p.39)
 
4
The multi-donor Catalytic Trust Fund was established in November 2003 within the framework of the Education For All-Fast 
Track Initiative. The CF Grant provides financial assistance to EFA-FTI countries to support the implementation of their 
education sector strategies. The strategies, endorsed by local partners, outline the countries’ plans, activities and budgets for 
improving the sector. 
 
Page  11

World Bank has been the supervising entity of this project since then.  
C. 
Rationale for FTI/CF and Bank involvement 
 
10. 
The Bank’s continued involvement as supervising entity of the project is essential.  First, the ESS 
is in line with the Bank’s overall program in Cameroon.  Second, the program financed by the proposed 
project complements efforts supported under another Bank-financed project (
Programme d’Appui au 
Système Educatif – 
PASE
).
 
Finally, the supervision of this project by the World Bank would prevent any 
interruption in ESS implementation more generally and the program financed by the project more 
specifically. 
11. 
The proposed program to be financed under the project is aligned with Bank’s “Cameroon: 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY10-13,” presented to the Board in March 2010. The CAS 
emphasizes that human capital production and mobilization are binding constraints to economic growth in 
Cameroon. In addition, membership to EFA-FTI is in line with the Bank commitment to strengthen 
partnerships and harmonization of donor activity (a hallmark of the EFA-FTI). 
12. 
In addition, the Bank supports the education sector through an IDA Credit (P075964 – the 
Education Development Capacity Building Project) of US$18.2 million for capacity building in the 
education sector. The development objective for this project
5
is to develop and apply management and 
learning tools for use by government and communities to improve efficiency and accountability of the 
Cameroon education sector. The project has provided financial resources for capacity building critical to 
the implementation of the ESS. 
13. 
As supervising entity of the CF Grant to Cameroon, the World Bank signed an initial grant 
agreement with the government in 2007 for Year I of the CF Grant.  This grant was disbursed in two 
tranches in 2007 and 2008.  The project financed under the Year II CF Grant will help consolidate the 
progress achieved so far.  The GoC intends to use the second-year grant of US$24.8 million to continue to 
support salaries of 37,200 contract primary teachers hired between FY07 and FY10
6
.
No other partner is 
prepared to assume the responsibilities of CF supervising entity at this time.  Without the Bank’s 
continued involvement in the program, the overall sustainability of the implementation of the ESS could 
be compromised.  
D. 
 
Higher Development Objectives to which the Project Contributes
 
14. 
The higher level development objective to which the proposed project contributes is universal 
primary school enrolment by 2015.  
Section  B.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION  
A. 
Lending  Instrument 
 
15. 
The instrument will be a Specific Investment Loan (SIL), implemented via governmental 
institutions. The instrument and implementation arrangements provide efficient financing to a program 
that forms an integral part of the Government’s ESS.  
B. 
Development Objectives and Key Indicators
 
5
This PDO refers to the restructured PASE, effective April 2010. 
6
18,485  new contract teachers were hired in FY07, 5,125 in FY08 and 6,490 in FY09 and 7,100 in FY10. 
Page  12
4
16. 
The project development objective is to reduce class sizes by recruiting and retaining more 
teachers in the public education system, as well as deploying them in an equitable manner.  
C. 
Project Components
 
17. 
The project consists of one component.  It will be fully used to support the Government’s contract 
teacher program. It will contribute to the payment of the salaries of 37,200 primary public school contract 
teachers recruited during FY07, FY08, FY09 and FY10 during (a) the period from January 2010 through 
the date which is four months after the Effective Date, and (b) part of the remainder of the 2010 and 2011 
school year.  The indicators for this project will be the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios (PTR) and 
reduction in the variation of PTR across regions. PTRs are measured by dividing the number of teachers 
by the number of students within regions and for the nation. The variation of PTR is calculated by 
regressing the size of specific schools against the number of teachers in each specific school. 
D. 
Justification of project design 
 
18. 
The current project design is based on the following rationale: 
i) 
The overall CF Grant (Year I and Year II) corresponds to the calculation of the financing gap 
resulting from the shortage of teachers in the system. 
ii)  Based on the endorsement of local education partners, the CF committee approved the GoC 
proposal that the grant would be specifically used to finance the salaries of contract teachers. 
Consequently, as supervising entity, the Bank is under obligation to ensure that the grant be used 
for this specific purpose.  
iii) The successful experience of the Year I CF Grant implementation and the impact of this 
financing on key educational indicators warrant continued support for this activity. 
 
Section C.   
IMPLEMENTATION  
A. 
Partnership Arrangements
 
19. 
The local development partners endorsed the ESS in 2006, which was a prerequisite for the 
awarding of the CF Grant. There are approximately seven bilateral and multilateral development partners 
that support the education sector, with the 
Agence Française de Développement
 (AFD) as the Lead 
Donor. AFD is a significant donor for the education sector. It provides 40 million Euros for the ESS: 37.5 
million Euros is disbursed over 5 years as general budget support against the implementation of the 
government’s contract teacher program (through its 
Contrat de Désendettement et de développement,
 
C2D); and 2.5 million Euros for institutional strengthening. Japan, China, Korea, UNICEF, UNFPA, 
Africa Development Bank, and NGOs also provide assistance to the education sector. 
20. 
The development partners have put in place a systematic and shared process for assessing ESS 
progress.  Based on detailed terms of reference, an intensive implementation review of the sector strategy 
was carried out in 2008 and 2009. Based on the review, a joint development partner aide memoire was 
transmitted to government that summarized the achievements and challenges of each sub-sector in 
addition to cross sector issues. The review provided a forum for assessing implementation and the sub-
sector experience to be shared with other sub-sectors.   
Page  13
5
B. 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 
21. 
The Ministry of Basic Education (MINEDUB) is responsible for the overall implementation and 
monitoring of the contract teacher program.  Several government entities are involved in the CPT 
program: (i) the Prime Minister’s office, which gives prior approval to proceed with the contracting 
process; (ii) the Ministry of Public Function and Administrative Reform (MCS), which signs the contract; 
and (iii) the Ministry of Finance (MoF), which is responsible for budget allocations and salaries payment. 
To ensure efficient coordination between these actors, the government established a Monitoring 
Committee (MC) within MINEDUB
7
.
The MC includes representatives from the above ministries, has a 
Permanent Secretariat headed by the Human Resources Director of MINEDUB, and is assisted by a 
Technical Secretariat.  
22. 
The staff of the Permanent Secretariat has considerable experience in human resources 
management.  In addition, an Operations Manual guides the implementation of the contract teacher 
program. The Manual specifies the procedures, roles and responsibilities of the actors involved in the 
process.  It also specifies the administrative, financial and accounting mechanisms.  The Manual was 
updated in March 2010 to reflect the recommendations of the 2008 Technical Audit and that of the 
financial audit of Year I CF Grant, as well as new disbursement procedures to reimburse government 
payments.  
23. 
The MC is responsible for (i) ensuring the coordination of the activities of the Project; (ii) 
preparing and organizing the overall recruitment process for CPTs; (iii) managing the recruitment and 
deployment of contracted teachers, especially verifying teacher presence in schools; (iv)   monitoring 
the 
quality of the teaching; and (v)  keeping records and reporting to the development partners on all aspects 
of the Program. In addition, the MC reports to the development partners on all aspects of the contract 
teacher program. The development partners also participate in the MC’s working sessions.  
24. 
The MoF and the MCS shall be jointly responsible for the administrative management and 
disbursement, under the Project.  As such, the MCS shall be responsible for (i) the identification and 
selection of the contract teachers to be paid under the Program; and (ii) the signing of the contracts with 
CPTs. The MoF shall be responsible for (i) identification of the payments to be made under the Program; 
and (ii) issuance of wire transfer orders to the relevant central, regional, and prefectural level entities for 
the processing of payments. 
25. 
Fiduciary arrangements are aligned with the Government’s mechanisms and procedures already 
in place for contract teachers. In particular, the country system will be partially used for the payment of 
teachers’ salaries. In view of certain weaknesses in the PFM system, highlighted by the recent Public 
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), these arrangements will be 
supplemented with the financial management system of the existing Bank-financed PASE project. The 
PASE FM Unit will appoint an accountant who will record and report on the project transactions, e.g. 
teachers’ salary payrolls. In addition, PASE’s Internal Auditor will review and clear the requests for 
disbursement of the project as part of his annual work program. Finally, the PASE external auditors will 
certify the eligibility of teachers’ salaries claimed by the Monitoring Committee for the Project (MC) and 
audit the Project’s Financial Statements issued at the end of the project implementation. The external 
auditors’ contract will be updated accordingly. No prior audit for this project or for any other project 
managed by the PASE is outstanding.

Monitoring and Evaluation of Outcomes/Results
 
26. 
The monitoring and evaluation system put in place for the Year I CF Grant provided detailed and 
consistent information on the implementation of activities.  Consequently, the project will use the same 
system.   
(i) 
The primary source of information is provided by MINEDUB.  Bi-annually, MINEDUB 
submits the names of teachers who were hired, the observations of government missions to 
the regions, and financial information on the amounts spent on Contract Primary Teachers 
(CPT) salaries by region.  
(ii)  The second source of information is provided by regular independent technical and 
procedural audits as well as by financial audits required under the Grant.
 
The technical and 
procedural audits assess whether: (a) the rules for recruitment and payment of salaries are 
being followed; (b) teachers are present in the classrooms, and (c) salaries are paid 
regularly.
8
The financial audit examines the financial management of the project. 
(iii)  The third source comes from the bi-annual supervision missions conducted by the Bank in 
collaboration with the development partners. One of these bi-annual missions occurs at the 
time of the annual ESS review. 
Achievement of the Project Development Objectives will be measured by a reduction in pupil-
teacher ratios (PTR) and a reduction in the variation of PTR across regions. PTRs are measured 
by dividing the number of teachers by the number of students within regions and for the nation. 
The variation of PTR is calculated by regressing the size of specific schools against the number 
of teachers in each specific school. 
D. 
Sustainability
 
27. 
The systemic sustainability of the program supported by the project results from the new teacher 
management policy framework that includes the establishment of a contract teacher corps.  First, contract 
teachers have rights, responsibilities and career opportunities.  This will contribute to the stability of the 
teacher corps over time, which in turn will enable authorities to develop plans for improvements in 
performance.  Second, contract teachers are more easily posted and reposted to different schools than civil 
service teachers.  This ensures a more efficient and effective deployment of teaching staff, and thus a 
more equitable distribution of education opportunities. Third, because all new teachers are recruited as 
contract teachers and given the attrition of civil servant teachers over time, there is little risk that the 
differences in pay and working conditions between the two corps will constitute a demotivating factor.  
28. 
The ability of the Government to eventually take over external funding is a key factor in ensuring 
the sustainability of the program. The GoC has shown strong commitment to sustaining the progress 
made in the education sector and intends to gradually absorb the salary of contract teachers into the 
national budget. The share of education in total public expenditure exceeded 17 percent between 2007 and 
2009, in spite of the decrease in revenues in 2009.  The government plans to increase this share to 19.5 
8
As of August 2010, two technical and procedural audits financed by C2D (AFD supported project) had been 
carried out. The first one (thereafter called 
2008 Technical Audit
)
was implemented in 2008 on a limited but 
representative sample of CPTs. The results of this audit were published in 2009. The second audit (thereafter called 
2010 Technical Audit
)
is under implementation and the results will be published by September 2010. A summary of 
the results of the 2009 technical audit is presented in Annex 6, Section 4.

percent in 2011. In parallel, the share of basic education in total expenditure on education increased 
dramatically, from 32.5 in 2007 to 38 percent in 2009, with a peak at 41 percent in 2008. These increases 
portray the priority given to education by GoC. If the budget for education increases to around 20 percent 
as suggested in the FTI indicative framework, GoC will be in a position to absorb contract teachers cost 
by 2011. 
E. 
Risks 
 
29. 
A key issue associated with the hiring of contract teachers has been addressed while the Yr I CF 
Grant was implemented.  Contract teachers were hired without adequate policies in place that defined 
their status and future career paths in the system. Cameroon has addressed this issue by establishing clear 
policies that govern the hire, salary scales and benefits, in addition to career development in the system. 
These policies differ distinctly from the ones that apply to regular civil servants and provide opportunities 
for career development. Remaining risks are identified in the table below, together with mitigation 
measures.

Section D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY 
E.  Economic and Financia
l
Analyses 
 
30. 
Although there has been some progress toward Education for All objectives, inefficiency and 
inequity is still pervasive in Cameroon. Gross Enrolment Ratio surpassed 100 percent in 2005, meaning 
that the primary education system had the overall capacity to enroll all 6-11 year old Cameroonians. 
However, this hides inequity within the system. Whereas the average Gender Parity Index (GPI) is high 
(.90), some regions still have a high proportion of out-of-
school girls. For example in the “Extrême Nord” 
and “Nord” provinces, the gender parity index is below .70.  Completion rates were still very low in 
primary education. Primary Completion Rates (PCR) reached only 64 percent in 2007. High levels of 
repetition also contributed to low completion, particularly in the francophone regions. Although repetition 
is primarily a policy issue in Cameroon (rates of repetition are determined by individual schools rather 
than clear pedagogical benchmarks), low quality of education may have been a contributing factor.  
31. 
The insufficient number of teachers has contributed to low efficiency. During the 2005-2006 
school year, there were 62.1 students per primary school teacher. In addition, not all teachers had the 
Page  17
9
same qualifications. Of the three types of teachers - civil servant teachers; contract teachers and 
community teachers - only the first two categories received training. The priority actions adopted in the 
2006 ESS to improve equitable access to quality education included an increase of the number of trained 
teachers to be deployed in a more equitable manner and a reduction in repetition rates.  Financial 
simulation scenarios indicated that increasing the number of civil servant primary school teachers would 
not be financially sustainable. Consequently, the government decided to recruit contract teachers who 
were paid lower salary levels. This was the essential element of the government’s EFA-FTI Catalytic 
Fund Grant application in 2006.  
32. 
Since the Year I CF Grant was awarded, progress has been made regarding the number and 
equitable deployment of teachers. As indicated in Annex 1, pupil teacher ratios decreased by 10 points 
between 2005/2006 and 2007/2008 to 51.8.  The recruitment of an additional 13,275 contract teachers has 
contributed to this goal. In addition, over the same period there has been a drop in repetition from 28 
percent to 18 percent in francophone regions and 17 percent to 12.2 percent in Anglophone regions. This 
has been the result of the enacting automatic promotions for “sub-cycles”.   
33. 
In addition, the Government of Cameroon has shown strong commitment to sustaining the 
progress made in the education sector and intends to gradually absorb the salary of contract teachers into 
the national budget. The share of education in total public expenditure exceeded 17 percent between 2007 
and 2009, in spite of the decrease in revenues in 2009.
9
The government plans to increase this share to 
19.5 percent in 2011. In parallel, the share of basic education in total expenditure on education increased 
dramatically, from 32.5 in 2007 to 38 percent in 2009, with a peak at 41 percent in 2008. These increases 
portray the priority given to education by GoC. If the budget for education increases to approximately 20 
percent as suggested in the FTI indicative framework, the GoC will absorb contract teacher costs by 2011. 
34. 
The project will consolidate the progress achieved so far.  It will contribute to the payment of the 
salaries of 37,200 primary public school contract teachers recruited during FY07, FY08, FY09 and FY10 
during (a) the period from January 2010 through the date which is four months after the Effective Date, 
and (b) part of the remainder of the 2010 and 2011 school year 
F. 
 Technical
 
35. 
During the 1990’s, parents and communities resorted to hiring temporary teachers, paying them 
significantly less than the average GDP per capita. This arrangement led to lower quality instruction, high 
turnover and an onerous financial burden on poorer communities.  Introduced in 2007, the contract 
teacher program aimed to rapidly reduce the shortage of teachers and the very high PTRs across the 
country and replace temporary teachers financed by communities.   
36. 
Contract teachers are recruited by the government, but within a personnel management 
framework that is different than for civil servant teachers. Contract teachers can receive promotions (with 
salaries and other benefits) and after 10 years of service, some can join the regular civil servants cadre. 
The GoC also provides contract teachers with a cash component to their remuneration in lieu of a 
traditional pension. Contract teachers are also given similar benefits to regular civil servants. For 
example, contract teachers receive the same amount of allowances for professional development. In some 
cases, they have greater flexibility than civil service teachers. Contract teachers can at any point resign 
from their position, whereas regular teachers must serve for ten years before they can resign.

Education spending was reduced to 14.4 percent in 2008 because of the fluctuation in oil revenues, before 
rebounding to 17.5 percent in 2009.

37. 
Procurement:
 
The CPTs are recruited on a contract basis and as such fall under the category of 
“Service Delivery Contractors”. The procurement plan specifies the number and timing of recruitment of 
these contractors. The selection procedures, job description and terms of employment are described 
extensively in the Operations Manual and have been deemed acceptable by the Bank. For the CPTs hired 
in 2007 and 2008, compliance to these rules has been attested by the 2008 Technical Audit. For the CPTs 
hired in 2009 and 2010, compliance will be verified during supervision of the project, based on the results 
of a 2010 Technical Audit and a Specific Audit.  
38. 
Financial Management: 
This is a follow-up operation that builds on the lessons and 
achievements of the Year I CF implementation. The implementation arrangements remain almost the 
same except for a few specific requirements that are detailed in the Financial Management (FM) Annex, 
as summarized below.
 
In response to its weak Public Financial Management (PFM) system, Cameroon 
formulated a PFM Reform Strategy to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Central and Local 
Government PFM, as well as accountability processes. The 2006 PEMFAR identified weak internal 
control and weak financial reporting and treasury management that led to a high overall fiduciary risk. 
Under the phase I of CPT, the MC has put in place robust fiduciary and operational procedures for the 
recruitment, management, budgeting and payment of the contract teachers which is mainstreamed through 
the government computerized public financial management systems: SIGIPES (personnel management) 
and ANTILOPE (salary payment).  In light of this, it was agreed to rely on these country systems for the 
project while supplementing them with the financial management systems of the existing Bank-financed 
PASE project. This will ensure sound accounting, timely reporting and audits.  
39. 
The fiduciary arrangem
ents are aligned with the Government’s mechanisms and procedures 
already in place for contract teachers. Existing internal controls will apply that comprise the whole system 
of control – financial, operational or otherwise - established by the Permanent Secretariat and described in 
an operations manual. This manual has been updated to take into account the recommendations of the 
2008 Technical Audit. The PASE FM Unit will expand its computerized accounting systems so as to 
record and report on project transactions, e.g. teachers’ salary payrolls. PASE’s Internal Auditor will 
review and clear the request for reimbursement to be submitted to IDA by the project. It will also submit 
Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) to the World Bank no later than 45 days after the end of each calendar 
quarter. At the end of the project implementation, the MC with the assistance of PASE will issue the 
Project’s Financial Statements, which will be audited by the current external auditors of PASE upon an 
amendment of their contract on Terms of Reference (TORs) agreed during the negotiations. Besides a 
Specific Audit to ascertain the eligibility of the disbursement claimed under category 1 will be carried out 
and report is expected to be done by March 15, 2011. The audit reports of the project financial statements 
shall be submitted to IDA no later than 6 months after the end of the project implementation.  
40. 
Disbursement
:
Overall project funding will consist of the Year II CF Grant of $24.8 million, and 
will be used exclusively to reimburse the government for the salaries paid to contract teachers. Under 
these arrangements, the project proceeds will be used to reimburse the government for part of the salaries 
of 37,200 primary public school contract teachers recruited during FY07, FY08, FY09 and FY10 with a   
retroactive financing of up to 20 percent for salaries paid before the signature of the grant but on or after 
January 1, 2010. This will be followed by a second installment estimated at 40 percent of the grant. The 
last installment will be conditioned to a conclusive Specific Audit on the eligibility of the salaries claimed 
by MC and paid by IDA under the first and second installments. As mentioned above, the PASE external 
auditor will perform the Specific Audit (in addition to the financial statement audit) upon amendment of 
their contract and based on TORs agreed during negotiations.  
H.  
Social
 
Page  19
11 
41.  The social analysis in the PRSP identifies the urban poor, marginalized groups and the disabled as 
vulnerable populations. Marginalized groups are not uniformly distributed across the country, but vary 
according to region and tribes. Marginalization also occurs due to the fragility of the national economy 
and its dependence on exports. The movement of populations into Cameroon from neighboring countries 
as a result of conflict is also a concern and puts enormous social and economic strain on communities and 
financial resources. While the project does not address these issues directly, it will result in an increase in 
and a more equitable distribution of teachers, which is likely to have the greatest impact on disadvantaged 
areas. This focus on ensuring a better distribution of teachers will indeed benefit mostly the most 
disadvantaged schools, including the “Extreme Nord” of the country where education indicators are the 
lowest.  This is portrayed in the appointments made in 2008 and 2009 - the majority of teachers were 
allocated to the ZEP regions where they are most needed.

ANNEX 1: COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND
 
Republic of Cameroon: Education for All 
–
Fast Track Initiative -   
Support to the Education Sector 
 
This annex presents an overall description of the status of the GoC Education Sector Strategy 
(ESS), within which the program of contract teachers is located. It then summarizes the program 
of contract teachers established by the GoC and initially supported by the Year I CF Grant and to 
be supported by the project.
 
Findings of the Joint Review of the Education Sector Strategy 
45. Ownership of and commitment to the ESS in a coordinated manner have been strengthened since the 
first joint review held in April 2008.  A committee grouping the four education ministries was created and 
meets regularly to debate issues that cut across sectors and subsectors and identify appropriate responses.  
46. Each ministry has created a committee that monitors the implementation of the part of the ESS 
relative to its level of the education system.  Work plans, with annual work programs from 2009 to 2011, 
have also been established to guide actions toward achieving the ESS goals.  Furthermore, annual 
statistics for primary education have been consistently produced, together with analyses of trends.  For 
secondary and higher education, additional efforts are needed in order to produce consolidated annual 
statistics. Progress in the implementation of the ESS is presented below for each sector. 
47. 
Pre-school
:
The Government recognizes that pre-school education can prevent repetition and drop-
out in primary and post primary education and has established it as a sector priority.  The Government’s 
strategy is to rely on partnership arrangements with civil society, in particular with NGOs.  Unfortunately, 
very few results have been observed.  Planned activities to increase access, to train the teachers, to 
provide subsidies to NGOs have not produced the expected results and enrollments remain far behind 
ESS targets.  These weak outcomes are mainly the result of an inadequate legal and institutional 
framework that could allow civil society to play a more active role.  The Government acknowledges that 
immediate actions are needed to establish structures and systems that enable effective partnerships and the 
transfer of funds. 
48. 
Primary education: 
Remarkable progress has been achieved in this sector.  The completion rate has 
increased to 71 percent in 2007/2008 from 67 percent in 2006/2007. This rise is mainly the result of a 
decline in repetitions, which improved internal efficiency. The repetition rate dropped from 25 percent in 
2006/2007 to 16.8 percent in 2007/2008, surpassing targets. Several strategic actions contributed to this 
favorable outcome, notably the application of automatic promotion between the sub-cycles, increased 
pedagogical support to teachers and intensive communication campaigns. It is expected that this positive 
trend will continue.

MINEDUB has regularly produced annual statistics with guidance provided by the National 
Statistics Institute. UNESCO/ISU and OECD have also provided support and they prepared an audit in 
2008. The results have been used to strengthen the data collection and compilation process. Statistics and 
their analysis have mainly embraced the coverage side of the system, rather than learning levels. 
MINEDUB is aware of this necessity and is working with partners to establish a quality assessment 
system. A new strategy for pre-service and in-service teachers training is under consideration, as the 
comparative study of the curriculum reforms of six African countries, including Cameroon, shows that 
providing training through the cascade method is not effective.  
50. 
Secondary education
:
Construction targets have been surpassed with the construction of 1,347 
classrooms.  In addition, MINESEC has developed eight new protocols to evaluate teachers and trained 
650 pedagogical inspectors to use them.  A partnership law for the private sector has been adopted 
together with a contracting framework.  Finally, administrative personnel have been trained in modern 
management techniques to improve governance and system management. 
51. 
Cameroon, however, does not currently have a solid strategy for the future development of 
secondary education.  First, secondary education was supposed to be reformed on the basis of a law 
passed in 1998, which has yet to be signed by the President.  After ten years, it is not clear whether this 
strategy (which aimed to align the Anglophone and Francophone upper secondary systems) is still 
relevant. In addition, school statistics for this level of instruction are produced late and are of low quality.

Technical/vocational education
:
A
draft Professional Orientation and Training Law and a 
Professional Training Reference Guide have been prepared.  In addition, the Government has signed 
partnership agreements with a few socio-professional groups, and has rehabilitated and constructed some 
professional training centers. 
53. 
However, institutional, organizational, quantitative, and qualitative constraints have posed 
challenges to the development of technical and vocational training.  The budget for the subsector has 
Page  22
14 
declined since 2007, limiting its development.  Weaknesses also exist in the overall vision for the sub-
sector.  The ESS presents a linear progression of provision of training that fails to take into account any 
analysis of actual needs of the economy and the labor market.  The sub-sector also suffers from internal 
and external efficiency, lack of coordination between training institutions, weak capacity for the 
production of statistics, and limited operational capacity. 
54. Higher 
education: 
The Government has begun implementing two principal strategies of the ESS 
for higher education: regulating student intake within the context of democratizing access to higher 
education, and adapting some of the courses to the needs of the economy and labor market in order to 
improve the employability of young graduates.  
 
55. 
It has been difficult however to limit the number of students enrolled in public higher education 
institutions as originally envisaged.  The target for 2015 was 138,000 students; however, 2008 enrollment 
surpassed this figure.  The lack of a coordinated inter-ministerial strategy at the different levels of the 
system and the failure to effectively regulate student intake in humanities subjects have contributed to the 
relative lack of progress in this area. Objectives to develop and promote research and in-service teacher 
training were also not achieved, as authorities have focused on student intake issues and quality.  
 
A. 
Contract Teacher Program
 
56. 
The economic crisis in the 1980’s made it impossible for the GoC to hire civil servant teachers, 
leading to serious shortages in primary schools throughout the country.  Communities and regions had to 
resort to recruiting their own teachers. As a consequence, three types of teachers existed side by side in 
primary schools: regular civil servant teachers, teachers hired by parents (
Maîtres des parents
)
and 
temporary teachers (
Instituteurs Vacataires
). To address teacher shortages and very high PTRs within 
ongoing budgetary constraints, the GoC introduced the contract teacher program in the 1990s. However, 
the program was not sufficiently defined leading to inequitable deployment, high attrition and uneven 
performance.  
57. 
In 2000, the government adopted a more sophisticated contract teacher model. The policy 
outlined salary scales, benefits and a career path for contract teachers. The salary of contract teachers was 
set at approximately three times the average Gini per capita (Atlas method) and two-third of regular civil 
servants salary. The GoC also established a career development strategy for contract teachers, which 
includes several levels of promotion.  The GoC provides an additional payment to contract teachers in 
lieu of a guarantee of a pension. Contract teachers are also given similar benefits as regular civil servants, 
such as 18 days of leave during the school year. If they have children, contract teachers can also take two 
additional days of leave per child. If leave is not taken during the school year, contract teachers are 
allowed to cumulate the leave -- civil service teachers, on the other hand, are not allowed to cumulate 
leave. 
58. 
With the teacher contract program, the teacher workforce has increased significantly, responding 
to the teacher shortage and reducing the inequity in the distribution teachers across regions. This is 
portrayed in the appointments made in 2008 and 2009 - the majority of teachers have been allocated to the 
Zones d’Education Prioritaires
 (ZEP) regions where they are most needed.

teachers in the public education system, as well as deploying them in an equitable manner. The indicators 
will be the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios (PTR) and the reduction in the variation of PTR across 
regions. PTRs are measured by dividing the number of teachers by the number of students within regions 
and for the nation. The variation of PTR is calculated by regressing the size of specific schools against the 
number of teachers in each specific school.  
60. 
The project has one component which will contribute to the payment of the salaries of 37,200 
primary public school contract teachers recruited during FY07, FY08, FY09 and FY10 during (a) the 
period from January 2010 through the date which is four months after the Effective Date, and (b) part of 
the remainder of the 2010 and 2011 school year. The Operations Manual will be used for the 
implementation of this component, including for the hiring and paying of teacher salaries.  
61. 
The instrument will be a SIL, implemented via governmental institutions. The instrument and 
implementation arrangements provide efficient financing to a program that forms an integral part of the 
Government’s Education Sector Strategy.

62. The 
Program 
(“Opération de contractualisation”
)
consists of the recruitment of 37,200 contract 
teachers over a five year period (2007-2011), estimated to cost US$392 million (202.5 billion FCFA).  
The Program receives financial support from AFD totaling US$55 million (28.5 billion FCFA) and a 
Grant from the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund of US$47.5 million (24.5 billion FCFA). Total donor financing 
equals approximately US$103 million (53 billion FCFA), representing 26 percent of the Program cost.  
63. 
The CF Grant was split into two Grants (Year I Grant and Year II Grant).  The project financed 
under the Year I CF Grant contributed to the financing of the salary of teachers hired in 2007 and 2008, 
and was disbursed in 2008. The project financed under the Year II CF Grant continues to support the 
Program by reimbursing the government for part of the salaries for 2010 of contract teachers recruited 
between 2007 and 2010. After 2011, the salaries of these teachers will be fully covered by the national 
budget.

Achievement of the Project Development Objectives will be measured by a reduction in pupil-
teacher ratios (PTR) and a reduction in the variation of PTR across regions. PTRs are measured by 
dividing the number of teachers by the number of students within regions and for the nation. The variation 
of PTR is calculated by regressing the size of specific schools against the number of teachers in each 
specific school. It is expected that PTRs will decline from 50:1 to 48:1 and the degree of randomness in 
teacher allocations in the system from .43 to .42.

Implementation of the contract teacher program
:
The Ministry of Basic Education 
(MINEDUB) is responsible for the overall implementation and monitoring of the contract teacher 
program.  The contracting process involves different phases, starting from a communication phase with 
central and local governments, unions and the civil society at the beginning of the year, the account of 
school children and the review of teachers’ allocation to the recruitment process and the payment phase.  
Several government entities are involved in the CPT program: (i) the Prime Minister’s office, which gives 
prior approval to proceed with the contracting process; (ii) the Ministry of Public Function and 
Administrative Reform, which signs the contract; and (iii) the Ministry of Finance, which is responsible 
for budget allocations and salaries payment. To ensure efficient implementation, a Monitoring 
Committee
10
 (MC) was established under MINEDUB. The MC includes representatives from the above 
ministries, has a Permanent Secretariat headed by the Human Resources Director of MINEDUB, and is 
assisted by a Technical Secretariat. The LDPs also participate in the Committee’s working sessions. 
67. 
The staff of the Permanent Secretariat has considerable experience in human resources 
management.  In addition, an Operations Manual guides the implementation of the contract teacher 
program. The Manual specifies the procedures, roles and responsibilities of the actors involved in the 
process.  It also specifies the administrative, financial and accounting mechanisms.  The Manual was 
updated in March 2010 to reflect the recommendations of 2008 Technical Audit and that of the financial 
audit of Year I project, as well as new disbursement procedures to reimburse government payments.  
68. 
The MC is responsible for (i) ensuring the coordination of the activities of the Project; (ii) 
preparing and organizing the overall recruitment process for CPTs; (iii) managing the recruitment and 
deployment of contracted teachers, especially verifying teacher presence in schools; (iv)   monitoring 
the 
quality of the teaching; and (v)  keeping records and reporting to the development partners on all aspects 
of the Program. 
69. 
The MINEDUB is responsible for overall Project implementation and Monitoring, including (i) 
submission to the World Bank of bi-annually reports on the number and distribution of contract teachers 
who were hired, the observations of government missions to the regions within the territory of the 
Recipient, and financial information on the amounts spent by region on CPT salaries under the Program; 
(ii) preparation of progress reports of the Project.  
70. 
The MoF and the MCS shall be jointly responsible for the administrative management and 
disbursement, under the Project.  As such, the MCS shall be responsible for (i) the identification and 
selection of the contract teachers to be paid under the Program; and (ii) the signing of the contracts with 
CPTs. The MoF shall be responsible for (i) identification of the payments to be made under the Program; 
and (ii) issuance of wire transfer orders to the relevant central, regional, and prefectural level entities for 
the processing of payments. 
71.  
 
Monitoring and Evaluation of outcomes/results:  
MINEDUB also assumes the overall 
responsibility to monitor and evaluate the results of the contract teacher program.  On a bi-annual basis, 
the MINEDUB compiles the names of teachers hired, the observations of internal missions to the regions, 
and financial information.

In addition, independent procedural, technical and financial audits will be conducted to examine 
overall program implementation, including recruitment, teacher presence in classrooms, salary payment, 
and financial management of the funds dedicated to the program.

1. Summary Project Description
 
73. 
The project will be fully used to support the Government’s contract teacher program. It will 
contribute to the payment of the salaries of 37,200 primary public school contract teachers recruited 
during FY07, FY08, FY09 and FY10 during (a) the period from January 2010 through the date which is 
four months after the Effective Date, and (b) part of the remainder of the 2010 and 2011 school year. 
Project financing will consist of the Catalytic Fund (US$ 24.8 million). The French Cooperation – AFD - 
and the Government of Cameroon are also supporting the sector under parallel arrangements with 
US$55.3 million and US$290 million respectively. 
2. Country Issues 
74. 
Cameroon has formulated a PFM Reform Strategy that is supported by various development 
partners. The overall objective of the PFM Reform Strategy is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness 
of Central and Local Government PFM and accountability processes, including an increase in 
transparency in the use of public funds and reduced corruption. 
75. 
A Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) was 
conducted and issued in June 2006. The PEMFAR (incorporating PER, CFAA and CPAR) recognized 
that substantial fiduciary risks remain in the following areas: (a) absence of controls of the materiality of 
expenditures in the administrative phase of spending; (b) lack of adequate controls at the payment phase 
of spending; (c) recurrent risk related to the payroll; (d) excessive use of exceptional procedures in budget 
expenditures. The combination of weak internal control and weak financial reporting thus leads to a high 
overall fiduciary risk. The risk is systemic on treasury management since there is not independent and 
effective internal control. However, progress has been registered with the implementation of Medium-
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in some key ministries during the last decade. A Bank-assisted 
project is supporting the government to address the main PFM weaknesses cited above. 
76. 
On governance and corruption issues, the Government has initiated a series of initiatives to 
strengthen governance through the adoption of a five year National Governance program (PNG). The 
Government has established anticorruption units in all ministries and in some public agencies. Their 
activities are coordinated by a national Anticorruption Observatory under the authority of the Prime 
Minister office. Moreover, various anti-corruption institutions have been set-up in the framework of the 
HIPC program completion. Despite this progress, Cameroon has still a long way to go to overcome 
endemic corruption and improve governance as well as PFM. 
77. 
Although there are risks associated with the country environment, robust fiduciary and 
operational procedures have been put in place by the MC under the first phase of the CPT program. These 
procedures apply to the recruitment, management, budgeting and payment of the contract teachers. The 
latter is mainstreamed through the government computerized public financial management systems, 
SIGIPES (personnel management) and ANTILOPE (salary payment). In light of this, it was agreed to rely 
on these country systems for the project while supplementing them with the financial management 
systems of the existing Bank-financed PASE project. This will ensure sound accounting, timely reporting 
and audits.

for the project’s activities in light of the results of 
the 2008 technical audit of Year I of the CF Grant 
as there was no proved evidence of ghost teachers 
in the listing of personnel cleared by MC. Besides, 
the lessons learnt from the implementation of Year I 
of the CF Grant are factored in the proposed built-in 
fiduciary arrangements. In particular, under MC’s 
leadership, the government has satisfactorily 
implemented the key recommendations of the 2008 
Technical Audit and that of the financial audit of 
Year I Grant, including a reconciliation system 
between SIGIPES and ANTILOPE. In addition, the 
2010 Technical Audit currently being implemented

Strengths
:
This is a follow-up project whose main activity will consist in reimbursing part of the 
salaries of CPT teachers under same fiduciary arrangements used for Year I CF Grant. In addition, the 
fiduciary arrangements will be strengthened with the support of PASE FM Unit in the areas of 
Page  32
24 
accounting, reporting and auditing and the existence of robust operations and fiduciary procedures. No 
prior audit for this project or for any other project managed by the PASE is outstanding. 
80. 
Weaknesses and Follow-up Actions
:
The audit reports of the 
Year I of the CF Grant
 identified 
several internal controls weaknesses, including the lack of accounting records and financial reports and 
the absence of reconciliation mechanism between SIGIPES and ANTILOPE. To address these 
shortcomings, the PASE FM Unit is expanding its computerized accounting system to ensure adequate 
bookkeeping of the CPT transactions and generate the financial reports under the responsibility of the 
Permanent Secretariat. Besides, the MC has updated the operations manual taking into account the audit 
recommendations, including an adequate reconciliation mechanism between SIGIPES and ANTILOPE.  
3. Implementing entity  
81. 
The Ministry of Basic Education (MINEDUB) is ultimately responsible for the implementation 
and monitoring 
of the “
Opération de Contractualisation” 
(OC). However, the contracting process of the 
OC calls for an institutional arrangement that requires the implication of different governmental entities: 
(i) the Prime Minister's office, which gives prior approval to proceed with the contracting process; (ii) the 
Ministry of Public Function and Administrative Reform, which signs the contract; and (iii) the Ministry 
of Finance, which is responsible for budget allocations and salaries payment. To ensure efficient 
implementation, a Monitoring Committee  (MC) was established under MINEDUB. The MC includes 
representatives from the above ministries, has a Permanent Secretariat headed by the Human Resources 
Director of MINEDUB, and is assisted by a Technical Secretariat. The LDPs also participate in the 
Committee's working sessions. 
82. 
The staff of the Permanent Secretariat has considerable experience in human resources 
management.  In addition, an Operations Manual guides the implementation of the contract teacher 
program. The Manual specifies the procedures, roles and responsibilities of the actors involved in the 
process.  It also specifies the administrative, financial and accounting mechanisms.  The Manual was 
updated in March 2010 to reflect the recommendations of 2008 Technical Audit and that of the financial 
audit of Year I CF Grant, as well as new disbursement procedures to reimburse government payments.  
83. 
The MC is responsible for (i) ensuring the coordination of the activities of the Project; (ii) 
preparing and organizing the overall recruitment process for CPTs; (iii) managing the recruitment and 
deployment of contracted teachers, especially verifying teacher presence in schools; (iv) monitoring the 
quality of the teaching; and (v) keeping records and reporting to the development partners on all aspects 
of the Program. In addition, the MC reports to the development partners on all aspects of the contract 
teacher program. The development partners also participate in the MC's working sessions.  
4. Financial management and Audits  
84. 
The 2008 Technical Audit was carried out in 2008 on a representative sample of PCTs hired in 
2007 and 2008. The results of this audit highlighted several weaknesses in the recruitment process as well 
as in the recording of transactions. The audit also noted significant improvements between the two 
recruitment phases. A second technical and procedural audit is under implementation and the results will 
be published by September 2010.The main results of the 2008 audit are summarized below: 
·
The selection criteria of teachers were observed overall, even though the audit found a number of 
anomalies in 2007. This number decreased significantly in 2008. 
·
The audit showed a significant gap between the number of teachers recruited and that registered 
in 2007. This gap was reduced in 2008.  
Page  33
25 
·
The number of teachers registered but not paid was low (40 out of 13,000 in 2007 and 60 out of 
5500 in 2008). A delay at the contract signature explained this anomaly in most cases, and at the 
time of the pilot audit, MINEDUB was working to reduce this delay. 
·
The audit also showed that in 2007, 3.6% of the total CPT were registered twice. This percentage 
fell to 0.04% in 2008. Half of these teachers were also paid twice, while the situation of the other 
teachers could not be asserted. At the time of the audit, no robust system was in place to track the 
"
Bons de Caisse
"
leading to such uncertainty regarding the occurrence of double payment. 
85. 
In response to the issues identified in the auditor reports of Year I CF Grant, PASE will provide a 
technical financial management support to the Permanent Secretariat.  The FM Unit of PASE, headed by 
a
qualified Financial Manager and supported by an accountant, will collect the documents supporting 
monthly salary payroll, record the transactions under the existing computerized accounting system and 
prepare the financial reports. PASE’s Internal Auditor will review and clear the requests for 
reimbursement before submission to IDA. His role will consist mainly in double-checking supporting 
documents submitted by MC to claim the reimbursement of monthly CPT teacher salaries. The effective 
reconciliation mechanism between SIGIPES and ANTILOPE will also help secure the registration and 
payment processes. 
5. Budgeting  
86. 
The project budget is included in the government approved budget with appropriate tags for 
spending selected in the project supported by external funding. The budget is prepared and managed 
under the responsibility of the MINEDUB. The annual work program - comprising the recruitment and 
deployment plan of contract teachers and budget - is agreed, recorded and monitored through the 
Government budget and executed according to financial procedures and systems. Adequate budget 
control and control of commitments are carried out by the “
Contrôle financier
”
of the Ministry of Finance 
in accordance with the internal controls applicable to payroll in Cameroon through computerized 
information and management financial systems – SIGIPES and ANTILOPE - and other relevant 
operational and PFM controls and oversights. 
6. Accounting policies and procedures  
87. 
 Although the project envisions an approach which departs from the one used for the Year I CF 
Grant, the fiduciary arrangements are aligned with the Government’s mechanisms and procedures already 
in place for contracting teachers program. The MC is supported by a computerized tool, SIGIPES 
(
Système Informatique de Gestion Intégrée des Personnels de l’Etat et de la Solde
), that interfaces with 
the financial software ANTILOPE (
Application nationale des traitements informatiques et logistiques des 
personnels de l’Etat
)
-
the computerized system of management of State personnel’s salaries and 
pensions-for the payment phase of Government treasury system. However, given that the audit reports of 
Year I CF Grant revealed shortcomings in bookkeeping and reporting, the PASE FM Unit will maintain 
separate project accounting following its current policies based on OHADA standards, which are 
acceptable to the Bank. The existing PASE’s computerized accounting system will be expanded to record 
the transactions of this project and generate accurate financial reports in time. 
 
7. Internal control and auditing:  
88. 
Internal controls already in place include the whole systems of control, financial or otherwise, 
established by the Permanent Secretariat consistent with CPT payroll management in order to (a) carry 
out the project activities in an orderly and efficient manner, (b) ensure adherence to policies and 
Page  34
26 
procedures and (c) safeguard the funds of the project and ensure as far as possible the completeness and 
accuracy of the financial and other records. An operations manual documenting the internal controls was 
developed and used to implement the Year I Grant with a specific focus on the following: (i) segregation 
of duties, (ii) authorization and approval, (iii) clear channels of command, (iv) arithmetic and accounting 
accuracy, (v) integrity and performance of staff at all levels, and (vi) supervision involving donors. Under 
the leadership of the MC, the government is satisfactorily implementing the key recommendations of the 
2008 Technical Audit including the effectiveness of the reconciliation of data between SIGIPES and 
ANTILOPE. The Operations Manual (OM) was also updated in March 2010 taking into account the audit 
recommendations of Year I of the CF Grant.  
 8. Financial Reporting:  
89. 
On behalf of MC, PASE FM Unit will record and report on the project transactions, e.g CPT 
salary payrolls claimed for reimbursement and will then submit Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) to the 
World Bank not later than 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. At a minimum, the financial 
reports must include the following tables with appropriate comments; (i) Sources and Uses of Funds; and 
(ii) Uses of Funds by Project Activity. The format of the IFR used for PASE will apply to this project as 
agreed upon during negotiation. 
90. 
At the end of project implementation
,
PASE will prepare on behalf of MC the Proje
ct’s Financial 
Statements (PFS) comprising: (i) a statement of sources and uses of funds; (ii) Uses of Funds by Project 
Activity; (iii) accounting policies and procedures; and (iv) explanatory notes. These PFS will be subject to 
external audits as described below. 
9. External audit:  
Within 2 months after effectiveness, PASE will amend the contract of its current external auditors to audit 
the CPT as follow:  
(i) 
Specific Audit: upon the disbursement of the first and second installments, the auditors will 
audit the teachers’ salaries claimed by the government to certify their eligibility before the 
balance – if any – be released by IDA. The expected due date of this Specific Audit report is 
March 15, 2011; 
(ii) 
Project financial statement audit: within 6 months after the closing date, the auditors will 
audit the Project Financial Statements covering the project’s lifetime. The expected due date 
is June 30, 2012.  
These audits will be carried out in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and 
based on TORs acceptable to IDA. The ToRs of the audits have been agreed upon with the government 
during negotiations. The above audit reports including a management letter will be submitted to IDA as 
specified above.  
 
Disbursement Arrangements and Flow of Funds 
10. Flow of funds: 
 
91. 
The overall project funding will consist of $24.8 million. The project proceeds will be used 
exclusively to reimburse the payment of CPT teachers’ salaries claimed by the MC under the program. 
An account will be designated at the BEAC by the government into which the reimbursement will be 
Page  35
27 
wired. Detailed arrangements, including procedures regarding all financial transactions, are documented 
in the financial procedures of the Operations Manual. 
92. 
Disbursement Methods
:
The Disbursement Guidelines of May 2006 avail up to four 
disbursement methods (reimbursement, advance, direct payment and special commitment). For this 
operation, the reimbursement method will be used since the grant will reimburse the government for its 
contribution to the program. The reimbursement method is being used to partially mitigate the risk of 
diversion of funds associated with financing contract teachers’ salaries paid using government systems.  
Before submitting applications for withdrawal grant proceeds to IDA, the internal auditor will review and 
clear the supporting documents provided by MC to claim the reimbursement of monthly CPT teachers’ 
salaries. Upon effectiveness, the government will submit a first installment request, together with the 
supporting documentation, for the amount approved for retroactive financing representing not more than 
20 percent of the grant.  A second installment representing not more than 40 percent will be submitted to 
IDA with agreed supporting documentation (see below). The third and last disbursement will be 
conditioned to the Specific Audit aimed at confirming the eligibility of the teachers’ salaries paid under 
the first and second installments. The following is the tentative disbursement schedule: 
-
Installment 1
:
US$ 4,960,000 upon effectiveness 
-
Installment 2
:
US$ 9,920,000 October  2010

Counterpart funding
:
similarly to Year I CF Grant, GoC is committed to support the education 
sector by contributing its own resources. Under this project, GoC pays the monthly salaries to contract 
teachers before seeking with IDA the reimbursement of catalytic fund contributions for a fraction of the 
overall CPT cost. 
94. 
Retroactive Financing
:
The grant will be disbursed on a retroactive financing basis up to the 
allowed limit of 20 percent of the grant (US$4.96 million equivalent) for contract teachers’ salaries paid 
by the government during calendar year 2009/2010 and before the grant agreement date but on or before 
January 1, 2010. 
95. 
Types of Supporting Documentation: 
the Bank requires copies of the original documents 
evidencing monthly payments of teachers’ salaries to be provided by the Technical Secretariat 
(“Records”) or summary reports of such payments (“Summary Reports”). Disbursements will be 
supported by customized Statements of Expenditures (SOE) summarizing eligible teachers’ salaries paid 
during a stated period. The SOE will be certified by MC and cleared by the internal auditor. In all cases, 
the Permanent Secretariat will be responsible for ensuring that the original documents evidencing the 
eligible teachers’ salaries are available for accounting, audit or inspection. 
Page  36

96. 
Financial covenants: 
financial covenants are the standard ones as described in the legal 
documents and are comprised of maintaining project accounts in accordance with sound accounting 
practices, audit requirements and records well kept and secured.  
97. 
Fraud and corruption
:
Though the risk of fraud and corruption within the country is high in 
general, it is considered Moderate for the project’s activities in light of the results of the 2008 Technical 
Audit and that of the Financial Audit of Year 1 CF Grant as there was no proved evidence of ghost 
teachers in the CPT listing of personnel cleared by MC. The stringent procedures for the recruitment and 
monitoring of the contract teachers program are strong deterrents against the risk of fraud and corruption. 
Besides, the lessons learnt from the implementation of Yr.1 CF Grant are factored in the proposed built-in 
fiduciary arrangements. In particular, under MC’s leadership, the government has satisfactorily 
implemented the key recommendations of the 2008 Technical Audit and that of the Financial Audit of 
Year 1 CF Grant including a reconciliation system between SIGIPES and ANTILOPE. The 2010 
Technical Audit will be used by the external auditors to certify the eligibility of teachers’ salaries for 
which reimbursement is claimed by the MC. In addition, the reimbursement method and auditing 
arrangements will contribute to mitigate the risk of fraud and corruption. 
98. 
Conclusion and Supervision Plan
:
the project will be supervised using a risk-based approach. 
Supervision will review the acceptability of FM system to ensure that the project resources are used for 
the intended purposes and provide support where needed. Based on the current risk, which is moderate, 
the project will be supervised once a year.

Annex 7:  Procurement Arrangements 
Republic of Cameroon: Education for All 
–
Fast Track Initiative -   
Support to the Education Sector 
 
Guidelines
:
99. Procurement for this project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank 
“Guidelines:  Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers”, dated May 
2004 and revised in October 2006 and May 2010, and the provisions stipulated in the Grant 
Agreement. The general description of various items under different expenditure category is 
described below.  No procurement related to works, goods and non-consulting services is foreseen 
under this grant. For each contract to be financed by the grant under consultant selection methods, 
estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time-frame would be agreed between the Recipient 
and the Bank Task Team in the procurement plan.   
Advance contracting and retroactive financing
:
100. In order to accelerate program implementation, the borrower has expressed its intention to 
proceed with the initial steps of procurement before signing the related Financial Agreement. The 
procurement procedures, including advertising, have been done in accordance with the Bank’s 
Guidelines in order for the eventual contracts to be eligible for Bank financing, and the normal 
review process by the Bank will be followed in accordance with the Consultant Guidelines. 
Procurement plan:  
101. The Monitoring Committee has finalized the procurement plan. The team has been informed that 
all the candidates have already been recruited. All the recruitments of the CPTs will be treated on 
the post procurement review basis. There will be no need for the procurement plan to be updated. 
Selection of consultants  
102. The CPTs are recruited on an individual consultant contract basis and as such fall under the 
category of the paragraph 3.21-“Service Delivery Contractors” of the Consultants Guidelines. The 
teachers’ recruitment process is based on a group advert, depending on the needs. Only consultants 
who meet the requirements stated in the advert will be selected. The selection procedures and 
terms of employment are described extensively in the Operations Manual and are summarized 
below: 
 86.5 205.1  8.0   5.9   0 : x\03
Selection Procedures
: The process starts by assessing the needs at the local level, based on 
the existing number of teachers and enrolment. The MC then decides on the number of positions 
to be open in each school, taking into account the objective of reducing the gap in PTR across 
regions. Based on this, MINEDUB publishes a call for application, detailing the modalities for 
applying, including the criteria used for the selection. Awareness campaigns are carried out to 
ensure that the call for application reaches every region in the same way. After all the applications 
are received and analyzed by MINEDUB, a ranking is performed taking into account the criteria 
defined beforehand, including years of experience, and diploma obtained. The final decision is 
made by matching the candidates’ choices with open positions. The list of hired candidates is then 
made public by local and central entities of MINEDUB.

Technical audits and supervision missions 
103. The Bank will exercise quality control. It is understood that control mechanisms, including 
reporting will be done on the existence and performance of the teachers. This will be done during 
supervision missions and through technical audits. The selection procedures, job description and 
terms of employment will be deemed acceptable by the Bank. For the CPTs Teachers hired in 
2007 and 2008, compliance to these rules has been attested by the 2008 Technical Audit. For the 
CPTs Teachers hired in 2009 and 2010, compliance will be verified during supervision of the 
project, based on the results of the 2010 Technical Audit as well as that of the Specific Audit.   
Fraud and Corruption:  
104. The MINEDUB/the Monitoring Committee, the PASE as well as CPT teachers shall observe the 
highest standard of ethics during the procurement and execution of contracts financed under the 
program in accordance with paragraphs paragraphs 1.22 & 1.23 of the Consultants Guidelines.

 In 2010, the EFA-FTI CF Grant will contribute to financing 25.6% of the total cost of the OC. Therefore, it is 
estimated that the Grant will cover the same percentage of the salary of each cohort of CPTs. The Estimated cost of 
each cohort is thus obtained by multiplying the total salary cost of that cohort by the share of the total OC cost in 
2010 financed by the Grant (25.6%).

Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis 
Republic of Cameroon: Education for All 
– Fast Track Initiative -   
Support to the Education Sector 
 
106. 
The government adopted a PRSP in 2003 in which it undertook to accelerate economic 
diversification and boost GDP growth; these objectives are however threatened by the global economic 
crisis, as well as the over-reliance of the economy on oil revenues. Based on the 2005 macroeconomic 
previsions, the government’s objective was to progressively increase real GDP growth to at least 7 
percent per annum. This would allow an increase in real GDP per capita by approximately 3 to 4 percent, 
which is deemed the minimum necessary to significantly reduce poverty and reach the MDGs. The 
government expected average annual GDP growth to be above 5 percent during the period 2008-2015. 
Economic growth accelerated to 4.1 percent in 2008, up from 3.4 percent in 2007 as a result of good 
results in the oil sector, ongoing infrastructure work, increased energy supply and programs to boost 
agriculture, livestock and fisheries. It is expected however to slow to 3.1 percent in 2009 because the 
global recession pushed down prices and demand for the country’s main commodity exports (chiefly oil, 
wood, cotton and rubber). The vulnerability of the economy to such exogenous shocks is exacerbated by 
its dependence on oil and a major challenge facing the government in 2009 is to increase revenue from 
the non-oil sector. 
 
107. 
The role of human capital as a key driver of economic growth and social development is 
reinforced in this economic context. With the decline in oil production, future growth depends on an 
increased share of the tertiary sector in the overall economy, in particular manufacturing activities. 
Education has thus a key role to play in promoting the development of these sectors, and beyond, to 
accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction. The government’s PRSP, which was developed in 
2003, acknowledged the importance of human capital development for poverty reduction and the various 
progress reports published since.  The 2009 Growth and Employment Strategy reaffirmed the role played 
by the education sector in economic and social development in Cameroun. 
108. 
However, progress towards Education for All remains slow: low internal efficiency and inequity 
is still pervasive. Gross Enrolment Ratio surpassed 100 percent in 2005, meaning that the primary 
education system had the overall capacity to enroll all 6-11 year old Cameroonians. However, this hid 
considerable inequity within the system. Whereas the average Gender Parity Index is high in Cameroon 
(0.90), some regions were lagging behind with high proportion of girls still out-of-school. For example in 
the “Extrême Nord” and “Nord” provinces, the gender parity index was below 0.70.  Primary completion 
rates were still very low in primary education, only reaching 64 percent. High levels of repetition 
contributed to low completion, particularly for the Francophone schools. Although repetition is primarily 
a policy issue in Cameroon (rates of repetition are determined by individual schools rather than clear 
pedagogical benchmarks), quality is globally quite low at the primary level (CSR, 2003).
12
 
109. 
According to the GoC Education Sector Strategy the insufficient number of teachers is a key 
contributing factor to the low efficiency of the sector. During the 2005-2006 school year, there were 62 
students per primary school teachers. In addition, not all teachers have the same qualifications. Cameroon 
had three types of teachers: civil servant teachers; contract teachers and community teachers.  Only the 
first two categories received training. The priority actions adopted in 2005 were to: (i) increase the 
number of trained teachers, ensuring a more equitable deployment; and (ii) adopt new policies that would

reduce primary education repetition rates; and initiate the Contract Teacher Program.
13
  These were the 
essential elements of the government’s EFA-FTI CF Grant application in 2005.  
110. 
Since the Year I CF Grant was awarded in 2006, progress has been made regarding the number 
and deployment of teachers. As indicated in Annex 1, pupil teacher ratios decreased by 10 points between 
2005/2006 and 2007/2008, reaching 52.  The recruitment of an additional 13,275 contract teachers under 
the Year I Grant has largely contributed to this goal. In addition, over the same period, there has been a 
large drop in repetition from 28 percent to 18 percent and 17 percent to 12.2 percent in Francophone and 
Anglophone regions, respectively.  This has been the result of the implementation of changes in repetition 
policies to have automatic promotions for “sub-cycles” (grades 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6).   
111. 
In addition, the Government of Cameroon has shown strong commitment to sustaining the 
progress made in the education sector and intends to gradually absorb the salary of contract teachers into 
the national budget. The share of education in total public expenditure exceeded 17 percent between 2007 
and 2009, although the actual spending declined to about 14 .4 percent in 2008 as a result of the 
fluctuation in oil revenues. In spite of the decrease in revenues in 2009, the allocation for education in 
total public spending remained high at 17.5 percent. In addition, the government has planned to increase 
this share to 19.5 percent in 2011. In parallel, the share of basic education in total expenditure on 
education increased dramatically, from 32.5 in 2007 to 28 percent in 2009, with a peak at 41 percent in 
2008. These increases reflect the priority given to education by GoC. If the budget for education increases 
to around 20 percent as suggested in the FTI indicative framework, GoC will be in a position to absorb 
contract teachers cost by 2011.

 Since increasing the number of primary school teachers would not be financially sustainable if they were hired as 
civil servants at existing pay levels, all new teachers were hired under contract.

World Bank: 
Education Development Capacity Building Project
:  The Project was restructured in April 2010 
to restate its objective and revise the indicators to be coherent with the stated objective.  The 
restructured Project is designed to build capacity that will support the development and 
implementation of Cameroon’s Education Sector Strategy.  In that context, the higher level 
objective is to establish a culture of strategic management and planning within the education 
sector to identify needed reforms and ensure their effective implementation.  To contribute to 
this higher level objective, the Project development objective is to develop and apply 
management and learning tools for use by government and communities to improve efficiency 
and accountability within the Cameroon education sector.  
French Development Agency: 
Program C2D « Contrats de Désendettement et de 
Développement».  
Under the C2D Cameroon continues to service the remaining debt, but France refinances the 
same amount through grants. The resources thereby released are allocated to jointly-identified 
priorities in the country’s poverty reduction strategy. The first global C2D contract between 
France and Cameroon was signed in June 2006. It covers an amount of Euro 537 million over a 
five year period (2007 to 2011) and will be distributed to five main areas: infrastructure (roads 
and urban development), rural development (agriculture, food security), environment and 
biodiversity, primary education, and health including HIV/AIDS. 
The Education component of the C2D provides  40 million Euros for the implementation of the 
Sector Strategy: 37.5 million Euros to be disbursed over 5 years as budget support targeted to the 
cost of contract teachers (through its Contrat de Désendettement et de développement, C2D); and 
2.5 million Euros for institutional strengthening. Support to the teachers’ recruitment program is 
done in collaboration with the international EFA-FTI CF. Budget support totaling FCFA 24.6 
billion combined with EFA and national resource funding have allowed the Ministry of Basic 
Education to start recruiting 13,300 new contract teachers since January 2007. The Ministry 
plans to recruit more than 25,000 new teachers over the next five years, in order to increase 
primary school enrollment while improving the quality of education, and ultimately achieve 
universal primary education in Cameroon. Resources from C2D also contribute to strengthening 
the management and the reform steering capacities of the Ministry of Basic Education, as well as 
developing a partnership between the Government and private schools. They will also contribute 
to upgrading education services in several key geographical areas.
