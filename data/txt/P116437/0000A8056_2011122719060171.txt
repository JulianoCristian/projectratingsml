                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress meeting the Project Development Objectives has been moderately unsatisfactory. The Grant reimburses part of primary contract teacher salaries for the school year
                         2009/2010 and 2010/2011. During this period another 7,100 contract teachers were hired under the primary contract teachers program, bringing the total to 37,200 contract teachers
                         recruited since 2007. The number of teachers hired under the contract teachers program conformed to the program document, and their distribution across Cameroon was broadly
                         aligned with the Program objective to reduce inequality in teachers' allocation. The deployment of teachers in areas where the Pupil Teacher Ratio was the highest contributed to
                         decreasing the degree of randomness from 42% in 2007 to 35% in 2010. It is worth noting that most of this decrease took place before project implementation since the degree of
                         randomness was already 35% in 2009. Despite the large number of contract teachers hired, the Pupil Teacher Ratio decreased only slightly from 53:1 in 2009 to 52:1 in 2010
                         because the increase in the number of pupils enrolled in primary school was larger than anticipated. Figures for 2011 will only be available early 2012 at which point achievement of
                         the final PDO targets can be assessed more precisely.

                         Project implementation has been moderately unsatisfactory. The project encountered significant disbursement delays, and the first two installments, for a total of US$15.46 million
                         were disbursed on November 08, 2011, more than six months later than envisaged. These delays are putting at risk disbursement of the last tranche in view of the Grant closing on
                         December 31, 2011. Administrative bottlenecks and limited capacity within the Government to prepare withdrawal applications held back disbursements for several months
