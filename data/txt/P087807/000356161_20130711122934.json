"Ratings for the Mine Closure,\n            Environmental and Socio-Economic Regeneration Project for\n            Romania were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory and borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            It is important to consult and involve the community in the\n            mine closure process. Before and during the mine closure\n            process, meetings were held regularly with the neighboring\n            communities both to keep them informed and to solicit\n            feedback and inputs. Support socio-economic regeneration\n            schemes that actively engage the community as a whole and\n            help bring people together. The success of socioeconomic\n            regeneration beyond the life of the project depends to a\n            great extent on the local communities' involvement and\n            endorsement. Bureaucratic procedures that are functioning\n            reasonably well should not be changed in the middle of\n            project implementation. Delegate and empower field\n            supervision to ensure a consistent level of quality\n            throughout the implementation phases. Mine closure project\n            duration should take into consideration the complexity of\n            the types of included mines."}, "docdt": "2013-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
