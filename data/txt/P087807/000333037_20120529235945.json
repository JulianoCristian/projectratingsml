The\n            extension is necessary to enable the completion of 16\n            municipal infrastructure investments under the socioeconomic\n            regeneration component, as well as to finalize civil works\n            under the mine closure component, on three environmentally\n            hazardous former mining sites - Vermesti, Baia Borsa, and\n            Deva.  Work is currently on-going on these sites and the\n            additional time is required to ensure a fully safe\n            completion. The remaining work at the Vermesti site is a\n            drainage and flood protection channel which was agreed with\n            the Requestors in the context of a partial inspection panel\n            investigation.  The work was initially delayed due to lack\n            of financing from the budget in earlier years, and more\n            recently because of complex implementation issues, in\n            particular the need to coordinate the work schedule with the\n            National Railroad Company under whose tracks the drainage\n            and flood protection channel will pass. There are no overdue\n            audits and previous audit reports have been found\n            satisfactory to the Bank.  Overall financial management is\n            rated satisfactory."}, "docdt": "2012-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
