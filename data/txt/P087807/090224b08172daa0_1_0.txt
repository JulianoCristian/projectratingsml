                         The Project Development Objectives (PDO) in the Loan Agreement is to strengthen the government's ability to undertake mining sector reform by (i) building MEC's
                         capacity for closing uneconomic mining enterprises through support for closing complex mines and ancillary facilities in an environmentally sustainable manner; and
                         (ii) providing support to mining communities and local public authorities for socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions through central entities."

                         environmental stewardship, technical methodologies underscoring these approaches, learning and capacity enhancement through training related to efficiencies in implementation of

                         evidenced by the 98 legal codicils specific to mining activities and mine closure proposed and passed through the efforts of the Project PMU which include 3 laws, 2 emergency
                         Government ordinances and 2 Government ordinances as general legislation adopted.

                         The Socioeconomic Regeneration Component has supported local economic development in localities severely affected by mine closures by addressing social and economic
                         primary concerns. Many of the end of project targets under the SER Component have been exceeded and include: seven times the target value in the average percentage increase in
                         own revenues of local budgets in the operating area; strategic development plans developed in a participatory manner in 50% more LPAs than projected in targets; 245 social
                         development schemes for mining communities (target was 144), 646 small grant schemes (target was 350), and 42 completed municipal infrastructure sub-projects (target was 30).
