                                  Restructuring Paper


1.      This paper proposes an extension of the Closing Date of The Romania Mine
Closure, Environment & Socio Economic Regeneration Project from May 30, 2012 until
October 31, 2012. There are no changes to the project development objective, outcomes
or the results monitoring framework, environmental assessment (EA) category, and no
additional safeguards have been triggered. The proposed five month extension is
pursuant to the Borrower’s letter dated April 12, 2012 which requested a six month
extension of the project Closing Date.

2.      Overall project implementation remains satisfactory and the PDOs are expected to
be achieved by the revised Closing Date. The Mine Closure Component has successfully
closed 24 mines and mining enterprises, which exceeds the target of 20. This number
will increase to 27 by the revised Closing Date. Most of the end of project targets under
the Socioeconomic Regeneration Component will also be met or exceeded by the revised
Closing Date, including: 245 social development schemes for mining communities
(target was 160), 522 small grant schemes (target was 350), and at least 41 completed
municipal infrastructure subprojects (target was 30).

3.       The proposed extension is necessary to enable the completion of 16 municipal
infrastructure investments under the Socioeconomic Regeneration Component, as well as
to finalize civil works under the Mine Closure Component, on three environmentally
hazardous former mining sites - Vermesti, Baia Borsa, and Deva. Work is currently on-
going on these sites and the additional time is required to ensure a fully safe completion.
The remaining work at the Vermesti site is a drainage and flood protection channel which
was agreed with the Requestors in the context of a Partial Inspection Panel investigation.
The work was initially delayed due to lack of financing from the budget in earlier years,
and more recently because of complex implementation issues, in particular the need to
coordinate the work schedule with the National Railroad Company under whose tracks
the drainage and flood protection channel will pass.

4.      This will be the third extension of the project. The first extension was provided
for 18 months, and extended the Closing Date from May 31, 2010 to November 30, 2011.
A second six-month extension was approved, until May 30, 2012, and was combined
with a cancellation requested by the Borrower of US$ 31,089,780 from Loan proceeds.
The Loan amount was thereby revised from US$120,000,000 to US$ 88,910,220
effective November 28, 2011.

5.      There are no overdue audits and previous audit reports have been found
satisfactory to the Bank. Overall financial management is rated Satisfactory.
