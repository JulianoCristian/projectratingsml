                         The objective of the project is to reduce system losses and improve revenue collection in electricity distribution companies in Mongolia. A central emphasis of the
                         project is to improve the reliability and financial sustainability of electricity distribution companies, so that consumers are provided reliable, high-quality distribution
                         services by commercially-operated distribution utilities.

                         Under the additional financing, the project has continued to progress toward meeting its development objectives of reducing system losses and improving revenue collection. This is
                         reflected in the continued reduction in system losses of just over three percent (from 22.0 percent to about 18.7 percent in Ulaanbaatar) since the end of 2010, and in additional
                         billings amounting to some MNT 150 million (in respect of one months’ consumption), of which about MNT 100 million has been collected.

                         Contracts for all major supply and install works and purchasing of equipment have now been finalized, and contractors are manufacturing and delivering equipment. Negotiations for
                         distribution and transmission planning software are ongoing and contracts are expected to be signed in April 2012. These additional works and equipment will allow the project to
                         move closer to achieving the PDO.
