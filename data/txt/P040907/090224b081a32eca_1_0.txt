                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to reduce system losses and improve revenue collection in electricity distribution companies in Mongolia. A central emphasis of the
                         project is to improve the reliability and financial sustainability of electricity distribution companies, so that consumers are provided reliable, high-quality distribution
                         services by commercially-operated distribution utilities.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Under the additional financing, the project has continued to progress toward meeting its development objectives of reducing system losses and improving revenue collection. This is
                         reflected in the continued reduction in system losses of just under four percentage points (from 22.0 percent to about 18.1 percent in Ulaanbaatar) since the end of 2010.
                         Furthermore, the financial situation of the Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution Network (UBEDN) has improved in part due to the reduction of average time of outstanding billing
                         collections from 42 days in 2010 to 30 days in November 2012.

                         Contracts for the major supply and installation contracts are either completed or in the late stages of implementation. These additional works and equipment are allowing the project
                         to meet Ulaanbaatar’s ever growing demand for electricity, as evidenced by strong annual growth in additional customer sales.
