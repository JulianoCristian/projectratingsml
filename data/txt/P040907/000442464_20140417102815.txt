F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the project is to reduce system losses and improve revenue collection in
electricity distribution companies in Mongolia. A central emphasis of the project is to improve
the reliability and financial sustainability of electricity distribution companies, so that consumers
are provided reliable, high-quality distribution services by commercially-operated distribution
utilities.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Mongolia's district heat and electric power system is a critical part of the country's basic
infrastructure. It provides the heating needs for much of the urban population in one of the
coldest climates in the world, and electricity supply for mining activities, and other industrial,
public, commercial and household consumers. At the time of appraisal, the central system was
based upon five coal-fired combined heat-and-power (CHP) plants of Russian design for base
load operation and was interconnected by a 220 kV line with Russia's Siberian grid. The central
system serviced Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan, Baganuur, Erdenet and six surrounding aimags
(provinces), accounting for about 90 percent of total electricity use and the bulk of the country's
district heating. Small towns (aimag centers) outside of the central system were either serviced
by small coal-fired CHP plants and district heating systems (such as in Choibalsan in eastern
Mongolia), or various combinations of coal-fired heat-only boilers and diesel-fueled power
generation sets. The central system and aimag power systems were managed by the Energy
Authority1, an umbrella institution comprised of a number of subsidiary energy enterprises or
departments.

The country’s coal-power-heat supply system was in poor condition, and was unable to meet the
basic supply requirements of industrial and commercial enterprises or the urban population.
Power supply was marred by voltage and frequency fluctuations, unscheduled outages, load
shedding and power rationing. In the Ulaanbaatar distribution system, electricity losses totaled
about 33 percent, compared to 8-15 percent in other Asian cities. Losses in the electricity
distribution systems in the aimag centers were typically even higher, reaching 50 percent in some
cases. It was imperative that these problems be addressed to improve the financial condition of
the electric power industry and to provide the stable and reliable revenue in-flow necessary to
enable sector restructuring. At the same time, in the period 1990-98, electricity demand had
grown at about 8.3 percent, and demand was expected to increase modestly over the medium-
term.

Government Objectives for the Power Supply System. Mongolia's main development objective
for the power supply system was to improve the reliability, quality and cost-effectiveness of
electricity supply. For the central system, key issues included the need to:
• continue the rehabilitation of coal production, electricity and heat distribution facilities to
    ensure a stable supply of energy to meet basic demand;

  Energy Authority: Established by Resolution No. 300 dated December 5, 1996, issued by the Minister of
Infrastructure pursuant to Parliamentary Resolution No. 40 of December 1996, on Administrative Structure of
Government, responsible for implementing the energy policy of the Ministry of Infrastructure throughout Mongolia.
It was dissolved in 2001. See footnote 3.


                                                                                                                1
•   improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the system, and reduce high system losses
    through involvement of modern technology and adoption of commercially-based utility
    management practices;
• improve the financial viability of the sector through improved revenue collection (including
    improved metering, billing, and theft control), more efficient financial management, and
    tariff adjustments; and
• improve operational efficiency and provide peak-load capacity to complement the existing
    base-load capacity.
For the aimag 2 center systems in particular, the most pressing needs were for investment,
training and technical assistance (TA) to: (a) avoid further dangerous supply disruptions and
improve system reliability to ensure energy for basic human needs and to allow development of
income-generating activities; (b) reduce the high costs of supply through efficiency
improvements; and (c) improve financial viability by introducing measures to reduce losses,
improve efficiency and improve financial management.

Institutional and Sector Reforms. At the time of project appraisal, the Government of Mongolia
(GOM) had made some progress in laying the foundations for market-based sector operations by:
(a) abandoning the previous centrally planned sector structure and achieving institutional
separation of government policy making, public ownership, and enterprise management and
operations; (b) developing joint public/private shareholding companies; and (c) initiating efforts
to increase private sector participation in new project development. Moreover, the Energy Law,
approved by Parliament on February 1, 2001, separated policy, regulatory and operational roles
while creating the first incentives for private sector participation.

Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Project was designed to address selected issues mentioned
above through an integrated program of TA and physical investments. It was aligned with
GOM’s sector strategy and directly supported one of the four primary Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS, IDA\R98-38, discussed on June 2, 1998) objectives: to develop and upgrade
infrastructure to support private sector growth and market development and improve the living
conditions of the poor by improving access to services and increasing efficiency gains,
particularly in energy and water supply. The Bank’s continued support was considered key for
completing the transformation and reform of the power sector in Mongolia, where the need for
international assistance was evident.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

In the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the objective of the project was “to reduce system
losses and improve revenue collection in the electricity distribution companies in Mongolia”.
However, in both the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and Project Paper for Additional
Financing (AF), the objective of the project was stated as: (1) to reduce electricity system losses
and improve service reliability in electricity distribution in Ulaanbaatar and selected aimag

  An “aimag” is a province of the Borrower. “Aimag utilities” refers, collectively, to entities responsible for
providing electricity and heat services at the aimag level.


                                                                                                                  2
centers; (2) to improve revenue collections in the electricity distribution system; and (3) to build
up institutional capacity to move toward a more commercial and market-based energy sector.
For the purposes of this evaluation, the PDO specified in the DCA will be used.

The key performance indicators included measurable indicators of improvement in distribution
system's loss reduction, and improved financial performance:
    • Selected indices of electricity supply, quality, and reliability (e.g. number of forced
       outages in certain service areas, and among consumer categories.);
    • Decline in disruptions to production and supply of basic needs (heat, water) due to
       inadequate electricity supply; and
    • Selected indices of the improved costs effectiveness of electricity supply. However the
       Project Design Summary did not provide concrete indices of improved costs
       effectiveness.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO and the four key indicators were not revised. However, the Project Paper for the AF
used the DCA formulation of the PDO and introduced “Increased reliability of and access to
electricity supply” as an additional outcome/impact indicators and three sets of additional output
indicators:

•   1(a) Additional consumer capacity served from new developments; 1(b) reduced system
    losses; and 1(c) outstanding collections (days);
• 2(a) and (b) Distribution and transmission load flow programs operational; and 2 (c)
    Development proposals prepared systematically; and
• 3 Number of staff trained in specialized areas.
In addition, the KPIs for UBEDN and aimags were finalized in 2005 and the original target of
system losses in UBEDN was revised to 18% at the time of the additional financing, as the
original target was deemed too ambitious after detailed loss calculations were carried out.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries were power consumers (households and businesses) in the project areas
that were provided with more reliable and high quality distribution services, and project targeted
distribution companies that benefited from reductions in system losses and improved financial
performance. In particular, the project improved the living conditions for the poor population
located in project aimags (UBEDN, Phase I aimags Bayankhongor, Gobi-Altai, Umnugobi,
Dornod, Huvsgui, and Suhbaatar, and Phase II aimags Hobd, Ubs, and Bayan-Olgii), where
economic activity was depressed and unemployment and poverty rates were high.

Over the course of project implementation, the implementation arrangements changed several
times (see Section 1.7 below). The following institutions received project TA: Energy
Regulatory Agency (ERA, now Energy Regulatory Commission ERC), all project distribution
companies (UBEDN, and Phase I and Phase II amaigs), and the PIU. With the AF, an additional

                                                                                                       3
institution, the Central Region Electricity Transmission Company (CRETC, also called National
Power Transmission Company NPTC), benefited from training in investment planning.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution (US$23 million in total, Bank financing
US$18.7 million or 81.3% of total). The purpose of this component was to reduce losses and
improve revenue collection, improve the efficiency and reliability of the electricity distribution
system in the capital city, and to commercialize the operations of the Ulaanbaatar Electricity
Distribution Office 3 (UBEDO). Component 1financed the following: (a) purchase and
installation of new meters for customers already supplied electricity without meters, and
replacement of existing customer meters with new UBEDO meters; (b) reconductoring bare
conductors in the low-voltage system with insulated wire; (c) new installation and replacement
of distribution transformers; (d) mid-voltage step-up (6 kV to 10 kV) in the Domod I substation
area; (e) purchase of hardware, software, technical assistance and training to commercialize and
implement a re-engineering of UBEDO customer business procedures, especially meter reading,
billing, money collection and customer account management; (f) implementation of a public
campaign on new customer service initiatives and against power theft; (g) purchase of spare parts,
safety equipment and measurement tools; (h) training and technical assistance (TA) on project
management, power distribution company management, financial management, technical skills
and energy economics, and (i) about $1.2 million of unallocated investments to be financed by
IDA and used by UBEDO as needs arose during implementation to meet the PDO subject to
IDA approval of sub-project feasibility reports.

Component 2: Aimag Energy (US$13.2 million in total, Bank financing US$10.5 million or
80% of total). The purpose of Component 2 was to reduce system and financial losses in the
aimag electricity operations, along with improving the reliability of electricity services to meet
the basic needs of the aimag centers’ population. Component 2 financed the following:
electricity system rehabilitation and loss reduction in 12-14 aimag centers, and energy system
rehabilitation in Choibalsan, Domod aimag, to complement the recently completed power plant
rehabilitation project of Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (German bilateral assistance, KfW). The
support for the aimag center electricity rehabilitation and loss reduction program included
equipment and material for the highest priority areas of network rehabilitation, installation of
new electricity meters in apartments and commercial buildings, and training in network design,
proper installation of equipment, power system loss reduction and basic financial management.

Component 3: Technical Assistance for Regulatory Support and Financial Audits (US$0.8
million in total, Bank financing US$0.8 million). The purpose of this component was twofold:
(a) to provide support to develop the Energy Regulatory Authority. Focus was to be put into
building the institutional capacity at the regulatory agency to properly discharge its mandate to

3
  UBEDO: Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution Office, the affiliate of the Energy Authority responsible for the distribution of
electricity throughout the city of Ulaanbaatar. After EA was dissolved in 2001, Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution Network
Company (UBEDN), established and operating under Mongolia’s law, pursuant to its charter dated September 12, 2001 and the
Government Resolution No. 203, dated July 9, 2001, became responsible for the distribution of electricity throughout the city of
Ulaanbaatar.


                                                                                                                                   4
implement and enforce the newly enacted Energy Law, particularly development of any
necessary subsidiary legislation, tariff level and rate structure analysis, financial analysis for
utilities regulation, and transition to market based electricity systems including needed analytical
tools; and (b) to conduct annual audits under acceptable international accounting standards of the
Energy Authority's financial statements, and the Energy Project's Financial Statements by an
independent external auditor in accordance with International Standards of Auditing over the life
of the project.

1.6 Revised Components

Under the AF approved on March 25, 2010, three components were added:

Component 4: UBEDN Investments (US$11.2 million in total, Bank financing US$10.7
million or 96% of total). Component 4 focused on carrying out critical investments in
UBEDN’s distribution network. Many of UBEDN’s substations contained aged and obsolete
switchgear that was unreliable and posed fire hazards. Out of 35 kV equipment, 22 obsolete oil-
filled circuit breakers were to be replaced by modern SF6 circuit breakers, and of the 6kV and
10KkV equipment, 177 obsolete oil-filled circuit breakers were to be replaced with vacuum
circuit breakers. The project was also to provide additional substation capacity and flexible
switching substations to enhance the distribution network, supply the expected new loads and
improve system reliability. Some urgent maintenance equipment would be procured such as a
35kV mobile cable testing equipment and a cable pulling machine to facilitate cable-laying.

Component 5: Development of Distribution Network Planning (US$1.0 million in total,
fully Bank financed). Component 5 focused on developing the planning and design capabilities
of UBEDN and the CRETC in order to prepare more efficient and structured investment plans
for the distribution and transmission networks in Ulaanbaatar and the Central region. UBEDN
and CRETC would carry out planning studies using new state-of-the art software financed by the
project. In addition external consultants would carry out (a) a condition assessment of the central
regions 6kV, 10kV and 35kV distribution substations and the extensive cable and overhead line
network to determine all rehabilitation and replacement needs; (b) estimation of load growth in
various parts of the city and development of a reliable load forecast for each subarea of the city;
(c) development of a cost of supply including long-run marginal cost; and (d) preparation of
appropriate design standards to replace former Soviet Union standards that were still in use.

Component 6: Capacity Building for UBEDN and Project Management ($0.3 million in
total, fully Bank-financed). Component 6 was designed to sustain and enhance the financial and
operational improvements achieved to-date and the institutionalization of efficient system
planning work for distribution and transmission development. It would (a) improve the
capability of UBEDN to use the new software tools being introduced under Component 5; and
(b) include training programs to improve the project management capabilities and accounting
practices of the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MMRE) to further develop the loss
reduction exercises carried out under the original part of the project.




                                                                                                   5
The total cost of the new components was US$12.5 million. With these new activities the
project cost increased from US$49.5 million estimated at appraisal to US$62 million upon
approval of the AF.

1.7 Other significant changes

Implementation arrangements. Due to changes in GOM’s structure, the line ministry and
management of the PIU changed five times during implementation. When the DCA was signed
in August 2001, the Energy Authority (EA) was the implementing agency with oversight of the
PIU. Eventually the PIU was housed under the Fuel and Energy Authority (2002-2003), later
changed to the Ministry of Fuel and Energy (2004-2008), which became MMRE between 2008
and 2012, and the Ministry of Energy from 2012 to 2013.

UBEDO, affiliate of the Energy Authority, was responsible for the distribution of electricity
throughout the city of Ulaanbaatar before 2001. After EA was dissolved in 2001, Ulaanbaatar
Electricity Distribution Network Company (UBEDN), established and operating under
Mongolia’s law, became responsible for the distribution of electricity throughout the city of
Ulaanbaatar.

New Activities Introduced in November 2006. Project savings of US$18.3 million arose
through a combination of efficient procurement and favorable exchange rate fluctuations. These
savings were reallocated to new activities such as: (a) inclusion of UBEDN ger areas which had
developed during early implementation; (b) system improvements in Ulaanbaator to address
overloading issues; and (c) inclusion of three western aimags with high losses and financial
sustainability problems. All activities were based on government priorities, fell within the
Project’s original description, but necessitated two closing date extensions.

Extensions of Closing Date: The closing date of the original Credit was extended four times:

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis: The World Bank completed the Mongolia Energy Sector
Review in late 1994/early 1995, identifying the set of policy and investment priorities needed to
increase reliability and security of energy supply. Another study 4 carried out in 1997 by the
Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), proposed specific measures
to improve efficiency in electricity distribution and identified areas and utilities with the highest
priority for rehabilitation. The experience of the Mongolia Coal Project (Cr. 2854, closed FY01)
was taken into consideration, where very good progress was achieved but a lack of timely price
adjustments and insufficient collection of revenues had caused major financial stress for the
company. International experts on heat and power utilities provided strong support for Mongolia
in the substance of technical project preparation.

Assessment of Project Design. The project design reflected lessons learned, including the
advantage of focusing on one primary beneficiary and one sector – energy – as opposed to both
energy and heating. The project also focused on the early development of the PIU with training
and TA support. The PDO was realistic and important for Mongolia’s power sector and the three
components were all highly relevant to achieving the PDO. The outcome indicators focused on
quantifiable results for which the project could reasonably be held accountable. That said, the
PDO in the PAD was inconsistent with that in DCA or Project Paper of AF (per Section 1.2). In
addition, the indicators did not capture the more qualitative outcome of strengthened institutional
capacity to move toward a more commercial and market-based energy sector (See also Sections
2.3 and 5.1 (a)).

The project approach considered the Bank’s comparative advantage, other donors’ engagement,
past experiences, and the Borrower’s commitment. The task team made a justifiable decision to
focus on addressing reliable energy supply issues in a sustainable and decentralized way,
considering the much larger financial presence of other donors’ involvement on alternative topics,
urgent needs in the energy sector to reduce losses and improve bill collections, and Bank’s
position on sector reform. The first group of aimags was carefully selected with the PIU based on
their level of losses -- typically above 25 percent -- level of commitment by managers at the
aimag level to implement recommended measures, replicability of measures selected, and their
financial returns (> 15 percent) and sustainability. At design, the project aimed to assist 12-14
aimag centers which was too ambitious given limited project resources. The project design also
endeavored to link poverty reduction and social impact through provision of energy supply to
isolated rural areas and included a strategy to establish a lifeline tariff system for low-income
consumers although the modalities for implementation were not clearly spelled out in the PAD.

Adequacy of Government Commitment. The Government’s commitment to the Project
improved during preparation. At appraisal completion, GOM disagreed with the Bank on

                                                                                                    7
required price adjustments, including upfront increases, which resulted in project processing
delays until the new government took actions to meet the requirements in January 2001. From
then on, it demonstrated its support to the Project through committing to co-finance the Project
and to reforms via a 15% increase in the electricity tariff level in 2000, the passage of the Energy
Law by Parliament in April 2001, and ongoing USAID efforts 5 to corporatize the sector.

Stakeholder Involvement and Participatory Processes. Stakeholders were involved using a
participatory process, which included a number of field interviews and investigations with
industrial, commercial and residential electricity consumers concerning usage patterns,
perceptions of service quality, and payment mechanisms and issues. Consultations with other
international donors (KfW, ADB and USAID) involved in related activities were also carried out
throughout project preparation, to set priorities and avoid duplication of effort in the sector.

Adequacy of Risk Assessment. The overall risk assessment in the PAD was “substantial” which
was correct. Specific critical risks were identified, such as those involving slower than
anticipated gains due to weak management and low gains in capacity building, and procurement
delays due to lack of experience and were rated substantial. Project design included mitigation
measures such as completion of training courses on procurement, disbursements and other
implementation procedures during project preparation and supervision, early initiation of
procurement processing for selected packages, closer supervision, capacity building and donor
coordination. The risk of implementation delays was correctly identified and rated, but the
difficulty of mitigating it was underestimated as detailed in Section 2.2.

GOM’s commitment to market-based reforms and the necessary pricing and electricity metering
reforms were rated moderate due to then recent passage of the Energy Law. In retrospect,
GOM’s willingness to reform was over-assessed as few actions were taken toward building a
market-based sector.

Quality at Entry. In general, the project’s background analysis was sound and consistent with
the sector strategy and GOM’s strategy for the sector. The PDOs were realistic and important,
the components were well designed to achieve them, and the overall risk was rated correctly.
Nevertheless, the PDO was not consistently stated in PAD and DCA. As judged by today’s
standards, the performance indicators should have included intermediate outcome indicators,
baselines, annual targets and end-of project targets. The project could have had stronger
institutional arrangements, and could have provided more focused and realistic TA for regulatory
support. The economic and financial analyses in the PAD could have been more thorough with
more realistic assumptions and better articulated methodologies. In addition, the “lifeline” tariff
program to support the poor was not well developed in the PAD. Furthermore, the project was
appraised in November 1998, but was not approved by the Board until May 2001. As pointed
out by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in the Quality at Entry Review of October
2001, the Bank did not insist that the project implementation plan (PIP) be formally updated as it
should have been. Procurement should have been packaged differently to avoid start-up delays as

discussed in Section 2.2 below. Therefore the overall quality at entry rating is moderately
satisfactory.


2.2 Implementation

The DCA was signed in August 2001 but did not become effective until July 30, 2002. The delay
in declaring effectiveness was mainly related to meeting the additional condition of authorizing
and ratifying the Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) between the Ministry of Finance and the
seven distribution utilities. Due to the reorganization of the EA in 2001, the original DCA and
PA were amended in July 2002, after which the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE)
entered into SLAs with UBEDN and the aimags. These institutional changes and consequent
delays contributed to the need for the first extension of the Credit closing date by two years.

Implementation Delays. The Project experienced substantial delays for other reasons. As of
February 2003, contract award had not taken place on any of the six most critical bid packages.
The reasons for the delays related to::
   • Readiness: There was a lack of readily available counterpart financing to cover local
       costs, including installation, works, customs arrangements, insurance, storage, etc. Also,
       the PIU had low capacity for dealing with procurement procedures, contributing to
       protracted bid evaluations and awards.
   • Procurement/Disbursement: Goods and construction activities were procured under
       separate contracts, making coordination between suppliers and contractors more
       challenging. Moreover, the local funding withdrawal procedures were lengthy and had
       little flexibility for revisions.
   • Institutional Support: The institutional support from the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI)
       and MOFE to the PIU was insufficient, leading to a lack of proper training, missing
       remuneration and inconsistent supervision of their activities and outputs. Also,
       responsibilities among government agencies were not allocated clearly to properly
       monitor project implementation.

Actions to Accelerate Implementation. Subsequently, both sides agreed to take actions to
accelerate project implementation: a limit of 10 working days was established for both GOM and
the World Bank to respond to communications. The internal evaluation procedures were sorted
out between MOFE and MOI, and, in parallel, World Bank assistance – in coordination with
MOFE – was provided to: (a) streamline the local procurement law; (b) improve confidentiality
of internal processes; and (c) support PIU capacity building in procurement. To strengthen the
institutional arrangements, GOM also agreed to assign counterpart funding for the incremental
costs of project supervision directly to UBEDN and the aimags.

Mid-Term Review. A Mid-Term Review (MTR) was carried out in early 2005 to examine in
depth the recurrent issues that had hampered implementation. It also focused on remedial
measures to accelerate implementation, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen
UBEDN’s financial position and operating performance. While suggesting steps to ensure that
the technical loss reductions were being implemented without further delay, the MTR also
focused on actions to formulate and implement the UBEDN commercialization program and

                                                                                                9
reduce non-technical losses in UBEDN and aimags, which were fundamental to the success of
the Project.

Financial Restructuring in UBEDN: In the Project’s early years, the financial situation in
UBEDN continued to deteriorate and acceleration of Project implementation became urgent. A
financial recovery plan for UBEDN was agreed on in 2004 to improve its financial status and
avoid non-compliance with financial covenants and later Financial Plans were developed for
UBEDN and the aimags, based on solid work done under the project funded TAs.

As a result of these efforts, project implementation picked up considerably in the beginning of
2005 and started to demonstrate solid progress in loss reduction and in UBEDN’s financial
health. After recording losses in 2006 and 2007, UBEDN achieved a small profit in 2008 with an
operating margin of 1.2 percent. Thereafter, it began to show growth in profits, as detailed in
Section 3.3 and Annex 3. The improved financial performance was a result of reduced losses and
improved collections.

New activities. As told in Section 1.7, several new activities were added with a DCA
amendment dated November 21, 2006. The additional activities were determined based on the
priorities of various institutions and the extent to which they could contribute directly to the
PDOs. Three Western aimags (Bayan-Ulgii, Khovd, Uvs) were selected for assistance under the
project based on their high system losses (32%-53%), financial stress, and poor state of the
networks in their ger areas. The new activities, together with early implementation delays,
required an extension of the closing date from December 2006 to December 2008. The second
extension (for one year up to December 31, 2009) and the third extension for nine months in
December 31, 2009 were to enable certain delayed construction activities to be completed. These
were largely due to longer than anticipated finalization of the new commercial operation system
as a result of poor consultant performance and postponements in the procurement process
resulting from differences in views between the relevant government agencies.

Rationale for AF. By 2008, it was evident that Mongolia’s continued mining development and
its rapid urbanization were greatly stressing the country’s energy generation capacity, which in
turn, caused serious reliability issues. (In fact, in 2008, a fire caused by overloading and safety
breakdowns destroyed a substation.) At the same time, the condition of transmission and
distribution networks had deteriorated markedly due to a lack of regular maintenance and
delayed investments. There was an urgent need to help avert disruptions in the supply of
electricity to Ulaanbaatar, which caused acute problems during the eight-month long heating
season where reliable power supplies were imperative to the proper functioning of the district
heating pumps, which, if not maintained, would deprive the population of vital heating services.
As the Energy Project had already generated benefits in loss reduction and increased reliability,
GOM requested in January 2009 to use it as a ready vehicle to continue improvements in
reducing system losses and increasing reliability with an AF credit of US$12 million. The AF
financed three additional components (per Section 1.6) to scale up activities to enhance impact
and development effectiveness. The key investment component, carrying out critical
investments to augment UBEDN’s distribution network, was somewhat loosely linked to the
original PDO, but the AF was nonetheless justified given the urgency of making critical



                                                                                                 10
improvements. Thus the AF was appraised on November 16, 2009, approved by the Board on
March 25, 2010, and became effective on September 16, 2010.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The M&E framework design focused on progress towards meeting the PDO as measured
by the outcome and intermediate results indicators, but no assessment of project impact through
beneficiary survey data and analysis was provided for. The indictors of loss percentage,
receivable collection days, and were correctly selected as they are strongly linked with the PDOs.
Shortcomings of the design of M&E framework were (a) the indicators on system reliability
(Service Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and Service Average Interruption
Duration Index (SAIDI 6)) were not included at appraisal but were developed later during
implementation; (b) the M&E system could have included some output indicators to monitor
progress of the capacity building component and it should have included indicators to monitor
progress on system reliability for aimags; and (c) the PAD did not provide baseline or final target
for the KPIs and output indicators, which were later on developed as project proceeded. This was
in accordance with QAG’s suggestion on improving the identification of performance indicators
consistent with project objectives.
The target for loss reduction was revised at the time of AF as the original was deemed too
ambitious (data sheet). In the AF, the indicator of additional customer sales per annum was
added but it did not have a clear link to the PDO.

Implementation: The PIU regularly collected data to reflect implementation progress and
outstanding issues, and make adjustments as needed. The M&E framework was monitored and
updated in a systematic manner and was made available in progress reports and supervision
documents. However, during implementation, the indicators of technical losses and power supply
reliability (SAIFI and SAIDI) were not monitored for the aimags, due to the weak capacity of
aimag utilities. The results framework was updated for the AF to monitor the increased capacity
and connections, which were not directly linked with PDOs.

Utilization: The M&E framework was useful in monitoring implementation progress, signaling
issues and prompting the client and the Bank to make adjustments to enhance the project’s
ability to realize its objectives. The PDO and intermediate outcome indicators were regularly
monitored and evaluated against the baseline and target values, after they were set in 2005.
Financial indicators for UBEDN were used to track progress and make adjustments to comply
with covenants.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Compliance with Safeguards. This project triggered only the environmental assessment
safeguard policy (OP 4.01) as it did not exhibit potential for any negative environmental impacts
and did not involve any involuntary resettlement, land acquisition, or indigenous people issues. It

was therefore correctly categorized as a “B” project. An Environmental Analysis Report and
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) were prepared in both Mongolian and English, and
disclosed to the public locally and at the Bank’s InfoShop on September 5, 1999. The EMP
contained a number of precautions as told in the PAD. For the AF, no additional safeguards
were triggered and the project remained a Category B. An EMP was prepared and disclosed
locally and at the Bank’s InfoShop in 2009. Compliance with the environmental safeguards
policy was satisfactory. Compliance with the EMP was monitored by the PIU to international
standards and compliance was reported in progress reports. Appropriate measures were taken on
complex issues such as the removal of asbestos from the heating pipes of Choibalsan with
support from international experts. According to the July 2013 Compliance report, no issues
were encountered.

Procurement: Procurement was organized and carried out by the PIU with oversight from its line
ministry and the Project Steering Committee under it. Procurement of goods was carried out on
the basis of international competitive bidding, shopping and direct contracting. The Bank’s
oversight included prior and post reviews of procurement and contracting procedures to ascertain
that the Procurement Guidelines were followed and all activities complied with the modalities
outlined in the legal documents. The process experienced significant delays in the first three
years (See Section 2.2) and a MU rating was given in FY09. The procurement issues were
eventually satisfactorily resolved and all systems have been operating since then.

Financial Management: The PIU maintained the project accounting records and prepared interim
financial reports on a quarterly basis in compliance with requirements under the legal documents.
Annual audit reports with unqualified opinions were submitted to the Bank on time as recorded
from FY05. Both financial management reviews and audits identified shortcomings, mostly in
the areas of internal controls, filing and documentation, and operating account reconciliation.
The findings were followed up and the problems were resolved satisfactorily.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

No significant post-completion operational issues are anticipated. For UBEDN and project
aimags, new substations, rehabilitated lines, and meters in tamperproof boxes were installed
(Photo in Annex 10) and in some cases, moved from privately owned apartment to utility-owned
boxes to reduce power theft. The equipment was inspected and certified to meet quality
standards to minimize potential breakdowns in the future. Also, UBEDN completed its
commercialization program, established customer centers in branches, and has business plans
and financial models in place. Planning software has been installed and is being operated
appropriately by well trained staff (Photo in Annex 10). Operations and maintenance are being
carried out by well trained staff.

UBEDN will continue to use the key indicators summarized in Annex 3, Table 6, to measure its
system losses, financial performance, and will continue to monitor SAIDI, SAIFI to track system
reliability. At aimag level, the ability to monitor system reliability needs to be improved.

In addition, some recommendations related to energy sector reform have been adopted, but
further changes in the regulatory and sectoral structure are still needed to move towards a

                                                                                              12
market-based sector, such as price indexation, single buyer market, etc. As a follow-up, the ERA
has informally requested the Bank’s technical assistance in continuing and strengthening the
sector reform and institutional building.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

The Project remained relevant to the current country and sector context throughout its entire
implementation period. In fact, the Project’s objectives in securing sufficient and reliable energy
supply became even more relevant, with the country’s recent rapid increase in electricity demand
due to mining development, urbanization, and population growth. The Project supported GOM’s
national strategy in moving towards a market-based energy sector. It was relevant to the Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) for Mongolia covering 2009-2010 (Report no. 48311-MN) which supported
high priority operations and focused on protecting the poor, managing critical infrastructure and
capacity building. It remained also consistent with current Country Partnership Strategy for
FY2013-2017, wherein one of the three pillars was to address vulnerabilities through improved
access to services and better service delivery, safety net provision, and improved disaster risk
management.

The Project adopted a combination of physical components, commercialization program
measures, and capacity building for utility staff that proved to be effective toward meeting its
objectives. However, the achievement on the regulatory front requires continued support. The
implementation delays experienced in the beginning were resolved and the experience
contributed to some of the lessons learned.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This report employs the PDO as stated in the DCA and the AF Project Paper, which was directly
linked to the project activities and outputs, and was measurable and attributable to the project
interventions. The PDO was comprised of three sub-objectives, weighted as follows:

The Project aimed at addressing the urgent issues of high system losses, low reliability, and slow
receivables collection through a series of investments and TA under Project Components 1, 2
and 4, in order to achieve the first two sub-objectives. The other sub-objective targeted at
creating an enabling environment for longer term sector reform by building up institutional
capacity through Project Components 3, 5, and 6.

The three sub-objectives and thereby the project components were correlated with each other.
The achievement of loss reduction and reliability improvement (Sub-objective 1) directly
contributes to the improvement in financial status and revenue collection (Sub-objective 2), and
the strengthened capacity (Sub-objective 3) at the energy regulator and distribution and
transmission companies contributes to the sustained achievement of the other two sub-objectives.

PDO (1): “to reduce electricity system losses and improve service reliability in electricity
distribution in Ulaanbaatar and selected aimag centers.”
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Reducing system losses. Achievement of this outcome is measured through PDO indicator #1
(system loss reduction in UBEDN) and indicator #3 (system loss reduction for selected aimags).
At appraisal, electricity losses stood at 31% in UBEDN’s distribution system and reached almost
50% in some aimag systems. The Project involved the upgrading of 758 substations, establishing
of 119 new substations, renovation of 1587 km of low-voltage lines, and installation of 119,075
meter and 23,762 meter boxes, all of which contributed to the reduction of losses and
improvement in reliability. See Annex 2 for details on project investments.

At project completion, six out of ten companies (UBEDN, Dornod, Suhbaatar, Hovd, Uvs,
Bayan-Olgii) had surpassed their loss reduction targets. For the remaining four (Bayankhongor,
Gobi-Altai, Umnugobi, and Huvsgul), their losses were reduced to below 25% of their original
loss levels of 34%-46%, as seen in Figure 1. Per Section 3.6 below, a beneficiary survey carried
out in late 2013 shows that the main reason why these aimag utilities failed to meet their loss
reduction targets was “added connections to distant soums”, in other words, the system losses
could increase with the extension of distribution lines to remote areas, which could negatively
influence the achievement of the loss reduction objective. Overall, the number of consumers in
the regions served by distribution companies that reached the project loss reduction targets
accounted for about 92% of the total consumers when the Project closed. Therefore achievement
of this part of the PDO is rated Satisfactory.

Improving reliability at UBEDN. Achievement of this outcome is measured through
intermediate indicators 3 (SAIDI for UBEDN) and 4 (SAIFI for UBEDN). The reliability of
electricity services provided by UBEDN was successfully improved, as evaluated by these two
indicators. SAIDI at UBEDN dropped significantly from a baseline of 4,204.7 minutes annually
to an actual of 397.5 minutes annually, surpassing the target of 600 minutes annually. SAIFI
dropped from a baseline of 28.4 times per year to an actual of only 7.16 times per year,
surpassing the target of 10 times per year as seen in Figure 2 below. Taken together lower
duration and frequency of annual interruptions indicate higher reliability of electricity supply and
achievement of reliability improvement targets at UBEDN. The rating for this part of the
objective is Highly Satisfactory.

Improving reliability at project aimags. There were no outcome or intermediate indicators
established to measure this aspect of the PDO. However, anecdotal evidence from the
beneficiary survey suggests a general positive sentiment towards reliability improvements (See
Section 3.6 and Annex 5). In light of the fact that no data is available, the rating is reduced to
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

PDO (2): “to improve revenue collection in the electricity distribution system.”
Rating: Satisfactory

Achievement of this outcome is measured through PDO indicator #2 (receivable collection
improvement for UBEDN) and indicator #4 (receivable collection improvement for selected
aimags). Through the project, 119,075 meters and 23,762 boxes of meters were installed,
commercialization programs were implemented and software was deployed, leading to the
significant improvement in revenue collection in the electricity distribution system. At project
completion, the billing collection days at UBEDN had been reduced from 100 in 2004 to 35,
exceeding the target of 45 days (PDO indicator #2). As can be seen in Figure 3, five out of nine
aimags (Bayankhongor, Gobi-Altai, Dornod, Huvsgui, and Suhbaatar) achieved the target in
PDO indicator #4, while the other four (Umnugobi, Hobd, Ubs and Bayan-Olgii) experienced a
significant reduction in collection days without meeting their targets. Significantly, about 98% of
the consumers who benefited from the Project were served by the distribution companies which
surpassed their targets for receivable collection days.

PDO (3): “to build up institutional capacity to move toward a more commercial and market-
based energy sector.”
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

There were no outcome or intermediate indicators established to measure this aspect of the PDO;
however, a qualitative analysis of the outcome is presented below. The component supporting
this objective was divided into two parts: (a) support to develop the Energy Regulatory
Authority, and (b) to conduct annual audits under acceptable international accounting standards
of the EA’s financial statements, and the Energy Project’s financial statements.

For part (a) above, the project’s results were moderately satisfactory. The project provided TA
and training especially on the development of power market rules and tariff structures. While the
studies were completed in good quality, only a small portion of the recommendations were
adopted, such as the implementation of the merit order dispatch approach, a way of ranking
available source of power generation in ascending order of their short-run marginal cost of

                                                                                                 17
production. Some key recommendations on tariff reform (including the lifeline tariff system that
was included at design) and transition to market based energy sector were not implemented,
largely due to a lack of political will. As observed from Annex 1, only 25% of the originally
allocated budget for the ERA component ($80,000) was actually spent. This would correlate with
the lack of progress in assisting GOM toimplement the recommendations.

For part (b), the results were satisfactory. Before the project, neither the PIU nor the distribution
companies in Mongolia had experience with preparing financial statements for independent
audits. Through the TA activities during project implementation, annual audits were conducted
on time under acceptable international accounting standards of UBEDN’s and the Project’s
financial statements, with support from an international auditor.

Core Sector Indicators. At closing the following information related to energy sector core
indicators was available:

Given the weighting system mentioned at the beginning of this section, the overall achievement
of outcomes is determined in the table below. The project is solidly moderately satisfactory with
an overall weighted score of “4.4” on a “6” point scale, where “6” is highly satisfactory and “1”
is highly unsatisfactory. The fact that the number of beneficiaries increased to nearly 298,000 is
further evidence of the project’s success.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

At completion, the Project is estimated to have generated an economic internal rate of return
(EIRR) of 34.0%. At an economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCK) of 11%, it is estimated to
have generated an economic net present value (ENPV) of US$127.0 million at completion,
compared with an estimated US$67.7 million at appraisal. The higher ENPV is primarily due to
the enhanced impact of loss reductions achieved by UBEDN over a decade of accelerated
demand expansion. In the decade of 2004-13, UBEDN’s sales grew at an average annual rate of
10.9 percent, and its revenue at 19.4 percent. The investments under the original Loan are
estimated to have yielded an EIRR of 32.8% and an ENPV of US$102.1 million at completion,
compared with an estimated 30.3% and US$10.9 million at appraisal. The investments under
the AF are estimated to have generated an EIRR of 61.7% and an ENPV of US$24.9 million at
completion, compared with an estimated 158.9% and US$56.8 million at appraisal. The lower
EIRR and ENPV of the investments under the AF at completion are due to the exclusion of the
global environmental benefit of loss reduction. When the benefit is included, the economic
returns of these investments are on par with appraisal estimates.

estimated US$24.2 million at appraisal. Again, the higher estimated FNPV at completion is
primarily due to the enhanced impact of loss reductions achieved by UBEDN over a decade of
accelerated demand expansion. The investments under the original Loan are estimated to have

Furthermore, the Project played an instrumental role in the financial recovery of UBEDN by: (i)
reducing the company’s cost of supply through loss reduction; and (ii) providing much needed
liquidity through increased revenue collection and reduction in accounts receivables. As a result,
UBEDN reached full cost recovery for the first time in 2008. The company’s liquidity
situation had also undergone marked improvements with growing cash reserves, increasing the
current ratio increased from 0.47 in 2005 to 1.33 in 2012, reduced need for short-term borrowing,
and expanded capacity for servicing long-term debts used for financing future investments. Over
the past decade, UBEDN’s balance sheet has undergone a fundamental structural shift from
having two-thirds of the assets backed by short-term liabilities and negative equity to a healthier
composition with 45% in equity, 42% in long-term liabilities, and 13% in short-term liabilities.
See Annex 3 for more detail.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Project remained substantially relevant throughout its lifetime. It was relevant to (a) GOM’s
strategy and the Bank’s CAS in place at appraisal, (b) the ISN in place for approval of the AF,
and (c) the latest CPS. Also, the Project was substantially based on reasonable economic and
financial performances especially benefiting from a surge in the demand for power during the
extension period. The Project performed well with reducing losses and increasing reliability for
UBEDN, and with improving revenue collection. However, the Project performed less well on
making reliability improvements at aimag level and on moving toward commercial and market-
based reforms in the energy sector. Therefore, the overall rating is moderately satisfactory.




                                                                                                   20
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project was not specifically targeted at the poor or women, but provided some linkages with
social/poverty aspects (Section 2.1). Although the lifeline tariff system was not adopted, with
reduced distribution system losses and improved supply reliability, the project provided
households and small businesses access to better energy services, thereby likely improving their
productivity and contributing to poverty reduction, especially in remote project aimags. In
addition, a more reliable supply with fewer interruptions has the potential to ameliorate the lives
of women who were traditionally responsible for cooking and washing.

Anecdotal evidence from the Beneficiary Survey (Annex 5) suggested that aimag utility
customers generally become more responsible and energy efficient than in the past thanks to
improved customer relations, improved metering and bill collection, and consumer campaigns.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
Through the TA offered by the project, at completion, UBEDN and CRETC (NPTC) had
improved their ability to plan investments in their networks. Moreover, UBEDN had completed
its commercialization program, established customer centers in seven branches, and had a
business plan and financial model in place, placing it in a better position to meet future
challenges. The aimags were staffed with personnel trained in planning, design, maintenance
and operation of distribution systems.

TA to ERA generated some key recommendations for removing regulatory barriers and
strengthening regulatory capability. These recommendations are still relevant to current
operations at ERA, which is moving toward shaping a market-based energy sector, such as
design of electricity pricing, market rules, etc.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The technical and commercial practices developed under the project have been transferred to
other areas of the utilities' operations. For example, to reduce non-technical losses, several
project aimags have expanded locked meter boxes to areas and customer segments not covered
by the project. In some aimags, the design specifications of project substations have been
replicated for the rehabilitation of substations in soums (district level administrative subdivision).
In addition, a more efficient distribution network could lead to a reduction in energy losses
thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, all other things being equal.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Results from a beneficiary survey are presented in Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results.

A post-project completion beneficiary survey was carried out in November/December 2013
among eight of the nine participating aimag utilities of Western and Eastern Mongolia. The
survey comprised two parts, providing insights into: (a) the impact of the infrastructure
investments made and commercialization measures taken at the aimag level; and (b) beneficiary
satisfaction linked with the PDOs under the aimag component.




                                                                                                   21
On the impact of the infrastructure investments made and commercialization measures taken at
the aimag level, the survey analysis chiefly points to a fair degree of homogeneity in the type of
infrastructure investments made and commercialization measures taken by participating aimag
utilities. Regarding beneficiary satisfaction linked with the PDOs under the aimag component,
the analysis of the data collected shows a generally positive sentiment towards the project’s
helpfulness in improving the utilities’ operational performances, customer service levels,
customer satisfaction, and management and employees’ capacity, as well as towards the
effectiveness of the software and training programs provided. The greater majority of the
utilities interviewed also indicated that improved operational performance ultimately translated
into higher levels of operational sustainability.

However, despite the positive results obtained in terms of beneficiary satisfaction and improved
operational performance, the survey shows that “added connections to distant soums” is cited as
the main reason why some utilities failed to meet their loss reduction targets, as extending
distribution lines to remote areas tends to increase system losses. “Lack of technical knowledge
and support” is the primary reason for some utilities missed their revenue improvement targets
instead.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Risks to loss reduction and collection improvement are low. The loss reduction objective was
generally achieved by project completion. Given the equipment quality, few risks are anticipated
with regard to the physical sustainability of the rehabilitated lines and installed meters. Also, the
staff has been trained to maintain the installed equipment. Moreover, revenue collection was
improved through a series of activities such as more accurate meter reading and loss
identification, customer awareness campaigns, customer service improvement, etc., which, to
some extent changed customers’ behavior in paying for electricity in the project region.

There have been some concerns on potential disruptions in the supply system outside of project
aimags, due to rapid urbanization and booming industries. During the ICR mission, several
aimags requested the Bank’s support in reducing losses and improving reliability, while
expanding their supply capacity. With similar projects in other aimags, the development outcome
could be extended to a broader area. The Bank is in close discussion with the Ministry of Energy
on next steps. Thus, the associated risks are rated as moderate.

Risks linked with building up institutional capacity remain moderate, given the less than
expected actions undertaken by the ERA during project implementation. Recommendations on
tariff and price indexation, market rules, etc. have not been adopted, which are important for
sector reform, thereby posing risks to move towards a market based energy sector. Over the past
decade, tariff growth had trailed behind inflation, resulting in lower average tariff in real terms.
Going forward, further loss reduction in the Project area will become more challenging. In
recognition of the risks, ERC has already requested TA support from the Bank with the aim to
continue implementing recommendations and the Bank will follow up with GOM on potential



                                                                                                   22
TA, either as an independent project or a project component. Therefore, the associated risks are
rated moderate, rather than substantial.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory,
which is consistent with the QAG’s rating in the Quality at Entry review of October 2001.

As summarized in Sections 1.1 and 2.1, the Bank’s support for the Project was well aligned with
the prevailing CAS and GOM’s energy strategy. The project was prepared and designed based
on a Bank technical review of studies and past experience with IDA’s involvement in Mongolia
and incorporated lessons learned from past and then ongoing projects. The Bank team assisted
GOM in designing the Project to meet the Bank’s technical, financial, economic, fiduciary, and
safeguards standards. The Project was prepared in close coordination with ADB, USAID, KfW
and the Japanese Government. The Bank spent $480,930 on project preparation (excluding the
preparation of the AF) and two very senior task team leaders (TTLs) collaborated in project
preparation. (Note no system-generated information is available due to the project’s age.)

Preparation began in November 1997, with the concept review being held in March 1998. The
appraisal was authorized in November 1998 but was not considered complete until October 1999.
Project processing was held up further due to a disagreement with GOM on the required price
adjustments. However, the processing started up again with the post-appraisal mission in January
2001, which found that sufficient progress had been made by the new government to meet the
Bank’s requirements. The Bank did not reappraise the project as no substantial changes had
occurred in the design or conditionality of the project.

As detailed in Section 2.1, certain shortcomings with Quality at Entry led to implementation
delays and other problems including: (a) PDO in the PAD was inconsistent with the DCA; (b)
performance indicators could have been improved by including reliability indicators for aimags
and setting realistic targets at design; (c) the institutional set-up for the Project could have been
more clearly arranged; (d) TA support to the regulator could have been more focused and
realistic; (e) implementation arrangements for the lifeline tariff for the poor could have been
better described; and (f) the economic and financial analyses could have been more thorough
with more realistic assumptions and better articulated methodologies. However, it should also
be recalled that project preparation started in 1997 when standards were different, especially for
the Results Framework, where the old log-frame format was still being used.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance during project implementation was moderately satisfactory. It
conducted supervisions under extreme weather conditions in geographically dispersed regions

                                                                                                    23
over long hours. The financial management and procurement functions were provided by field-
based staff in Ulaanbaatar and at project sites. Field-based staff also provided continuous training
and hand-holding to PIU staff on procurement, disbursements, and M&E, and consultants
provided support on environmental safeguards. The Bank’s technical expert spent a significant
amount of time each year actually living in project aimags to provide hands-on assistance to
utility staff. Overall reporting on supervision was adequate with 18 ISRs file over 12 years;
however some of the implementation progress ratings were optimistic especially early in the
project when rather serious delays occurred, yet all ISRs reported “satisfactory” progress but one
MS in June 2009 due to contract delay.

The team responded promptly to the deteriorating financial situation of UBEDN in 2008 by
developing the Financial Restructuring Plan and later developing Financial Plans for UBEDN
and the aimags. When delays arose, the Bank team proactively and correctly identified problems
and came up with action plans to move the project forward. Based on evidence on the ground
and recommendations in continuous TAs, the commercialization program and business plans
were developed and refined to reduce non-technical losses and increase revenue collection. The
Project also allowed for flexibility to adjust work scope and strategies based on evolving internal
and external conditions and client’s demand over time, evidently from the contract repackaging
under Phase II and the more focused TA in the AF. Continuous training and capacity building,
intensive supervision, problem identification and prompt problem solving greatly contributed to
the success of the Project. One shortcoming was that inadequate attention was paid to follow-up
on the recommendations for ERA.

Preparation of the AF. As told already above, GOM requested AF for the project to address an
emergency capacity generation problem. The Bank appraised the AF in November, 2009 and as
a result, the three components shown in Section 1.6 were added to the project and a three-year
extension of the Credit closing date to September 30, 2013 was granted. These three
components were perhaps not tightly tied to the achievement of the PDO, but they were highly
relevant to the situation at hand, and the AF design incorporated lessons learned from
implementation. As demonstrated by the results at project completion, targets for both loss
reduction and capacity generation targets for Ulaanbaatar were reached and Ulaanbaatar had the
energy generation capacity to meet demand at project completion. Therefore, the ICR considers
adding the three new components under the original project justifiable, especially given the
longer processing time that would have been required by developing a separate project.

As far as the quality of the Project Paper is concerned, it could have been better. The Project
Paper adopted the PDO from the DCA without ever mentioning a change from the PAD version.
The Project Paper should have had an updated Results Framework with clear Key Performance
Indicators and Intermediate Outcome Indicators, with baselines, annualized targets and end-of-
project targets; instead it used the old logframe from 2001. In particular it did not include
indicators of improved energy supply reliability for aimags making evaluation of that sub-PDO
very difficult. It also lacked an overall revised financing plan for the entire project.




                                                                                                 24
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

During implementation, the Bank promptly responded to emerging issues and client requests and
showed flexibility in making adjustments based on evidence on the ground and recommendations
in TAs. However, the shortcomings in ensuring quality at entry contributed to the initial delays
in implementation, and the PDO was moderately satisfactorily achieved. Thus, considering the
moderately satisfactory rating for Bank’s performance in ensuring quality-at-entry and
supervision, the overall Bank performance is also rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

GOM was supportive of the Project during both preparation and implementation, and its
commitment to the project became stronger over time. The Project was appraised in November
1998 but was not negotiated until 2001 due to delays in meeting required price adjustments. The
progress made by the new government in 2001 was considered sufficient for the Bank to
continue the project processing. From then on, GOM demonstrated its support through (a) the
passage of the Energy Law in April 2001; (b) a 15% tariff increase in April 2001; and (c)
ongoing efforts to un-bundle the sector as supported by USAID.

Not long after Board approval, however, implementation arrangement changed and counterpart
financing was inadequate in the first few years, both of which contributed to significant delays.
In response, the Bank team and GOM (Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Infrastructure)
worked through the issues and implemented actions to move the Project forward (Section 2.2).
Subsequently, GOM became more committed to the Project, and provided sufficient counterpart
funding for goods and installations and PIU staff salaries. By project completion, it had built
much stronger ownership of the Project, contributing to the achievement of the PDO. However,
Ministry of Fuel and Energy/MMRE lacked the necessary political will to carry out the energy
reform program that was still needed, particularly in the areas of tariff indexation and single
buyer market.

Regarding the AF, MMRE can be credited with recognizing a quickly emerging need for
capacity expansion in 2008, and requesting Bank assistance with the AF Credit. With the three-
year extension necessary to implement the AF, it was also possible to further strengthen
UBEDN’s financial position, train staff of the NPTC on investment planning, design, and
maintenance and operation of the system..

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The PIU, seated within the Ministry of Energy at closing, provided continuous and solid support
to the Project. It communicated and cooperated with management from line ministries, UBEDN,
aimags, Steering Committee and the Bank team. Several shortcomings were noted early in

                                                                                               25
project implementation, e.g., lack of experience with procurement and financial management
procedures. However, with proper training, the PIU’s performance greatly improved over time.
Financial management and procurement were generally rated satisfactory for most of the project
duration. The PIU maintained good relationships with the aimags throughout project
implementation and took initiatives without Bank prompting to conduct hands-on trainings. The
PIU also saw that the environmental safeguards framework complied with international
standards and took appropriate measures on complex issues with support from international
experts.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

GOM commitment to the Project was somewhat lacking at times, with the long delays between
appraisal and Board due to reticence to adjust tariffs to meet Bank imposed requirements, and
more start-up delays (Sections 2.1 and 2.2); however, it became stronger during project
implementation. Although the initial lack of support did not significantly affect the ultimate
achievement of the first two sub-objectives of the PDO, it greatly contributed to project
preparation delays and implementation delays which required multiple extensions of the closing
date. In addition, the lack of concerted political will to reform persisted over the course of
project implementation, which led to the partial achievement of the third sub-objective of the
PDO. Therefore, the overall borrower’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
• Early intensive and continuous training and capacity building are critical to the success of
    projects, particularly when the PIU has no previous experience with Bank projects and the
    domestic regulatory framework is weak. The project management capacity of the PIU was
    built up over time, which allowed the PIU to play a key role in monitoring and supervising
    project implementation and guiding the aimags.
• More coordinated and frequent high-level communications between the Bank and
    government agencies are needed, especially when the responsibility framework or approval
    authority is not clearly defined. Early in implementation, coordination among Bank, MOI,
    MOFE, PIU was not well organized, thereby contributing to misunderstandings and
    implementation delays.
• The design of procurement packages needs to consider country-specific regulatory
    frameworks and government organizations. While it seems easier to allocate responsibility to
    procure goods and construction activities under separate contracts, coordination between the
    two contracts is likely compromised. The initial decision to procure them separately turned

    AF, procurement delays were significantly reduced.
• Given limited budget, the TA support to the regulator needs to be designed in a focused and
    pragmatic matter. For a country in the infancy of sector reform, it is key to focus on selected
    priorities, while taking government’s will to act into consideration. Meanwhile, the on-going
    policy dialogue with high level government officials should be maintained during the whole
    course of the project.
• The practice of having the technical consultant sit with the aimag utilities to provide
    intensive hand-holding trainings and TAs contributed to the project success. Under the tight

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This section comprises the economic and financial analyses of the project and the financial
assessment of UBDEN. At appraisal, several benefit-cost analyses (BCAs) were carried out to
assess the economic and financial viability of the investments in Ulaanbataar and six aimag
centers. Later on, BCAs were carried out again for the investments under the additional financing.
At completion, the economic and financial returns of all components previously assessed were
reassessed based on their actual scope and performance.

   A. Project Economic and Financial Analysis

           a. Analytical assumptions

To ensure comparability with the appraisal-stage estimates, the economic and financial analyses
at the project completion adopted the same methodology, and in some cases, the same unit
valuations, such as those for the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for new connections and power
outage. This would allow the analyses to focus on the more substantive differences between the
project actual performance at its completion and the planned performance envisaged at appraisal.

However, due to the long project implementation period expanding over a decade, the values of
some macro and project-specific parameters have experienced considerable fluctuations. Notably,
the considerable depreciation of the local currency had posed two opposite impacts on the
Project’s economic and financial return by (i) increasing the local purchasing power of the IDR-
based IDA credit, thus allowing an extension of the original project scope; and (ii) reducing the
dollar-based valuation of the Project’s future benefit streams.


           b. Benefits and costs

At the appraisal, three main economic benefits were identified: (i) power loss reduction and
associated improved revenue collection; (ii) improved system reliability; and (iii) reduced
electricity purchases by UBEDN and associated reduced coal consumption by power generators.
Of all these identified benefits, only the loss reduction benefit was quantified at the initial
appraisal. The technical analysis of the investments proposed for additional financing identified
three main categories of potential benefits: (i) reduction in network losses; (ii) reduced outages;
and (iii) ability to connect additional customers to the network. All three benefits were assessed
for the additional investments.

The same benefit streams were assessed at the project completion based on the actual
performance of the project.

   •   Loss reduction. Substantial reduction in distribution losses was achieved through the
       Project in the networks of UBEDN and nine project aimags (see figure below). Arguably,
       the Project’s actual impact on loss reduction could have been greater if not countered by
       the utilities’ expansion to more distant soums during the same period, which led to
       increases in technical losses in recent years.

                                                                                                 38
        At the project completion, the economic value of loss reduction was valued at the WTP
        of power supply, which was conservatively assumed as the lower of (i) the actual tariff of
        power supply, and (ii) the implicit tariff of power supply derived from the retail tariff.
        The same conservative assumption was also adopted at the initial appraisal. Global
        environmental benefits in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction were
        excluded in the benefit valuation, although they were included at the appraisal of the
        additional financing. 7

    •   Avoided outages. To be consistent with the appraisal-stage assumptions, this benefit was
        only measured for the Project investments under the additional financing, thus being only
        applicable for the period from 2011 onward even though more substantial reduction in
        SAIDI, from 4,205 minutes to 2,234 minutes per year, was achieved in UBEDN’s
        network in the period of 2004-2010. The WTP for power outages assumed at the
        appraisal was overly conservative at conservative values of US$0.07 per kWh for the
        WTA of power outages, compared with US$0.50 per kWh, a commonly cited figure
        based on diesel-based back-up units operating at low load factors. To allow for
        comparability with the estimates at the appraisal, the ICR analysis has adopted the same
        conservative assumption. The financial value of avoided power outages was assumed at
        and US$0.01 per kWh for the financial values were assumed at both the appraisal and
        the project completion.

    •   Increased access to electricity supply. Again, this benefit was only measured for the
        Project investments under additional financing even though both UBEDN and the project
        aimags experienced a continuous increase in access throughout the decade of project
        implementation. The benefit of being able to connect additional customers to the


7
  An additional value of US$0.035 per kWh in global environmental benefit was included in the loss
reduction benefit assessment at the appraisal of the additional financing.


                                                                                                       39
       network was measured as the aggregate willingness of new customers to pay for
       electricity supply, assumed at $US0.159 per kWh, the same assumption in the appraisal
       of the additional financing.

           c. Results of the economic analysis

At completion, the Project is estimated to generate an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of
34.0%. At an economic opportunity cost of capital (C) of 11%, it is estimated to generate an
economic net present value (ENPV) of US$127.0 million at completion, compared with an
estimated US$67.7 million at appraisal. The higher ENPV is primarily due to the enhanced
impact of loss reduction achieved by UBEDN over a decade of accelerated demand expansion.
In the decade of 2004-13, UBEDN’s sales had grown at average annual rate of 10.9 percent, and
its revenue at 19.4 percent. The investments under the original Loan are estimated to yield an
EIRR of 32.8% and an ENPV of US$102.1 million at completion, compared with an estimated
30.3% and US$10.9 million at appraisal. The investments under the additional financing are
estimated to generate an EIRR of 61.7% and an ENPV of US$24.9 million at completion,
compared with an estimated 158.9% and US$56.8 million at appraisal. The lower EIRR and
ENPV of the investments under the additional financing at completion are due to the exclusion
of the global environmental benefit of loss reduction. When the benefit is included, the
economic returns of these investments are on par with the estimates at appraisal.

    The appraisal of this component was carried out in 2010. Then, the ENPV was estimated in
terms of 2010 US dollar at US$117.9 million. The difference between the two figures, i.e.,
US$56.8 million and US$117.9 million, is due to discounting. In 2010 US dollar terms, the
ENPV of the component was estimated at US$ 51.8 million.

Moreover, at a discount rate of 8%, the Project will result in a lifetime net present reduction of
4.46 GWh in distribution losses, equivalent of the avoidance of 4.46 million ton of CO2
emissions. The implicit cost of CO2 abatement is estimated at an impressive US$8.58 per tCO2.

At completion, the Project is estimated to generate a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of
27.4%. At a financial real discount rate of 8%, it is estimated to generate a financial net present
value (FNPV) of US$107.2 million at completion, compared with an estimated US$24.2 million
at appraisal. Again, the higher estimated FNPV at completion is primarily due to the enhanced
impact of loss reduction achieved by UBEDN over a decade of accelerated demand expansion.
The investments under the original Loan are estimated to yield an FIRR of 27.6% and an FNPV
of US$102.7 million at completion, compared with an estimated 21.2% and US$5.3 million at
appraisal. The investments un the additional financing are estimated to yield an FIRR of 20.2%
and an FNPV of US$4.5 million at completion, compared with an estimated 19.1% and US$3.0
million at appraisal.

   B. Financial Analysis of UBEDN

The Project played an instrumental role in the financial recovery of UBEDN by (i) reducing its
cost of supply through loss reduction; and (ii) providing the company with much needed liquidity
through increased revenue collection and reduction in accounts receivables.

As a result, UBEDN reached full cost recovery for the first time in 2008. The company’s
liquidity situation had also undergone marked improvements with growing cash reserves,
increasing current ratio increased from 0.47 in 2005 to 1.33 in 2012, and reduced need for short-
term borrowing, and expanded capacity for servicing long-term debts used for financing future
investments.

Over the past decade, UBEDN’s balance sheet had undergone a fundamental structural shift from
having 2/3 of the assets backed by short-term liabilities and negative equity to a healthier
composition with 45% in equity, 42% in long-term liabilities, and 13% in short-term liabilities.

Notably, tariff increase had not played a major role in UBEDN's path toward cost recovery. In
the period of 2007-12, retail tariff in UB grew at an average annual rate of 11.6%, trailing behind
the average inflation of 13.3% in the same period, resulting in lower average tariff in real terms.
Going forward, as loss reduction becomes more challenging, the pace of tariff increase will need
to pick up to keep the company at full cost recovery.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A post-Project completion beneficiary survey was carried out among eight of the nine
participating aimag utilities of Western and Eastern Mongolia. The survey comprised
two parts. Part A provided insights into the impact of the infrastructure investments
made and commercialization measures taken at the aimag level; Part B provided insights
into beneficiary satisfaction linked with the PDOs under the aimag component. To further
shed light on the survey results, anecdotal evidence was collected through in-depth
interviews with a selected number of key aimag utility stakeholders.

Part A:
The survey analysis points to a fair degree of homogeneity in the type of infrastructure
investments made and commercialization measures taken by the aimag utilities engaged
with the Project. The results show that such investments have generally translated into
improved sustainability of the utilities’ operational models. According to Mr. Chinbat,
Executive Director of the local distribution utility in the Dornod aimag, “the improved
operational performance of the utility stems from the infrastructure and
commercialization investments made under the Project, which are complementary in
nature”. In a brief overview of Pre-project conditions, Mr. G.Otgonbaatar, Deputy
Financial Director, recounted how the local distribution utility was troubled with: (i) high
losses, (ii) a high average number of days to collect receivables; and (iii) the inability to
keep track of due payments, which created uncertainties about the sustainability of the
distribution utility commercialization model Mr. Dorjragchaa elaborated as follows:

       “As a result of the joint efforts between the Government of Mongolia,
       Choibalsan’s local utility and the World Bank, a number of measures were
       taken to address the issues of physical assets”, emphasized Mr. Chinbat.
       On the Project’s infrastructure investments, he then added: “Twenty-nine
       out of the 42 aimag substations were rehabilitated, thereby reducing
       power losses from over 19% in 2004 to below 9% in 2013. We now have
       a more reliable system with a very low number of yearly power faults (120
       in 2003 and two in 2007) and voltage drops. In the district ger areas,
       obsolete Russian mechanical meters were upgraded to more modern and
       precise models and confined into breakin-free boxes. Equally, in the
       urban areas of Choibalsan, meters were moved from privately-owned
       apartments to utility-owned boxes, which reduced power theft and
       facilitated the monthly visits of official inspectors. Our customers have
       generally become more responsible and energy efficient than in the past”.

        “The real revelation, however, was seeing great strides in improving our
       customer relationship management”, continued Mr. Munkhtulga, Head of the
       Sales Department. “We were able to decrease the average number of days to
       collect receivables below 7 in 2013. This naturally followed the set-up of a
       customer service center which greatly helps with addressing complaints and
       dealing with new contracts. We also made some organizational changes, splitting
       the billing and revenue collection units into two separate entities for payments

                                                                                          47
       tracking and organizational improvement purposes. Finally, we upgraded the
       utility’s software infrastructure, which supports the work of the newly created
       customer service center by improving the sales and finance functions”.

Part B:
The survey shows a high level of satisfaction among the utilities having participated in
the Project. On a scale from one to five (from worst to best), utility contentment averages
at 3.75 in terms of loss reduction achievements and 3.88 for the reduction in the average
number of days to collect account receivables. This is backed by a generally positive
sentiment towards the project’s helpfulness in improving the utilities’ operating
performances, customer service levels, customer satisfaction, and management and
employees’ capacity, as well as towards the effectiveness of the software and training
programs provided (all above an average of 4 out of 5). The majority of the aimag
utilities found the newly gained levels of operational performance to be a key element for
strengthening the sustainability of their business. In fact, 75% of the utilities interviewed
attest to having sufficient funds to finance investments to further reduce distribution
losses, or at least, keep up with current trends.

However, despite the positive results obtained in terms of beneficiary satisfaction and
improved operational performance, the survey indicates that the Infrastructure component
could have been handled better with a higher degree of emphasis on upgrading meters
and on installing meter boxes. This, however, does not seem to be the cause for some
aimag utilities to have missed the PDOs targets. The survey shows that “added
connection to distant soums” is cited as the main reason why some utilities failed to meet
their loss reduction targets. According to Mr. Gansukh, Director of the local distribution
utility in the Suhkbaatar aimag: “Consistently with a country-wide trend, many herders
are moving from the countryside to more developed areas and more soums are coming
on-line in the local distribution networks”. This automatically results in higher demand
for electricity, which in turn calls for higher investments in physical infrastructures.
According to the utilities surveyed, the revenue improvement target was not always met
primarily due to a lack of technical knowledge and support. A graphic illustration of
selected survey results is presented below.

                               Energy Sector Project

The following report summarizes the views of representatives of the Ministry of Finance,
UBEDN, and Ministry of Energy on behalf of the Government of Mongolia on the
implementation and completion of the Energy Sector Project (Project), financed by the
International Development Association (IDA), with funding from the Government of
Mongolia.

I. Introduction

The“Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution Network” JSC ( “UBEDN” JSC) and Aimag
Energy Plants (AEP) have been operating long time with high technical and non-
technical losses, and could not meet power supply requirement to customers, finally
having negatively impacts to the economic benefits of the UBEDN and AEPs.Therefore
in order to reduce non-technical losses of UBEDN and AEPs and to reorganize them into
commercial principles, the WB International Development Agency (IDA) have initiated
and implemented the Energy Project since 2001.

The objective of the project was to reduce system losses and improve revenue collection
in electricity distribution companies in Mongolia. As stated in the Development Credit
Agreement, the project development objective was: (1) to reduce electricity system losses
and improve service reliability in electricity distribution in Ulaanbaatar and selected
Aimag centers; (2) to improve revenue collections in the electricity distribution system;
and (3) to build up institutional capacity to move toward a more commercial and market-
based energy sector.

As one of parts of World Bank “Energy Project”, in the scope of distribution network loss
reduction project there were rehabilitated electricity distribution network of “ger” areas in
8 districts of Ulaanbaatar city and 9 aimag centers and constructed new sub-stations. The
project of "The distribution network loss reduction” was commenced in 2001 and
financed by World Bank long-term loan (35 million US$), with technical rehabilitation
project implemented in 2 phases. The capacity building component of the project
included consultancy services to UBEDN, selected aimags, and Energy Regulatory
Agency.

II. Project Preparation and Design

The World Bank team had adequate experience and knowledge for the preparation of the
project. The task team collaborated closely with the Government and the UBEDN in the
design and preparation of the project.



                                                                                          52
III. Project Implementation

       A. Implementation delays

There are some factors impacting on project slowdown. The selection of construction
companies to perform construction and installation works in a few districts in 2005 was
delayed and due to loss of lot of time for Contract signing off as well as construction
works non-starting in warm season, the construction works were not completed in
scheduled due time. Due to insufficient supply of steel concrete poles and wooden logs
under domestic financing as well as household’s inlet dropping cable under overseas
financing, the delay on work performance and scheduling of Contractors was happened.
Upon organizing work meetings between PIU, UBEDN and Contractors companies and
based on assumption that goods and materials required for construction works will be
delivered in August 2006 and according to agreed work schedule and quantity, the PIU
made decision to not ceasing construction and installation works and has assigned
Contractors to follow. However, due to the low quality of poles and installation, the PSC
meeting decided to dismantle the low quality steel concrete poles and resolve
compensation.

Another major factor impacted on project implementation was that project design
drawings, which performed in 2002-2003, are not updated considering increasing number
of “ger” households and land permits for new sub-station site and protection stripes are
not validated by district land authorities and therefore working drawings keep changing
because of disputes between customers, operator and contractor. This is not because of
particular drawing mistake, but because of increased migration, unauthorized settling
down and owning of land, careless action of district authorities on land granting as well
as households arbitrary extension of fences.

In order to solve any disputes related with project working drawings, the technical staff
from PIU and UBEDN have updated working drawings and included some of missing
household and even though working drawings are subject for frequent change because of
land disputes by customers.

Delay on supply of required construction materials in 2006-2007, delay on selection of
Contractor to supply steel concrete poles etc., lead up to slowdown of construction works.
Because of construction work slowdown of one contractor in 2008, the several official
notifications were sent to them to speed up work progress and finally even Contract
termination proposal submitted to the Head of Energy Policy department of the MMRE
in 2009, but despite these efforts repeatedly issued tasks and implementation of decision
by PSC meeting of MMRE were not sufficient.

As II phase of Project, due to delay project financing as well as delay on payment for
supplied equipment and goods etc., caused construction work of a rehabilitation
Contractor’s delay against planned schedule. Besides that non-fulfillment of Contract
obligation to supply 1-phase electronic meters, required for construction works within
2008 made impossible the completion of sub-stations. Regarding of this issue, the

                                                                                       53
working meetings between Client, Operator and Contractor company had been organized
and despite of certain task and recommendations to speed up construction works, the
Project is not fully completed in 2008, as per schedule. As per Resolution No. ¹35 by
State Secretary of MMREon intensification of construction works of “Distribution
Network Loss Reduction Project”, upon decision of PSC to take audit on performance on
supplied goods and materials and installation works; the working team has appointed to
make Contract conclusion and worked at the Contractor to check above mentioned items.

       B. Additional Financing

Due to lack of the investment for reforming techniques and technology and expanding in
conformity with demandable capacity increasing within the area of construction,
production and services with more electric load concentration, the critical situation of
overloading of line equipment has been occurredand the reliability of power supply has
been worse as the reserve of inter-loading transfer is limited during the damage and
cutoff. Therefore, the additional financing project had the main purpose of renovation
electric equipment and technology to expand a capacity and ensure a reliability of power
supply in conformity with demandable capacity increasing within the area of construction,
production and services with more electric load concentration.

IV. Project Achievements

The Project was successful in fulfilling its objective of reducing system losses and
improving revenue collection in electricity distribution companies in Mongolia. As a
result of these works the voltage drop has decreased at customers end points, high quality
power is provided to the customers, loading are balanced and lossreduction positively
impact to the power electricity distribution and sales activities and gained significant
technical and economical outcomes.

       A. Technical benefits

Before Project implementation, the 0.4kV OHL of “ger” area of Ulaanbaatar city and
aimag centers have general problems such as OHL has bare conductors and too long
length, significant voltage drop, lighting glowing, customers own electricity meters and
so high non-technical loss or power stealing as well as there were many failures and
breakdown when weather is poor because of rain and snow, strong wind etc. Also sub-
stations are overloaded, load between phases are not equal, low operation level, many
non-standard wooden poles and most of them decayed, the household’s insertion or
dropper wires are not adequate and there are used various kinds of electrical wires, due to
meter is located inside of households there is possible wrong usage including ceasing,
meter reading takes too long time, many payment related breaches because of human
factors as well as outdated equipment and technology, inefficient organizational
structures, careless attitudes in work place, customers senseless and uncultured actions
/e.g power stealing/ etc. lead up to implement this Project.

As of 2004, the UBEDN has been operated with 69,36% of sales and 30,64% losses upon
purchased power. Upon implementation of distribution network loss reduction project,

                                                                                        54
the losses have been decreased by 2-3% annually. Comparing to 2004, the losses were
decreased by 9,25% as end of 2009.

As of 2004, the Aimags under the 1st phase of Project were operating with 81,7-53,7% of
sales and 18,3-46,3% of losses upon purchased power. Under implementation of
distribution network loss reduction Project, the annual loses have been decreasing by 2,6-
17,6%.Comparing to 2004, the losses were decreased by 5,1-31,2%as end of 2010.
As of 2004, the Aimags under the 2nd phase of Project were operating with 70,1-57,6%
of sales and 29,9-42,4% of losses upon purchased power. Under implementation of
distribution network loss reduction Project, the annual loses have been decreasing by 1-
10,6%.Comparing to 2004, the losses were decreased by 10,1-22% as end of 2010.

As a result of project’s economical outcome before project was implemented year of
2004 for the base to compute, loss reduction 691.4 million kV hours indicating electricity
was saved in 2010. By each year’s current sold price was multiplied and economical
outcome was shown USD 24.26 million which is equals to 31066.4 million MNT.

       B. Energy Loss reduction at UBEDN

Please see following graphs, which illustrate how main sales indicators have been
increased upon implementation of Commercialization project at UBEDN. Actual
electricity loss reached to 21,39 as of 31st Dec, 2010, and planned losses reduced by 0,21

                                                                                       55

Upon implementing of the Project, the company’s debt repayment works have been
intensified and according to auditing recommendations for company’s financial
performance, which done by KPMG-International auditing company, debts occurred
before 2003 are separated from the branches and bad debts worth 5,231.5 million MNT
has been transferred to company’s registration as well as upon receiving and validation of
2227 customers request and complains, the 67.1 million MNT worth debts are separated
from customers account.

         C. Improved reliability

There were significant economic and technical reform investment in the distribution
business activities since UDEDN and AEPs have received and operating various
machineries, equipment and testing tools etc, supplied under rehabilitation works done
within distribution network loss reduction Project. Upon rehabilitation of “ger” area OHL,
the calls and complaints regarding power quality and distribution have decreased and
voltage drop and operational failures and downtimes reduced due to sub-station’s outlets
load balancing.

Upon fixing up failures in short time, the network reliability operation is increased and
customers will be able to get power quickly and thus resulting to reduce dead expenses.
Throughout the company, the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) has
decreased by 5.2% in 2009 comparing to previous 2008.The System Average Interruption
Frequency Index (SAIFI) has decreased by 0,3% and the Customer Average Interruption
Duration Index (CAIDI) has decreased by 7,7 minutes compare to previous year. The
interruption call ups of UBEDN in 2008 were 10586 and it reduced up to 8058 in 2009.
Therefore it is obvious that outcomes of works, performed in the framework of the
Project are actualized and have a positive impact on distribution business.

       D. Institutional strengthening

Within the Project main scope of objectives, several training abroad were planned in
order to transfer UBEDN into commercial activities, upgrading AEPs performance
management, capacity building of organizational structures and staff capabilities,
reducing power electricity technical and adverse (non-technical) losses as well as to
improve power system efficiency.

During these trainings, the employees have been introduced and familiarized with
equipment and technologies as well as organizational structures and management adopted
in particular country and company and based on that have developed their own ideas and
initiatives to improve existing situation and this had positive impacts on company’s
performances.

Under this project for improving financial management of aimags energy utilities, the
finance and sales integrated software was installed. Moreover, in developing investment
plan, aimags have put into an order the investment works according to their priority and
allocated them for next 4 years. In calculating financing sources of investment in the
financial planning section of their business plans, at first they determined internal
financing potential based on cash flow planning. Hereupon, they have estimated the
necessary financing required for investment to be financed out of external sources. The
distribution companies are required to seek sources for financing for the works put in the
investment plan which were planned to be financed out of the state and local budget.

V. Overall assessment of World Bank and Government Performance


The overall performance of the World Bank in preparing and implementing the project is
rated as satisfactory. While initial progress made on the project was slow, the World
Bank responded timely and came up with action plans to follow during supervision, and
ensured that the central objective of the project was effectively attained.

The overall performance of the Government of Mongolia in preparing and implementing
the project is rated as satisfactory. The Government placed priority on achieving the
objectives of the project and demonstrated ownership as project proceeded, despite weak
coordination in the early stages of project implementation. The PIU was able to
effectively negotiate between the project stakeholders in implementing the project, and
keep monitoring project work progress, its quality and performance and timely solving
critical issues and successfully managed construction work acceptance and handover by
State Committee. Also it provided Project progress reports to the PSC as well as keep
                                                                                       58
communicating and coordinating with relevant specialists from the World Bank.
Moreover, annual and quarterly financial statements and financial management
reportswere prepared and submitted to district tax authority, and IFR or internal financial
reports were prepared according to the form provided by the World Bank and submitted
to the World Bank, Ministry of Mineral and Energy and Ministry of Finance. The
financial statements of the projects were audited by external auditor and measures in
accordance with the recommendations in audit report.

VI. Lessons and Experiences

       A. Procurement and coordination

Initially, due to insufficient supply of materials under domestic financing as well as
household’s inlet dropping cable under overseas financing, the delay on work
performance and scheduling of Contractors happened. After close coordination among
government agencies, World Bank, and repackaging of procurement packages, the delay
was reduced.

       B. Contract management

Complexity of contracts and insufficient contract management contributed to the
implementation delay. As project proceeded, the PIU and PSC improved their ability in
dealing with complicated contracts and resolving disputes, through training, technical
support, and learning by doing. Moreover, the monitoring engineers from Technical
Project Unit and AEPs Project Support Units were responsible to keep working
relationships and communications between customers, operators and contractors
including solution of any disputes and complaints and take operative countermeasures
and/or escalating the to the proper decision making management level.

       C. Public campaigns and marketing PR activities

The information dissemination works have been done to provide customers correct and
operative information on the Project. The supply service department also provided
information about project importance and construction and installation works as well as
benefits for “ger” area residents as well as provided required necessary information on
timely manner. Upon receiving customers complaints and suggestions and taking proper
solution, the public advertisement in relation with construction works have been done in
parallel including introducing project related activities to the general public, further
actions, making presentation on new equipment and technologies etc.

VII.   Follow-up Activities

There exist possible follow-up activities that could be supported by the World Bank and
are currently being pursued.

First, there is a need for the World Bank to expand the support to other aimags. For
example, two regional distribution companies outside Ulaanbaatar expressed strong

                                                                                        59
interests in replicating some key components of the Energy Sector Project in their service
areas. Both aimags presented a compelling case for investments in loss reduction and
capacity expansion.

Second, there is a possibility for continuing technical assistance to the ERA (now Energy
Regulatory Commission). In specific, the priority areas are (1) methodology on tariff and
price indexation; (2) methodology for setting fuel price used for energy generation and its
calculation; (3) electricity market model and rules; (4) strengthening of ERC
independence and autonomy; and (5) capacity building of ERC staff.
