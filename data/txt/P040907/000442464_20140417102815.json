follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: early intensive and continuous training\n            and capacity building are critical to the success of\n            projects, particularly when the project implementing unit\n            (PIU) has no previous experience with Bank projects and the\n            domestic regulatory framework is weak. The project\n            management capacity of the PIU was built up over time, which\n            allowed the PIU to play a key role in monitoring and\n            supervising project implementation and guiding the aimags.\n            More coordinated and frequent high-level communications\n            between the Bank and government agencies are needed,\n            especially when the responsibility framework or approval\n            authority is not clearly defined. The design of procurement\n            packages needs to consider country-specific regulatory\n            frameworks and government organizations. Given limited\n            budget, the technical assistance (TA) support to the\n            regulator needs to be designed in a focused and pragmatic\n            matter. For a country in the infancy of sector reform, it is\n            a key to focus on selected priorities, while taking\n            government's will to act into consideration. The\n            practice of having the technical consultant with the aimag\n            utilities to provide intensive hand-holding trainings and\n            TAs contributed to the project success."}, "docdt": "2014-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
