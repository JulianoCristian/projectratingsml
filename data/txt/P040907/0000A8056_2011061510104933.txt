                         The project has made significant strides toward meeting its development objectives of improving revenue collection and reducing system losses in electricity distribution networks
                         among project beneficiaries, which include the Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution Network Company and nine Aimag centers. Technical and non-technical losses have been

                         reduced from an average of 31 percent to 23 percent in Ulaanbaatar, and from about 34 percent to 15 percent in six Aimags. The estimated cumulative amount of cash benefits from
                         reductions in losses that are directly attributable to project investments is US$17 million. In addition, billing collection periods have also been reduced from 98 days to 54 days in
                         Ulaanbaatar, and from 67 days to 25 days in Aimags.

                         Under the additional financing, these development objectives will be enhanced. Since the additional financing only became effective on September 16, 2010, the focus has been on
                         tendering for works, goods and services. As such, it is too early to report on how the additional financing has contributed to the project's development objectives.
