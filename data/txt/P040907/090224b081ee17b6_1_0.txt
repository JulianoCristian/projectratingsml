                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to reduce system losses and improve revenue collection in electricity distribution companies in Mongolia. A central emphasis of the
                         project is to improve the reliability and financial sustainability of electricity distribution companies, so that consumers are provided reliable, high-quality distribution
                         services by commercially-operated distribution utilities.

                         Under the additional financing, the project appears to have satisfactorily achieved its development objectives of reducing system losses and improving revenue collection. Thanks to
                         the project’s many capital investments (meters, transformers, distribution networks, substations), system losses have been reduced from 34.9% at the beginning of the project in
                         2001 to 17.9% now, reaching the targeted level of 18%. Average losses at aimag utilities were estimated at 55% in 2001 and have now declined to 14.3%. The financial situation of
                         the Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution Network (UBEDN) has improved in part due to the reduction of average time of outstanding billing collections from 120 days in 2001 to 23 days

                         in June 2013, significantly exceeding the target. Also, additional customer sales per annum now stand at 146 GWH, compared to the target of 64 GWH, strong evidence of
                         Ulaanbaatar’s ever growing demand for the project’s output of electricity.

                         The final ongoing capacity building initiatives in the proper use of system planning software, integrated information data base for electricity distribution, and smart grids will help
                         sustain the gains made under the project.
