INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A., OF MEXICO FOR THE
THIRD IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in the amount in various currencies equivalent to US$19 million to
Nacional Financiera, S.A.
PART I: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
2.        Two of the seventeen loans made to date to Mexico were for ir-
rigation. They were Loan 275-ME of 1961 for $15 million, and Loan 336-ME
of 1963 for $12.5 million. Construction work under both of these loans
is progressing satisfactorily.
3.        The project for the proposed loan was appraised by a Bank mission
in August 1965. Negotiations were held from March 23 to 29, 1966. Negotia-
tors were Lic. Victor Navarrete, Subdirector of the Nacional Financiera, S.A.,
and Subsecretary of Hydraulic Resources, Ing. Salvador Aguilar Chavez; they
were assisted by five members of the staffs of their organizations.
4.        The proposed loan would increase the Bankts lending to Mexico to
$625.3 million (net of cancellations). Mexico has received no IDA credits.
The following is a summary of Bank loans to Mexico as at March 31, 1966:

5.        Construction and procurement have been generally proceeding according
to schedule with the exception of the 1960, 1962 and 1963 highway loans, where
delays were caused by very heavy rains, difficulties in obtaining the right-
of-way, limited budgetary allocations and the necessity to relocate some
sections of the highways; remedial actions are being taken.
6.        There are no other M4exican projects which are expected to be ready
for presentation within the next few months, although several are being pre-
pared by the Government for the Bank's consideration.
PART II: DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.        The main features of the proposed loan would be as follows:
BORROWER:             Nacional Financiera, S.A., a financial agency
of the Mexican Goveriment which, under the
existing lexican legislation, has to be the
borrower or co-borrowier of Bank loans.
GUARANTOR:            United Mexican States.
AMOUITT:              The equivalent in various currencies of
$19 million.
PURPOSE:              To assist in the rehabilitation of the Region
1agunera and San Juan del Rio Irrigation Dis-
tricts0
AMORTIZATION:         20 years, with no repayments during the first
6 years; semi-annual installments beginning
March 1, 1972, to retire the loan on March 1,
1986.
INTEREST RATE:        6 percent per annum
COI0IT EUT CHARGE:   3/8 of 1 percent
PART III: THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled "Rehabilitation and Expansion of the
Region Lagunera and San Juan del Rio Irrigation Districts Mexico"(TO-520 c)
is attached.
9.        Agriculture is Mexico's principal occupation from which one-half
of the population derives its livelihood.  Because of arid or semi-arid
climatic conditions and a large proportion of mountainous terrain, the



- 4 -
cultivable area is limited to about 30 million hectares or less than one
hectare per inhabitant.   A continued increase in production requires a
more intensive use of available land which frequently calls for putting
more land under irrigation. In fact, the sustained increase of agricul-
tural production during the last decade has been caused in large measure
by new irrigation works. Between 1950 and 1962 the crop area under irriga-
tion doubled and now amounts to over 4 million hectares. In recent years,
rehabilitation and expansion of some of the existing districts have been
found to yield more rapid and higher economic returns than the irrigation
of new areas and have, therefore, been emphasized.
10.       Major irrigation works are planned, executed and operated by the
Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos (SRH). This Ministry, existing since
1947, has a well qualified and experienced staff, both at headquarters and
in the field, and maintains adequate laboratories for studies in hydraulic
and soil mechanics. Considering that SRH has successfully carried out other
much larger projects, the proposed project should be well within its capa-
bilities.
11.       The project would increase the quantity of water for irrigation
in two irrigation districts through the construction of additional dams and
reconstruction of the canal systems. In the Region Lagunera District the
irrigated area would be expanded from 52,660 hectares to approximately
85,000; in the San Juan del Rio District the increase would be from 5,400
hectares to approximately 10,000. In addition, the project would regulate
the water supply and reduce damage from floods; it would also reduce the
construction or rehabilitation of 620 km. of roads in the project areas.
Adequate agricultural extension services, including demonstration programs
and long, medium and short-term credit to farmers would be assured by the
Government.
12.       The total cost of the project is estimated at the equivalent of
about $65 million, of which the proposed 'oan would cover $19 million: the
balance would be financed from the Federal Budget. The proposed loan would
.nainly cover payments relating to civil works awarded under international
competition with M"exican contractors participating without preference. With-
drawals in respect of civil works will be at uniform percentage, which has
presently been established at 27.5 percent to cover eauipment and materials
which in the past generally have been imported into Mexico. The proposed
loan would also cover the cost of machinery and spare parts on the basis
of international competitive bidding in which qualified Mexican suppliers
might be given preference, provided their offers do not exceed by more than
15 percent the offer of the lowest qualified foreign bidder. This preference
margin is in lieu of customs or other import duties. Preferences in the
procurement of equipment of 10 percent were allowed in one of the highway
loans (3514-HE) and of 15 percent in the last two power loans (316-ME and
436-ME) in Mexico.
i3.       The only exception from international competitive bidding would
be in case of emergency construction and small items of construction work
which may be carried out better by government forces or local contractors.



- 5 -
The total of these exceptions would not exceed 20 percent of all the construc-
tion work. This maximum was 30 percent in the two previous irrigation loans
to Mexico.
1I.       The benefits of the proposed rehabilitation would justify the cost.
Annual economic benefits arising from the increased net value of agricultural
production are estimated at $9.6 million for the Region Lagunera District and
$1.5 million for the San Juan del Rio District. The respective rates of in-
ternal return would be about 11 percent and 16 percent. This calculation does
not include some additional economic benefits, which cannot easily be measured,
such as increased trade and employment in the area.
15.       Water users would pay water charges sufficient to cover all operating
and maintenance costs and make some contribution to repayment of capital.
PART IV:  LEGAL INSTRUNENTS AID AUTHORITY
16.       The Draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Nacional Financiera,
S.A., the Draft Guarantee Agreement between the United Mexican States and the
Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Art. III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
17.       The provisions of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements are similar to
those contained in loan documents for the previous Mexican irrigation proj-
ects and for other projects of this kind. Special features are:
(a) According to Section 7.01(b) of the Loan Agreement an
effectiveness condition is that the Government takes
action initially satisfying the requirements of Section
3.11 of the Guarantee Agreement concerning the establish-
ment of water charges.
(b) According to Section 3.12 of the Guarantee Agreement the
Government will make available credit on reasonable terms
to farmers in the project areas to enable them to carry out
the necessary on-farm works and make full use of the proj-
ect facilities.
(c) According to Section 3.13 of the Guarantee Agreement, the
Governm3nt will improve and expand agricultural extension
services (including demonstration farms) in the project
areas.



- 6 -
PART V: THE ECONOMY
18.       In April 1965 a Memorandum on Recent Economic Developments was
submitted to the Executive Directors (R 65-59). iore recent information -
given in an attachment - indicates that the Government continues to move
cautiously in matters of public investment and foreign borrowing0 Fol-
lowing a 6 percent annual growth rate of the economy over the last 15 years,
substantial further growth is within the capacity of the Mexican economy,
provided that additional savings are made in the public sector, that measures
are taken to prevent a deterioration of the balance of payments and that
private investment continues at a high level. The demonstrated ability of
the Government to stimulate development is a favorable factor in assessing
future performance.
PART VI: COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
19.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII: RECOMvENDATION
20.       I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following re-
solution.
RESOLUTION NO.
Approval of Loan to Nacional Financiera, S.A. in the amount of
the equivalent of US$19,000,000 to be guaranteed by the United
Mexican States.
RESOLVED:
THAT the Bank shall grant a loan to Nacional Financiera, S.A. to
be guaranteed by the United Mexican States in an amount in various currencies
equivalent to nineteen million United States dollars (US$19,000,000), to
mature on or prior to March 1, 1986 to bear interest at the rate of six per-
cent (6%) per annum, and to be upon such other terms and conditions as shall
be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
form of Loan Agreement (Third Irrigation Project) between the Bank and Nacional
Financiera, S.A. and the form of Guarantee Agreement (Third Irrigation Project)
between the United M4exican States and the Bank, which have been presented to
this meeting.

ViORANDUM ON RECENT ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENJTS AND PROSPECTS IN MEXICO
Introduction
1.        On November 26, 1965, on occasion of the presentation to the Execi'i1 ve
Directors of the US$110 million loan for electric power, they were informed
that the Government that had taken office in late 1964 was in the process of
formulating an expenditure and financing program for the years covering its
constitutional period of office, i.e, ending in 1970. The formulation of
this program has not yet been completed; nevertheless, a Bank mission has
recently visited Mexico as part of the first phase of an assessment of cur-
rent prospects and problems in the next few years, and it is intended to re-
view its preliminary conclusion with the Mexican authorities by mid-year, at
which time the Government expects to be in a position to discuss its invest-
ment and financing plans with more precision. The present memorandum is,
therefore, still of an interim nature; while it incorporates the material
obtained by the mission that visited Mexico in February and M4arch of this
year, it cannot yet report on detailed forecasts agreed upon between Bank
staff and the Government of Mexico.
Output and Employment
2.        Between 1950 and 1965 the Mexican economy experienced substantial
growth and significant structural transformations. GNP, on the average, grew
by about six percent annually; since population growth was approximately
3.5 percent per year, income per head rose by some 2.5 percent yearly or
45 percent in 15 years. Provided that no insuperable bottlenecka develop
in the balance of payments, i.e., that foreign markets and long-term capital
inflows develop favorably, a continuation of this growth rate would be within
the capacity of the Mexican economy since the factors making for productivity
increases in the past - a vigorous and growing entrepreneurial class and an
agricultural sector which in part is geared toward modern technology - can
be expected to continue to operate. It is possible, however, that some de-
celeration of the growth rate may be imposed on the economy in the next few
years if the prospect of rather less favorable conditions in the foreign
sector than have obtained in the past materializes (see below). Another
crucial determinant of the growth rate in the next few years will be the
investment decisions of the private sector; stimulated by confidence in the
long-term prospects of the economy and in the prudence and responsibility of
the authorities, as well as by rising Government expenditures, this sector
has recently been one of the most dynamic elements in Mexico's growth.
3.        Mexico's urban population at present constitutes roughly one-half
of the total. This proportion has been rising steadily and at present rates
may be close to two-thirds by 1975. Both lower mortality rates in the cities
and internal migrations have contributed to this result, with the latter
factor probably being the preponderant one.  Nevertheless, pressure on the
available supply of agricultural land, especially in the densely settled
central states, is one of the major continuing problems facing Mexico. N4hile



- 2 -
considerable new acreage has been brought under irrigation - through large
scale government outlays - in the sparsely settled northwesterm areas, the
subdivision of land in the center has reached a degree that must be con-
sidered excessive by any standard.
Monetary and Fiscal Trends
4.        After the effects of the 1954 devaluation were absorbed by the
domestic cost and price structure, Mexico has, in the more recent past,
managed to combine economic growth with a reasonable degree of price
stability. This occurred in spite of very considerable expansions in the
money supply, as the following figures indicate:
1955-1960      1960-1965
Percentage change in money supply             61              55
Percentage change in wholesale prices          20             11
Among the causes that account for this unusual performance are the gradual
monetization of the subsistence sector, the high marginal savings coefficient
of the private sector and a combination of government policies which included
moral suasion to maintain prices stable, administered imports and some direct
price controls. While no reliable data on wage rates in secondary and ter-
tiary industries are available, their annual rate of increase in the 'sixties
seems to have been of the order of 5-6 percent and may thus have been some-
what in excess of productivity changes.
5.        To attend the multiple needs of a developing economy, public sector
investment during the last ten years has been expanding at a pace somewhat
greater than total output, constituting about 5.9 percent of GNP in 1963-65,
as against some 4.5 percent in 1955-57. Besides satisfying the growing re-
quirements for economic and social infrastructure, in the early 'sixties,
when private investment was lagging, public sector investments were also
used in a counter-cyclical manner to prop up aggregate demand. In 1964 -
the last year of the outgoing administration - they rose from M$13 to about
M$16 billion, and in 1965 financial considerations imposed a retrenchment
to approximately M$10 billion. It is not yet possible to be precise about
the public investment necessary in the next few years; it would seem likely,
however, that a sustained annual growth of six percent in GNP would require
steadily rising public investment, possibly to M$18-19 billion by 1970.
6.        In the light of the presently available information, which, as
already pointed out, is still incomplete and tentative, it seems probable
that the financing of investment of this order of magnitude will require
some additional savings in the public sector. Although the Central Govern-
ment's revenue system relies on some taxes whose yield tends to rise with
GNP, the revenue system as a whole is only moderately elastic; and the
appreciable past revenue increases (77 percent between 1960 and 1965) were
in part the consequence of periodic changes in the rate structure as well



- 3 -
as of administrative improvements and of price rises. Moreover, in recent
years current expenditures have tended to rise faster than revenues (118
percent during 1960-65). Prime causes for the increases in current expendi-
tures have been the growing deficit of the publicly owned railroads, the
rising cost of agricultural subsidies, the increase in the Government's con-
tribution to the social secarity system and the rapidly rising interest on
the public debt, which in 1960 amounted to little more than M$0.5 billion
while in 1965 it was almost M$2.3 billion and by 1970 could exceed M$4 billion.
7.        The Government has already taken some measures to reverse the decline
in public savings. Thus, beginning in 1966, private employers will absorb
about half of the Government's contribution for private employees to the social
security system which works on a tripartite (employer-employee-government)
basis. The Government has also expressed its intention to curtail agricultural
subsidies and has already reduced the support price for wheat, so as to shift
to the producers the losses previously borne on account of wheat exports.
Administrative changes introduced in 1965, which in effect make the Treasury
the cashier of the decentralized public sector agencies and enterprises, are
also expected to yield tighter controls over their expenditures. Furthermore,
the Government is considering other organizational and policy changes in
some of these agencies and enterprises and has expressed the intention to
improve their financial performance. Some tax measures, mostly of an ad-
ministrative nature, are also under consideration.
8.        It is the present opinion of the Government that these various
policies will suffice to raise public savings to a level at which, in con-
junction with acceptable levels of domestic and external borrowing, re-
sources will suffice to cover the public investment. However, until more
details on the timing and magnitude of the intended measures become available,
it is not possible to concur with or dissent from it. As decisions are reached
on the public investment programs for the next few years, the Government may
well conclude that still further measures are necessary to make complete the
public sector's financing plans. The Mexican authorities have shown skill
in managing Mexico's economic affairs and, in 1965, demonstrated that retrench-
ment in expenditures will be made if circumstances so require.
The External Sector
9.        It seems unlikely that Mexico's growth during the past decade and
a half would have been possible without very favorable foreign exchange
earnings, which rose at an average annual rate of about 5.5 percent. How-
ever, a perceptible slowing down occurred both in conmodity exports and in
earnings on service account during the second half of the period; and, at
least as concerns commodities, a further deceleration seems likely in the
next few years. One reason for this is the change in agricultural price
support policy referred to above; in recent years the largest additions to
export receipts originated in subsidized wheat and corn exports. The de-
cision to reduce or eliminate these subsidies will most probably induce
a decline in the exports of these cereals. Combined with the prospect
of some declines in cotton prices - Mexico's most important export comnodity -
this implies that even if the exports of manufactures continue to grow at



- 4 -
the dynamic pace of recent years, total export receipts will probably expand
at no more than some two percent per annum. Services, on the other hand, show
no indication of lagging; receipts from tourism and border trade - 39 percent
of total current account receipts in 1965 - have been growing at an average
annual rate of 8.5 percent during the past five years, and may well continue
to do so.
10.       One of the sources of strength of Mexico's foreign sector is its
diversification. Its three most important exports, cotton, coffee and sugar,
account for only about one-third of total commodity exports. In the past
price fluctuations have, to a degree, been mutually offsetting. Besides,
special factors, such as the cereal situation referred to above and the
access to the United States sugar market made possible by the absence of
Cuba from this market, have contributed to the growqth of exports. At present,
however, no new elements of strength of comparable magnitude are foreseeable.
Mexican authorities are, therefore, becoming increasingly conscious of the
need to reduce costs in a wide range of industries so as to make them com-
petitive gradually in international markets and have recently to this effect
announced a broad reorientation of their industrial protection and develop-
ment policies. While the effects of the new policies on exports cannot be
expected to be noticeable on the short run, their longer term implications
may be substantial.
11.       Confidence in the growth and stability of the economy, as well as
the stimulus provided by particular industrial protection policies, have in
recent years produced a rapid rise in direct foreign investments (US$1145
million annually in 1963-65 against an annual average of US$54 mil'lion in
1959-61). In recent years the automobile industry - affected by the Govern-
ment-imposed requirement that at least 60 percent of each new car be produced
domirestically - has been a major recipient of these funds. Since the basic
investments in this industry are now largely completed, and since no single
industry of cormparable magnitude appears likely to take its place as an
object for foreign investment, direct capital inflows are likely to level
off even if confidence remains as high as is generally expected.
12.       An inflow of official capital has been, in recent years, important
in sustaining the balance of payments. The very high public investments of
1964 were in large part financed by foreign borrowing on relatively short
terms, so that the debt service ratio rose from 16 percent in 1960 to about
22 percont in 1965. Preoccupation with this rising trend was one of the
2'Uctors that induced the Mexican authorities in 1965 to retrench drastically
in public investments and to exercise extreme caution in their new foreign
borrowing. They have expressed their intention to do everything possible
to maintain the absolute level of foreign debt service obligations (interest
and amortization) during the next few years at or belcw the level of about
Us$1450 million at which they stood in 1965.
13.       The amounts and terms of foreign official borrowing will be ex-
tremely important in Mexico's economic management in the next few years.



Mexico needs to move expeditiously in arranging and utilizing external loans
on a project basis if the momentum of the development effort is to be main-
tained. The Government has expressed its intention of continuing to utilize
Mexico's excellent credit standing in the international capital markets by
making bond issues, as was so successfully done in 1963-65 when US$128 mil-
lion were placed with European and North American investors.  Moreover, the
Government has stated that the controls established in 1965 over the foreign
borrowing of the decentralized public sector will be utilized energetically
both in limiting new debts to high priority projects and to obtaining the
best possible terms regarding grace periods and maturities. Furthermore,
the Mexican authorities have also expressed their intention to continue to
make efforts to stretch out the maturity of the existing official debt; the
recent placement in Europe of a US$20 million bond issue without Govermnent
guarantee by the state-owned power sector (Comision Federal de Electricidad)
to refinance its short-term obligations is part of these efforts. The present
prospects of Mexico's balance of payments make all these policies and measures
particularly important; the past record of the Mexican economy and the MvIexican
Government makes the assumption reasonable that both will rise to this chal-
lenge.
