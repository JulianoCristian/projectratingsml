project would increase the quantity\n            of water for irrigation in two irrigation districts through\n            the construction of additional dams and reconstruction of\n            the canal systems. In the Region Lagunera District the\n            irrigated area would be expanded from 52,660 hectares to\n            approximately 85,000; in the San Juan del Rio District the\n            increase would be from 5,400 hectares to approximately\n            10,000. In addition, the project would regulate the water\n            supply and reduce damage from floods; it would also reduce\n            the construction or rehabilitation of 620 km of roads in the\n            project areas. Adequate agricultural extension services,\n            including demonstration programs and long, medium and\n            short-term credit to farmers would be assured by the Government."}, "docdt": "1966-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
