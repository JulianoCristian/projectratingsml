In the Region Lagunera District the\n            irrigated area would be expanded from 52,660 hectares to\n            approximately 85,000; in the San Juan del Rio District the\n            increase would be from 5,400 hectares to approximately\n            10,000. In addition, the project would regulate the water\n            supply and reduce damage from floods; it would also reduce\n            the construction or rehabilitation of 620 km of roads in the\n            project areas.
