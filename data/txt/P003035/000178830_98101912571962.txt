I. THE ENVIRONMENT
A. The Industrial Sector
1.01      The industrial sector (including agro-industry but excluding
mining and basic metal processing) is relatively small, contributing some
9% of GDP and employing about 160,000 persons, or 22% of total employment
in the modern sector. Medium and large enterprises (over 100 workers)
dominate most branches, accounting for nearly 90% of total manufacturing
value added. As in many countries at the same stage of development,
industrial production consists essentially of consumer goods for the
domestic market.   Indeed, the sector is dominated by agro-industrial
enterprises, many of which are vertically integrated enterprises processing
the production of plantations. Principal agro-industrial enterprises
include palm oil production and refining, sugar processing, coffee drying
plants, cotton grinding and textile production, beverages, milling, rubber
and wood processing. As in the rest of the industry, many processing
plants are old, badly maintained and have increasingly suffered from
inadequate replacement investment and shortages of spare parts.
1.02      Over the last 10-12 years, there has been no significant change
in the structure of the sector or the location of enterprises. Zaire's
industry is still closely linked with commerce and many industrial firms
continue to have substantial commercial operations. Kinshasa, the capital,
remains the main center of industry with Lubumbashi a secondary center.
These two urban areas contribute more than two-thirds of industrial value
added and employment.
1.03      Until 1973, almost all major industrial enterprises were owned by
foreign and locally-based expatriate interests. However, the
;'zairianization" measures of 1973-74 and particularly the "radicalization"
(nationalisation) measures of 1974-75 transferred to Zairian hands
ownership of about two-thirds of firms in the manufacturing sector, which
nevertheless continued to be managed for the most part by their expatriate
owners and managers. These measures resulted in severe dislocation of the
distribution system of manufactured goods, particularly in the interior, a
drastic fall of industrial investment, and a substantial deterioration in
the relations between the private sector and the Government. In 1976, in
view of the problems posed to the country by the mismanagement and
stagnation of radicalized and Zairianized firms, the Government decided to
return up to 60% of the shareholding in the enterprises taken over to their
former foreign owners. The "retrocession" program, however, failed to
reestablish confidence fully and the uncertainties created by
Zairianization continue to inhibit the private sector (particularly
foreign) investment.
Past Performance and Present Situation
1.04      Between 1970 and 1974, manufacturing output grew at an annual
average rate of 7%, but decreased thereafter at an even faster rate, so
that by 1979 output at constant prices was about 10% below its 1970 level.



-2-
Zairianization and radicalization were the primary reasons for the severe
deterioration of the industrial sector but the substantial decrease in
copper prices and the ensuing general economic crisis also played an
important role.
1.05      Over this period, the relative performance of different
industrial subsectors varied considerably. Among consumer goods
industries, food and beverages expanded rapidly, while more moderate growth
was posted for light chemical industries (soaps, paints, varnishes, etc.)
and plastics. Conversely, metal products, leather goods, clothing
industries and tobacco declined. In intermediate and capital goods, only
transport equipment registered strong growth. All the other industries in
this group (cement, bottles, metal containers, basic chemicals, spinning
and weaving, wood processing industries etc.) decreased sharply. With the
general breakdown in the production and distribution systems and the
resulting insufficient supply of local inputs, the trend has been away from
processing local materials in favor of industries based on imported
materials. This was also encouraged by an overvalued exchange rate and the
"cost-plus" price system (para. 1.11). Non-essential consumer goods and
intermediate and capital goods also performed poorly because of the reduced
purchasing power of the population and the general depressed state of the
economy.
1.06      In late December 1979, the economy sustained a further shock.
All Z5 and Z10 banknotes, which represented 73% of currency in circulation
were demonetized and replaced on a one for two basis with new notes, thus
reducing the volume of currency in circulation by more than 30%.
Individuals and companies were given three days to change their old notes
(up to Z3,000 per individual and Z20,000 per company) and thereafter were
restricted in the amount of cash they could withdraw from the banks each
month and to only one withdrawal per month. The management of the
operation, in particular lack of coordination between BDZ and the banks led
to an uneven and inadequate distribution of new notes across the country,
especially in the interior, and resulted in major cash shortages below the
minimal requirements for trade and business. Since then, increases in
liquidity have partly overcome the disruptions caused by the demonetization
measures but a number of firms still experience liquidity problems.
1.07      Although Zaire's economy showed some signs of improvement in 1980
when the GDP registered a real growth of 2.3% while budgetary deficit was
contained within manageable limits, the country's problems remain
formidable: inflation is still very high; the balance of payments
continues to be under pressure because of the weakening of the world cobalt
and coffee market, the financial difficulties of Gecamines and, despite
reschedulings, heavy external debt service burden. As a result, Zaire's
industry is faced with:



-3-
(a) a declining demand for certain manufactured
products as a result of falling real wages and
income;1/
(b) severe shortages of foreign exchange for importing both
inputs and capital equipment. Plants in many branches are
in major need of modernization and rehabilitation but
private foreign capital for this purpose is not
forthcoming due to continued uncertainties in the
investment environment and the difficulties of
repatriating profits. In some industries, notably those
based on processing of local raw materials, net
disinvestment has been occurring since the beginning of
the economic crisis as a result of the decline in the
availability of agricultural inputs;
(c) difficulties in supply of inputs due to the dislocation of
transportation services and the deterioration of
agricultural and forestry sectors; and recently
(d) a tight liquidity situation resulting from the
demonetization measures of December 1979 and stricter
credit control imposed by BDZ.
1.08      The impact of these factors on the financial situation of
industrial enterprises has been serious. Profitability has fallen
markedly, industrial capacity utilization is low (about 30% of installed
capacity) and the ability to reinvest and/or maintain the existing capital
stock has diminished drastically. In this environment, SOFIDE has become
the major source of term investment finance (particularly in foreign
exchange), and has financed much of the investment required to preserve
Zaire's industrial base and to restore commercial agriculture and
agro-industrial production.

Government Industrial Policies and Medium-Term Prospects.
1.09      Prospects of the industrial sector remain linked to sustained
improvements in the overall economic situation. As noted above, despite
recent progress, Zairets economic difficulties persist. These had prompted
the Government to take a number of measures aimed at stimulating production
and containing the external account deficit within manageable levels.
Thus, in the first half of 1981, the Government adjusted its interest rate
structure upwards, took measures to liberalize prices and devalued its
currency by 67% to 1 Z = SDRO.1575, or about US$1 = Z5.5 (para. 1.43).
1.10      During this transition period on the way to economic recovery,
the Government is likely to follow the same policies and strategy for the
industrial sector as in the past. This strategy, which is the only
feasible one given the general state of the economy, consists mainly of
preserving the existing industrial base while preparing the basis for
future development through a strengthening of the country's investment
planning capacities. Within this general framework, the Government has
tried to use a number of policy instruments to regulate and assist the
industrial sector, although their effectiveness has been reduced by
insufficient qualified manpower in Government administration. Their impact
has also been very limited because of the crisis that had beset Zaire's
economy since 1974. The most important of these measures are discussed
below, with the exception of foreign exchange controls and credit
regulation, which are analyzed in paras. 1.35-1.40.
Price System
1.11      Until recently, prices of most manufactured products were fixed
at the producer, wholesale, and retail levels by the Ministry of National
Economy and Industry. Producer prices were generally established on the
basis of production costs (including depreciation) plus a 20% profit margin
before tax (50%).  Fixed margins above these prices are also set for
wholesalers' and retailers' mark-ups.  With high inflation and periodic
devaluations in recent years, frequent changes in the official prices have
been necessary.   Moreover, Government agencies lack qualified manpower to
enforce price controls.  In June 1981, the Government took an important
step towards liberalizing prices by allowing companies to set prices
themselves, with the only obligation to communicate them to the Ministry of
National Economy and Industry within 30 days.
The Investment Code
1.12      Under the Investment Code, revised in September 1979 to encourage
foreign private investment and introduce specific economic criteria for
award of benefits, the Government can grant a number of tax exemptions (on
profits, expatriate income taxes, property taxes, import duties on capital
equipment) and guarantees for repatriation of capital investment, profits
and interest. The extent and duration of the benefits depend on the size
of the projects and their impact on the balance of payments and on
employment.  Since September 1979, the code is administered by an
Investment Commission within the Planning Ministry (Commissariat Général au
Plan) which examines all project applications for approval and granting of



- 5 -
incentives. The organization of the Investment Commission has been
strengthened to enable it to better screen projects through more complete
financial and economic analysis. In addition to a permanent membership
consisting of representatives of the office of the President of the
Republic, BDZ, the Ministries of Planning, Finance, Labor, and National
Economy and Industry, and the President of the Commission itself, the
Commission can invite experts from other ministries on an ad hoc basis.
Minutes are prepared at every stage of the Commission's work to minimize
political considerations in the appraisal and decision-making process.
Since its inception in December 1979 to September 1981, the new Commission
had approved 31 projects (50% of all project proposals received) for a
total amount of Z471 million. About 42% were industrial projects and were
for the most part rehabilitation and modernization of existing plants and
equipment. The new commission's record to date is thus encouraging but it
could further increase its effectiveness by speeding its review process.
The Pre-Investment Fund
1.13       The purpose of this fund created in mid-1981 is to finance
feasibility or sector studies to improve the design and preparation of
projects It is managed by a Management Committee consisting of the
Minister of Planning, the Secretary of State, the Director of Projects and
Programs, and the Technical Secretary of the Fund. All of them are from
the Planning Ministry to which the Fund is attached. Its resources consist
mainly of budgetary allocations (Z9 million in 1981 and Z15 million in
1982) and some financial support from UNDP.  According to its statutes, the
fund should allocate 40% of its annual resources to finance studies
initiated by Government agencies and 60% to studies initiated by public,
mixed or private enterprises. Studies financed for Government agencies
will be on a grant basis, while those for public or private enterprises
will be made on the following conditions: 1 to 3 years grace; maximum 10
years maturity; interests and commission fees will be set by the Management
Committee on a case-by-case basis.  The Fund does not yet have any foreign
exchange resources, although some German aid is reportedly going to be made
available.
The Office for Promotion of Small and Medium-Scale Zairian Enterprises
(OPEZ)
1.14       Created in 1973 to provide assistance to small-scale enterprises,
OPEZ has so far been unsuccessful in fulfilling this role because of
inadequate organization and staffing, limited resources and the lack of a
defined strategy supported by the Government. SOFIDE has tried to
establish close cooperation with OPEZ, but has not succeeded owing to
OPEZ's limited capabilities. Most of its assistance to Zairian small scale
enterprises has therefore been made independently of OPEZ. Recently the
Government with UNIDO assistance set up a task force to study the
constraints facing SSI and to propose an action program for their
development and the strengthening of OPEZ's organization. No budgetary
support for OPEZ has yet been provided, however.
1.15       Unlike many developing countries, Zaire has not until recently
relied on foreign trade regulation to encourage industrial development.
Taxes and duties on imported goods are not high compared with other



- 6 -
countries, but appear somewhat unsystematic and haphazardly applied. As a
result, some local manufacturers have difficulty in competing with imports
owing to higher tariffs being charged on their imported inputs than on
competing imported finished products. No incentives are granted to
exporters of manufactured goods. On the contrary, industrial exports are
in numerous cases discouraged by the imposition of export duties and
taxes.
Sector Issues
1.16      As mentioned earlier, prospects for the industrial sector depend
to a large extent on the recovery of the Zairian economy which will be a
long and difficult process requiring careful management of available
resources. There are, however, a number of sector issues which need to be
addressed and solved now to improve the environment in which industrial
firms are working. The major ones are:
(a) Availability of foreign exchange for spare parts and raw
materials: This remains the main constraint to capacity
utilization in the short-term. However, in the long run
its effects could even be more serious. The inability to
obtain spare parts has already forced some firms to
substitute substandard domestically produced spare parts
which do not meet the required tolerance, thus leading to
rapid deterioration of equipment. It is therefore
essential that foreign exchange allocations by BDZ take
into account the needs of the industrial sector (para.
1.40 and 1.41).
(b) Promotion of small-scale enterprises: As noted above, the
Government is considering revitalizing OPEZ. Such an
action would be necessary but not sufficient to ensure the
development of small scale enterprises. Present economic
and operating conditions in Zaire are indeed making it
increasingly difficult for small firms to survive. This
is the result of a combination of external factors (such
as the collapse of agriculture, high inflation, shortages
of spare parts etc. to which small firms are more
vulnerable than larger ones) and the absence of a clear
policy towards small enterprises. Although Zaire's
overall economic situation could only improve slowly, some
measures could be introduced to promote SSI development
such as: (i) legislation changes to make commerce less
attractive and profitable than industry. At present, laws
favoring small enterprises apply equally to industry and
commerce, so that most people tend to opt for commerce
since it is more profitable, has a shorter payback and
involves less risk; (ii) introduction of measures to
improve credit facilities and encourage better accounting;
and (iii) establishment of the guarantee fund, for which
provision exists in the legislation, with a more
comprehensive coverage of the risk.



7-
(c)  Improvement in project design and preparation:  Many
industrial projects submitted to the Investment
Commission's need additional preparatory work to become
economically viable. The Government is aware of this fact
and has created a pre-Investment Fund (para. 1.13) to
finance feasibility or sector studies. However, the fund
does not yet have any foreign exchange resources. The
proposed project described in this report includes funds
for financing the foreign exchange cost of feasibility as
well as sector policy studies aimed at assisting the
Government to improve policy making and policy
coordinations for the industrial sector (para. 3.08).
Bank Group Strategy
1.17      Given the present economic crisis in Zaire, the objectives of the
Bank Group in the sector are mainly to (i) provide the foreign exchange
needed to preserve Zaire's existing industrial base and increase the
production of basic goods for the population; (ii) support and reinforce
SOFIDE, the main institution promoting private industrial development; and
(iii) assist the Government in improving policy making and policy
coordination for the industrial sector through the financing under this
project of sector policies studies (para. 3.09).
B. The Agricultural Sector
1.18      The agricultural potential of Zaire is considerable.  The
couutry's geographical location astride the Equator and the differences in
elevation within the country result in several climates, which make
possible a variety of agricultural activities. An estimated 70-85% of the
population derives its livelihood directly from agriculture and much of the
remaining 25-30% is indirectly dependent on it for employment. Zaire has
also the world's largest reserve of tropical hardwoods, and fishing could
be developed considerably more in the country's extensive river and lake
network.
1.19      The sector is characterized by a clear distinction between the
traditional sub-sector, composed of smallholders, and a relatively advanced
modern sub-sector. The predominant crops grown on traditional farms are
cassava, maize, rice, cotton, peanuts, vegetables, and tropical fruits
vegetables, and tropical fruits, in particular bananas. The principal
crops produced by the modern sector are oil palm, sugar, rubber, tobaccco,
coffee, cocoa and cattle.
Performance
1.20      The share of agriculture in total GDP at current prices has not
changed significantly over the last 20 years (26% in 1959 as compared to
30% in 1979). It has, however, fluctuated considerably with the
vicissitudes of Zaire's copper-based economy and with the rise and decline
of agricultural production itself. It was estimated that, of the total



- 8 -
contribution of agriculture to GDP in 1959, 40% came from the traditional
sector and 60% from the modern sector; these shares are currently estimated
at 60% and 40% respectively.
1.21       The modern sector includes about 800 production units of an
average size of 2,300 ha per unit (about 25 percent of Zaire's land under
cultivation).  It has stagnated or declined since independence.  The
traditional sector comprises an estimated 3-4 million farming units,
occupying a total of about 4 to 6 million ha.  The average farm size is
about 1.5 ha of crop land.  The share of traditional farms in total
production includes nearly 100% of cotton, 20% of robusta coffee, 80% of
arabica coffee, 30% of marketed oil palm fruits, and 20% of tea.  About 60%
of the national cattle herd is owned by 100,000 traditional farmers.
1.22       Production of food crops is estimated to have slightly increased
between 1973 and 1979, while that of export crops declined by about 10%,
mainly as a result of a substantial decrease of palm oil (35% to 98,500tons
in 1979) and cotton (60% to 96,000 tons in 1979). On the other hand,
estimated coffee production (arabica and robusta) remained constant at
67,000 tons while wood log production increased by 8% (350,000 m3 in 1979).
Imports and Exports
1.23       The consequences of the declining or stagnating production and of
a growing population have been a general decline in exports, an increase of
imports (agricultural inputs excepted) and probably an impoverishment of
the population's diet. Zaire used to be a maize exporter, but was importing
64,000 tons by 1970, and 139,100 tons by 1979. The share of agricultural
exports in Zaire's total exports was 15 percent in 1979; the quantities
exported dropped from an estimated 443,000 tons in 1968 to 277,000 tons in
1973 and again to 152,000 tons in 1979:

Agriculture Credit
1.24      The commercial agricultural sector is served by commercial banks
and SOFIDE whose financing of agricultural investment projects has grown
rapidly in the past four years. There is, at present, no institutional
credit for small farmers, except for that minority which benefits from
special agricultural projects set up under the auspices of a number of
outside lenders. The establishment of an agricultural credit institution
is currently being studied by the Department of Agriculture and Rural
Development (DOA). However, in view of the complexity of the problem, the
creation of such an institution will probably take a long time.
Sector Issues
1.25      Serious deficiencies in economic management, adverse decisions by
Government, Zairianization and nationalization have led to a considerable
decline in the productivity of the economy, and especially of the
agricultural sector since 1974 and resulted in the urgent and critical
problems Zaire faces today. These problems make it very difficult to plan
and implement effective agricultural development schemes. In
addition,Zaire's agricultural sector suffers from the geographical
constraints (size, terrain etc) which are exacerbated by the limited size
and poor state of the internal communications network.
1.26      In the past few years, the Government's actions to develop the
agricultural sector consisted of a series of hastily conceived schemes to
arrest the decline of production. Agricultural production has been
seriously curtailed by an almost total absence of services, by shortages of
inputs and spare parts, limited investments, and by the dramatic
deterioration of the transport network. Recently, however, there have been
three important initiatives. First, the Government has sought to
decentralize the decision making and planning authority to Regional
Authorities. Second, it introduced a system of so-called Economic Recovery
Funds, whereby firms were authorized to increase their prices up to 10% of
the retail price of their end-products in exchange for a commitment to
invest 10% of the proceeds in projects designed and managed by them for the
production of the raw materials they consumed or for improving the economic
environment affecting their activites (e.g., for roads, hospitals, etc.) A
review of this system showed that the results varied from one company to
another. Third, in 1978 the Government abolished most of the parastatals
agencies, including ONACER (cererals) and ONAFITEX (cotton), which were
highly inefficient. For cotton marketing and processing, the Government
has promoted regional mixed capital companies in joint ventures with
textile firms. The Agricultural Action Plan adopted at the 1981
Consultative Group meeting outlined a series of steps for development of
the agricultural sector. These include an increasing role of the private
sector, incentives to encourage investment, and a better allocation of
foreign exchange. The Government is currently in the process of drawing up
an agricultural strategy for discussion at the next Consultative Group
meeting.
1.27      Virtually all institutions responsible for development of the
agricultural sector are weak and poorly organized. Existing extension



- 10 -
services provide almost no effective services to farmers and in some areas
are counter-productive, notably by enforcing inappropriate price levels and
"imposed cultivation" provisions requiring cultivation of uneconomic
crops.  Zaire's formerly outstanding agricultural research system no longer
functions effectively and links, both with farmers and with extension
services, are practically non-existent. Agriculture training is not
providing the much needed staff for development programs. Project
preparation capability is very limited, and the Department of Agriculture
lacks the staff and appropriate organization to supervise on-going
projects. Basic systems for collecting and processing agricultural
statistics are weak, and low salaries of most Government officials offer
virtually no performance incentive.
1.28      The agricultural sector, although declared the "priority of
priorities", has been allocated a very low proportion of govenment
budgetary resources. Agriculture's share of current budgetary expenditures
was on average 2.4 percent a year during the period 1973-79, (and almost
all these allocations went to pay salaries), while its share in Government
capital expenditures averaged 6% for the same period. Budgetary procedures
do not work well and high priority activities are frequently omitted from
the budget.  Capital budget funds are seldom transferred to operating
agencies before the end of the fiscal year.
1.29      Marketing of most agricultural crops is dominated by the private
sector, although some parastatals (ONDE for livestock, ONP for fish
products) also play a role in marketing. Export marketing is, to a large
extent, handled by commercial plantations or trading agents but, in 1979,
the Government established a new marketing agency for coffee, the
Office Zairois du Café (OZACAF) with responsibility for overseeing all
aspects of coffee marketing and export.
1.30      The Government has sought to regulate and control prices of most
agricultural commodities through the establishment of minimum prices (food
crops, cattle), fixed prices (cotton), and official minimum price in
relation to the world market prices (coffee, tea), or fixed prices based on
cost plus 20 percent margin (sugar, palm oil). These pricing policies and
mechanisms have had an important and generally negative impact on
production and marketing in several instances. Actual prices paid by
consumers are often much higher than the official prices, since they
reflect product scarcities, the long chain of intermediaries, the
inadequate and high cost transportation, packing and storage problems and
the high losses, especially of perishable products. All this results in
either permanent shortages of supplies or intermittent supplies which often
do not meet demands. The smuggling out of Zaire of some commodities
(coffee, oil palm, etc.) make these shortages even more acute.
Recently, the Government liberalized prices of most agricultural products.
1.31      Transportation problems present one of the most serious
impediments to agricultural development for Zaire. Zaire's transportation
system is dominated by the Zaire river system and its tributaries (with
over 13,500 km of-navigable waterways). Road and rail systems in general
complement the river system, with numerous transshipment points on major
routes. In recent years, the existing transportation infrastructure has
been poorly maintained, services have been poorly managed, and private



- il -
transporters have faced inadequate equipment and shortages of fuel and
spare parts. As a result, large areas of Zaire are most of the time
inaccessible, and transportation costs are very high.
SOFIDE's Role in the Sector
1.32      Despite the difficulties facing the sector, there is substantial
potential for future investment in agriculture in Zaire, especially if
progress were made by the Government in resolving the critical issues
outlined above. In the short term, the most urgent priority lies in
rehabilitating existing and transport services and in providing the foreign
exchange to import essential inputs.  In that context, SOFIDE has played a
useful, albeit modest role, in assisting medium size agricultural
enterprises to maintain and modernize their existing productive capacity.
C. The Financial Sector
1.33      The financial sector in Zaire consists mainly of the Central
Bank, nine commercial banks and one development bank (SOFIDE). All these
institutions are based in Kinshasa, but the larger commercial banks have
branches in major centers in the interior.
1.34      The Central Bank (BDZ) is responsible for regulating all the
financial institutions in the country and for establishing and
administering national monetary and credit policies. BDZ also manages the
country's international reserves, and is also in charge of Zaire's import
licensing and foreign exchange control system, which it administers wlth
the assistance of the commercial banks. As a financial institution, BDZ
can lend to the Government, but not to public enterprises which are
considered part of the private sector as far as credit is concerned.
1.35      The nine commercial banks have a total of 82 branches throughout
Zaire. The Banque Commerciale Zairoise (an affiliate of the Belgian
Société Générale de Banque) is by far the largest, with deposits accounting
for some 60% of all commercial banks' deposits, and 29 branch offices. The
second largest is the Banque du Peuple, which is 100% owned by the
Government, and the third largest is the Union Zairoise de Banque (UZB).
Others include the almost fully Zairian-owned Banque de Kinshasa, the
Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique au Zaire (BIAZ), First National City
Bank-Zaire, Barclays Bank-Zaire, Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas and
Grindlays Bank. Because of deteriorating economic conditions and high
inflation the commercial banks have been very reluctant in recent years to
lend on a medium or long term basis. Thus, most of their lending is short
term, although through some revolving short-term credit, they have also
contributed to financing industrial investment (in conjunction with SOFIDE
on some projects). The commercial banks play a particularly important role
in the financing of imports and exports, in which they act under regulation
of the central bank. The only principal source of long term finance and
the only non-governmental source of term foreign exchange financing is the
development bank, SOFIDE, which is described in detail in the next chapter
of this report.

Credit Control and Interest Rates
1.36      Over the past few years, as a result of the deepening economic
crisis, credit has been progressively tightened. Thus, since 1979
commercial banks have been required to deposit the equivalent of 25% of
their liabilities with BDZ. The overall volume of credit each commercial
bank could provide over a given quarter was also limited and depended on
the volume of its deposits at the beginning of that quarter. Five
sub-ceilings (agriculture, other productive sectors including industry,
transportation, distribution and other services) were also established
within that overall limit to regulate the relative proportions of
commercial bank lending to different priority sectors and uses. Penalties
for exceeding ceilings were extremely high, amounting to 1% of the excess
per day. In 1981 credit control was further tightened with the
introduction of a new measure limiting the access to BDZ's rediscounting
facilities to only three categories of credit: bills of exchange, treasury
bonds and short-term agricultural credits. The excessive liquidity of the
banking system was thus progressively reduced. Indeed, with the need for
individuals and enterprises to reconstitute their cash balances following
the demonetization measures, the commercial banks ended the year 1980 with
a relatively tight situation.
1.37      Until recently, implementation of this restrictive credit policy
did not pose major problems for industry as industrial investment was at a
low level and as the main problem was to obtain foreign exchange. There
are, however, indications that the industrial sector is now facing
increasingly difficult liquidity problems as a result of the rapid increase
in costs and, to some extent, the persisting effects of the demonetization
measures. Because of ceilings imposed on commercial banks' lending to
industry, many firms have been unable to obtain short-term credits to buy
the foreign exchange allocated to them by BDZ and which they need to
maintain a minimum level of capacity utilisation. As of August 31, 1981,
more than a third of the US$50 million foreign exchange allocation made
available to the industrial sector remained unused, forcing BDZ to extend
the deadline indefinitely (see para. 1.40 below). The situation remained
tight at the end of 1981 but would have to ease if production level is to
increase. Should the situation remain tight, it is likely to lead to a
rapid deterioration of the financial position of many enterprises at all
levels, severely reducing their ability to meet their obligations,
including those to SOFIDE.
1.38      Until March 1980 maximum interest rates were set for commercial
bank loans and ranged from 7.5% for rediscountable short-term credits for
production and equipment to 20% for non-rediscountable medium and long-term
credits. 2/ Effective April 1, 1981 a new structure giving the commercial
banks more flexibility in the setting of interest rates was established.
As mentioned in para. 1.36, the Government also restricted access to BDZ
rediscounting facilities which are now only reserved for certain categories
of credits and only apply to loans within the specific credit ceilings.
2/ SOFIDE's lending rates are not subject to BDZ control.

1.39      Given the reluctance of commercial banks to seek new sectors of
investment, the lending rates prior to April 1981 appear to have played
little role in the allocation of local currency resources. However, the
recent adjustment, which increased lending rates by 25 - 45 percent to the
levels mentioned in the table above, should encourage commercial banks to
diversify their activities to other than largely trade financing and should
have a somewhat greater impact on resource allocation.
Foreign Exchange Controls
1.40      Until 1974, BDZ had delegated administration of almost all
foreign exchange transactions to the licensed commercial banks, except for
exports of copper, cobalt and diamonds. In the wake of the deteriorating
foreign exchange situation due to falling copper prices and the increasing
burden of the external public and commercial debts, stricter control
measures were introduced in 1975 when BDZ started to allocate ("dotation en
devises") foreign exchange to commercial banks for distribution to
importers. With the deepening of the crisis, foreign exchange restrictions
were made more severe through BDZ's circular no. 156 to the commercial
banks which became effective in September 1978. This circular (slightly
revised in February 1981) reduces the proportion of foreign exchange
earnings retained by the commercial banks from 80% to 50-55% as 30% are now
reserved for the BDZ to service Zaire's external debt and 15-20% for the
exporter. Commercial banks were further instructed to allocate their
foreign exchange receipts as follows: 30% for imports of consumer goods;
45% for raw materials, spare parts and intermediate goods; and 25% for
payments of invisibles. The NGBZ program, 3/ which in 1977 and 1978 was a
3/ In 1977 BDZ introduced this "Nouvelle Garantie de la Banque du Zaire"
program under which it guaranteed foreign exchange cover for imports
when the amount needed exceeded the foreign exchange holdings of a
commercial bank.



- 14 -
major source of foreign exchange for industry, was also abolished. On the
other hand, the SAD System 4/ was substantially liberalized and can now
apply to almost all imports. This has contributed to reduce shortages of
consumer goods in the past few years.  Some industrial firm have also used
the SAD system to finance raw materials and spare parts although the costs
of such imports are quite high.
1.41      Under the present control system there are only four ways for
industrial firas to obtain foreign exchange at the official rate: (a)
engage in export activities and keep 15-20% of the foreign exchange
receipts; (b) commercial banks; (c) bilateral aid, such as the Belgian
Fonds de Transfert established in 1979 to help Zairian industries import
raw materials and spare parts; and (d) BDZ annual foreign exchange
allocations, which are at present distributed among companies in a rather
ad hoc manner, often giving priority to large firms. Since many SOFIDE
clients are small to medium sized firms, they are not at all assured of
getting the foreign exchange needed to operate above break-even point. At
negotiations, the Government agreed to consult with SOFIDE on the
distribution of each special allocation of foreign exchange to the
industrial sector (dotation spéciale).
Inflation and Exchange Rate
1.42      The persistent imbalance between supply of goods (both imported
and domestic) and local demand, periodic sharp devaluations and the
inefficacy of official price controls all have been fueling inflation
which has reached unprecedented levels over the past few years. According
to official statistics, consumer prices in Kinshasa rose by 58% in 1978,
98% in 1979. 42% in 1980 and an estimated 45% in 1981. The lower rate in
1980 was mainly due to three factors: (a) the implementation of the IMF
stabilization program; (b) the impact of the demonetization measures; and
(c) the further erosion of real income. For the next four years, Bank
projections indicate that inflation in Zaire might be of the order of 40%
in 1982 and 30% in 1983-85.
1.43      Since March 1976 when the Zaire was pegged to the SDR at a rate
of Zl = SDR 1, it has been devalued six times by a total of 635%. The last
devaluation took place in June 1981 and brought the exchange rate down to
ZI = SDR 0.1575 (or about US$1 = Z5.5). Following this substantial
adjustment (67%), the rate of the Zaire improved somewhat on the parallel
market but the differential with the official rate remained substantial (10
Zaires per US dollar compared to 5.5 Zaires on the official market). The
Government has stated that, in the future, it will follow a flexible
exchange rate policy involving frequent but gradual adjustments.
4/ To alleviate shortages, in the mid-1970s BDZ authorized certain imports
to be financed by foreign exchange obtained from sources other than
the domestic banking system (Système d'Importation sans Achat de
Devises - SAD).

II. THE INSTITUTION
Background and IDA's Relationship with SOFIDE
2.01      The Société Financière de Développement (SOFIDE) was created on
January 9, 1970 and began operations six months later. On May 28, 1970,
IFC approved an equity investment of. US$750,000 representing 18.75 percent
of SOFIDE's initial share capital and IDA provided its first credit of US$5
million (190-CK), and acted as executing agency for a program of technical
assistance from UNDP as well as seconding a staff member as Director
General. Since the granting of the first Credit in 1970, IDA has made four
other credits to SOFIDE: 271-CK for US$10 million in 1971; 463-CK for US$10
million in 1973; 710-ZR for 10 million in 1977; and 998-ZR for US$18.5
million in 1980.
2.02      The main objectives of IDA in its relationship with SOFIDE have
been primarily those relating to nurturing a young and inexperienced, but
effective, financial institution operating in an extremely difficult
environment, and also to provide investment financing for productive
purposes, principally in medium and large scale projects in industry,
tourism and transport. The fifth IDA Credit provided the impetus to widen
SOFIDE's scope of activities to commercial agriculture and agroindustry,
both considered by IDA to be priority sectors in the context of Zaire's
economy. 5/ The main objectives of the fifth Credit continued to stress
institution building and productive investment financing and aimed at
maintaining Zaire's existing industrial base and assisting medium scale
enterprises in the commercial agriculture sector. In this regard, IDA
assisted SOFIDE to draw up and adopt a new investment strategy in order to
establish a priority ranking of projects submitted for financing to SOFIDE
according to their importance to the Zairian economy. SOFIDE still
maintains this investment strategy (Annex 2). As of April 15, 1982, about
US$16.0 million have been committed under the fifth line of credit.
Projects financed were mainly for plant renewal and rehabilitation and
included a sugar plantation/refining complex, a cotton rehabilitation
project (both in association with direct IDA financing), a fishing and fish
distribution project, renewal of equipment for a civil engineering firm,
rehabilitation of a plant to manufacture bottles largely from local raw
materials, the renewal of some equipment and extension for a plastics
products packaging project, and the rehabilitation of some equipment for a
large engineering and metal working group. Only two projects were new
creations. All projects aimed at stimulating production of basic goods to
meet a large and unsatisfied demand and thus reduce the need for imports.
The projects financed rely mainly on domestic raw materials and all were
judged to be economically justified with financial and economic rates of
return in excess of 20%. Individual project size varied between US$200,000
to US$2.4 million with an average of US$800,000.
5/ At least US$7.5 million was allocated for financing the foreign
exchange component of SOFIDE loans in these two sectors.

Lessons from Audit
2.03      A Project Completion Report and a Project Performance Audit
Report were prepared in 1975-76 for the first IDA credit. A second Project
Completion Report covering the evolution of SOFIDE and its relationship
with the Bank over the period 1975-80 (including a review of the
subprojects financed) was issued in early 1981. A Project Performance
Audit Report for the same period is being finalized. The main conclusions
of the first Audit Report suggested that SOFIDE should be dloser involved
in overall sector policy formulation. In the turbulent environment of the
past five years, however, this could only be done progressively and with
caution given the constant struggle of SOFIDE to survive as an independent
and financially viable institution. The PCR on the second and third
Projects commented on the substantial cost to SOFIDE of its efforts to
finance SSE's in a difficult environment (para. 2.04) and on the
organizational and financial problems posed by the environment on one side
and the growth in operations on the other. SOFIDE, has, as described
further on in this report, moved rapidly to address these issues,  by
restricting its promotional activities, instituting cost cutting measures,
institutional reorganization along the lines suggested in the PCR and by
increasing its interest rates.
Institutional Aspects
Objectives and Role
2.04      SOFIDE's Statutes and Policy Statement list as its broad
objectives (i) to provide equity and term loan finance for investments in
the productive sectors of the economy and (ii) foster the distribution of
shareholdings and the development of a capital market in Zaire. Because of
the crises which have hit the Zairian economy since 1973, SOFIDE could not
pursue the latter objective and has concentrated its activities on meeting
the first objective.  It has therefore operated as a traditional
development finance institution providing term investment finance to medium
and large industry, and recently to commercial agriculture and
agroindustry. It has also, at the instigation of several of its outside
lenders, increased its financing of small scale enterprises. SOFIDE has
successfully established itself as the only term lending institution in
Zaire and has succeeded in attracting and retaining the confidence of a
number of foreign lenders. SOFIDE was considerably helped in this by IDA's
close and constant support both in terms of financial and technical
assistance.
Share Capital and Ownership
2.05      In order to help restore SOFIDE's capital base which has been
eroded by the continued devaluation of the Zaire, in December 1980 SOFIDE's
Board approved a second increase of SOFIDE's authorized capital from Z4.0
million to Z12.0 million, of which Z10.1 was fully paid in by June 1981.



- 17 -
SOFIDE management expects the balance to be paid in shortly. The
authorized share capital is held as follows:
Before Increase              After Increase
Capital = Z4 million        Capital = Z12 million
---------       (in percentage)----------------

IFC did not participate in the capital increase. In addition to its share
capital, SOFIDE has long term, low interest subordinated loans, which are
considered by IDA to have quasi-equity characteristics. These consist of:
(i) Zl million in Government advances bearing no interest and extended for
the lifetime of the company; (ii) Z5 million in Government loans with a
maturity of 40 years and bearing 1 percent annual interest; and (iii)
"rolled-over" IDA funds relent to SOFIDE by Government. These are the
proceeds of repayments from subprojects financed out of previous IDA
credits and repaid to Government.
Board of Directors
2.06      SOFIDE's Board presently consists of ten members (of whom 5
represent foreign institutions and 5 the Zairian public and private
shareholders) and is chaired by SOFIDE's President and General Manager.
Although the composition of the Board of Directors represents the various
shareholders interests, it has not yet been changed to reflect the changes
in the shareownership of SOFIDE following the recent capital increase. The
Board meets on a quarterly basis to discuss major policy issues and to
approve loans exceeding US$300,000 and equity investments above Z50,000.
Although Board decisions have generally been sound, several directors,
notably those representing the private overseas shareholders do not attend
Board meetings regularly and Zairian directors are not always well informed
on issues relating to SOFIDE. The President/General Manager has effective
control over most Board/Executive Committee meetings. Given the difficult
environment and SOFIDE's delicate situation, the institution needs a
stronger and more active board. IFC's presence on SOFIDE's Board, which
SOFIDE has requested IFC to maintain despite its reduced shareholding, is
critical to ensure that the Board can efficiently play its role.



- 18 -
Executive Committee
2.07      The Executive Committee consisting of six members, five of whom
are also locally based directors, meets at more frequent intervals than the
Board. It has authority to approve all individual loans below Board limits
(para. 2.06).
Management, Staffing, and Organization
2.08      Management:  SOFIDE's President and General Manager, a Zairian
national joined SOFIDE in 1973. He is a competent manager and is well
respected in the Zairian public and private sectors. The position of
Deputy General Manager has been held by various Bank Staff on secondment
until 1981 when it was filled by a high level expatriate manager. SOFIDE's
top management has performed well in a difficult situation. In this it has
been supported by its middle management consisting of six department
directors, all Zairian, and the expatriate head of the Secretariat des
Agences (para.2.11). All have been with SOFIDE for several years, some
since its inception, and all are very competent and highly motivated and
constitute the backbone of the institution.
2.09      Staffing:  SOFIDE is adequately staffed by capable Zairian
professionals assisted in a few specialized technical areas by
expatriates. As of August 1981, the total professional staff, excluding
the President and Deputy General Manager, amounted to 50 including 4
expatriates (two FAO agronomists, an engineer financed by the French
Cooperation and a projects officer financed by German technical
assistance). The Zairian staff typically have formal training in business
administration, economics, commerce, engineering or agronomy and joined
SOFIDE either directly from University following competitive examination or
after three or four years working in the public or private sector. Most
professional staff have benefitted from specialized courses in project
finance and management, both in-house organized by SOFIDE, and overseas
such as those organized by the Centre d'Etudes Financières Economiques et
Bancaires (CEFEB) and EDI, as well as significant practical on-the-job
training. SOFIDE's staff is young, competent, hardworking and well
motivated, but somewhat overstretched. In view of the rapid rise in
administrative costs, SOFIDE has over the past two years severely
controlled the increase in staff.  This policy is likely to be continued.
In line with the planned level of operations and growth in portfolio,
SOFIDE expects to recruit at least two new professional staff per year
through 1984. The proposed project will include a component to assist
SOFIDE in providing such new recruits and existing staff with specialized
training and experience in project finance, management, accounting and
particularly in financial management.
2.10      Staff Training Center (CEPETEDE):  Recently, a training center in
banking, administration, economic and financial analysis of projects has
been created in Kinshasa under SOFIDE's active sponsorship with the
CCCE's cooperation (which is also providing technical assistance to staff
the Centre). The center will be known as CEPETEDE (Centre de
Perfectionnement aux Techniques de Développement). Its cost will amount to
Z2 million and the FAC (Fonds d'Aide et de Coopération) will finance the
foreign exchange cost, while the local costs will be borne by SOFIDE and
the other local project sponsors which are the Banque de Zaire, Département
du Portefeuille de l'Etat, Commissariat Général du Plan, Secrétariat



- 19 -
Permanent de la Comptabilité, and the Office de Gestion de la Dette
Publique (OGEDEP).   SOFIDE seconded its former director of the Economic
Studies Department to manage the Centre. He is ;assisted by an expatriate
with the title of Director of Studies. The first course for about 35
students has already started. The Center will enable SOFIDE and the other
participants to offer their staff a more comprehensive training program.
The technical assistance component of the proposed project will provide
funds, (up to US$150,000) to enable SOFIDE to engage the services of
foreign experts (about 18 man monthsy to run high level seminars in
financial and project Management for its staff, at the Centre in which
clients and staff of the other Centre partners could also participate.
2.11      Organization:  With the exception of the establishment of the
Agriculture Department in 1976 and the opening of the three regional
offices (starting in 1978), SOFIDE's organization had not changed
materially since its inception. Until early in 1981, the organizational
structure was flat and cellular, with six departments reporting directly to
top management and relatively heavy formal channels for exchanging
information. With the increase in the amount and complexity of operations
this system became quite cumbersome. In particular, the separation between
the Accounting and Administration Department and the Risk Management
Department (which was responsible for loan administration, follow up and
overall financial management) led to substantial duplication of effort and
at times, conflicting data. Moreover, since the latter department was
overburdened, the loan supervision function was neglected. Following
recommendations from IDA and the CCCE in early 1981, SOFIDE management
proceeded to review the overall organizational structure in order to bring
it more in line with the present level of operations. The present
organizational structure is summarized in Annex 3. SOFIDE's management has
also become more aware of the need to monitor and control separately the
performance of the Agriculture Department (paras. 2.12-2.15), its portfolio
and costs, and has taken the necessary action to do so. The main changes
over the previous structure are:
(a)  The Accounting and Administration Department and
the Risk Management Department have been merged into a
single Finance Department. A capable Zairian
professional, previously the Head of the Risk Management
Department, was appointed to head the new Department. Two
assistants, one in charge of accounting and one of
financial management report to him. SOFIDE is proceeding
to rationalize the information system of the two
Departments to cut out duplication and improve data
reconciliation.
(b)  The administration function, previously in the Accounting
Department was spun off and a separate Administration
Department, in charge of payroll, personnel and other
administrative matters set up.
(c)  The supervision function was transferred to the Technical
Department. A deputy director for supervision was
designated to take charge of this function and SOFIDE's
management expect that in time a separate supervision
department will be established.



- 20 -
(d)  The Secrétariat des Agences et du Crédit, created in 1980,
initally to coordinate the work of the regional offices is
nov functioning as an internal secretariat to top
management and has carried out very useful studies on
various organizational problems facing SOFIDE. It is
intended that in time SAC could also carry out an internal
audit function.
(e)  The Projecte Department is now formally in charge of the
economic and financial analysis of projects and overall-
project appraisal coordination. It is assisted by the
Technical Department, and on demand, by the Economic
Studies Department. (Previously all three departments
vere involved in appraisals without any department having
overall responsibility for coordination).
(f) The Economic Studies Department is no longer directly
involved in Project Appraisal. Its main responsibilities
are nov to prepare market and sector studies and to
organize training courses.
The Agriculture Department
2.12      SOFIDE responded to the perceived need for a term lending
institution for agroindustrial and commercial scale agricultural projects
by creating its Agriculture Department in 1976 with FAO assistance. This
department expanded very rapidly. It contributed 4 percent of SOFIDE's
total approvals by amount in 1976, 48 percent in 1979, and 40 percent in
1980. The relative decline of approvals in 1980 was due to the decrease of
loans made to saall and medium scale companies.
The department is nov organized into four sections:
3 technical sections: a) livestock
b) fruit and vegetable production and
c) agro-industry and forestry.
l financial section.
2.13      The Department is staffed adequately with one director and 11
professionals, including two expatriates funded by FAO. The total staff of
the Department has increased from 6 in 1976 (9 percent of total SOFIDE
staff) to 17 as of -id-1981 (11 percent of total SOFIDE staff). The
regional offices assist the Agriculture Department closely, and additional
professional staff (one agronomist in Goma, Kisangani and Lubumbashi
offices, plus an agro-industry specialist in Lubumbashi) are expected to be
assigned to these regional offices to enable them to better fulfil this
function. The Canadian Development Agency (CIDA) is currently proposing
seconding technical specialists to the Goma office.
2.14      The Department is responsible for the technical, managerial and
financial aspects of agricultural project appraisal and works with the
Secrétariat des Agences et du Crédit (SAC) for the screening of the
projects to be appraised and with the Risk Management Department on
supervision (nov under the new organization with the supervision section of
the Technical Department).



- 21 -
2.15      From 1976 to mid 1981, the Department appraised 995 projects, out
of which 117 (11.8 percent) were approved for financing. SOFIDE deployed
considerable resources to identify and prepare detailed feasibility studies
for a number of very small projects, many of which had to be dropped
subsequently because of lack of adequate management or low profitability.
In the future, SOFIDE will develop its pre-screening procedures to reduce
such unproductive efforts and permit the Agriculture department to focus
more on supervision, which was neglected and was not adequately coordinated
with the other departments (SAC and Risk Management). It will also monitor
and control separately the performance of the agricultural portfolio.
Regional Offices
2.16      In 1978 SOFIDE decided to establish four regional offices, in
Goma, Kananga, Lubumbashi, and Kisangani. It was expected that these
offices would support the operating departments and, in particular, the
Agriculture Department in identifying, appraising and supervising projects
in the interior. Three of these offices have been opened to date:
Kisangani and Goma in 1978 and Lubumbashi in 1979. SOFIDE appointed one
capable senior professional staff to head each of the offices. SOFIDE
recently conducted an internal study on the effectiveness and costs of
these offices. The main conclusions of this study were that these offices:
(i) did not alleviate the supervision burden of
Headquarters; and
(ii) did not play the screening role they were
supposed to, but instead increased the
number of small scale, often ill prepared,
agricultural projects passed on to
headquarters for preparation and
appraisal.
The study also concluded that there was a very large discrepancy between
the projects identified by the regional offices (320 since their creation)
and the number of projects approved (29, of which 15 would have been
identified and approved in any case).  It appears therefore that the
decision to open these offices has not yet been justified on a cost-benefit
basis. The same internal SOFIDE study recommends the need for more precise
terms of reference and a closer integration of the work of the offices with
that of SOFIDE's operational departments. The creation of the SAC was
intended to help achieve the latter objective. IDA considers that these
offices are important for SOFIDE to attain its developmental objectives but
that their continued existence has to be justified on a cost-benefit
basis. SOFIDE has now drawn up an action plan aimed at increasing the cost
effectiveness of these units. This plan proposes (i) a strengthening of
the offices (funded partly through outside technical assistance, if
possible) to enable them to attain greater operational capability, (ii) the
definition of precise operational targets and budgets and (iii) tighter
administrative costs control. SOFIDE is now moving to implement the plan
and the recommendations of the study.

Operating Policies and Procedures
2.17      Policy Statement:  SOFIDE is managed according to operating and
financial policies set by the Board and documented in a formal policy
statement. This statement was reviewed and approved by IDA in conjunction
with the previous lines of credit and remains a sound basis for operations
under the proposed sixth credit.
2.18      Appraisal:  SOFIDE's appraisal procedures have been quite
adequately systematized and are documented in a project appraisal manual.
An Investment Committee, (the Comité de Direction) comprising all SOFIDE
department directors undertakes a first review of all appraisal reports
before submission to top management and the Board. SOFIDE is now carrying
out an economie evaluation of all projects studied as a matter of course,
(including EROR calculation). Although in general the quality of
appraisals has been good, the previous system of having three separate
departments carry out separate portions of project appraisal often led to
duplication and lack of synthesis. SOFIDE's management anticipates that
the new organization (para. 2.11) will remedy this. SOFIDE's management
has now sought to streamline the appraisal process to coordinate and
supervise better appraisal work, and already there appears to be
improvement in this area. SOFIDE is finding it difficult to recruit high
calibre staff for appraisal work and it has therefore to carry out
significant in house training of new recruits.
2.19      Supervision:  Although on paper SOFIDE's supervision procedures
have been satisfactory, the supervision function over the past two years
was not adequate, mainly because of lack of staff and the overburdening of
the Risk Management Department. The new organization now fully recognizes
the need for supervision and the number of staff responsible solely for
supervision has been increased to 5. SOFIDE management has drawn up an
action plan for the supervision function. This envisages a considerable
increase in the activities of the regional offices in supervising projects
in the interior and an intensified supervision program. A reinforcement of
the loan recovery effort by SOFIDE is also underway. A formal loan
recovery unit was recently instituted for this purpose.
2.20      Project Promotion:  SOFIDE's project promotion efforts have been
extensive and successful. In the recent past, however, it has considerably
scaled down its promotion activities given the severe resource constraint.
2.21      Procurement and Disbursement.  Project sponsors are responsible
for procurement of items financed by SOFIDE. Even though SOFIDE does not
require international competitive bidding, it ensures that such procurement
is made on the basis of competitive quotations from a number of different
suppliers, (including foreign) from amongst whom the promoter, with
SOFIDE's assistance, selects the most advantageous. SOFIDE then disburses
against presentation of invoices or relevant documentation after the
preconditions for disbursement have been met and the sponsors' equity paid
in. Given the situation in Zaire and the relatively modest size of
procurement packages, these procedures are adequate, in both general terms
and for the purposes of the proposed Credit particularly since most
projects will be for rehabilitation; all projects above US$300,000 will be
closely reviewed by IDA.

Accounts and Audit
2.22      The 1978 audit, which appeared to be deficient in the treatment
of foreign exchange losses to be recovered from the Government, showed the
increasing urgency to modernize and update SOFIDE's accounting system to
enable it to cope with the rapidly increasing volume and complexity of
operations. To date this has not yet been carried out. The 1979 audit was
acceptable to IDA but an attempt at mechanizing the accounting system to a
higher level was not successful. The situation worsened in December
1980 following the sudden death of SOFIDE's chief accountant.The 1980
annual accounts were produced two manths late and the auditors qualified
their opinion of these annual accounts because of inaccuracies in SOFIDE's
records of customer accounts and of exchange risks. At IDA's request,
SOFIDE asked the auditors to carry out a special audit to help straighten
out the accounts as of June 30, 1981, and to assist SOFIDE in adopting the
necessary procedures to ensure that accurate and timely accounts can be
drawn up under the existing system. An acceptable audit without
qualifications of the accounts as of June 30, 1981, has now been received.
However, in the notes the auditors highlight a number of urgent isues, such
as the low level of provisions (paras. 2.37) and the need to clarify the
extent of the foreign exchange risk borne by Government on guaranteed
foreign currency loans. SOFIDE management recognize the need to modify the
present system to enable it to meet SOFIDE's requirements until a new and
mechanized system is installed.  Some action in this regard has already
been taken. The reorganization of the Accounting and Risk Management
Department into a single Finance Department (para. 2.11) will avoid the
previous duplication of effort. A local outside accountant has been hired
as an Assistant to the Finance Department Director. SOFIDE also obtained
the services of a foreign expert financed by the Belgian Cooperation to
advance the work, already started by SOFIDE, on the overall conception of
the new system. An Accounting Procedures Manual is also being prepared (to
date none existed). SOFIDE presented at negotiations a detailed plan of
action, acceptable to IDA, with a timetable for the implementation of a new
and mechanised accounting system. SOFIDE has now started implementing this
plan and it expects to have a new system in place by the end of 1982. A
significant portion of the technical assistance component of the proposed
project will provide resources to assist SOFIDE obtain the necessary
expertise and hardware to adopt and implement the new system.
2.23      The Brussels based firm of Berger, Block Kirschen and
Schellekens and Co. has audited SOFIDE's accounts since its inception. The
audits have been generally satisfactory in thoroughness and quality and in
line with IDA's requirements. However, given the present state of SOFIDE's
accounts and its need for outside assistance in this area, SOFIDE
management is considering the possibility of inviting bids for the 1982
audit also from other companies. SOFIDE also intends to widen the scope of
the audit to include an in-depth analysis of specific organisational
issues.
2.24      Under previous Credits SOFIDE agreed to present IDA with its
audited annual report within three months of the end of the fiscal year.
Since SOFIDE's board normally meets in April to approve the Audited annual
accounts, the deadline for submission of Audited accounts by SOFIDE under



- 24 -
the proposed sixth Credit will be extended to six months after the end of
its fiscal year.
Terms and Conditions of Lending
2.25      SOFIDE lends for maturities of between two and ten years.  The
average loan maturity is about 6.5 years. SOFIDE normally seeks to take
adequate security and not to accept subordination to any other lender.
2.26      On foreign currency loans not tied to lines of credit with
specific onlending conditions (Annex 4) SOFIDE was charging until recently
17% p.a. plus a commitment fee of 1% p.a. on the undisbursed committed
amount and an appraisal commission of 2% with the foreign exchange risk
being borne by the client. On similarly untied local currency resources
the rate was 20% p.a. with the same commission structure. In consonance
with SOFIDE's tradition of adjusting interest rates to reflect its
competitive position, need for an adequate spread and the prevalent
inflation rates in Zaire, SOFIDE's board at its December 1981 meeting
decided to increase the interest rates on foreign currency loans to 20%
p.a. (with the foreign exchange risk being passed on to the borrower) and
on local currency resources to 30% p.a.  The commission and fee structure
was retained unchanged. SOFIDE's lending rate of 20% p.a. coupled with the
foreign exchange risk would yield over the life of the subloan positive
real interest rates on subloans denominated in foreign exchange, provided
the Zaire continues to be devalued in line with the differential between
domestic and international inflation rates. For SOFIDE's clients, it also
appears that they can sustain this level of interest rates because (a) the
Zaire is still overvalued; (b) a relatively flexible price regime allows
them to recuperate interest and principal increases arising from
devaluations; (c) most loans are for rehabilitation and are therefore
relatively small compared to the total productive capacity of the
enterprise. For local currency lending, the rate is however negative in
real terms given Zaire's present and forecast level of inflation. The
demand for term lending in local currency is rather limited, however, even
though SOFIDE is the only lending institution providing such resources,
because most investment is to rehabilitate machinery and equipment and
therefore requires foreign currency with very little local currency
content. Moreover lending in local currency is largely for agricultural
and smaller projects in the interior that cannot as readily absorb high
rates of interest (due to the lack of purchasing power, lower price levels
than in the main urban centres, etc.).  The funds under the IDA Credit will
be onlent at a minimum of 20% per annum (plus commitment and appraisal fee)
with the foreign exchange risk being passed on to all subborrowers.
2.27      With IDA's assistance SOFIDE has made a concerted effort to
convince its various creditors to increase the maximum interest rates they
allow SOFIDE to charge on subloans refinanced out of their respective
credit lines (Annex 4). Some now appear to be taking an attitude that is
closer to that of IDA; in the recent loan negotiated with ADB (para. 2.44),
for example, ADB did not stipulate any maximum interest rate and allows
SOFIDE to apply the interest rates decided by its Board.

Coverage of Foreign Exchange Risk
2.28      SOFIDE's 1970 Establishment Convention provided for the
Government to assume the foreign exchange risk resulting from SOFIDE
foreign exchange borrowings up to a ceiling of US$30 million. This did not
cover the IDA Credits and the OPEC Special Fund loan for vhich the
Government had provided separate guarantees for the full portion of the
credits/loan on which the subborrowers did not bear the foreign exchange
risk. In 1979 the Government advised SOFIDE that whereas it vould honour
its engagements under the terms of the Convention on existing borrovings,
it would assume the foreign exchange risk on future borroving8 only in
cases that would be agreed to in advance by Government.  SOFIDE accordingly
changed its policy and required that on all loans not covered by these
provisions, the full foreign exchange risk be passed to the subborrover.
2.29      Following the devaluations of the Zaire in 1978 and 1979, foreign
exchange losses were incurred on foreign borrowing8 (excluding IDA credits)
contracted by SOFIDE and on which the subborrowers did not carry the
foreign exchange risk. These losses were initially covered by SOFIDE out
of its own resources since Government guarantees under the Establishment
Convention were not activated and no mechanism for that purpose existed.
Following discussions with IDA however the Government had by early 1980
repaid all past foreign exchange losses incurred by SOFIDE on its
Government guaranteed direct borrowings. A Protocole d'Accord, between
SOFIDE and OGEDEP was signed in February 1980. This provided for OGEDEP to
make payment as they fall due of the total amounts of repayment8 in foreign
exchange of principal and of interest, and commitment fees to SOFIDE's
foreign creditors on SOFIDE's Government guaranteed foreign borrowings upon
which the subborrowers do not carry the foreign exchange risk. OGEDEP will
then subsequently claim payment from SOFIDE in Zaires on the basis of the
exchange rates prevailing at time of disbursement. The Protocole d'Accord
also provides for OGEDEP covering, on those foreign borrowings under which
the subborrower carries the foreign exchange risk, the residual foreign
exchange risk between the time of loan collection by SOFIDE from the
subborrower and repayment by SOFIDE to the external lender. The Protocole
d'Accord also establishes that, except in the case of specifie categories
of subborowers to be agreed upon with Govèrnment on a case-by-case basis
(in all probability essentially SSE), SOFIDE will seek to paso on to its
subborrowers the foreign exchange risk on all foreign borrovingu to be
contracted in the future.
2.30      The mechanism established under the Protocole d'Accord adequately
protects SOFIDE from bearing the foreign exchange risk on its foreign
borrowings and to date it has worked well.
Operations
2.31      As of June 30, 1981, SOFIDE had approved loans and equity
investments amounting to Z 231 million (Annex 5). SOFIDE's level of loan
approvals averaged about Z 5 million for the first four year8 of
operations. It then increased to Z 9.4 million in 1976, about Z 22 million
in 1977 and in 1978, more than doubled to Z 50.4 million in 1979 and again
increased to Z 65.9 million in 1980. Loan approvals for the first six
months of 1981 amounted to Z 33.1 million. Even after taking into account



- 26 -
the high levels of inflation and the repeated devaluations of the currency,
the real level of loan approvals shows significant increases of 60% in
1976, 100% in 1977, 70% in 1979 and 20% in 1980. The relative decline in
the real level of approvals for the first six months of 1981 was due to the
resource constraints. The rapid increase in SOFIDE's level of approvals in
recent years reflects partly the additional business generated by the
agricultural department which accounted for between 33.5% and 50% of
business from 1977 to 1980. It also reflects the pent up demand for
investment funds for rehabilitation and renewal of equipment following the
retrocession of major industrial companies to their former owners and the
fact that SOFIDE has, by and large, been the only source of term investment
funds in foreign exchange for the past few years.
2.32      The rate of commitments and disbursements has generally kept pace
with the rate of approvals. As of June 30, 1981, 77% ofbloan approvals had
been committed and 61% had been disbursed. Annex 6 shows a breakdown of
SOFIDE's approvals by sector, region, size and type of projects. Given the
deteriorating state of the Zairian economy in recent years, SOFIDE has had
to adapt and reorientate its investment strategy and operations to meet the
most pressing needs of the economy. As a result, agriculture became in
1980 the most important sector accounting for 39% of total approvals. The
manufacturing sector is second with 33%, followed by construction (10%)and
transport (6%). A substantial part of SOFIDE's investments both by number
and value has been for rehabilitation (76% by number and 78% by value over
the period 1970-80). Investment in new projects has generally been limited
to high economic priority sectors. As most of the major industrial firms
are still foreign owned or have foreign majority interests, much of
SOFIDE's financing has inevitably gone to these companies. More recently,
particularly in the agricultural sector, SOFIDE has been financing
Zairian-owned small and medium scale projects. SOFIDE has also
progressively sought regional diversification of its investments. However,
the Kinshasa and Bas Zaire areas still receive about 45% of SOFIDE's
interventions because of the concentration there of most of Zaire's
industrial base. Although in the agricultural sector a high proportion of
the projects are for modernisation and expansion of existing concerns,
since the beginning of 1980 about 30% has been for new creations. These
are essentially small to medium sized Zairian-owned enterprises, generally
with relatively low average project size. The average size of loans for
the agricultural sector is currently about one million Zaires with
significant differences between subsectors: Z2.9 million on average in the
forestry subsector vs ZO.6 million in food crop cultivation.
Portfolio and Provisions
2.33      Loan Portfolio:  As of June 1981, SOFIDE had Z 132.6 million
outstanding in 191 projects of which 32, representing 40% amount of the
total outstanding loan portfolio, were still under implementation. Total
arrears of more than three months at end June 1981 (Annex 27) amounted to
Z 6.49 million, i.e. 5% of the total loan portfolio outstanding and
affected 76 projects representing 26% of the value of the portfolio. The
level of arrears relative to total portfolio, and percentage of portfolio
affected by arrears have remained at about the same level for the past
three years with the relative proportion of agricultural small scale



- 27 -
projects however recently becoming more important.  Five projects account
for Z2.53'million, or 39 percent of the arrears: (a) a saw mill/ship
construction company with severe liquidity problems; (b) a tin mining
project which ran into substantial difficulties; (c) a cement factory which
ran into severe implementation delays (d) a poultry farm which was set up
with inadequate management and has to be restructured; and (e) a printing
press with severe liquidity problems. SOFIDE expects to recover its
outstandings on the first three projects, although some rescheduling will
be required to bring the maturity schedule in line with anticipated cash
flow from operations.  SOFIDE has set aside specific bad debt provisions of
up to 50 percent of the fourth project and is seeking to recover its loan
outstanding through the courts. The same holds for the fifth project. The
reasons for arrears on the other projects are mixed, but arise largely
either out of technical difficulties, or, in the case of small projects out
of poor management. Rescheduling of loans to facilitate repayment by
clients in difficulties has only taken place when justified and SOFIDE has
not sought to disguise serious arrears in its portfolio through systematic
rescheduling.
2.34      In view of the difficult economic environment in which SOFIDE and
its clients operate, the level of arrears, although relatively high is
acceptable and in general SOFIDE's portfolio can be considered sound. A
worrisome development however is the increase in the number of projects
affected by arrears, particularly projects still under implementation.
This reflects SOFIDE's increased lending to small scale projects and to
more risky sectors such as agriculture and projects in the interior.
SOFIDE has moved reluctantly into these areas, often under pressure from
Government and outside lenders, who have not in general provided SOFIDE
with the necessary technical assistance and financial support to offset the
increased risk and sharply higher costs inherent in lending to these
sectors and which have seriously impaired SOFIDE's profitability (paras.
2.38-2.39).  SOFIDE's management is aware of the increased risk profile of
the portfolio and has moved to strengthen its supervision effort (para.
2.19). It is adopting an operational strategy aimed at reducing arrears
through more systematic supervision, by better use of its regional
offices.  It also plans to limit its involvement in high risk sectors.
This strategy was reviewed by IDA and considered satisfactory.
2.35       SOFIDE has recently formally established a Loan Recovery Unit
charged with following up arrears with greater vigor and on a more
systematic manner than previously (para. 2.19). In order to better monitor
its arrears position SOFIDE intends, as part of updating its management
information system, to classify separately industrial and agricultural
loans in its reports.
2.36      Equity Portfolio:  As of June 1981 SOFIDE had a small equity
portfolio totalling Z 1.97 million consisting of equity investments in
eight companies. Zairian companies are essentially seeking term foreign
exchange resources from SOFIDE and hence the scope for equity investments
in local currency has been limited.  SOFIDE's participation in these
companies ranges from 5.5% to a maximum of 26.6%. Three of the older
projects have paid dividends in the past. These dividends have fallen off
in recent years as companies have been hit by the worsened economic
conditions and have sought to retain earnings to consolidate their
financial position in a very difficult environment.



- 28 -
2.37       Provisions:  SOFIDE's overall general risk and specific risk
provisions as of June 30th 1981 had fallen to 2.1% of outstanding
portfolio, a level significantly below what SOFIDE has traditionally
carried (about 3 to 4%). This is due partly to the sudden increase in the
size of the portfolio following the June 1981 devaluation of the Zaire.
However, it also reflects the fact that SOFIDE has not adopted a systematie
policy for deciding provision levels.  Although SOFIDE's investments are
generally well secured, the present level of provisions is relatively low
given the risks inherent in the Zairian economy and the increased risk
profile of SOFIDE's portfolio. SOFIDE's auditors strongly recommended that
SOFIDE adopt a more systematie provisions policy and that it should seek to
build up its overall provisions for risk on the loan portfolio and provide
also for a portion of the non-performing equity portfolio. SOFIDE must
therefore urgently seek to reconstitute its provisions to a level that
better reflects the risks inherent in its portfolio. SOFIDE agreed at the
negotiations to a covenant in the Project Agreement binding it not to
distribute any dividends until the amount of general and specific
provisions for risk constitutes at least 4% of the total outstanding loan
and equity portfolio.  (SOFIDE has already sought to reconstitute this
level of provisions in the distribution of its 1981 net income).
Financial Results and Condition
2.38       SOFIDE's summarised income statements and balance sheets for 1976
through June 1981 and the relevant financial ratios are shown in Annexes 8,
9 and 10. The rapid increase in inflation from 1977 through 1981 and
repeated devaluations of the Zaire have seriously impaired SOFIDE's
profitability. Despite the 400 percent increase in average total assets
for the period, SOFIDE's profits, after constituting relatively small
provisions for risk, did not show significant increases in absolute terms,
passing from Z 0.46 million in 1977 to Z 0.4 million in 1978, Z 0.43
million in 1979 and Z 0.631 million in 1980: had SOFIDE reconstituted its
provision for risk in 1980 to its traditional level of 3 to 4% of its
portfolio it would have had to declare an operating loss. Profitability
relative to average total assets declined sharply and the interest coverage
ratio has fallen from 1.8 in 1978 to 1.51 in 1979 to 1.31 in 1980. This
low level of profitability, in spite of SOFIDE's overall efficiency and
competence, is due to several factors:
(a)  the rapid rise in administrative costs which doubled in
absolute terms in every year of operation since 1979 and
which in relative terms moved from 4.1% of average total
assets in 1977 to 7% in 1980 and are estimated to reach 8%
by end FY81. The rise in these costs is mainly due to
local inflation, which was almost 60% in 1978, 100%
in 1979, and more than 40% in 1980. Using the official
SDR-Zaire historical parity, which still over values the
Zaire, the increase in SDR terms would, however, be
significantly less: about 25% per annum between 1977 and
1980 (table 1 below). This still relatively high increase
is mainly accounted for by international inflation, the
additional costs generated by the development of
agricultural operations mainly in the interior, and lately



- 29 -
by the opening of agencies. This increase (in SDR terms)
in administrative costs could not be offset by a
comparable progression of earnings from portfolio, as the
portfolio (expressed in SDR equivalent) did not increase
much due to resources constraints and foeus on industry
rehabilitation type of projects while the impact of
interest rates increases is felt progressively only. In
addition, a fifth of SOFIDE's portfolio is denominated in
Zaire currency and thus neither that part of the portfolio
nor the interest earnings on it increase as a result of
devaluation. The zaire equivalent of the portfolio on
which the foreign exchange risk is passed to subborrowers
has been adjusted four times following the successive
devaluations, which resulted in higher earnings (in zaire
currency) since the interest was applied to higher
portfolio values. However,administrative costs have
continued to rise due to local inflation between those
devaluations. On the whole, because of the above, and
mainly because of the high inflation during the past year,
increases on interest earned on portfolio could not offset
fully nor regularly the increases in administrative costs,
and thus profitability declined.

(b)  The bulk of SOFIDE's portfolio is lent at fixed rates:
SOFIDE could not therefore adjust its lending rates on the
portion of the existing portfolio comprising loans made at
a time when the general level of interest rates and
administrative costs was low. SOFIDE has regularly
increased its lending rates and spreads but these
increases could not compensate for the high costs or even
losses incurred on loans made previously on much smaller
spreads.
(c) Not all of SOFIDE's portfolio is indexed: This can be
seen from the above table - since 1977 the portfolio in



- 30 -
SDR equivalent has not increased. Therefore since
SOFIDE's interest rates are fixed, the ratio of
administrative expenses in relation to interests
deteriorates rapidly for all the non-indexed part of the
portfolio.
(d)  Some foreign lenders e.g. the CCCE, OPEC Fund etc.
constrained SOFIDE's spread to a level that did not
reflect the high cost of term lending in Zaire, and SOFIDE
only accepted these loans to fulfill its national
developmental objectives. Annex 4 which gives details of
the lines of credits available to SOFIDE shows that except
for IDA V the spread allowed to SOFIDE was usually below 5
percent, and thus did not, for the past three years at
least, reflect SOFIDE's increased administrative costs and
the need to constitute adequate provisions. The effect on
SOFIDE's profitability was also compounded by the
conditions often attached to the resources e.g. lending to
high cost sectors such as SSE or small agricultural
projects in the interior.
2.39       Profit as a percentage of average equity declined from 20.6% in
1978 to 10% in 1979, and to 7% in 1980.  SOFIDE's management is seeking to
restore the profitability levels of the institution. Following the
recommendations of IDA supervision missions, it is now restructuring the
organization to better utilize existing resources and to hold down cost
increases, it is cutting down significantly its project preparation/
appraisal efforts to bring them into line with available resources and is
seeking to negotiate with some of its lenders an increase of the spread on
their lines of Credit. Some have already indicated a positive disposition
in this regard. It has also moved to raise interest rates and has reached
agreements with some of the commercial banks to share in the commissions
arising out of the documentary credit business related to SOFIDE financed
foreign exchange loans. The newly set up Administrative Department has
also set about seeking cost economies in a systematic and convincing
manner. These efforts should bear results in the near future.
2.40       Capital:  In December 1980 SOFIDE's authorized share capital was
raised from Z 4.0 million to Z 12.0 million. As of June 1981 Z 10.10
million was paid in and the balance is expected to be paid in shortly
(para. 2.05). As of that date also total equity and quasi-equity including
rolled over IDA funds, amounted to Z 36.7 million. Its long term debt to
equity and quasi-equity ratio was 2.7:1, well within the maximum 5:1 agreed
to with IDA. The equity to debt ratio was higher, at 7.0:1.
2.41       Liquidity:  SOFIDE's liquidity declined sharply in the first six
months of FY81 and SOFIDE in fact had a net negative Zaire resource
position. SOFIDE management expect that this will be remedied through (i)
recourse to the rediscounting facilities of the BDZ and (ii) anticipated
loan repayments. This lack of liquidity appears temporary and SOFIDE
management are now establishing adequate systems to ensure future
commitments will be made in the light of projected Zaire resouIce inflow.



- 31 -
2.42      Despite the above reservations regarding the portfolio and
profitability position, SOFIDE's overall financial situation is still
sound and creditworthy especially in view of measures being taken to
improve the situation, and justifies IDA's continued assistance. SOFIDE
management has over the past year moved with speed and imagination to adopt
policies and organizational changes recommended by IDA and other outside
lenders and elaborated on by SOFIDE to ensure that SOFIDE remains
creditworthy. Given the extremely difficult environment and problems
SOFIDE faces, it will however be necessary for SOFIDE's foreign partners to
continue supporting the institution to enable it to continue operating
efficiently.
Resources
2.43      SOFIDE's resource position as of June 1981 is included in the
basic data. At that date there was a resource deficit at the approval
level of Z 26.3 million, of which Z 14.6 million was in foreign exchange
and Z 11.7 million in local currency. SOFIDE also had a resource deficit
at the commitment level of Z 7.2 million in local currency. It is seeking
to cover this by (i) freezing loan commitments in local currency; (ii)
obtaining from OGEDEP a delay in scheduled repayments; and (iii) having
recourse to the rediscount facilities of the BDZ. At negotiations SOFIDE
informed IDA that it had reached agreement with Government to retain on a
long term basis repayments on non-IDA resources. This should resolve the
local currency shortage in the very near future. In addition to the
resources identified in the Resources Statement, a special Fund of Z 13
million has been provided by Government, out of USAID counterpart funds to
finance agricultural investments. SOFIDE receives a 4 percent spread as
management fee on the loans financed out of these funds.
2.44      SOFIDE has proven remarkably successful in diversifying its
sources of foreign exchange funds for investment purposes. In this it was,
and remains, considerably aided by the close and constant support of IDA
which had a significant catalytic effect in enabling SOFIDE to attract and
maintain the confidence of these outside lenders. SOFIDE has recently
obtained a loan from the European Investment Bank for an amount equivalent
to about US$7.12 million and a Credit from the African Development Bank
equivalent to US$11.5 million. SOFIDE now has lines of Credit from seven
different foreign sources. Annex 4 shows the conditions attached to these
lines of Credit. However, apart from IDA and on its latest Credit, the
ADB, most of the other lenders attach numerous conditions which
considerably restrict SOFIDE's flexibility of operation. The SBI and CCCE
lines are tied to Belgian and French procurement respectively. EIB funds
are channelled to specific subprojects and the KfW and OPEC funds have a
number of conditions relating to size, region and type of project or
procurement. The foreign exchange risk is now generally being passed on to
all medium and large scale borrowers under all the credits negotiated since
the signature of the Protocole d'Accord between SOFIDE and OGEDEP.
Prospects
SOFIDE's Strategy
2.45      The immediate and medium term prospects for the Zairian economy
continue to be limited, and the considerable efforts of the Government over



- 32 -
the past two years to stabilize the economy and move it once more into a
growth pattern will have to be sustained and supported for some time to
come. In this context SOFIDE's role will therefore continue to centre on
its position as the sole foreign exchange resources lender for the directly
productive private sector. Its Investment Strategy, adopted in 1978 (Annex
2) continues to be pertinent and will continue to be applied by SOFIDE.
SOFIDE's efforts will hence remain directed towards stimulating productive
activity in the commercial agricultural, agroindustrial and industrial
sectors and to providing the assistance necessary to maintain intact the
existing stock of industrial plant and equipment in Zaire. It is expected
therefore, that most investment projects will be mainly for renewal,
balancing and rehabilitation of existing equipment, and to improve the use
of local raw materials.
Project Pipeline
2.46      The demand for foreign exchange funds for term investment
purposes in Zaire continues to far exceed the availability and SOFIDE has
therefore had to be very selective in the choice of investment projects it
appraises. Because of this situation and in order to keep down
administrative costs it has recently tightened its project screening
procedure and is appraising fully only those priority projects for which it
can identify, with a high degree of probability, a ready source of external
financing. In view of the resource constraint, therefore, SOFIDE has
sought to identify from its very large pipeline (well over two hundred
projects involving over US$80 million for the likely commitment period of
the proposed credit) a relatively limited number of projects which it
anticipates, with a reasonable degree of certainty, to be able to present
to IDA for refinancing. This list consists of twenty three industrial
projects with an estimated SOFIDE foreign currency financing amounting to
about US$16.0 million equivalent and of twenty elght projects in the
agricultural sector with an estimated SOFIDE foreign exchange financing
requirement amounting to about US$7.5 million. There will also be a
sizeable related demand for local currency loans for these projects,
especially those in the agricultural sector. The promoters of the projects
are for the most part Zairian and locally based private firms, with some
projects being joint ventures between Zairian and foreign interests and
Government and private groups. The majority of the projects in the
industrial sector are for modernization and/or expansion of existing
concerns in a number of sectors including transport, textiles, power,
manufacturing and others. The agricultural pipeline, shows a broad
sub-sectoral mix and a wider geographical spread, and is skewed towards
modernization but contains a number of new projects. Most of the projects
would be for export of industrial crops (coffee, rubber); the purchase of
transport equipment to collect rice or palm oil and other produce; cattle
projects, oil and oil and tea mills.
Financial Forecasts
2.47      The forecasts of SOFIDE's operations and financial results for
the period 1981-1985 are shown in Annexes 11 through 15. The financial
projections assume that (i) the current stabilization program will be
successful in bringing down inflation to the levels envisaged in current
Bank projections (para. 1.42) and (ii) SOFIDE's cost controls and efforts



- 33 -
to utilize more efficiently its existing resources will reduce the increase
in administrative costs to slightly below general inflation. Although
further adjustments of the Zaire currency are likely, these projections
have been made on the assumption that no devaluation would occur, because
forecasting the timing and magnitude of devaluations is not possible. As
Zaire has not followed a policy of smooth gradual adjustment of its
currency, an indexation of the projections would not be realistic.
However, sensitivity tests to further devaluations were made and they show
that the conclusions of the projections and the issues raised below remain
valid, except that SOFIDE's financial structure as expressed by its debt to
equity ratio is highly sensitive to the magnitude of devaluation. A
general conclusion of these tests is that SOFIDE will have to exercise
extreme financial care and prudence in its future operations and should
continue to adjust its lending rates and spreads in such a way that it can
generate enough earnings to cover its administrative costs and risks, and
strengthen its equity base. Approvals for 1981 will be significantly
higher than the 1980 level both because the Zaire equivalent is inflated by
the recent devaluation of the Zaire, and because of abnormally high levels
of approvals in July 1981. This high level of activity, which was not
matched by sufficient resource availability, characterises the whole
operations forecast, significantly inflating commitments and disbursements
in 1982 and 1983. Approvals in 1982 and subsequent years will then
represent a 5% increase in real terms for foreign currency loans, over the
1980 base figure, with 75% going to industry and transport and 25% for
agricultural loans. Approvals in local currency will be held at the
projected local currency availability. Commitments and disbursements
follow the approvals pattern with a delay, except that disbursements which
in 1981 will be low owing to a resource constraint (the IDA V credit became
effective only in early 1981) will rise rapidly in 1982 and 1983 following
the level of approvals in 1981. Disbursements would then fall off
slightly in 1984 and will start to rise regularly thereafter.
2.48      Despite the rapid rate of growth in the portfolio, the high level
of assumed interest rates and forecast increase in revenues, SOFIDE's
profitability remains at best marginal when account is taken of the need to
provide for a sufficient level of provisions.  This is because of the rapid
rise in administrative costs.   The objective of progressively
reconstituting SOFIDE's provisions level to 4% of total equity and medium
and long term portfolio will be achieved in 1982, according to these
projections. Sensitivity tests show how precarious SOFIDE's profitability
situation is likely to be. A rise in the administrative costs by 5% over
the forecast would lead to significant losses, unless offset by increased
revenues (arising out of either higher interest rates or of higher revenue
earnings assets base, generated either by a higher level of operations or
the increase in the Zaire equivalent of the indexed portion of the
portfolio in the case of a further devaluation of the Zaire).   Since the
recent rise in interest rates will take two to three years before it starts
having an impact on SOFIDE's revenues, the main issue SOFIDE's management
will face in the near future is that of maintaining profitability, a sound
portfolio and an adequate level of provisions. Achievement of these
objectives will depend on reducing and limiting the arrears on its
portfolio, slowing the rise in administrative costs through better resource
use, drastically limiting the extent of non-remunerative operations and
requiring an adequate spread on all resources SOFIDE manages. This is why



- 34 -
it is recommended that funds from the proposed IDA credit would be passed
on to SOFIDE at 8%. The spread on this Credit would have a significant
impact on profitability as of 1984 and enable SOFIDE to retain a level of
earnings and provisions to enable it to build up its real capital base and
provisions.
2.49      While the resulting spread of 12% seems inordinately high, it is
justified for the following reasons. Firstly, as mentioned earlier (para.
2.38) high spreads are necessary to compensate for the low returns or even
losses incurred on loans made previously with small spreads at a time
interest rates were low. This is true not only for the portfolio in local
currency, but also valid for loans with foreign exchange risk passed to
subborrowers. Secondly, SOFIDE needs to increase and maintain its
provisions - which are not automatically adjusted with inflation or
devaluation - to about 4% of its portfolio. Thirdly, it needs to
strengthen its equity base through retained earnings, at least to keep it
constant in real terms. Fourthly, SOFIDE needs to make adequate profits to
enable some distribution of dividends in order to provide an incentive for
shareholders to put up the required additional capital, particularly in
case of devaluation. Assuming that out of a 12% spread on the IDA credit,
1.0% needs to be allocated to provisions, 11% remain to cover
administrative costs and build up the equity base. Even if administrative
costs were about 3%, a most unlikely figure despite the efforts of SOFIDE
to reduce costs, the 8% left would only represent a maximum nominal return
on equity of 40% - assuming a maximum debt equity ratio of 5 to 1, or 24%
with the existing ratio of about 3 to 1.  These are low figures as compared
to current and forecast inflation. Finally, while other lenders have in
the past granted too small spreads to SOFIDE, the situation is changing as
a result of SOFIDE's efforts and support from IDA. For example, in the
loan granted recently by ADB, funds are passed on to SOFIDE at 8% and ADB
has accepted that SOFIDE charge its current rates to its subborrowers,
resulting in a spread of 12%. SOFIDE is also negotiating a similar
treatment with the EIB. Accordingly, while in the past IDA may have both
taken the lead in granting high spreads and somewhat subsidized activities
supported by other lenders, the situation has notably improved and other
lenders are now following policies similar to those supported by IDA.
2.50      When the IDA V line of credit was appraised the debt to equity
limit of SOFIDE was raised to 5:1 and it was agreed, at negotiations for
that credit, that qualifying rolled over IDA funds could be considered as
quasi-equity and be included in the equity for the purpose of the
debt/equity ratio calculation.  Since that time SOFIDE has raised its share
capital to Z 12 million. Given SOFIDE's poor profitability prospects it is
unlikely that SOFIDE's shareholders will agree to a further share capital
increase in the near future. The projections show that SOFIDE's debt to
equity (including quasi-equity) ratio will not breach this 5:1 limit over
the next two to three years. If there should be a significant further
devaluation of the Zaire over the next few years, however, then SOFIDE's
debt to equity ratio would exceed the set limit by 1984/85.  Given the.
uncertain investment climate in Zaire and the difficulties SOFIDE faces, it
would not be pertinent at present to relax the debt to equity ratio.



- 35 -
2.51      The projections indicate clearly the number of problems SOFIDE
will face and the overall fragility of its financial situation. For these
reasons the following measures were agreed to at the negotiations by SOFIDE
and the Zaire Government as conditions of the proposed credit: (a) the
investment component of the proceeds from the proposed credit would be
onlent to SOFIDE at a minimum rate of 8 percent (para. 2.48); (b) that
SOFIDE should not declare any dividends until its provisions for risk
attain 4 percent of its equity and medium and long term loan portfolio
(para. 2.47); (c) the Government should retrocede the proceeds of the IDA
V credit to SOFIDE on a quasi equity basis (para. 2.50) and (d) the debt to
equity ratio limit as defined under the previous Credit should be kept at
5:1.
Resource Requirements
2.52      SOFIDE's forecast total foreign exchange resource requirements,
drawn up on a very conservative basis, show that SOFIDE, which had
uncommitted resources of about US$24.0 million as of June 1981, would need
an additional amount of about US$56 million for new commitments through end
1984 of which US$25.0 million for agriculture. SOFIDE has since negotiated
a line of credit from the EIB for an amount equivalent to US$7.12 million
and a credit from the African Development Bank equivalent to US$11.46
million. The Investment component of the proposed credit (US$19.5 million)
would thus meet about 35% of SOFIDE's needs. SOFIDE is aggressively
pursuing other sources of funds such as CIDA (up to an amount of Can. $5.0
million), ADF (up to US$7.2 million equivalent), SBI and the CCCE, to
enable it to reach and possibly exceed its operations forecast and respond
to the large and unsatisfied demand for term investment funds by the
directly productive sectors in Zaire.
2.53      As mentioned earlier, local currency resource requirements at the
commitment level would be met out of the increase in "rolled over" IDA
funds, the Special Fund for Agriculture and net operational cash flow and
if necessary by recourse to BDZ discount facilities.   In total they would
amount to about Z 44 million through FY84.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The proposed Credit would represent IDA's continued support of an
effective financial intermediary since its inception, to enable it to
continue to develop its institutional capabilities and resilience, to
assist selectively the directly productive sectors in Zaire, and to provide
the impetus necessary to further its impact on the formulation of sector
policies and project selection at the national level. As such, the
specific objectives of the proposed credit are:
(a)  to provide fast disbursing foreign exchange resources for
high economic priority capital investments in: (i) the
industrial, transport, tourism and agroindustrial sectors
in Zaire, to assist maintain and modernize where necessary
existing productive capacity; and (ii) the agriculture
sector to promote production to meet basic food needs, the
raw materials requirements of the agroindustrial sector,
and to increase agricultural exports.
(b)  to maintain SOFIDE as an effective intermediary by
providing it with loanable funds that would enable it to
attain its forecast level of operations and retain
profitability and autonomy, and by providing funds for
technical assistance, enable it to upgrade its management
and control systems and staff capabilities. This would
also enable IDA to continue its institutional building
efforts with SOFIDE.
(c)  by providing foreign exchange resources, to be managed by
SOFIDE, to finance the foreign exchange component of
feasibility and pre-investment and policy related studies,
for the Government, parastatal bodies, SOFIDE and the
private sector, to foster a greater interaction between
SOFIDE and the Government in sector policy formulation and
project selection.
B. Description of the Project
3.02      The Proposed Project will include three components:
(a)   US$19.5 million of the line of credit to finance SOFIDE's
subloans for subproject capital investments. At least
US$7.5 million of this would be for subprojects in the
agro-industrial and agricultural sectors. This amount
will cover almost 35 percent of the total of SOFIDE's
projected foreign currency requirements at the commitment
level through end 1984 (para. 2.52).
(b)  Approximately US$0.9 million to finance the technical
assistance needs of SOFIDE to enable it to upgrade its
accountancy and management information systems; training



- 37 -
of SOFIDE staff in project evaluation and management,
accountancy and financial management; recruit high calibre
foreign experts to run specialised management and finance
courses at the newly created training centre (para. 2.10);
purchase the necessary hardware, such as for example
vehicles, to continue its operations.
(c) Approximately US$1.1 million to provide a fund of foreign
exchange resources to be managed by SOFIDE, for financing
the foreign exchange component of high priority,
feasibility and policy studies related to the industrial
and agroindustrial sector.
The Proposed Line of Credit for Investments
3.03      This component will finance the foreign exchange costs of capital
investments, including initial working capital, in subprojects approved by
SOFIDE. It will carry the following terms and conditions:
(a)   Eligibility:  The funds will be available to finance
subloans in the industrial, transport, tourism,
agroindustrial and agricultural sectors; the projects
eligible will have to be of high economie priority, be
selected by SOFIDE in accordance with its investment
strategy, and be justified on the basis of a full economic
analysis, including calculation of the economic rate of
return on all non-service sector projects. This component
will therefore be restricted to financing projects which
are aimed at maintaining production capacity,
rehabilitating existing enterprises, transport projects,
projects aimed at increasing production of agricultural
goods and projects which have a significant foreign
exchange saving or earning impact. Priority will be given
to projects for the rehabilitation of existing industrial
and agricultural capacity. At least US$7.5 million has to
be used to finance eligible projects in agriculture and
agroindustrial sectors.
(b) Relending Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk: SOFIDE will
onlend at a minimum of 20 percent per annum and pass on
the foreign exchange risk to subborrowers. Government
will onlend the proceeds of the investment portion of the
credit at a minimum of 8 percent per annum and a commitment
fee of 0.75 percent.  SOFIDE will thus derive a spread of
12 percent which is required to keep its overall average
cost of borrowed funds at a level that would allow SOFIDE
to continue to operate profitably, reconstitute its
provisions for general risk to an adequate level, allow a
modest strengthening of its capital base and continued
distribution of dividends which would provide an
incentive for SOFIDE's shareholders to eventually
participate in future share capital increases.



- 38 -
3.04      Free Limit:  The individual subproject free limit will be raised
from US$250,000, applied under the fifth IDA Credit to US$300,000 in
recognition of price changes and the improving quality of SOFIDE's
appraisals. The aggregate free limit should be US$7.0 million, permitting
the institution to review about 60 percent of the amount of the line of
Credit.
3.05      Amortization Schedules:  The subsidiary credit agreement
(Government to SOFIDE) would have a flexible amortization schedule that
would substantially conform with the aggregate of the amortization
schedules of the subloans made by SOFIDE and financed under the proposed
IDA Credit, subject to a maximum of 15 years including a grace period not
to exceed three years. In order to inhibit prepayment, SOFIDE shall impose
its normal prepayment commission on all subloans financed out of this
investment component that are repaid earlier than the initial amortization
schedule agreed upon between SOFIDE and the sub-borrower.
3.06      Commitment Period and Changes:  The funds will be available for
commitment by SOFIDE until December 31, 1984. A commitment charge of 3/4
of 1 percent per annum will be charged by Government.
The Proposed Technical Assistance Component
3.07      An amount of US$0.9 million is recommended for this component
which will assist SOFIDE to:
(a)   upgrade its accountancy and management information
system, (including mechanization) to enable it to
introduce and operate systems that are more adapted
to the volume and complexity of operations, and
that would provide SOFIDE's management with a
better data base for control and planning purposes
(estimated cost US$300,000);
(b)   finance selective training of its professional
staff in the areas of project appraisal and
preparation and in particular financial management,
an area in which SOFIDE staff have not so far had
the formal overseas training and experience
necessary. (estimated cost US$100,000);
(c)   recruit foreign experts to run short term, high
level, practical oriented courses for SOFIDE, at
the Training Centre, (CEPETEDE) recently set up in
Kinshasa by SOFIDE with assistance from the Caisse
Centrale de Coopération Economique, (the amount
proposed, US$150,000, would cover an estimated 18
man months of such assistance);



- 39 -
(d) purchase hardware, such as vehicles
and radios, for which SOFIDE cannot
obtain foreign exchange from other
sources. (approximately US$100,000);
and
(e) an unallocated amount of US$220,000 to
cover other needs e.g. expert foreign
advice, speciàl audit costs etc.
This component is needed to ensure that SOFIDE continues to develop its
in-house capabilities to enable it to cope with the difficult problems it
will face in the future.
3.08      The funds allocated for this component will be passed on as a
grant from Government to SOFIDE and will be available for commitment until
December 31, 1984. The Association will approve all requests for financing
under this component. Any balance of funds for this component not used for
the above stated purposes could be transferred at the request of SOFIDE and
with IDA's consent to the line of credit component under the terms and
conditions applicable to that component.
The Proposed Component for Feasibility and Sector Policy Studies
3.09      An amount of US$1.1 million is recommended for this component, to
be managed by SOFIDE, which will finance the foreign exchange cost of
feasibility and industrial sector related policy studies. It will carry
the following terms and conditions:
(a)  Eligibility:  The funds will be available to finance the
foreign exchange costs of feasibility and industrial
policy related studies for Government, parastatal bodies,
SOFIDE and the private sector. It is expected that a
number of these studies will address specific policy
related issues aimed at improving the performance of the
sector. SOFIDE has been consulting with Government to
prepare an indicative list of such studies. A tentative
list based on projects at present under study at the
Investment Commission was presented to IDA at
negotiations. SOFIDE and Government however will need
more time to prepare more long term policy oriented
studies. At negotiations SOFIDE agreed to adopt a list of
criteria to enable it to screen study proposals (Annex
17). SOFIDE anticipates that studies to be presented to
IDA for financing which would qualify under these criteria
could include: (i) studies to improve the design and
preparation of projects; (ii) a review of the investment
code with a view to suggesting revisions aimed at
improving the framework for industrial investment; (iii)
assistance to improve and develop an adequate data base
for the industrial sector; (iv) a review of tariff
protection and incentives for industrial development; and
(v) a study of SSE promotion focussing on aspects such as
access to credit and legislation changes



- 40 -
to favor SSE development.  SOFIDE will analyse each of
the demands for financing under this component. It
would liaise with the Ministry of Planning and ANEZA
in determining the priority of the various demands.
For this purpose it has already established a
committee with Government (Ministry of Planning):
it also proposes to invite ANEZA to join the
Committee. SOFIDE will be advising IDA as to the
status and procedures of the Committee prior to the
signing of the Credit.
(b) Approval Process: SOFIDE would submit each demand for
financing under this component to the Committee for
approval prior to submitting the financing request to
IDA. Each request will be accompanied by (i) SOFIDE's
analysis and justification including any comments by
the Ministry of Planning on the study; (ii) a short
list of consultants, an analysis of the bid documents
(where applicable) and SOFIDE's recommendations on the
selection of a consultant to carry out the study; (iii)
detailed draft terms of reference for the proposed
study as agreed to between SOFIDE and the project
sponsor identifying the source of the Zaire component
of the study; and (iv) detailed cost estimates of the
study. IDA would review all the above documents and
would formally approve each demand for financing as
well as the final choice of consultants. A copy of
each study will be sent to IDA.
(c) Charge for Administrative Expenses: SOFIDE will charge
a one time fee of 2% of the approved amount of each
study accepted for financing to cover the expenses it
incurs in administering this facility.
(d) Cost Recovery for Studies by Non-Governmental Bodies:
For studies presented by non-Governmental SOFIDE would
extend a loan for the amount of the same terms and
conditions as for the Investment Component of the line
of Credit except that the terms of the loan should not
exceed four years. It would then aggregate repayments
arising out of this with the next maturing portion of
its loan of the Investment Component for transfer to
Government.
(e) Maximum Amount for Each Study: In view of the limited
amount and the pilot nature of this component, no more
than US$200,000 would be allocated to a single study.
(f) Commitment: The funds under this component will be
available for commitment until December 31, 1984.
Procurement for the Proposed Technical Assistance and Studies Components
3.10       (a)  Goods:  SOFIDE will, as under the previous IDA Credits, use
local competitive bidding for the procurement of goods
(vehicles, computer, etc.). These procedures were found at
appraisal to be satisfactory to IDA.



- 41 -
(b) Studies: SOFIDE will liaise with IDA in the manner
specified in para. 3.09 and use the methods therein
described for obtaining the services for the studies
component.
(c) Short term experts/consultants and training. SOFIDE's
request for commitment should be accompanied by a
justification of the proposed assistance or training, a
detailed costing and terms of reference, and, if
applicable, a short list of experts/consultants.
Project Cost Estimates
3.11      The nature of the project components precludes the statement of
costs in terms of total investment costs, and financing in terms of a firm
plan for funding these costs. The size of the proposed investment
component is based on SOFIDE's projected commitments, assuming there are no
resource constraints, through the end of FY1984. The component will
finance a proportion, ranging up to 80% of the investment cost of
beneficiary subprojects. SOFIDE's contribution, on a commitment basis, to
projects it is forecast to finance from June 30, 1981 to December 31, 1984,
together with SOFIDE technical assistance and equipment requirements for
that period, amount to US 88.6 million, of which the foreign exchange
component is US$80.0 million.

Since SOFIDETs asistance will be provided mainly for rehabilitation of
existing projects, it is difficult to estimate the total investment cost of
projects which it would help finance. However, past experience shows that
on average SOFIDE finance about 40% of investment costs, and thus the US$80
million forecast commitments would result in about US$200 million of
investments. Projects financed in the past have shown high economic and
financial rates of return; in the case of most projects assisted by IDA,
these rates largely exceeded 20%. Under the proposed line of credit,
returns are expected to be equally high. As most projects will be for
rehabilitation/modernization of existing industrial plants, no substantial
additional employment is expected to be created.

Thus, IDA funds cover only about 35 percent of SOFIDE's total foreign
exchange requirements as projected at end June 1981. SOFIDE's plans for
raising the balance of its needs, which are estimated on a conservative
basis, are well formulated and realistic.



- 43 -
Project Implementation
3.13      Reporting Requirements:  SOFIDE would be required to submit
quarterly reports as it has done under previous credits, which would
include financial statements, resource position, statement of arrears and
notes on subprojects encountering serious operational difficulties. SOFIDE
would also be required to continue to submit audited annual accounts
prepared by qualified accountants along with the SOFIDE annual report (see
para. 2.22).
3.14      Disbursement:  The proceeds of the proposed Sixth Credit would be
disbursed as follows:
(a)  On the studies and Technical Assistance components:
(i) 100% of the foreign exchange costs of feasibility
and policy studies related to the industrial and
agroindustrial sectors, up to the equivalent of
US$1.1 million; and
(ii) 100% of the equivalent of the foreign exchange
costs of staff training, technical assistance,
vehicles amd supplies required by SOFIDE's
operations, up to an aggregate amount equivalent
to US$0.9 million.
(b) On SOFIDE subloans:
(i)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported goods or
services for eligible subprojects;
(ii) up to 85% of the cost of previously imported
equipment which is purchased locally for the
subprojects;
(iii) up to 70% of the cost of equipment produced in
Zaire substantially from previously imported
components or raw materials; and
(iv) up to 55% of the cost in Zaires of construction
works included in subprojects and carried out by
Zairian contractors.
Since the project is expected to finance mainly the purchase of machinery
and equipment for rehabilitation of existing projects and since SOFIDE
already have identified a number of fairly firm projects for financing, it
is anticipated that the project will disburse at a faster pace than the
aggregate disbursement profile of the first four SOFIDE credits, and will
follow recent SOFIDE experience of relatively quick disbursement. Thus,
the projected disbursement schedule (Annex 16) projects cumulative
disbursements by end of year 2 to amount to 44% of the credit and full
disbursements by the end of the fourth year (as compared to 30% and 80%
respectively for the aggregate profile of the first four credits).



- 44 -
Benefits and Risks
3.15      The proposed credit will provide resources to the directly
productive, mainly private sectors in Zaire to enable them to maintain
intact and rehabilitate existing industrial and transport plant and
equipment and to revive agricultural production. It would thus contribute
towards increasing the production of basic goods to meet basic needs,
reduce import requirements, promote exports, and save jobs and assist in
the creation of new employment opportunities. This project would therefore
contribute towards the long and difficult process of effecting the recovery
of the Zairian economy. This project would also enable IDA to continue to
assist a development finance institution it helped establish and nurtured,
both by providing funds to enable it maintain a level of operations that
would be conducive to profitability and autonomy and by providing technical
assistance and support it needs to face up to the difficult environment and
institutional problems in the future. It would also enable SOFIDE to
participate more in economic decision making in Zaire and involve it more
closely in sector policy dialogue.  Continued IDA support would, as in the
past, have a catalytic effect, enabling SOFIDE to obtain resources from
other donors, who would not otherwise have considered supporting SOFIDE.
3.16      The major risks associated with the project relate to the
difficult general economic situation of Zaire, and its possible effects on
SOFIDE's subborrowers and hence on the creditworthiness, profitability and
risk profile of its portfolio. Shortages of foreign exchange for the
import of spare parts and raw materials are likely to persist. These
shortages and a tight liquidity situation restricting working capital
availability to productive enterprises would further hinder the prospects
of an early economic recovery; endemic inflation and devaluation are likely
to sap the financial strength of many of SOFIDE's clients.  These same
factors will also affect SOFIDE itself directly and therefore pose a
difficult challenge to SOFIDE's management and shareholders.
3.17      Although the performance of SOFIDE has so far been remarkable,
there is also the risk that endemic inflation and consequent rise in
administrative costs on one side and the inability to pass on these
increased costs on the other, would lead to loss of profitability, and
subsequently financial autonomy. This points out the risks inherent in
institution building whereby environmental conditions can slowly sap the
strength of even well managed institutions. SOFIDE will need close and
continuous assistance from IDA and IFC (through its presence in SOFIDE's
Board) and from its other outside creditors and its shareholders in terms
of continued financial and technical support to help avoid this from
happening.
3.18      However, while serious macro-economic problems persist, the
Government has recently taken a number of policy measures to redress the
economic situation. These were discussed in the part I of this report and
included:
(i) a substantial devaluation of the Zaire in mid-1981;
(ii) an increase in the interest rates of 25-45%;
(iii) liberalization of industrial prices; and
(iv) some improvement in the allocation of foreign exchange resources.



- 45 -
If Zaire continues to make efforts, the overall medium and long term
prospects could be considerably improved.  In that instance, the benefits
of having a strong indigenous effective development finance institution
would amply compensate for the risks outlined above, and would outweigh the
costs inherent in continuing to provide such assistance. Even if the
situation does not improve markedly in the near term but remains at the
present level, SOFIDE's contribution to the Zairian productive sectors
still justifies strongly IDA's support.
IV. UNDERSTANDINGS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED AT NEGOTIATIONS
4.01      IDA would advance a credit of US$21.5 million to the Government
of the Republic of Zaire which would pass it on to SOFIDE for the proposed
project. The following understandings and agreements were reached:
(A) From the Government:
(i) An understanding that SOFIDE will be consulted
before each special allocation of foreign exchange
to the industrial sector (para. 1.41);
(ii) An agreement that the investment component of the
proposed project will be onlent to SOFIDE at a
minimum rate of 8% per annum (paras. 2.48 and
2.51); and
(iii)  An agreement that the proceeds of the IDA V credit
will be retroceded to SOFIDE on a quasi-equity
basis (para. 2.50 and 2.51).
(B) From SOFIDE:
(i)  Agreement that SOFIDE will not declare dividends
until its provisions for risk attain 4% of its
equity and medium and long-term loan portfolio
(paras. 2.37, 2.47 amd 2.51); and
(ii) Agreement that the debt equity ratio should not
exceed 5:1 (para. 2.51);
4.02      At negotiations IDA's recommendations that the 1982 audit would
include a systems and management audit were discussed. Given the extent of
reorganization and the amount of work done in this area by SOFIDE recently
it was agreed that the results of a full management audit were unlikely to
justify the costs and this requirement was therefore dropped.
4.03      At negotiations IDA reviewed and found acceptable SOFIDE's plans
for (i) improving its accounting system (ii) strengthening its supervision
efforts (iii) increasing the cost effectiveness of SOFIDE's regional
offices and (iv) raising local currency resources.

Selection of Study Sub-Projects
4.04      The Zairian delegation provided the Association with an
indicative list of possible study subprojects as discussed during the last
supervision mission. It also indicated that the choice of study
subprojects to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit would be made
by a Committee currently being created; the Committee would include
representatives from SOFIDE, the Ministry of Planning and ANEZA (the
national Association of Zairian enterprises) and would decide on projects
to be presented to IDA. The two delegations also discussed the criteria
for the selection of study subprojects (Annex 17). The proposals of the
Committee for study subprojects including terms of reference would be
presented to the Association for comment and approval. It was agreed that
the status and procedures of the Committee would be forwarded to IDA prior
to the signing of the Credit.

SOCIETE FINANCIERE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (SOFIDE)
Investment Strategy Statement -/
Criteria for Selection of Projects by SOFIDE
Selection of projects shall take into account economic conditions,
the major problems facing the country and national priorities, whilst also
bearing in mind the limited resources at SOFIDE's disposal.
SOFIDE has identified the following priority criteria:
(a) satisfaction of basic needs;
(b) transport;
(c) stabilization of the balance of payments;
(d) industrial integration;
(e) increased exploitation of local raw materials; and
(f) employment creation.
To this end, SOFIDE will give priority in its lending to projects
which contribute to resolving one or more of these problems. Specifically,
SOFIDE shall assist primarily:
-    agriculture and livestock projects;
-    transportation projects;
-    export-oriented projects;
-    import susbstitution projects;
-    industrial integration projects;
-    projects involving exploitation of local raw materials;
-    labor-intensive projects;
-    projects located in the regions;
-    projects promoting Zairian-owned firms.

The above areas of activity constitute the criteria for
pre-selection of projects. Appraisal of all projects will then include an
economic analysis, on the basis of which the decision to finance any
given project will be taken. From,amongst the projects meeting the
above criteria, SOFIDE will select for its financing those with the highest
economic rates of return.

ANNEX 17
Criteria for the Evaluation of Study Subprojects
Priority shall be given to studies which would enable Government
as well as other interested parties (for example ANEZA and SOFIDE) to
better formulate policies and strategy regarding the industrial and
agro-industrial sectors to better utilise existing production capacity,
promote local resources bank industries and promote small scale enterprise
development. To this effect the subprojects should enable:
(a)   the improvement of the statistical data base for the above
mentioned sectors;
(b)   Government and other interested parties to strengthen their
capacity to formulate and implement strategy and policy
towards the sector (e.g. through training, reorganisation);
(c)   analysis of the measures (fiscal, trade related and other)
that would improve existing capacity utilisation in the
above sectors;
(d)   study of the actions necessary to promote small scale
enterprise development;
(e)   improve project preparation and design.
