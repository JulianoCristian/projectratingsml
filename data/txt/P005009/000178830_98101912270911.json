     Egypt's inadequate telecommunications system which is\n            creating a major bottleneck in the country's\n            development process. The project will (i) provide some\n            relief to the huge backlog in demand for telephones through\n            the installation of about 226,000 local exchange lines; (ii)\n            improve long distance telephone services through about 5,000\n            additional trunk exchange lines; and (iii) expand telex\n            services through an additional 3,000 line telex exchange in\n            Cairo. With the project, system congestion will decrease and\n            existing telecommunications facilities will be used more\n            efficiently. User resources presently wasted on higher cost\n            means of communication will be saved. Further, losses of\n            production and marketing efficiency, caused by the present\n            lack of communication, will be reduced and expansion of\n            industries and activities that rely on good communications\n            will be facilitated."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
