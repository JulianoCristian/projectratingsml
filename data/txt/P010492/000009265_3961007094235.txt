MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A POPULATION WELFARE PROGRAM PROJECT
I.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development credit to the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan of SDR 45.0 million (US$65.1 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity, and would help finance a
population welfare program project.
2.    Background. Pakistan is the eighth most populous country in the world, with a population of over
120 million. Poverty is widespread, life expectancy is low, and maternal and child mortality remains
high. Continuing high fertility is part of a web of poor social indicators, tied to low education levels for
women, high child mortality and the scarcity of family planning (fp) services. At the present population
growth rate of about three percent a year, the population will double again in the next 23 years. This
rate of growth, higher than any other large Asian country, is the consequence of a slow but steady decline
in mortality with only a small corresponding decline in fertility. Although fertility is falling rapidly in
most Asian countries, a typical Pakistani woman still has about 5.6 births in her life (compared to 3.9
in India and 4.4 in Bangladesh). In the 1950s, Pakistan was one of the first countries in the world to
recognize the problems of rapid population growth and to adopt a policy to reduce fertility. Little success
has been achieved despite excess demand for fp; modern contraception is used by only about 12 percent
of couples. Reasons for the past lack of success included weak Government commitment, failure to
supply fp services of acceptable quality, management deficiencies, cultural resistance especially linked
to the status of women, and a generally difficult social environment, reflected in very low social
indicators. This situation is changing. About 40 percent of married women now want to avoid or
postpone further pregnancy, and fertility has probably started to fall in urban areas. The Government
is implementing a Social Action Program (SAP) to accelerate social development in four key sectors,
including population and - critically - female education. IDA is supporting the SAP through the Social
Action Program Project (SAPP). The SAP and the SAPP both show that the Government is generally
giving much higher priority to population - this project takes IDA support a step further.
3.    Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is fully consistent with the IDA Country
Assistance Strategy discussed by the Executive Directors on March 31, 1994. Slowing population growth
is central to achieving sustained socioeconomic development; since the 1970s, IDA has argued that
Pakistan's high rate of population growth is making achievement of its socioeconomic goals substantially
more difficult. Slow social development, in turn, greatly hinders fertility decline. The fastest way to
slow population growth in Pakistan will be to increase female education while supplying better fp to both
men and women and improving children's health -- in short, investing in human resources, especially for
women. IDA's strategy for Pakistan has consistently included among its main objectives human resources
development and poverty alleviation. However, with the exception of 1983 when a population project
was approved, the Government has been reluctant to borrow for population projects. With the renewed
focus on population, the Government has now requested IDA support for a broad-based population project
taking a 'program' approach, which would support and extend the SAP initiatives. IDA is uniquely
placed among donors to take the lead in such a program approach. The cessation of very substantial
United States assistance for population and limited grant financing from other donors makes the request
for IDA support more urgent.



2
4.     The only previous IDA population project achieved little success in its either institutional
development or its fp objectives. Key lessons were: the importance of sustained Government commitment
to the program, the need for greater realism about the institutional constraints on implementation, the
importance of a project being firmly grounded in solid sector work, the need to avoid a piecemeal
approach (including limiting the number of PC-Is'), and the need for staff continuity in both the
Government and IDA. These lessons have been taken into account in the proposed project by: seeking
to reinforce political commitment, which is presently higher than it has been for many years, through
specially designed information activities; by designing program content and reforms within a realistic
implementation schedule after much advanced detailed preparation work, by extensive local involvement
including a series of consensus building workshops, and by decentralization. Moreover, IDA (and other)
sector reports have been used, especially the 1989 Pakistan population study, as have findings from the
continuing IDA-funded two Family Health projects, and the results of recent major surveys. Finally, it
has been agreed that staff transfers will be limited. Lessons from the two continuing Family Health
projects, particularly on ways of more effectively linking health and fp services together, have been
incorporated as have wider lessons from other social sector projects including the need for advanced
preparation, early Government project approval, and working through the existing implementation system.
5.     Program and Project Objectives. Pakistan's high rate of population growth undermines its efforts
to relieve poverty and achieve sustainable development. The Government has therefore set reduction of
fertility as its main objective in population policy. Ambitious targets for the Eighth Plan period have
been set, including the expansion of fp service coverage to 100 percent in urban areas and 70 percent
in rural areas, nearly doubling contraceptive use, and reducing fertility by 10 percent. To reduce
fertility, demand for smaller families needs to be built - through expansion of education and economic
opportunity especially for women and improvement in children's survival prospects - while supplying
better fp information and services. The project would help the Government reduce fertility mainly
through increasing contraceptive prevalence, thereby slowing population growth and improving the health
of women and children. The proposed project, and the national population program which it would
support, will: (a) expand fp service coverage and improve service quality; (b) increase the demand for
fp services by strengthened population information, education and communications and enhanced
community support; and (c) strengthen institutional support for fp in both the Government and private
sectors. Priority will be given to informing and meeting the demand that already exists while building
further demand. The project will complement projects in education and health and the SAP, as well as
broader efforts to promote economic opportunity.
6.     Program and Project Description.  The proposed project would support the entire national
population program. Financing would be linked to a sequenced policy and implementation reform
program agreed between the Government and IDA. The project would support Pakistan's population
program to: (a) plan and implement policy reforms to improve the effectiveness of population activities
in key areas such as financing, strategic planning, decentralization, and contraceptive supply; (b) boost
the quality and availability of fp services through service expansion, improved outreach, and better
coordination within the public sector and with the private sector; (c) strengthen population information,
education and communications; (d) expand staff training and improve the management and supervision
capacity of the federal Ministry of Population Welfare (MPW) and the provincial Population Welfare
Departments (PWDs); (e) strengthen links with other departments including health, education and
women's development; and (f) substantially increase private sector involvement, including non-
' All development projects in Pakistan must be presented to the approving Government authorities in a prescribed detailed format known as a PC-I.



3
governmental organizations (NGOs), in fp. The project would reinforce the need to provide contraceptive
choice and quality services, and to increase the involvement of communities and users. The main
innovation in the program is the introduction of extensive community outreach through female village
workers, who will be drawn from the communities they serve, who will provide fp information and
services to women in their homes, and who will pass on clients' needs and priorities to local program
managers. The program will be reviewed yearly within the already agreed program framework. Annual
agreements will be reached on the details of policy and reform measures, budget levels and distribution,
and program content and operations for the coming year. The lead implementing agencies will be the
MPW and the Provincial PWDs. The multi-sectoral approach requires the involvement of a number of
other Ministries/Departments (especially health and education) and the private sector (particularly NGOs,
private doctors, and contraceptive social marketing).
7.     The total cost of the national population program, for the four financial years 1995/96 to 1998/99,
is estimated at US$287.6 million. The Government will finance an increasing proportion of the total cost
- and of incremental costs - and the donors will finance the balance. After subtracting expected aid
from other sources (particularly the Asian Development Bank, the British Overseas Development
Administration, and the United Nations Population Fund), IDA will finance the gap as a four-year time-
slice on a program basis. Details will be finalized as part of the annual agreements. The Federal
Governrment will make available to the provinces and the federal areas part of the proceeds of the
proposed Credit, in accordance with its standard budgetary procedures, for implementing their respective
parts of the program. It is estimated that IDA's contribution would be US$65.1 million (including US$5
million for technical assistance and US$5 million for an NGO fund). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  The amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 1361 1-PAK, is being distributed separately.
8.    The total cost of the program is at present very moderate; it will be less than 1 percent of total
Government expenditure, even after more than doubling during the project period. For a truly major
national program, funding would need to be radically increased and made more efficient. But short-term
implementation constraints remain significant and so limit the pace of expansion. Nonetheless, program
resources are planned to grow by a substantial average annual real increase of 22 percent. Even with this
rate of expansion, the total program will continue to be modest; financial sustainability is not an issue.
9.    Actions Agreed. During Negotiations, the Governments confirmed the content of the Population
Program for 1995/96 (subject to budget approval by the legislatures). A letter of development policy for
the population sector, dated November 22, 1994 was presented during Negotiations.  During
Negotiations, the Federal and Provincial Governments as appropriate provided assurances that: (a)
program responsibility in the Federally administered areas will be transferred to those areas, with a status
similar to that being followed for the Provinces; (b) no bans on the recruitment of service delivery staff
will be introduced or enforced during the project period; (c) the administrative status of population
program staff will be resolved by December 1995; (d) the National Trust for Population Welfare will
continue to operate in a manner satisfactory to IDA; (e) the overall level of spending on the population
program will rise by at least 22 percent a year (in constant price terms) during the four-year period
1995/96 to 1998/99, and that the total size of the program for the same period will be Rs 10.34 billion,
subject to the possibility that a different percentage may be agreed in fiscal 1998/99, the first year of the
Ninth Plan, with a resulting different aggregate over the four year period; (f) within the total spending
on population, the Governmnent's contribution will rise from 57 percent to 60 percent during the period



4
1995/96 to 1998/99, including the Government financing an increased proportion of incremental costs;
(g) independent auditors acceptable to IDA will be appointed in a timely manner to undertake annual
audits and to prepare audit reports of the Project Accounts, Special Account and Statements of
Expenditure for each province, federal area and the federal level; and certified copies of the audited
Project Accounts and the Special Account Statements, together with the auditor's report and opinion
thereon, and a certified copy of the auditors report and opinion on the Statements of Expenditure will be
provided to IDA within nine months of the end of each fiscal year; (h) annual operational plans for each
project year will be prepared and their activity, financial and reform content agreed with IDA; (i) the
Federal and Provincial Governments will implement their agreed operational plans to the satisfaction of
IDA; (j) release of funds will continue to be made to the Ministry and Departments of Population Welfare
by the 15th of the first month of every quarter to facilitate full spending of the budgeted accounts; (k)
a joint Government and IDA mid-term review will be held before July 1997; (1) the Federal and
Provincial Governments, with the assistance of consultants to be recruited by the federal Government,
will systematically monitor program implementation, provide semi-annual progress reports, and
participate in annual Government/donor reviews of the past year; and (m) an Implementation Completion
Report will be submitted by the Government to IDA within six months of the closing date of the project.
10.    There is one special condition of Credit Effectiveness: satisfactory progress in implementing the
SAPP supported population program for 1994/95.
11.    Environmental Considerations. No adverse impact on the environment is expected from this
project; it was determined to be in screening Category C. On the contrary, by reducing population
growth the project is expected to ease pressures on the environment.
12.    Poverty Category: Program of Targeted Interventions. The project supports the entire national
population prograrn, which plans to increase dramatically the coverage and quality of fp services
throughout the country, especially in rural and poor urban areas. Such disadvantaged areas are presently
seriously under-served; they will benefit particularly from the new outreach programs, which are designed
especially to reach the rural poor. The expected improvements in health and welfare will benefit poor
women and their children most.
13.    Participation.  The village-level outreach worker initiative will greatly facilitate community
involvement in the program. In addition, experiments have started that are designed to increase the
participation in the program and promote feedback by clients, communities, and field workers. The
program also provides support for NGO efforts through the creation of a trust fund for NGO activities
in the population sector. A comprehensive series of workshops has been held, which will be continued,
to encourage greater participation and feedback by the field program managers and staff. MPW and the
PWDs are fully committed to their programs and hence to the project. The program and project were
developed mainly by the Government, with supporting inputs from the cooperating donors and IDA
missions.
14.    Benefits. The project will help the Government achieve its population welfare objectives by
supporting a major expansion in family planning service availability, and informing and stimulating
demand for services. It will increase Pakistan's very low contraceptive prevalence rate and start to reduce
its very high fertility and population growth rates, which presently constrain economic and social
development in many ways. Services will be of higher quality, more available, and of increased
effectiveness. The project will help women attain their reproductive health goals, as well as provide a
substantial number of work opportunities to women. Ambitious targets have been set to expand coverage



5
of family planning service delivery to approach 100 percent in urban areas and 70 percent in rural areas,
from 54 percent and 5 percent at present; a near doubling of contraceptive use, and a 10 percent fall in
fertility is projected. Important aspects of the service delivery program include: a crucial new village
outreach program (increasing village workers from a few hundred to 12,000, such that every village of
2,000 or more people has one worker), increased service delivery points (including an extra 200 Family
Welfare Centres and a doubling to 251 of Mobile Service Units); enlarged staff pre- and in-service
technical training (over 4,000 trainees during the five years); and strengthened population information
activities to increase the effective demand for family planning and generate community support. Support
for population objectives by other line departments and the private sector will improve sharply through
provision of family planning services by provincial health departments and other line agencies, increased
population education in schools, strong emphasis on girls' education under SAP, expanded social
marketing of contraceptives, and a doubling of NGO activities. The government will benefit from the
various institutional development components, particularly the management, planning and technical skill
enhancement activities. Lastly, through lower fertility and population growth, the project will facilitate
the achievement of human development and poverty alleviation, improve the health and reduce the
mortality of mothers and children, improve women's status, and reduce environmental pressures.
15.   Risks. During preparation, attempts have been made to analyze and reduce project risks. But
this remains a risky initiative given poor past performance. The program as a whole faces two generic
risks: failing to increase contraceptive use sufficiently to meet the demographic and health objectives; and
failing to improve the availability and quality of services sufficiently to meet service demand. Underlying
these are four specific risks. The first, and critical, risk is that support for the program will fade as in
the past, due to political or religious pressures, or because results are slow in coming. Political support
for the program is currently high, but success for the program will depend upon the Government
maintaining the commitment demonstrated in the past two years. The inclusion of population prominently
in the SAP and the SAPP, helped strengthen political resolution. Through enhancing the communications
program for opinion leaders, the phased funding, and other practical ways being developed under the
annual agreement mechanism, stronger commitment will be fostered. But this will continue to be a
difficult area. The second risk is that the implementing agencies lack the management capacity to execute
the ambitious program, and that the program approach will strain this limited capacity even further. This
risk is being addressed by a program of management training and sustained technical support, by
decentralization and increased participation, by detailed development work, and by a continuing program
of operations research.  The joint monitoring of progress (by Government and IDA), program
development workshops, and annual agreements will also make important contributions. The third risk,
as happened in the past, is that poor performance of some provinces and agencies, especially the health
authorities, will persist, mainly due to lack of accountability for success. This risk will be mitigated by
the already initiated decentralization reforms, crucially by increasing the responsibility of the provinces
for the program including requiring accountability from other departments at senior levels. The increased
level of provincial political support and the SAPP efforts to improve inter-sectoral coordination and
partnership are also important factors. Finally, given the substantial contribution that the private sector
is intended to make to the program, there is a risk that this will be impeded by persistent problems of
inadequate support for NGOs and recurrence of earlier antagonism that the Government demonstrated to
the commercial sector. Completing the establishment of an independent Trust to channel Government
and donor population support to NGOs would greatly reduce this risk; relations with the private
commercial sector are now reasonable and, in future, companies will have increased autonomy over
trading decisions. Although the project is risky, the risks seem eminently worth taking in view of the
potential for raising per capita living standards, improving the status of women and producing substantial
macroeconomic benefits.

16.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommnend that the Executive Directors approve it.
