"Pakistan's population growth of\n            about 3 percent annually - faster than any other large Asian\n            country - undermines its efforts to relieve poverty and\n            achieve sustainable development. High fertility is part of a\n            web of poor social indicators in Pakistan, tied to slow\n            progress in the social sectors as well as poverty. The best\n            way to slow population growth will be to build demand for\n            smaller families through improvements in education and\n            economic opportunity, especially for women, and in\n            children's survival prospects, while supplying better\n            family planning information and services so that couples can\n            more easily limit fertility. Family planning will then\n            become a more appealing option. Pakistan's Social\n            Action Program, which covers primary education, primary\n            health care, population, and rural water supply, will\n            address both \"demand\" and \"supply\"\n            aspects of family planning. The Population Welfare Program\n            Project will contribute mainly by strengthening supply of\n            family planning information and services, to meet the demand\n            that already exists. It will thus complement other Social\n            Action (SAP) programs and projects in education and health\n            as well as broader efforts to promote economic opportunity\n            that will generate further demand."}, "docdt": "1995-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
