3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective.
The goal of the project was to help the Government of Pakistan (GoP) reduce fertility, thereby
slowing population growth and improving the health of women and children. The intermediate
objectives were (a) to expand family planning service coverage and improve its quality; (b) to
increase the demand for family planning services through information, education, and
communication activities; and (c) to strengthen the institutional framework for the delivery of
family planning and reproductive health services through the Ministry and Departments of
Population Welfare, other government line agencies, the private sector, and nongovernmental
institutions. A complementary objective was to improve reproductive health services.
The objectives were appropriate in view of the situation prevailing at that time of very high
fertility, evidence of substantial unmet demand for family planning, and weak service
infrastructure. However, at appraisal the demographic objectives were considered ambitious
within the time frame of the project. To achieve this, it required strengthening of links between
the population and health sectors and involving the private sector, especially nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs). This was proposed to be done jointly through various projects (Family
Health Projects, Health and Population Welfare Project of Asian Development Bank). This
project was intended to reduce fertility and support family planning in a country where gender,
social and religious constraints are coupled with very weak institutional capacity and poor
governance. The project was implemented in parallel with other Bank projects, notably the Social
Action Program Project (SAPP) which adopts a sector wide approach to address key underlying
institutional issues. The project objectives and approach need to be viewed within this broader
framework. The main policy issues being addressed through the first and second SAPP were:
provision of family planning services through health outlets; improving coordination between the
two programs; training of health staff in family planning; and supply of contraceptives to health
outlets.
3.2 Revised Objective:
There were no changes in the original objectives.
3.3 Original Co½nponents:
The project's design followed a program approach, supporting the entire Population Welfare
Program of the GoP. The program was an integral part of the Social Action Program (SAP) and
the Social Action Program Project (SAPP) supported by International Development Association
(IDA) and other donor partners. It provided a common framework for a policy dialogue between
GoP and donors. Project financing support was conditional on (i) reaching an agreement annually
between the GoP and donors on the subsequent year program's contents, budget, targeted
institutional and policy reforms; and (ii) satisfactory progress in the implementation of the
program as a whole.
-2 -



The project had three components: (a) Service Delivery (US$136.3 million, provincial
responsibilities); (b) Support Services (US$77.6 million, federal responsibilities); and (c) Private
Sector (US$19.9 million). The Service Delivery component was to be achieved through expansion
of the numbers of Family Welfare Centers (FWCs) and Reproductive Health Centers (RHCs),
deployment of village-level family planning workers, and expansion of services by the Provincial
Departments of Health. The Support Services component was concerned with providing support
to the program through: training; contraceptive procurement, logistics; information, education and
communication activities; and research, monitoring and evaluation activities. The Private Sector
component included support for NGOs and social marketing of contraceptives.
3.4 Revised Comn ponents:
The project was restructured in June 1997, in conjunction with the Pakistan Social Sector
Portfolio Restructuring Exercise. At restructuring (a) the quantity of contraceptives to be
procured were reduced to US$10.0 million as these were being supplied by grant donors, and (b)
the allocation for NGOs was reduced to half from US$5.0 million to US$2.5 million as at
mid-point the NGO activities had not started. There was no other change in the restructuring of
the Project.
3.5 Qualit4 at Enitry:
The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) did not rate this project for quality at entry. The quality at
entry in this Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is rated as marginally satisfactory. This is
based on (a) the program being consistent with the development goals of GoP and the Bank's
strategy towards Pakistan since the 1980s, as reflected in successive Country Assistance
Strategies (CASs), and (b) the project's assumptions were grounded in solid household survey
data, indicating substantial unmet demand for family planning services. This justified the program's
emphasis on expanding family planning services, while continuing to support efforts to improve
couples' awareness and understanding of family planning. However, as noted later, insufficient
attention was paid to the planning of financial management and procurement.
The four major risk factors identified at Appraisal were the following:
* a lack of political commitment or religious pressure;
* deficient implementation capacity to execute the ambitious program;
*  insufficient accountability from the provinces, the health authorities and other agencies
concerned for the success of the program; and
* inadequate involvement of the private sector.
These were to be addressed by inclusion of the population program under SAPP, appropriate
Information Education and Communication (IEC) strategies, decentralization, technical
assistance, and improving support to private sector.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4. 1 Outcome/achievement of obwjective.
The overall achievement of objectives is rated as Satisfactory in this ICR. The objective of the
project was to increase contraceptive prevalence by improving the quality and availability of
family planning services and information to meet and reinforce existing demand for contraception.
Key impact and outcome indicators with benchmarks were included in the Staff Appraisal Report
(SAR). However, no targets were set for those indicators. It is not possible to attribute gains in
contraception specifically to this project, since many factors influence the demand for
contraception, and this project was carried out in the context of SAPP and many economic and
social changes. However, the program does appear to have contributed to increasing the coverage
in the public sector and enhancing the role of the private sector in the provision of family planning
services. This has helped in increasing the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) and in reducing
the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) along with other programs aiming at lowering fertility. To
summarize, some of Pakistan's achievements are the following:
*  The CPR has increased from less than 10.7% in 1993/94 to 23.9% in 1998/99 according to
the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey (PIHS). The CPR is still increasing and by the end
of the program is expected to be higher. Although the CPR is reported to have improved, the
current level remains very low compared to other countries in the region.
* The 1998 Census has established that the TFR has declined substantially from 5.6 in 1993/94
to 4.5 in 1998/99. PIHS data also support this trend.
* The coverage of family planning services with the combined efforts of all actors has increased
from 5% in 1993/94 to 57% in 1998/99 in rural areas and from 54% to 77% in urban areas
during the same period. Access to services (defined as proximity to service outlets) has
improved significantly as has awareness of contraception among married couples.
* The private sector and NGO involvement in Family Planning (FP) has increased from almost
nothing to 30% of documented coverage.
* The percentage of married couples who want to space or limit their family size has risen
steadily from 40% in 1993/94 to 61% at present.
*  There has been a regular supply of contraceptives in the Ministry and Population Welfare
(MoPW) outlets.
The program has made progress in strengthening the delivery of family planning and reproductive
health services through the Ministry and Departments of Population Welfare and other
government line agencies. The program has succeeded in diversifying contraceptive sources
through increased supply by the private sector and NGO providers. Technical assistance (TA) was
not available during the life of the program due to delay in finalizing the contract of the TA firm.
This was a limiting factor for capacity development. However, there has been an improvement in
supervision and monitoring of the program by trained supervisors, involvement of Mobile Service
Units, increased availability of new supervisory tiers, and use of standardized formats for
collection of information. Another aspect of institutional strengthening has been the delegation of
certain financial powers to staff at the provincial level and below. Nonetheless, financial
- 4 -



management of the program in general suffered from serious weaknesses, as discussed later in this
report.
4.2 outpuits by components:
As a program-oriented project, IDA supported the entire MoPW program and financed a time
slice of MoPW's expenditure program. The overall program's interventions included (a) Service
Delivery (provincial responsibilities); (b) Support Services (federal responsibilities); and (c) the
Private Sector. Achievements have been satisfactory for the first two categories and
unsatisfactory for the third category. Details appear below:
Service Delivery (provincial responsibilities):
*  Over 200 additional Family Welfare Centers have been established and are fully functional.
*  The number of Village Based Family Planning Workers has increased from about 1,000 at the
start of the project to about 12,000 by the end of 1998/99.
*  The number of Lady Health Workers (a type of village-based worker deployed by the Federal
Ministry of Health and provincial Departments of Health, who also provide some family
planning services) increased from a few thousand at the start of the project to 43,000 by the
end of 1998/99.
*  The number of Reproductive Health Service Centers (for contraceptive surgery) has increased
from 79 at the start of the project to 96 by the end of 1998/99.
*  There has been an increase in the number of provincial Department of Health facilities offering
family planning services. According to estimates from the Health Management Information
System (HMIS), the proportion of Department of Health first-level care facilities providing
family planning services before the start of the project (in early 1996) was 49% in Punjab,
19% in Sindh, 15% in North West Frontier Province (NWFP), and 13% in Balochistan. By
December 1998, the proportions had changed to about 60% in Punjab. By December 1999,
those proportions had increased to 37% in Sindh, 47% in NWFP and 21% in Balochistan.
-  The women who had access to family planning services within five kilometers of their
residences increased from 5% of rural women and 54% of urban women in the early 1990s to
42%/o and 77% respectively in 1998/99.
*  Linking various projects inputs assisted improving access, IEC/IPC strategy, health services
(Family Health I and II), SAPP II, and other donors' programs.
Support Services (federal responsibilities):
*  Inter-personal [EC activities were greatly expanded through the deployment of 12,000
Village-Based Family Planning Workers and 43,000 Lady Health Workers increasing
awareness among approximately 50 million people.
*  Mass media activities: the communications strategy of the program has changed radically to a
more explicit approach of promotion of family planning, with increased air time especially
during prime time, and increased production of IEC materials.
*  As a result, it appears that IEC activities during the project/program period raised awareness
and knowledge of family planning and influenced contraceptive behavior.
- 5 -



Private Sector
*  Through the National Trust for Population Welfare (NATPOW), the program supported and
funded 181 NGOs during the project period against the original planned involvement of 322
NGOs in family planning. NATPOW appeared to have a reasonable appraisal procedure in
which there was room for innovative projects, but the bulk of the projects consist of static
centers and limited outreach projects. The program has not been successful in encouraging
strong collaboration between the NGOs, Governments and the private sector. NATPOW's
procedures and formats for project monitoring were of reasonable quality. However, it is
unclear what lessons were being learned from the monitoring reports for subsequent program
design and evaluation criteria.
*  Several weaknesses were noted in the financial management system of NATPOW, especially,
for making payments for Grants to NGOs. Internal controls in NATPOW were somewhat
inadequate.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic r ate of return:
Not applicable.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project has assisted the Government in developing from a very low and fragile base its
institutional capacity to deliver family planning programs and reproductive health services through
the Ministry of Population Welfare, and the health departments of the various provinces. It has
also helped strengthen private sector and NGO service delivery capacity particularly through
diversification of contraceptive supply channels available to married couples. Nevertheless, efforts
to more emphatically decentralize program implementation responsibilities, including some key
program design, staffing and financial management responsibilities to the provincial level and to
remove many of the identified cumbersome administrative constraints were only partially
successful. Working in conjunction with the SAPP, the project has improved the monitoring
capacity of the family planning program by the MoPW. Many parts of the staffing and financial
management reformns envisaged have also been constrained by the severe fiscal crisis afflicting
Pakistan during most of the period of project implementation as central agencies constrained
government expenditures.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5. 1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agenc9n:
The use of family planning methods in Pakistan is entirely voluntary and the use of contraceptives
depends to a large extent on couples' decisions. These decisions can be influenced through IEC
activities and improving accessibility of family planning services.
-6 -



5.2 Factors generally suibject to government control:
The sustained fiscal crisis in Pakistan after the first 1-2 years of the project's implementation
constrained the government's capacity to finance its share of the overall program as agreed at
appraisal. The ambitious overall program budget and expenditure targets were reduced for the
second half of the project. Revised levels were maintained and provided. Releases of funds to the
provinces were delayed by the Ministry of Finance in each financial year by between two and three
months. These delays affected expenditure on non-salary inputs and also resulted at times in
delays of several months in payment of the salaries of the village-level workers. Administrative
procedures remained cumbersome, and there was no effort to transfer administrative powers to
the provincial Population Welfare Departments by the central office of the Ministry of Population
Welfare. During the first half of the project, there were bans on the recruitment of non-technical
staff, but these were later relaxed. However, there was no ban on the recruitment of the Village
Based Family Planning Workers. There has been for some time a ban on the purchase of durable
goods and transport for the supervisory staff. If the above issues had been addressed in the early
stages of the Program, the outcomes would have been more positive.
5.3 Factors generaltv subject to implementing agency control:
In-service training of staff was also within the competency of the implementing agencies but little
was done in this respect. The organization of assistance to NGOs through NATPOW took more
than two years to materialize. Financial management of the project was very weak. Bookkeeping,
financial monitoring, and compliance with reporting requirements, which are crucial for proper
implementation and effective use of funds, were not paid the attention they deserved. Audit
reports were delayed, and the format of reporting was not consistent with the Bank's
requirements. Insufficient attention was paid to the issues raised by the auditors. A remedial
action plan, based on both a project- and portfolio-wide effort to take action on identified
problems, was agreed in the November/ December 1999 Supervision Mission for the provision of
audited financial statements to be prepared by the MoPW for the entire program period. These
audited financial statements, in a format agreed with the Bank, were due to be provided by
February 2000, but remain outstanding. Audited financial statements for fiscal year 1998/99 and
audit opinions relating to earlier years are also outstanding for NATPOW.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The total program cost estimate at appraisal was US$287.6 million (Rs 10,339 million). The
Financing Plan for the program envisaged a government contribution of US$161 million (56% of
total program cost); contributions from donors other than IDA of US$61.5 million (21.4%); and
IDA funding of the remaining US$65.1 million (22.6%). As compared to the above, actual
program expenditure in the project period amounted to US$161.4 million. This amount was
financed as follows: Government, US$86.7 million (53.7% of the total program cost); donors
other than IDA, US$39.4 million (24.4% of the total program cost); and US$35.3 million from
IDA (21.9% of the total program cost). In Rupee terms, actual program expenditure in the project
period amounted to about Rs 7,090 million. The low expenditure is mainly due to slower than
anticipated expansion of the program.
-7 -



The project was restructured in 1997. The program remained basically unchanged, but certain
categories of IDA financing required revision. Two thirds of IDA funds for contraceptives were
replaced by grant assistance from other donors; and less IDA funds were required for slow
implementing components -- the NGO component, operating costs, and vehicles. The Ministry of
Population Welfare and the Bank agreed that the amount of the Credit should be US$36.0 million
rather than US$65.1 million, and canceled US$29.1 million (contraceptives: US$20.0 million,
grants to NGOs: US$2.5 million; and operating costs and vehicles, US$6.6 million). The
restructured IDA Credit of US$35.3 million has been disbursed.
6. Sustainability
6. 1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability of the program is rated as Likely, with the exception of support to NGOs through
NATPOW. Reasons for this rating are given below.
* Government commitment: The Government's commitment to the program remains high.
This is reflected by increasing support for social mobilization and continuation of family
planning services as part of the Social Action Program.
*  Policy environment: The goal of reducing the rate of population growth remains a central
element of Government policy.
*  Economic/financial viability: The fiscal cost of the program is very small relative to total
government expenditure, and funding should not be a problem as long as reducing fertility and
population growth continue to be high-priority policy goals.
*  Social impact and local participation: The program has always been entirely voluntary, so a
social backlash against the program is unlikely. There is an element of local participation in the
provision of services under the program through the village-based workers.
=  Incentives for participation to sustain the project: The demand for family planning in
Pakistan is high, and there is pressure from the public for the program not only to be sustained
but also to be expanded.
*  NGO support: Nonetheless, management of the program still needs strengthening as does the
mechanism to work with NGOs.
6.2 Transilion arrangement to regular operations:
As explained in section 3.3 above, the project's design followed a program approach, so the
question of transition arrangements to regular operation does not really apply, with the exception
of funding for NGOs, which was not a part of the program prior to the project. From a financial
point of view, the end of IDA funding for the program through the project is being compensated
both by Government funds and multi-donor grants in the context of the Social Action Program
Project II and a number of relatively small grants from other donors including UNFPA.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank performance during the identification to appraisal cycle was satisfactory, with the exception
of insufficient attention to the planning of procurement and to financial management. The
program was identified within the framework of the Eighth Five Year Plan of the country. As an
integral part of the country's socioeconomic development program, its main goal was to promote
the small family norm and to provide couples with the means to achieve this norm by increasing
contraceptive prevalence through improving the quality and availability of family planning
services, and by stimulating service demand. A complementary objective was to improve
reproductive health services and improve the health of women and children. The project was
consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Executive Directors on March
10, 1994. The Bank assisted in holding provincial workshops for the preparation of the project.
Directions for major policy reforms and program components were discussed and approved by
both the Government and the donors. Program financing was also discussed and agreed. Matrices
were produced to reflect proposed policy and institutional changes and implementation plans for
the federal and provincial components. The appraisal mission comprised members of the British
Overseas Development Administration (now DFID) and UNFPA in addition to the Bank staff.
The documentation produced by the mission was of good quality and comprehensive.
One aspect that received insufficient attention during preparation and appraisal was financial
management, in contrast with more recent projects whose appraisal followed the introduction of
OP/BP 1 0.02.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank performance during supervision was also satisfactory. Project supervision was based on an
average of two missions per year: a main mission in April/May and the other in
November/December. The April/May mnissions overlapped with similar missions for SAPP I and
II, and reviewed operational plans for the coming fiscal year. The November/December
supervision missions focused on technical issues, reviewed mid-year progress, and provided views
on issues to be addressed in preparation for the coming year's Operational Plan. These missions
also included extensive field visits. In November/December 1997, the Bank carried out a joint
supervision mission for the Pakistan Population Welfare Program Project, the Family Health
Project and the Second Family Health Project along with discussions of a piece of sector work on
health sector strategy, reproductive health, and future lending in health, population and nutrition.
Coordination with financial management staff of other donors was, however, lacking. Such
coordination would have assisted the Bank staff in becoming aware of the common problems, and
in developing a remedial action plan in the earlier years of the program. The Bank could have
undertaken further measures such as: (a) insisting that the Government's own process of
resolution of the audit observations was carried out through the system of Departmental Accounts
Committee meetings within a reasonable time; (b) enforcing more rigorously the remedies under
-9-



OP/BP 10.02 regarding the preparation of acceptable action plans to deal with audit observations
and the underlying internal control weaknesses; (c) insisting on the timely provision of financial
management training to staff; and (d) assessing the need for and ensuring provision of more
accurate and timely accounting information.
7. 3 Overall Bank pe.'formance.
The overall performance was satisfactory and well appreciated by the Government, especially the
on-the-ground monitoring through extensive field visits.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Other than on the side of financial management and procurement planning, Government
performance in preparation was satisfactory. There was full cooperation with the Bank and other
donors in the preparation process. The Government provided clear directions for the program in
the context of the preparation of the Eighth Five Year Plan, and then worked closely with the
Bank and other donors to flesh out detailed plans for the project period.
7.5 Government im7plementation per/frmanc e:
Government performance in implementation was marginally satisfactory. The policy directions set
at the outset of the project were maintained. The government's continuing commitment to the
program and determination to support it financially was confirmed by the inclusion of Population
Welfare as one of the sectors under the second phase of the Social Action Program as had been
the case under the first phase. However, on the minus side, the Government faced serious
macroeconomic difficulties at various times during the project period. This in turn led to the
imposition of some recruitment bans and delayed flmd releases to the provinces. This led to the
project being given an unsatisfactory rating by the Bank for about a year. The performance
improved markedly after mid-1998 and remained satisfactory thereafter until closing of the
project.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Performance of the main implementing agency (the Ministry of Population Welfare and its
provincial Departments) was generally satisfactory. The achievements have been already noted in
section 4 above. However, there were three areas where performance was weak. These are:
availability of technical assistance; procurement other than contraceptives; and financial
management.
Technical Assistance. There was a long delay in securing technical assistance for capacity
development. The benefits of such assistance did not materialize during the life of the project.
Procurement: Execution of procurement by the implementing agencies has been unsatisfactory.
Major delays in program implementation are largely explained in the following:
(i) Absence of Procurement Planning: The implementing agencies did not follow a
- 10-



well-conceived plan for procurement. Each provincial Department of Population Welfare and
NATPOW was carrying out its own procurement. Without a formal overall plan, principles of
econormy and efficiency were compromised because of inappropriate packaging; similar items
were procured through separate contracts within the same year. Agreed procurement procedures
and the Bank's guidelines were overlooked in some of the contracts for vehicles, furniture, and
equipment as the total requirements under the project were not compiled.
(ii) Delays in implementation and lack of due diligence: Major contract agreements including
procurement of contraceptives, technical assistance, and vehicles were signed during the last year
of the project (fiscal year 1998/99). UNFPA has been contracted to supply contraceptives worth
US$12.0 million and paid the full amount in advance. Since the contract agreement is not on the
Bank's standard format, and is in the shape of a Memorandum of Understanding which does not
specify details of the obligation of the supplier, the Government needs to closely monitor the
performance of UNFPA and implementation of the contract. No deliveries were reported from
UNFPA prior to closure of the project.
Similar issues and delays were observed in the procurement of vehicles. Most of the vehicles
were procured during the last year of the project. The bids for vehicles following ICB and NCB
procedures were all declared non-responsive due to technical specifications and commercial
terms, and had to be awarded on the basis of direct contracting.
(iii) Deviations from agreed procedures. In Balochistan, serious deviations from agreed
procedures were observed in procurement of medicines. As a result, mis-procurement was
declared twice by the Bank, with corresponding amounts of contracts being canceled from the
Credit. In addition, the aggregate thresholds for procuring vehicles by NCB procedures as
specified in the legal agreement were far exceeded. Most of the vehicles have been procured by
following NCB procedures, or direct negotiations with the manufacturers. Similarly, ex-post
audits revealed deviations in fumiture procurement.
It is, however, noted that following training in procurement and the assistance provided in the
context of Bank supervision, at the later stages of the project, the concerned implementing
agencies were found receptive to the need for making improvements in their procurement
procedures.
Financial Management. Financial management was weak in all of the implementing agencies --
the Ministry of Population Welfare, its Provincial Departments, and NATPOW. The agencies
clearly did not have the trained staff needed to fulfill this function adequately, nor did they make
provisions for training their existing staff in financial management. Resolutions of audit
observations took a long time, and no effective action plans were formulated to deal with these
observations and with the underlying internal control weaknesses.
7. 7 Overall Borrower perjbrmance:
Overall performance has been satisfactory, except for one year.

8. Lessons Learned
A number of important lessons have been learned through this project.
(a) Moving to a reproductive health approach can be helpful with integration of services.
With the recent emphasis on treating family planning services as one of the key elements of a
reproductive health package, the MoPW and MOH, and their provincial departments have started
to interact in a more meaningful way.
(b) It is difficult to have administrative decentralization in the presence of a centralized
funding mechanism. Although field responsibilities were transferred to the provincial
Departments of Population Welfare in 1983, the staff recruitment powers have not been
transferred to the provincial Departments of Population Welfare.
(c) The deployment of women as trainers and supervisors greatly facilitates the recruitment
of female outreach workers. Training and supervision of female outreach workers in the
program has been undertaken by women. In a society where women are reluctant to be trained
and supervised by men, their training and supervision by women ensured their enrollment in the
required numbers.
(d) Relying on the procurement of technical assistance for institutional capacity
development is a risky strategy. The problems observed with lining up technical assistance for
the project show that it is risky to put too much reliance on such assistance. There is general
reluctance in Pakistan to hire consultants/consulting firms. Alternate mechanisms for capacity
development need to be investigated for Pakistan.
(e) Procurement lessons. The experience with procurement under the project points to the
critical importance of having an overall detailed procurement plan before implementation starts.
More generally, the project's experience points to the general weakness of the procurement
function in Pakistan, and the consequent need for continuing reinforcement of the proper
procedures through staff training and other measures.
(f) Financial management lessons. The experience with the project demonstrates the need for a
detailed appraisal of the financial management system to be carried out at inception, and for
minimum improvements to be required and implemented prior to approval of the project. The
Bank's reporting requirements need to be explained in detail to the Borrower, and an assessment
carried out to establish whether the implementing agencies have the capacity to prepare the
required financial reports both for internal management as well as donor requirements and
whether suitable arrangements have been made for their audit. It is also imperative that the
Auditor General's office, whenever an audit is to be carried out by that office, be involved at
inception to confirm that the accounting and auditing arrangements are satisfactory. To minimize
additional reporting, while ensuring that all donors' requirements are met, the financial statements
for such programs should be comprehensive and show all sources of financing as well as total
expenditure by program components.

9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Both the borrower and implementing agencies evaluation are given in Annex 8.
(b) Cofinanciers:
Draft ICR was provided to the DFID and its comments are summaried below:
Overall it is encouraging to see steady improvement in demographic indicators and the level of
achievement of many of the supply side objectives. There have been some positive responses
towards an integrated approach to family planning and reproductive health as advocated by the
International Conference on Population and Development, increasing involvement of the private
sector for service delivery, and rising awareness of family planning (now almost universal at
98%). However, the CPR is still extremely low by Asian standards for modem methods and
access to family planning services in rural areas is only 42%. There are a number of issues of
concern, including: (a) dissatisfaction with government services because of access, staff
availability, and staff attitude (as measured by PIHS); (b) lack of clarity of government intentions
to continue supporting NGO programs through NATPOW or any other mechanism; (c)
weaknesses in financial management seem to indicate lack of coordination between donor partners
and lack of monitoring by the World Bank; and (d) lack of progress in decentralization of financial
and management powers to the provincial level. The report does not adequately address the issues
of contraceptive supply, community participation, and quality of care, which are key factors in
promotion, use of services and sustainability of the program.

Annex 8. liorrower/Implementing Agencies' Comments
Government of Pakistan
Ministry of Population Welfare
Population Welfare Project (CR 2688-PAK)
Implementation Completion Report
A. Assessment of Project Objectives, design and implementation experience
1.    The World Bank Population Welfare Program Project under CR. 2688-Pak aimed at
assisting the government through its population welfare program in achieving the objectives of
reducing the population growth rate, the total fertility rate and increase in the contraceptive
prevalence rate. The support under the project adopted program approach with funding for the
entire program. The project covered last three years of the Eighth Five Year Plan and 11/2 years
of the Ninth Five year Plan (1 st July 1995 to 31 st December, 1999).
2.    The program implementation and impact has improved during the project period, which is
evident from the fact that the program has been successful in achieving its stipulated objectives for
the 8th Plan and the gain has been consolidated during 1-1/2 years of the Ninth Plan. The level of
awareness about family planning was almost universal (98%), with contraceptive prevalence rate
around 30%. The total fertility rate is 5 and the annual population growth rate is 2.3%.
3.    The proj _ct supported the expansion and consolidation of service delivery network. It also
facilitated the strengthening of the capacity of personnel of service delivery outlets. The Credit
available under this project was also used for the procurement of vehicles, medicines, equipment
and contraceptives. To effectively implement Population Welfare Program Project (PWPP) an
effort was made to fill the vacant positions in the federal and provincial setup. Massive
recruitment at all levels, was made during the project period. The vacancy rates had vastly
improved by the end of the project.
4.    The project has contributed to strengthen Information, Education and Communication
(IEC), in-service training/orientation activities, improved monitoring supervision, strengthened
linkages with other Sectors, sustained NGOs program through National Trust for Population
Welfare (NATPOW) and reinforced community-based services. The project has made a decisive
contiribution in achieving the objectives through its promotional campaign, training, consolidation
and expansion of services, involvement of NGOs through NATPOW and its support for action
research througlh/by NIPS.
5.    The program implementation monitoring tools devised in the shape of Policy Matrix,
Annual Operational Plans, Quarterly Monitoring Report formats were useful for specifying
objectives, indicating required activities to achieve the stated objectives, and monitoring the
progress using simple and quantifiable indicators. This experience has so far proved very useful
and needs to be carried forward for better monitoring of program activities in future as well.

B. An Evaluation of implementation agency's own performance during project preparation
and its implementation, with special emphasis on lessons learnt that may be relevant in the
future
6.    The Population Welfare Program Project under International Development Association
(IDA) Cr.2688 provided support for administrative infrastructure at Provincial, Divisional,
District and Tehsil Levels, provision of family planning and primary health care through Family
Welfare Centers (FWCs), Mobile Service Units (MSUs), Reproductive Health Service (RHS) A
Centers, Village Based family Planning (VBFP) Workers, health outlets of Health Departments
and Provincial Line Departments (PLDs) and Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs: Doctors,
Hakeems, Homeopath), information on population related issues and family planning (including
the availability of services at service outlets) was provided through IEC activities. The scheme
also provided logistic support. During the 8th Five Year Plan period, the emphasis of the program
remained on increasing the coverage of rural population from 5% to 70% and the coverage of
urban population from 54% to 1 00% and thus providing overall coverage to 80% of the
population whereas the 9th Five year plan provides for 100% coverage of population during the
period by strengthening the present service network, its expansion and through close coordination
with Departments of Health (DOH), Provincial Line Departments (PLDs), NGOs, Private Sector
Organizations etc. The services were made available in the rural areas (at community level) by
involving matriculated (10 years basic education) females (8 years, where matriculates were not
available) of the same community. Mobile service facilities were strengthened to cover the out
reach and to provide linkage with the VBFP Workers. The Family Welfare Centers (FWC)
facilitated the vicinities inhabited with low income groups/slum dwellers with satellite clinics at
least twice a week, around the F.W Centers.
7.    The promotional campaign was revamped during the period under review with necessary
training of IEC staff in the country and abroad. All channels of communication (including
out-door publicity and inter-personal communication) were undertaken and sustained throughout
the period. The IEC program was recast to focus on the recommendations of International
Conference on Population Development (ICPD). The promotional campaign is research based,
target and audience-oriented and issue-centered. The present strategy is focussing on advocacy
and Interpersonal Communication (IPC). The potential of the private sector has also been
harnessed to enrich the messages and utilize their expertise and specialization. The fresh campaign
was produced and launched covering the issues of population and resources, status of women,
health of mother and children, responsibility of father, breast feeding, value of girl child, concern
for environment etc through electronic and print media. Celebration of important events (like
World Population Day, Conferences, seminars, Walk-a-cause events etc.), were organized to
highlight the cause of the program. Religious scholars were associated through organized visits
abroad, followed by local seminars and press conferences.
8.    Population Welfare Program has been strengthened in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK)
and Northern Areas with support for their management setup, service delivery, training and
promotional activities. As a result, the service infrastructure in these areas has increased and
improved. It includes outlets of health department, reproductive health centers, family welfare
centers and village based family planning workers etc. Similarly, the outlets of 14 major Public
- 24 -



Sector Institutions have been supported to provide information and services to the workers
through their health infrastructure.
9.    Due recognition was given to the valuable role of NGOs in national development
generally, and in family planning programs specifically, under the Population Welfare Program
Project of the World Bank. Under the project an umbrella mechanism was provided which
allowed for sustained financial and technical support to key NGOs. This mechanism provided
some medium term continuous support to enable the population NGO sector to develop further.
The main objective of the project included expansion of service delivery, service coverage and
improvement of service quality, by enhancing service delivery, by increasing private sector and
non-government involvement. Another objective was to encourage community participation in
Population Welfare by providing grants to test, develop and support innovative approaches to
improving the quality and coverage of service delivery in the Population Welfare Sector with
focus, inter-alia, on involving communities and the non-profit institutions in such service delivery.
The IDA Credit for NGO sector was administered through NATPOW.
10.   NATPOW ensured delivery of reproductive health services (including family planning,
mother and child health care) through its 479 affiliated service outlets all over the country
(including Azad Kashmir and Northern Areas) to achieve the national demographic goals by
providing married couples of reproductive age, better access to family planning services by
expanding choices through NGO sector. NATPOW, through its affiliated 264 NGOs,
supplemented and complemented the Government in achieving its demographic goals by
providing the reproductive health services etc. in rural, slum and urban areas of the country.
These NGOs served an estimated Population of about 9 million. Of the 264 NGO Projects, 168
were provided financial and technical support under the World Bank project under report.
11.   NATPOW also complemented and supplemented governmental and national efforts in
lowering the growth rate and declining the fertility rates. In the last two years, the scope of NGOs
activities has expanded from providing family planning services to reproductive health services
and they have started to play a crucial role as grass root organizations in mobilizing community
resources and promoting participation by the people.
12.   NATPOW also made serious efforts for the institutional development of the NGOs by
organizing various training workshops. These included one five-day workshop on basic survey
and research methodology, two TOT workshops for doctors/Lady Health Visitors (LHVs), eleven
workshops for LHVs on counseling, infection prevention, reproductive health and service quality
assurance and fourteen workshops for NGO coordinators on financial management and report
writing, and in service training of NATPOW staff. Besides, the above training workshops,
NATPOW field officers/assistant field officers provided on-job training to the staff of NGOs in
their respective areas during quarterly visits. In addition, the NGOs staff was imparted training in
counseling, motivation, maintenance of client record, infection prevention and service equity
assurance. In addition to the above mentioned training activities, NATPOW organized two NGO
conventions at Karachi and Lahore. These conventions provided a forum to all the affiliated
NGOs to share their field experiences, exchange notes and highlight the problems faced by them.
It also helped in evolving future strategy.
-25 -



13.   Effective execution of the project was ensured through timely disbursement of grants to
NGOs, distribution of quality contraceptives through the Commodity Officer, NATPOW, at
Karachi, ensuring efficient delivery of clinical services through 479 service outlets all over the
country, training of LHVs, Motivators and Coordinators in proper upkeep of the service centers
in all respects, raising the number of clientele in the project areas through these centers, regular
monitoring and evaluation through the Field Offices, consequently the Contraceptive Prevalence
Rate (CPR) is reported to have increased in the project areas. Although the components of gender
equity, equality and women empowerment are not included in NATPOW's mandate, through its
264 NGOs and 479 service outlets, it covered almost 9.0 million population all over the country
and was able to raise the contraceptive prevalence rate significantly in all project areas from 6 to
16% and 25 to 53% over a period of just two years in rural and urban areas respectively.
14.   The Population Welfare Program Project (PWPP) of the World Bank also accorded high
priority to the action research and supported NIPS activities. NIPS undertook a number of studies
during 1995-99. The implementation of these studies was possible through IDA and other
partners credit and grants. These studies provided research-based support to the program for
improving its performance and achieving its objectives. The findings of the studies were utilized
for better policy formulation and monitoring various components of the Population Welfare
Program. Studies undertaken by NIPS during 1995-99 are listed below:
Pakistan Fertility and Family Planning Survey, 1996-97;
Static Health and Outlets Survey, 1996-97

C. An Evaluation of the performance of the Bank and other parallelfinanciers (UNFPA,
DFID, ADB)
15.   The overall objective of the IDA Population Welfare Program Project (Cr.2688-Pak) was
- 26 -



to provide financial investment to the government of Pakistan in the field of Population Welfare,
to help arrest the high rate of Population growth in the country. The Credit amount has been
utilized for various activities of the Population Welfare Program at federal and provincial level
and has eased the financial dearth to some extent.
16.   NIPS has expressed that the World Bank Population Project has been instrumental in
meeting a part of the financial need for the program. The support also included technical input and
independent assessment of the program. All these have been useful and relevant for execution of
program activities. The project contribution has thus been quite satisfactory. The project design
was generally acceptable and was based on the program needs, priorities and requirements. The
National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS) had very cordial relationship with all the
financiers in the past. The flow of funds committed for research activities by the World Bank,
ADB, ESCAP, and DFID were smooth and timely. However, UNFPA contribution for research
activities of NIPS has been negligible during the past thirteen years. A project entitled "Pakistan
Reproductive Health and Family Planning Survey", which the donor community and the Ministry
of Population had proposed NIPS to undertake during 1999-2000, has, however, been delayed
due to the indifferent attitude of the UNFPA, (which had agreed to be the financier of the
Project).
17. NATPOW have rated PWPP as very useful. The financial support provided by the World
Bank has been of great value to NATPOW since it helped the latter to carry out its activities in
the field of population welfare through NGOs at an expanded scale. The Bank's system of
releasing funds to NATPOW proved very helpful for timely provision of grants to NGOs. The
Bank had created a revolving fund of US$ 300,000/-with NATPOW which was constantly
replenished on submission of Withdrawal Applications. NATPOW did not face with any difficulty
in getting funds under the project. The World Bank staff was also found to be quite cooperative in
expanding guidance and advice as and when required.
D. Proposed arrangements for future operation of project activities after
its closing.
18.   The 9th Five Year Plan (1998-2003) has been built on the achievements of 8th Five Year
Plan (1993-98). The major shift in the program is the introduction of Reproductive Health
Package in accordance with our social setting and as approved by the Ministry of Population
Welfare. Male involvement in the program is being given special attention. The quality of services
is being improved through capacity building of the staff. Coordination and collaboration with the
Health Sector is being stepped up as envisaged in the Plan. Human resource development is being
emphasized. NGOs and Private Sector Organizations are treated as partners in the program.
Inter-personnel Communication and Community Involvement are being stressed. It is expected
that the demographic targets of the 9th Five Year Plan (1998-2003) shall be achieved by
implementing the program strategies, by the year 2003. The program has encountered certain
constraints some of which are mentioned below:
Frequent transfer of Provincial Secretaries
Mass retirement and aging of employees
- 27 -



Ban on recruitment during the period under report, resulting in large scale vacancies
Delayed, short/piecemeal releases of funds
Ban on purchase of vehicles
F. Remedial Measures in each Area with Recommendations to Ensure Better
Implementation.
19.   The remedial measures are given below:
Transfer of Accounts to Accountant General Pakistan Revenues (AGPR).
Regular flow of funds on yearly basis.
Lifting of ban on purchase of vehicles.
De-centralization of administrative powers.
Recruitment of officers/doctors against vacant posts.
Human Resource Development in the field of administration, finance, procurement and
technical issues related to implementation of ReproductiveHealth (RH) Package.
The VBFP Workers to be treated at par with Lady Health Workers (LHWs).
Better grade for recruitment of trained Theater Nurses at par with DOH
Close coordination among Departments/organizations providing Family
Planning and Health facilities.
20.   In the views of Program Wing, the experience brings into light the following lessons for
future:
(a) The technical assistance component reflected as a separate item has been a source of
constraint and was difficult for smooth implementation. It was not based on the needs of
the program and was not adequately visible or easily identifiable in the content of
approved PC-I of the Program which the project supported.
(b) There has been excessive emphasis in certain areas like decentralization of
administrative and financial powers. These have to flow out of basic principles, established
procedures and institutional set-up of the host country. The program was a federally
funded activity and all employees were federal government servants. As such, rules and
procedures for decentralization have to be seen within this context and
decentralization/delegation was only permissible as far as the law permits. This was not
appreciated adequately and easily agitated throughout the project implementation period,
inspite clear statement made on the subject.
(c) Since the project supported a social change program, it takes time for results to
emerge. The frequency of visits by supervisory missions was at too close interval to
provide time for implementation. The staff was mostly occupied to prepare for the Mission
instead of devoting more time to the work for implementation of the field activities.
Furthermore, and an important observation is that the existing monitoring system, service
statistics, review process and impact studies be used to gauge progress/achievement more
through annual reviews. This will not burden the system and staff for new information,
- 28 -



which entail fresh exercises that may not be necessary or are burdensome for the system
for a such vast program and its Management Information System (MIS).
21.   NATPOW have expressed their concern that on 31st December 1999, the support being
given to 264 NGOs having 479 service outlets dried up as World Bank's and UNFPA's projects
were terminated. This has dealt a service blow to the NGO sector and put a question mark on the
future of most of them. If they close their service outlets, unmet demands for family planning
services will definitely increase. The clients who were converted into users after continued
counseling/motivation for years, will be deprived of counseling/motivation and contraceptives and
may turn into non-users. This will ultimately affect the National Population Welfare Program and
will also have adverse impact on the economy of the country. Due to non-availability of financial
support, the activities of most of the beneficiary NGOs have come to a standstill, as there still
remains a long way to go for them to reach the stage of sustainability. However, will they be
helped in future remains an unanswered question. NATPOW's hope is that some way will be
found to answer this question in the affirmative.

five are regular Training Centers are functional in the Province. These Centers have improved
their performance from 22% (1996-97) to 90% (1998-99). Extension Service Camps have been
conducted by the Medical Officers of these centers in coordination with the Department of
Health. Training has been imparted to the Medical Officers of Department of Health,
NGOs/Private Sector Organizations in contraceptive technology including Non Scalpel
Vasectomy for effective involvement of males in Reproductive Health. Vasectomy Centers have
been established at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore, RGH Rawalpindi and DHQ Hospital,
Faisalabad. The Medical Officers posted at the said Vasectomy Centers provide services through
static clinics and extension service camps in different districts. on demand. They also impart
training to Medical Officers of DOH, NGOs and other in No-Scalpel Technique of vasectomy.
The RHS A Centers have been strengthened with the provision of medicines, equipment, furniture
and trained Medical Officers and staff.
3. RHS B Center: The RHS B Centers, generally established at selected T'ehsil H eadquarter
hospitals could not function properly due to non-availability of female doctors/paramedics at the
said hospital. Technical training of Medical Officers, flow of funds and poor referral of cases are
the other causes of low performance.
4. FW Centers: The Family Welfare Centers, the core component of Population Welfare Program,
have been equipped with trained paramedics and other staff members. These service outlets have
been strengthened with equipment, medicines and furniture and housed in rented buildings. The
staff has undergone Refresher Training Courses for the provision of quality services to the clients.
The in charge of these centers conducted satellite camps in the areas inhabited with low income
groups/the poor, around the respective FWCs to make services accessible
to the public. The performance of F.W. Centers remained up to the mark during the period under
report.
5. Mobile Services Units (MSUs): The performnance of MSUs is improving gradually. The
non-availability of staff due to ban on recruitment and complicated procedure for promotions
hindered the performance of these units. No vehicle could be purchased during the 8th Five year
plan period and during 9th plan period (up to December, 1999) due to ban on purchase of
vehicles. This state of affairs has created travel barriers to cover the outreach rural areas.
Adjustments have been made on the available transport fleet to pull on with field jobs. Hlowever,
MoPW has been approached to resolve this issue.
6. Village Based Family Planning Workers: Drop out rate in the category of VBFP Workers
remained a point of concern. Now, their Salary/Retainer Fee has been enhanced. The pricing of
contraceptives and the like issues and service conditions as compared with LHWs, better jobs
- 30 -



have been considered the reasons for drop out rate. The drop out rate will be reduced as and
when this category shall be treated at par with LHWs, in terms and conditions of contract/service.
7. Training, Trainers and VBFPWs Supervisors. 113 Training Centers for VBFPWs are
functioning in the Province. 240 Supervisors (Female) are in position against the sanctioned
strength of 240 whereas 106 Trainers are in position against the sanctioned strength of 113.
8. Hakims & Homoeopaths: The number of Hakims & Homoeopaths has been proposed to be
increased in the plan but the achievement of these categories in terms of birth aversions/users
indicate the amount of interest and work these categories are putting in to check the growth rate.
The department has no official control on them but persuasion and training (which is on going
with the hopes of improved achievement) could bring the desired result.
9. Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) The component of TBAs could not achieve even modest
results and the nmain reason remained late payment of Retainer Fee and other incentives due to
travel barriers interrupted flow of funds etc. The TBA project was discontinued after 1997-98.
10. Monitoring and Supervision: Lady Doctors have been posted as Deputy District Population
Welfare Officers (Technical) to play the important role of technical supervision and on the job
training of technical staff in addition to the Deputy Directors (Technical) at the divisional level.
These doctors, trained in contraceptive surgery also extend help to the Medical Officers RHS-A
Centers during static/extension service camps, when needed. Monitoring of absenteeism is
perforned through visits especially at district and divisional level and these visits are followed up
by disciplinary actions. Monitoring teams from the Provincial Headquarters Office visit district
offices and field establishments regularly. Teams from different directorates/organizations also
conduct monitoring visits. The performance of different program components has also been
reviewed through MIS and review meetings at district and provincial level on monthly basis. The
MoPW reviewed the program activities, performance etc during inter-Provincial meetings on
quaiterly basis.
11. ]Linkage with DOH: The Departments of Health and Population Welfare are working in close
coordination for provision of quality family planning services. Joint Contraceptive Surgery and
IUD camps are held especially in rural areas. The Provincial Coordination Committee of both the
Departments has been constituted/notified and the committee met for the first time on
27.12.1999. The Committee will monitor the implementation of RH Package in service outlets of
bot h the Departments and those of NGOs. It will also resole issues for smooth working of RH
Project. The Committee will help to strengthen the District Technical Committees and shall
supervise their working in the light of new TORs. The Population Welfare Program made
significant progress during the 8th Five Year Plan period (1993-98). The coverage of population
was increased to 70%. All the envisaged service infrastructure was brought on the ground. The
awareness about the program increased to almost 94%, CPR increased to 25.6% and the TFR
reduced to 5.1 and the population growth rate registered a downwards trend (2.4% per annum).
The results of the census (1998) indicate that a turning point towards success of the program has
conie and the following indicators confirm the evidence of change:
- 31 -



(a) Increased demand for family planning
(b) Improved availability of family planning services
