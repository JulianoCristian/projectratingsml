The\n            sustained fiscal crisis in Pakistan after the first one to\n            two years of the project implementation constrained the\n            government's capacity to finance its share of the\n            overall program as agreed at the appraisal. A number of\n            important lessons have been learned through this project. 1)\n            Moving to a reproductive health approach can be helpful with\n            integration of services. 2) It is difficult to have\n            administrative decentralization in the presence of a\n            centralized funding mechanism. 3) The deployment of women as\n            trainers and supervisors greatly facilitates the recruitment\n            of female outreach workers. 4) Relying on the procurement of\n            technical assistance for institutional capacity development\n            is a risky strategy. 5) The experience with procurement\n            points to the critical importance of having an overall\n            detailed procurement plan before implementation starts. 6)\n            It is necessary to have a detailed appraisal of the\n            financial management system to be carried out at inception,\n            and for minimum improvements to be required and implemented\n            prior to approval of the project."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
