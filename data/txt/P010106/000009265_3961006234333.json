The Bank, in\n            consultation with the Government of Pakistan, also decided\n            to withdraw the loan before the signature of the legal\n            documents. Therefore, the project is not rated and no audit\n            is planned. A year later, the Fauji trust succeeded in\n            finding a new partner (a Danish company) and a new project\n            was presented to the Executive Directors in September 1978\n            for which the Board approved a credit of US$55 million. This\n            new project was audited May 1986. The reason for the\n            Bank's decision not to proceed with the proposed Loan\n            was that the foreign sponsor, an agro-chemical company in\n            the United States, withdrew from the project following a\n            Corporate decision to reduce its activities in Pakistan due\n            to the political situation that prevailed there at the time.\n            Although, the original project was never started and permits\n            no major lessons, the restructured project, with the same\n            objective and design, was completed satisfactorily and\n            evaluated by the Fauji, and the Bank's Operation\n            Evaluation Department after the closing of the Credit."}, "docdt": "1994-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
