INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPiENT
REPORT AND RECOlvDiiENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN FOR ELECTRIC POWdER EXPANSION (FIFTH POW<ER PROJECT)
TO ENIPRESA NAGIONAL DE ELECTRICIDAD S.A. AND CORPORACION DE
FOliENTO DE LA PRODUCCION IN THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
1.      I submit the following report and reconmendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$60.0 million to Empresa
Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDESA) and Corporacion de Fomento de la
Produccion (CORFO) to finance the foreign exchange cost of ENDESA's fifth
power project.
PART I: HISTORICAL
2.      The proposed loan would be the fifth loan to ENDESA to assist in the
financing of its power expansion program. ENDESA was formed as a joint
stock company in 1944 to plan electric power development in Chile and to
provide facilities for meeting power requirements which could not be provided
by other companies. Most of its stock is owned by CORFO, a Government Cor-
poration established in 1939 to carry out the Government's development
policies. Because of the requirements of Chilean legislation, all four pre-
vious loans to ENDESA for power development were made jointly to ENDESA and
CORFO as co-borrowers.
3.      The first of these loans, and the Bank's first development loan, in
an amount of US$13.5 million was made in 1948 to finance an early stage of
ENDESA's program of power development which included the installation of
81.4 MW of hydroelectric generating capacity and related facilities. The
plants have all been in operation since 1955. Principal repayments to date
total US$11,323,000 and the entire loan is scheduled to be repaid by July 1,
1968.
4.      On November 1, 1956 the Bank made the second loan, equivalent to
US$15 million for the expansion of ENDESA's hydroelectric generating capacity
by 166 MW in three hydroelectric plants and transmission facilities.   All
these plants have been in operation since 1962. Principal repayments to date
amount to US$4,510,000 and the entire loan is scheduled to be repaid by
October 15, 1976.



5.      The third loan, and heretofore the largest loan in Chile, amount-
ing to US$32.5 million equivalent, was made in December 1959 to assist in the
financing of the construction of the 280 14W Rapel hydroelectric power plant
and the 16 14W Huasco Steam Plant. The Huasco project came into operation in
1965. Completion of the Rapel project has been considerably delayed by the
severe earthquake of 1960, by repeated floods, landslides, poor rock con-
ditions, and by prolonged strikes. It should be completed early in 1968.
In view of the fact that the events leading to the substantial delay in the
completion of the Rapel plant were largely beyond the control of ENDESA,
the Executive Directors in June 1965 approved my recommendation to postpone
the Closing Date of the Loan by three years, to June 30, 1968, and to re-
schedule the maturities of the Loan in such a way as to give ENDESA a new
period of grace on the amortization payments corresponding to the new com-
pletion date of the Rapel project. Principal repayments to date armount to
US$1,100,000 and the entire loan is to be repaid by April 15, 1985, as
originally agreed.
6.      In January 1965, the Bank extended a fourth loan to ENDESA in an
amount of US$4.4 million equivalent to assist in the financing of an interim
program consisting of several small poaer plant extensions as well as trans-
mission and distribution facilities.  The project is proceeding on schedule.
and should be completed by 1968. Principal repayments will begin on April 15,
1968, and end on April 15, 1985.
7.      Negotiations of the proposed loan took place in Washington in the
week of November 21, 1966.  ENDESA was represented by iv-. Renato Salazar,
General Manager, Enrique Mardones, Financial Manager, and Jorge Bascur,
ENDESA's New York representative. Mlr. Enrique Vial, Director of CORFO's
New York Office, represented CORFO, and Hr. Jorge Burr, Minister Counselor
of the Chilean Embassy, the Government.
8.      The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
to Chile as of November 30, 1966:

9.      Of the above loans delays in disbursement have been experienced
with the following:
i) Loans 171-CH and 172-CH: The reasons for the delays were
explained in detail to the Executive Directors on June 5,
1964 on the occasion of the presentation of the Supplemental
Loan Agreement with the merged Lota-Schwager Coal Company.
ii)  Loan 2h4-CH: For the reasons outlined in paragraph 5 above.



- 4 -
iii)  Loan 287-GH: Disbursements under this loan were suspended
by mutual agreemient in early 1963 pending the formulation
of a Master Maintenance Program. This program was finally
submitted by September 1965 and disbursements were resumed
shortly thereafter. All orders under the project have been
placed and the loan should be fully utilized by the present
Closing Date, December 31, 1966.
iv) Credit 4-CH: The Executive Directors were informed on April
21, 1964 about the difficulties which hampered the progress
of this project. Since disbursements under this Credit were
resumed in April 1964, the execution of the project has pro-
gressed satisfactorily and completion is expected by the
Closing Date of December 31, 1967.
v)  Loan 366-CH: The loan became effective in July 1964 but
disbursements have been delayed on account of several
factors, principally lack of proper organization of the
project, the credit policies applied under the project and
inadequate disbursement procedures. Agreement has been
reached with CORFO concerning appropriate and necessary
changes in the administration and operation of the project.
A mission is now in Chile reviewing the progress made and
assessing the prospects for completion of the project. I
expect to make recommendations to the Executive Directors
shortly about the future disposition of the loan as soon as
the mission's conclusions have been formulated.
vi) Loan 367-CH: An account of the delays in disbursements of
the loan, together with recommendations concerning the ex-
tension of Closing Date by two years to December 31, 1968
and partial cancellation of the Loan were submitted to the
Executive Directors on November 2, 1966 and December 7,
1966 respectively.
10.     Apart from the proposed loan, no loans are expected to be
presented to the Executive Directors for approval in the near future.
PART II: DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
11.     The proposed loan would have the following characteristics:
Borrowers:                      Empresa Nacional de Electricidad
S.A. and Corporacion de Fomento
de la Produccion.
Guarantor:                      Republic of Chile
Amount:                         The equivalent in various curren-
cies of US$60 million.



Purposet                        To finance the foreign exchange
cost of a 400 14W hydroelectric
power plant (E1 Toro) and related
works, transmission and distribu-
tion facilities, and of consultants'
services.
Amortization:                   30 years (including 7 years of
grace); Payment dates January 1
and July 1; 47 semi-annual repay-
ments beginning on January 1, 1974
and ending on January 1, 1997.
Interest Rate:                  6% per annum.
Commitment Charge:              3/8 of 1% per annum.
PART III:  THE PROJECT
12.     An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Fifth Power Project
Empresa Nacional de Electricidad, S.A. (ENDESA), Chile" (TO-564a) on the
proposed project is attached.
13.     Chilets power demand is concentrated in the central region of the
country where 91% of the population resides and 96% of the energy is
generated. Responsibility for the generation of power for public service
is concentrated in ENDESA which supplies power in bulk to private or mixed
companies or entities, some of which are ENDESA's own subsidiaries, and
which distribute power at various locations throughout the country. At
the end of 1965, the country had a total of over 1,400 MW of generating
capacity of which ENDESA accounted for nearly 550 MW, other utility
companies, principally Compania Chilena de Electricidad (CCE), a sub-
sidiary of American Foreign Power, for about 340 DUJ and captive plants
in mines and industry for 540 MW. The proposed purchase of CCE by the
Government for which Congressional approval is expected in 1967 would
substantially change the character of the power sector and alter ENDESA's
function since practically the entire future responsibility for the ex-
pansion of generating facilities for public service will fall on ENDESA.
14.     The proposed project constitutes part of ENDESA's overall expansion
program for the period 1966-1972 designed to provide the additional genera-
ting, transmission and distribution capacity required to meet expected
systema load increases. Its main elements are:
a) The construction of the El Toro hydroelectric scheme, located
at Lake Laja, about 300 miles South of Santiago, with an
installed capacity of 400 MW, including civil works for the
Alto Polcura Division to increase the flow of water into
Lake Laja, and modifications at the existing Abanico hydro-
electric plant.



- 6 -
b)  The addition of equipment associated with the fifth 70 MW
generating unit in the Rapel hydroelectric plant.
c) The construction of a trunk double circuit 220 KV transmission
system of about 700 KM to interconnect Santiago with the El
Toro plant and the Bocamina thermal plant near Concepcion.
d)  Other transmission and distribution system expansion, including
substations, to meet requirements in various parts of the
country.
e) Procurement of electrical and other equipment and supplies,
which are not available in Cnile, for ENDESA's new office
building.
f) Provision of consulting services for various aspects of the
project and for studies related to ENDESA's future expansion
of the power system.
15.     ENDESA's program, in addition to the project, includes the completion
of the Rapel hydroelectric scheme with an installed capacity of 350 eNW
(Loan 244-CH); the completion of small generating plant additions and dis-
tribution expansion (Loan 402-CH); the construction of the Bocamina thermal
electric plant with an installed capacity of 125 M4W; the expansion of
transmission and distribution facilities; the construction of small genera-
ting plants to supply isolated areas; and the commencement of construction
of other generating plants to be in service after 1972.
16.     Expenditures on the entire program during the period 1966-72 are
estimated at US$534 million equivalent, of which US$146 million would be
the foreign exchange component. The total cost of the project would amount
to about US$186 million of which the Bank loan would finance the foreign
exchange cost amounting to US$60 million. The additional funds required
for the completion of the project would come from ENDESA's own resources
and from equity contributions by CORFO which has agreed to meet any short-
falls in funds to complete the project.
17.     ENDESA's financial situation has substantially improved during the
two years since the last loan was made. In presenting the Interim Power
Loan to the Executive Directors in January 1965, I pointed out that sub-
stantial progress in improving ENDESA's return on investment would be a
prerequisite for the consideration of any further Bank loans for ENDESA.
This position reflected the fact that since 1959 ENDESA's rate of return
had declined to 2.3% in 1962/63 due to the severe inflation in the country
and the authorities' failure to grant fully and promptly the rate increases
ENDESA requested and to which it was entitled under the country's Electricity
Law. Since 1964, however, the administrative process of adjusting tariffs
to reflect inflationary cost rises has been greatly improved and, with the
substantial rate increases it has been allowed, ENDESA has been able to
offset these cost increases and to achieve a rate of return of 7.7% in



- 7 -
1965/66. With t;ie commitments made by the Borrowers and the Government
in connection wiah the proposed loan to adjust tariffs promptly in the
future in line with the provisions of the Electricity Law, EIDESA is ex-
pected to have a 9.3% rate of return by 1972.
18.     The Bank's procurement procedures will be followed by ENDESA for
the purchase of all goods and services to be financed under the proposed
loan.
PART VI:  LEGAL INSTRUPNTS AND AUTHORITY
19.     The Draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and ENDESA and CORFO
(referred to in the documents as "Fomento"), the Draft Guarantee Agreement
between the Republic of Chile and the Bank and the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
20.     These draft Agreements are in the usual form.   The draft Guarantee
Agreement is similar to previous Guarantee Agreements between the Republic
of Chile and the Bank, with the exception indicated below. The draft Loan
Agreement is similar to the earlier agreements between the Bank and ENDESA
and CORFO, with certain modifications in line with present Bank practice,
and with the exception of the provisions indicated below:
a) Section 5.12 of the Loan Agreement requires ENDESA to make
such adjustments in its tariffs as will provide revenues
sufficient to cover all operating costs and to produce a
reasonable return on its revalued net fixed assets in opera-
tion, and that the Borrowers shall promptly inform the Bank
of any proposal to amend any provision of the Electricity
Law concerning electric power tariffs. Under Section 3.03
of the Guarantee Agreement, the Guarantor undertakes to take
the necessary action to enable the Borrower to comply.
b) Section 5.o4 of the Loan Agreement provides that ENDESA may
incur additional debt as defined without the reference to
the Bank required under prior agreements so long as its
earnings cover maximum future debt service 1.5 times (as
these terms are defined in the Section).
PART V: THE ECONO1MY
21.     An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Chile" (No. WH-165b), in four volumes, dated August 22, 1966, was cir-
culated to the Executive Directors on August 30, 1966. Since then there
have been no significant developments which would change the main conclus-
ions of the report.



- 8 -
22.     In presenting the last loan for vocational training in Chile to
the Executive Directors in October 1965, it was pointed out that any further
lending to Chile would depend on the conclusion of arrangements for the
implementation of the copper agreements, and a satisfactory appraisal of
the new Government's economic performance and prospects for future progress
and sustained growth. In March 1966 the Chilean Congress approved the
legislation for the implementation of the copper agreements, the first of
which was signed last October. As the economic report further indicates,
the Government has succeeded in slowing down the rate of inflation, es-
tablished a more flexible and realistic exchange rate, introduced necessary
tax reforms and has implemented agricultural policies designed to stimulate
investment and output in this important sector of the economy. In accordance
with the agreement which Chile reached in February 1965 with its major
creditor countries on the rescheduling of part of its external debt, the
Government substantially reduced the use of suppliers' credits during the
past two years. Although the agreement was limited to 1965 and 1966, the
Government intends to maintain strict controls on suppliers' credits in
the future.
23.     While we do not yet know the details of the Government's program
for 1967, its broad intentions with respect to fiscal, investment, monetary
and incomes policies appear consistent with the objectives of arresting the
growing trend of Government expenditures, improving the quality of public
investment, achieving further progress toward internal financial stability
and stepping up the rate of economic growth.
24.     The prospect of high copper prices in the short run and the massive
longer run increase in copper production called for in the copper agreements,
make the balance of payments outlook appear stronger than it has for many
years. If the Government continues to make progress in its stabilization
efforts and follows appropriate fiscal and investment policies in the future,
it would be justified to continue external assistance on a substantial scale
to supplement domestic savings during the next years. Chile should be able
to obtain the external finance it requires and still reduce the presently
heavy debt service burden with continued careful control in the use of sup-
plier credits and intensive efforts in preparing suitable projects which
could be financed on a long term basis.
PART VI: COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
25.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII: RECOMMENDATION
26.     I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:



- 9 -
