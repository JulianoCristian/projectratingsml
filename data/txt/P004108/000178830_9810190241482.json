forecast through the 1980s and address system\n            inefficiencies in coal and cement distribution.\n            Specifically, the project will: increase capacity in: (i)\n            specialized intermodal freight terminals for coal and\n            cement; (ii) railways and port infrastructure at Incheon and\n            Ulsan; and (iii) specialized cars for coal and cement\n            transport; and correct system inefficiencies by: (i)\n            introducing policy measures regarding transport pricing of\n            coal and of bulk and bagged cement; (ii) making operational\n            improvements in train operations and locomotive utilization;\n            (iii) making operational improvements in the two project\n            coal ports; and (iv) undertaking studies, technical\n            assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
