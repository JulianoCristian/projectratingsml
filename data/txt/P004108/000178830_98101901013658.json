Project\n            will provide the necessary capacity in rail, ports and\n            inland terminals to handle efficiently the coal and cement\n            traffic forecast through the 1980s and address system\n            inefficiencies in coal and cement distribution.\n            Specifically, the project will: increase capacity in: (i)\n            specialized intermodal freight terminals for coal and\n            cement; (ii) railways and port infrastructure at Incheon and\n            Ulsan; and (iii) specialized cars for coal and cement\n            transport; and correct system inefficiencies by: (i)\n            introducing policy measures regarding transport pricing of\n            coal and of bulk and bagged cement; (ii) making operational\n            improvements in train operations and locomotive utilization;\n            (iii) making operational improvements in the two project\n            coal ports; and (iv) undertaking studies, technical\n
