Overall World Bank\n            performance was satisfactory: supervision was very closely\n            coordinated with the co-financiers, who were enabled to\n            solve emerging problems and at the same time, remain firm on\n            critical issues. Overall Borrower performance was marginally\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included the following:\n            Cooperatively planned and implemented projects based on\n            mutual trust between the Bank and the borrower can change\n            the way the cooperating parties think about environment and\n            development issues. The stronger the commitment at various\n            levels within the Borrower country, the Bank, and the\n            donors/co-financiers, the better the result. This project\n            reconfirmed the findings of earlier completed projects that\n            it is important to ensure continuity of the task\n            managers/task team leaders and the composition of the task\n            teams. The project also reconfirmed that transforming an\n            existing water and wastewater utility developed in a\n            centrally planned economy into an efficiently managed\n            self-sustaining entity, and introducing modern corporate\n            management ideas are much more challenging tasks than\n            physical implementation of the project. In similar projects,\n            special emphasis should be placed on institutional capacity building."}, "docdt": "2001-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
