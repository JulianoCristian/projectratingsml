The project's objectives\n            are the following: 1) reduction of various pollutant loads\n            from the Siauliai area into the Upper Lielupe River Basin,\n            thus decreasing the transboundary pollution into the river\n            and the Gulf of Riga; 2) improvement of the quality,\n            reliability and cost efficiency of water supply and\n            wastewater services in Siauliai; 3) assist in establishing\n            financially sustainable provision of municipal services; and\n            4) improvement of the regional and local environmental\n            quality monitoring and enforcement system in the Upper\n            Lielupe River Basin. The project consists of two\n            complementary components: 1) water and wastewater\n            improvement component, which includes support for\n            rehabilitation, upgrading, and expansion of the water and\n            wastewater system, and which comprises three key activities:\n            a) water supply and distribution; b) wastewater collection\n            and treatment; and c) technical assistance and training; and\n            2) environmental management component consisting of the\n            following four activities: a) direct support for the\n            Lithuanian side of the Lielupe River Basin Commission; b)\n            regional environmental monitoring and water quality\n            laboratory system; c) small point source pollution control;\n            and d) non-point source pollution control."}, "docdt": "1995-11-09T00:00:00Z"}
