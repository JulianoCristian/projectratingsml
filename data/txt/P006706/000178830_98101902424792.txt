ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO E2PRESAS PUBLICAS DE MEDELLIN
COLOMBIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a pro-
posed loan of an amount in various currencies equivalent to $15 millinn
to Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM) to finance the foreign exchange
cost of the first stage of the Nare hydroelectric projecto
PART I: HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has made two loans totalling $34 million for hydw.-
electric power development in the iedellin area.   The first loan of $12
million (225 CO) made in May 1959 helped to finance the instalJation of
96 mw of new generating capacity on the Ouadalupe River plus related ,
facilities. A total of 50 mw; was installed in the second half of 1962,
and the last 16 mw will be installed in mid-1964.
3.        The second loan of $22 million (282 CO) made in May 1961 helped
to finance the installation of an additional 138 mw of generating capa-
city on the Guadalupe River plus related facilities. All four units
are expected to be installed by the end of 1965.
4e        The next step of EPM's power program is the first stage of the
Ware River development. This project has been studied since early 1961.
The formal loan request was made in March 1963 and the project was re-
viewed in the field in June 1963. Formal negotiations for a loan began
in Washington on December 11, 1963.   The Colombian Government was repre-
sented by Dr. Luis Fernando Echavarria, Minister Counselor of the Colombian
Embassy and the Borrower by Dr. Alejandro Uribe Escobar, General Manager;
Dr. Hernan Puerta Perez, Board Iiember; and Mr. John Arango, Financial
Director of EPM.
5.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's 25th in Colombia.   It
would increase the total of Bank loans to Colombia from $343.9 million
to $388.9 million net of cancellations. The status of previous Bank
loans may be briefly summarized as follows:

relate to loans made since 1960 for which disbursements are about
on schedule. The remaining $32 million relate principally to the
following three loans on which there have been delays of more than
a few months :
Loan 225 CO (Roads) primarily because of poor organization of the
Ministry of Public Works;
Loan 282 CO (Empresas Publicas de Mledellin), due mainly to unex-
pected difficulties encountered during construction; and
Loan 255 CO (CVC & CHIDRAL), due in part to a long strike against
the main contractor.



6.        IDA has made one credit of $19.5 million to Colombia for the
National Highway Program jointly with a Bank loan (295 CO) for the same
project. As in the case of the Bank loan for highways, disbursements
on the credit have been slow ($6.3 million, as of December 31, 1963).
7.        A Bank Mission has recently been in Colombia to update bir
economic report and review the status of Colombia's investment programn
Although the report of the Plission has not yet been completed, its
major findings are the basis for the economic conclusions set forth
below (para. 19 - 27). No other projects are likely to be ready for con-
sideration before the findings of the Milssion have been presented to the
Executive Directors.
PART II: DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
8.        The main features of the proposed loan are as follows:
Borrower:           Empresas Publicas de M4edellin (EPM), an Xatonomous
agency with four independent departments providing
power, water, telephone and sewerage services to
the Nledellin area.
Guarantor:          Republic of Colombia
Amount:              The equivalent in various currencies of $15 million.
Purpose:            To finance the foreign exchange cost of the first
stage of the Nare Hydroelectric Power Project.
Interest Rate:      51 per annum.
Commitment Charge:  3/4 of 1% per annum.
Term and
Amortization:       35 years, including 5 years of grace.   Semi-annual
installments from April 15, 1969 to April 15, 1999.
PART III: APPRAISAL OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
9.        A detailed appraisal of the project is attached (No. 1).
Project Description
10.       The Ware I project comprises the civil works of a hydroelec-
tric plant designed for four 66 mw units and the installation of the
first two units and related transmission and distribution facilities.
The third and fourth units are not part of the project and would be in-
stalled later as needed. The site can be further developed to provide
for the installation of an additional four or five 66 mw units when such
an expansion is justified.



-a -
Justification of the Project
11.       The main part of EPM's service area is the city of Medellin
which is one of the fast growing industrial centers in Colombia, with an
annual population growth of 6.2% in recent years. Population growth and
industrial development are expected to continue at hiigh rates, and will
raise the demand for EPM's power. Additional increases in demand are
also likely to come from the progressive extension of the area served by
EPM's distribution network and from the interconnection of that network
with those of the other two main power companies in Colombia. The fare
I project is needed to assure that the growing demand can be satisfied.
12.       The proposed project is the best of four alternative hydro-
electric developments which were investigated. The proposed project was
also compared with alternatives substituting hydroelectric capacity par-
tially or totally by steam capacity. These studies showed that the in-
cremental annual return on the additional investment needed for the Nare
project, as compared with the next best steam alternative, is about 12%.
With a return of this order of magnitude, the Nare project is unques-
tionably the best which could be selected at the present time to satisfy
the needs of the EPM service area.
13.       Bank loans of about $145 million have helped finance power pro-
jects in Bogota, Cali and Medellin, the three largest cities with the
three main power systems in Colombia. In the past the systems have ex-
paiided individually, with local power resources being used for local
markets. However, in view of the size to which the three systems have
grown by now, it has become imperative to study the advantages of inter-
connection between them. This study is advanced enough by now to indi-
cate that the Nare I project is justified whether the interconnection is
realized or not, and that it would be well suited to meet the needs of
the proposed interconnected system which is expected to be realized
within the next four years.
Borrower
14.       The EPM is an autonomous enterprise established in 1955 by the
city of Medellin. Its Board of Directors consists of the Mayor of Nledellin,
Chairman, two members selected by and from the City Council, and four mem-
bers appointed by the lMayor from names suggested by the Central Bank and,
various private organizations. EPM has four departments: electric power,
water, telephone and sewage. The enterprise has a record of good manage-
ment. All of EPM's departments are profitable. The water department of
EPM has received a loan from IDB for financing its program and the sewage
department is expecting a loan from the USAID. As stipulated in the exis-
ting Loan Agreements and in the proposed one (Section 6.02) revenues or
assets of the Power Department shall not be used to meet obligations of
any other department.



- 5
Financing Arrangements
15,       The rate of return on assets in operation in the Power Depart-
ment is in the neighborhood of 20% (except in years when new big invest-
ments are put into service). Power rates have been raised three times
since 1958, the last being an increase of about 70% in April 1963. Des-
pite these increases EPM is presently experiencing a cash shortage which
is likely to last for the next two years.  It stems primarily from EPH's
large investment needs and from the fact that a sizeable portion of the
April 1963 rate increase was nullified by the rapid price rise in Colombia
followsing the devaluation of the peso in late 1962. EPM expects to be
able to make another rate increase of 25% in 1965; with such increase
EPM is likely to be financing more than 40% of its investment expendi-
tures during 196h-68 from cash generated internally.
To help meet the present temporary cash shortage, EPM has ob-
tained a credit of Ps.6 million from USAID and a line of credit of Ps.20
million from Corporacion Financiera Nacional (CFN) of Nedellin.  It is
expected that the line of credit from CFN will not be used if negotia-
tions now under way between EPM and USAID are successfully completed
next year for an additional credit of Ps.15 million.
Procurement
17.       EP14, with the assistance of its consultant, is awarding con-
tracts for equipment and civil engineering works on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. A $4 million contract for initial civil
works has already been placed with an American-Canadian contractor. In-
ternational competitive bidding will be the basis for awarding all other
important contracts.
Economic Situation
184       Colombiats economic situation was last reviewed in the report
"Current Economic Position and Prospects of Colombia", (WH-126a) which
was distributed on June 18, 1963. The report paid special attention to
the credit, fiscal and foreign exchange measures which the Government
took in late 1962 in order to lay the financial basis for its develop-
ment program.
12.       The Colombian economy continued to expand in 1963; gross pro-
duct increased by 4U last year and 5% per annum in 1961 and 1962. The
increase was especially marked in manufacturing production but there was
some slowdonm in agricultural production.  The Valencia Government, in
office since August 1962, has maintained a favorable climate for private
investment. Investment was encouraged through the operations of the
Private Investment Fund. Increasing capital expenditures are being
undertaken by petroleum companies.



- 6-
2 z        In the public sector the Government established overall finan-
cial balance in 1963. Through a substantial increase in revenues --
about 45% in current terms or 20-25t in real terms -- and by severely
restricting investment expenditures, the National Government was able
to avoid Central Bank support of the budget; in the previous two years
the Central Bank financing of the budget amounted to more than 900 mil-
lion pesos. Public enterprises were permitted to follow flexible price
and tariff policies and were, on the whole, in a relatively strong posi-
tion to carry out their own investment plans.
21.        The Colombian balance of payments continues to be under pressure.
Receipts from exports other than coffee have not increased as rapidly as
had been expected in the development plan. At the same time, demand for
imports has been strong as a result of rising incomes and a relatively
high rate of investment. The foreign exchange problem has been aggravated
by an outflow of private capital. The balance of payments deficit has
been financed mainly by drawingscn the IM' and US loans in support of the
development plan. Gross foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank were
about $106 million at the end of 1963.
22.        The effectiveness of the November 1962 exchange rate adjust-
ment in restraining imports was largely offset by price advances in the
course of 1963. The Government is continuing to restrict imports withiin -
the limits of available foreign exchange resources through direct controls,
giving top priority to raw materials and intermediate products and lower
priority to capital goods.
23.        This year the Government intends to maintain the balance in
public finances which it achieved in 1963. Through strict tax adminis-
tration public revenue is likely to grow apace with the increase in
money income. Some addition to revenue will result from new taxes in-
troduced under special authority in late 1963. Public investment financed
by the National Government will continue to be restricted, particularly
in the social sector. The Government has thus far been successful in
avoiding another round of wage increases, but whether it i1ll be suecess-
ful in stabilizing domestic prices will largely depend on a reduction in
the pace of private credit expansion which has been rather large in
recent months. Export earnings are expected to increase in 196h, partly
as a result of the recent strengthening of coffee prices; foreign ex-
change resources will also be strengthened by rising disbursements of ex-
ternal credits. However, there will be a continued need to maintain
rather strict direct controls to keep import demand within available re-
sources.
2Lb        By concentrating expenditures on projects of high development
priority, the Government has been providing a strong foundation for a
further growth of the Colombian economy. Growth prospects are enhanced
by a favorable resource base, a relatively high level of domestic savings
and a favorable private investment climate. With the rapid growth of
manufacturing industry and large-scale commercial agriculture, Colombia



- 7 -
is becoming more diversified and should be able to increase gradually
its exports. Prospects for continued growth are favorable, although
export growth is likely to lag behind overall economic growth.
25.        Since the Bank convened the first meeting of a Consultative
Group in January 1963, Colombia has received about $160 million in ex-
ternal credits for high priority projects. The Government is restricting
external borrowing to high priority projects within its development program.
Such projects are estimated to require about $180 million per annum in
new external credits during 1964 and 1965.
26.        Colombia's external debt is estimated at about $700 million,
of which $137 million is scheduled to be repaid in 1964 and 1965 (parti-
cularly privately placed and Export-Import Bank credits). [See tables-
1 and 2 attached;7 Total external debt service amounts to $100 million,
or about 16% of estimated export earnings in 1964. Service on existing
debt declines rapidly after 1965, fialing to $46 million, or 5% of export
earnings in 1969 when the first amortization payment on the proposed loan
falls due. However, in view of the relatively large external credit re-
quirements of Colombiats development program, it is likely that for some
years to come external debt service will not decline but remain at the
present rather high level. On the basis of the favorable outlook for
growth and its sound record of overall financial and external credit manage-
ment, Colombia continues to be creditworthy for additional external credits,
including the proposed loan. In view of the relatively sluggish export
outlook it is desirable that part of the new external credits be extended
on very long terms.
PART IV: LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND LEGAL AUTHORITY
27.        A draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and EPM (No. 2) and a
draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and the Bank
(No. 3) are attached.
28.        The draft Guarantee Agreement is in the usual form.
29.        The draft Loan Agreement follows closely the previous Loan
Agreement with EPM. Provisions of special interest are:
(a)  Covenants F e.g. Sections 5.07(c); 5.10; 5.11; and
6.02_7 designed to protect the Power Department
against possible claims arising from debts incurred
by other Departments of the Empresa and to assure
that the operations and accounts of each department
are separately maintained;
(b) Section 5.11 containing a rate covenant which is anplified
in a letter (No. 4).



-8-
30.       The report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section h(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank is attached
(No. 5).
Part V: COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGRBEEMENT
31.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Banke
PART VI: RECOTIMENDATIONS
32.       I recommend that the Bank make a loan to Empresas Publicas de
M4edellin, with the guarantee of the Republic of Colombia, in an amount
in various currencies, equivalent to $45 million, for a total term of
thirty-five years, with interest (including commission) at 52-% per an-
num, and on such other terms as are specified in the attached draft
Loan and Guarantee Agreements, and the Executive Directors adopt a
resolution to that effect in the form attached (No. 6). 'With regard
to the period of amortization7 the attached Appraisal Report states that
the project is suitable for a term of 35 years; such an extended term is
also rendered desirable by the economic position of the country, in-
cluding in particular the heavy burden of external debt and the prospec-
tive need for large external borrowing,
