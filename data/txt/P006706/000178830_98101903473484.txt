i.        The Empresas Publicas de Nedellin (EPM) has requested a loan of
345 million to cover the foreign exchange cost of the first stage of the
Nare hydroelectric development. The total cost of the project would be
equivalent to about $75.5 million including interest during construction.
ii.       This wouild be the Bankrs third loan to EPY. The first was made in
1959 (Loan 225 CO) and the second in 1961 (Loan 282 CO). The projectas for
which the previous loans were made were, or are being, completed in a satis-
factory manner, although with some delays compared to original estimates.
iii.      EPM presently owns and operates or has under construction, hydro
plants with a total rating of 388 OpT. The proposed project would provide
facilities for an additional 264 W4, of which 132 !4W would be instialled.
Based on Yledellin requirements, the additional capacity would be required
beginning in 1968. If electrical interconnection between the three major
Colombian power systems (Medellin, Bogota and Cali) occurs by 1968$ as
appears likely, the proposed project could also provide base load capacity
for the interconlected system, thereby making it possible to postpone new
plant investments elsewhere.
iv.       EPM is an autonomous agency established in l955.  In addition to
operating power facilities it also provides the telephone, water supply and
sewerage services to Medellin.
v.        EPMts management and staff are competent and, with the assistance
of consulting engineers, are capable of carrying out the project.
vie       EPMts past operating results have been generally good and are
forecast to continue to be good. A satisfactory finrancing plan has been
arranged to cover the:five yerr period during which the project would be
under construction. It includes the proposed Bank loen and the equivalent
of a Ps. 20 million line of credit to be drawn if needed during the next
two years. The balance of EPIM's cash requirements, to meet debt service
obligations, coustruction expenditures and operating- costs including worXing
capital, would be fror2l internally generated funds.
vii.      The project is sound and its cost estimates contain relatively
lcrge amounts for contingencies and price increlses,  The financing plan
is sound. The broject would be suitable for a loan of $i45 million-including
-5 million for interest during construction, for a term of 35 years with
5 years grace on amortization payments.

1, INTRODUCTION
1.        The Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPA) has requested a loan of
$45.0 million to cover the expected foreign exchange cost of the first
stage of the Nare hydroelectric develoDrent including interest during con-
struction on the pronosed loan, The project would include civil works for
the installation of four 66 9,N units, of which two wou'd be initially in-
stalled, transmission between the Nare site and Medellin, and iriprove'~ents
and extensions to EI.'ts distribution system.
2,        The total cost of the project includin- interest during construction
would be about $l45 million iplus Ps. 274 million. This would be equivalent
to about 475.5 million at the present official rate of exchange of 9:1. The
proposed loan would represent about 60 per cent of this total. The balance
would be obtained from EPIts omn resources (36 per cent) and local borrowings
(4 per cent).
3.        This would be the Fank's third loan to EPF. The first (225 00 -
W$12 million) was made in Way 1959 end the second (282 CO - ,22 million) was
made in -'lNay 1961.
4.        The projects for which the previous loans were made included storage
and diversion works, generation additions totalling 251 P74 in seven instal-
lations, transmission lirnes, and distribution system improvements.  Work under-
taken through the first loan has been substantially completed and thct under
the second loan is scheduled to be cormpleted during the next two and one-half
years.
5.        In addition to the past loans to EPM the Bank has provided major
assistance in financing power programs for the systems serving the Bogota
and Cali regions. The requirements or all three systems have been met to date
through plant additions of a size capable of being absorbed within reasonable
periods and at relatively low cost.  Both the size of the systems and of the
plants planned for future construction have reached a point, however, where
interconnection of the three systems in the relatively near future is certain
to yield major economic benefits. The matter is being studied and tile Bank is
following the course of the studies closely. The likelihood of interconnect-
ion has been recognized during the appraisal of Nare, It is a project well
suited to the needs of EPHil alone or, through acceleration of subsequent stages,
to the needs of an interconnected system.
6.        This report is based on information supplied by 5n11 and its con-
sulting engineers and on the finaings of a Bank mission which visited Medellin
during June 1963. Subsequent visits were made by Bank staff in August,
October and November, primarily in connection with interconnection studies,
for which Nare is recognized an important element0



-2-
II, THE BCRRWTE',R
7.        EPM is an autonomous public entity which provides Vedellin with
public services of electricity, domestic water s-apply, sewerage and telephone.
EPM was established by charter in 1955 through powers given the city of
Medellin by Federal law. "oncurrently the existing municipally-operated
utility was abolished and its assets and liabilities turned over to EPI.
Upon its est,blishment EPM1 was obligated to pay taxes and to a ,sure 85 per
cent of certain debt owed b7 the city totalling $5-3 million;/ The city re-
ceived no other consideration for the transfer of the utility assets.
8.        EPII has a seven member Board of Directors of which the "'ayor of
lledellin is ex-officio Chairman.  Except for the layor, the terms are for two
years and are staggered to provide continuity. Miembers ray be re-elected.
Two members are selected by and from the City Council; three are appoirted
by the 1'ayor from candidates proposed by the Bank of the Republic, the I.Jational
Banks of l¾;edellin and the IH1ational Association of Industrialists; and one is
appointed by the 1Mayor from candidates proposed by the MIedellin Chamber of
Comrmerce and the Federation of Mlerchants.
9.        The Board appoints a General 'ianager who is the Chief executive
officer oi EPN. The four branches of power, telephone, water and sewerage
are each operated as independent departments, except for administrative dir-
ection and use of common services* Accounts are kept separately for each of
the departments;  power revenues are dedicated only to power purposes.  A new
General 1ianager was appointed in Auwust 1963, the previous General !anager
retiring after 1our years in of ice because of illness.  The new General
hlanager is an experienced executive with  background in financial manage-
ment.
10,       In connection with the Drevious loan agreements EPM has undertaken
that the Bank will be 'a) consulted before EPIIrs Board introduces any mod-
ifications in the statutes of EPVF, and (b) informed of any proposed amenidments
to national legislation and national and municipal decrees and resolutions
affecting the statutesof EPMil or its status and operations.
11.       EPIs technical and financial management is good. Past experience
indicates EPI'Ts capability for carrying out the proposed project, assisted as
it would be by its consulting engineers.
Existing Power Facilities
12.       EPM presently owns and operates five hydro plants with a combined
nameplate rating of 217 rAW.  Pdditions to one plant and the completion of
another, both of which are now under construction, will add 171 J of capac-
ity bringing the total to 388 ITT by early 1966. EPM's transmission and dis-
tribution facilities are in a generally good condition;  a continual program
of strengthening and erlarging the system is followed to meet the growing
requirements of the market,
g/ This debt was incurred by the City to finance facilities which were later
turned over to EPM.

III.  THh POP ER ViJAKET
13.       The EPM power system serves 1Kedellin and a number of small adjacent
communities, In addition, power is supplied to the Electrificadora2 de Antio-
quia for distribution to other towns and rural customers in the Department of
Antioquia.
14.       From 1938 to 1962 the pornulation of EPMNs service area increased
from 239,000 to 945;000, or at an average annual rate of about 5.8 per cent.,
(The growth rate was slightly higher during the period 1950 to 1962, averaging
about 6.2 per cent.) Rapid population growth has been due to immigration into
the area as well as to a high birth rate. In preparing the present market
forecasts the assuiption wes made that population growth would continue at
about 6 per cent so that, by 1970, the population in EPMfs service area would
be about 1.5 million.
15.       EPM has kept reliable sales statistics for many years.  The recent
value of these statistics is partially obscured, however, due to restrictions
to the free growth of demand whichwvere imposed at one time or another during
each of the years since 1957.
16.       The long term pre-1957 trend in load growth and sales (1938-1957)
averaged about 11.5 per cent annually. EPM believes that this long term trend
has been only temporarily arrested during the past five years and that, given
adequate generation capacity, system load and sales would quickly adjust to a
value Drojected since 1957 at about the historic rate. This would imply a
considerable block of deferred demand at present, yet evidence of this is
lacking.
17.       Consumption per average residential account year is high, having
increased from 3000 kwh in 1950 to 4500 kwh in 1962. This occurred despite
restrictions imposed during periods when the system was short of generating
capacity. It should be noted also that system restrictions were generally
applied to the residential class of consumer; industrial consumers, for
example, were very seldom affected, The present nigh average residential
consumption and lack of a demonstrable   block of deferred demand leads to
the conclusion that some degree of saturation should be taken into considera-
tion in projecting future sales. A somewhat. lower rate of growth has there-
fore been adopted for this report than projected by EPW.  This rate averages
9.7 per cent (1963-1970) against EPM's projection of 11.1 per cent. In terms
of sales the cumulative difference is 1,214 millior kwh over the eight-year
period, This represento a reduction of EPM's estimates by slightly more than
10 per cent.
18.       Actual and forecast sales, generation and peak load are shown in
Annex 1. It can be seen that sales increased from 462 million kwh in 1956
to 747 million kwh in 1962, or at an avera-e rate of about 8.4 per cent,
System load increaoed from 117 W! to 2C0 MN during the same period, or at an
average rate  above   9 per cent.  The effect of market restrictions mentioned
earlier can be seen in the years 1960 and 1961 when abnormally high load
factors were experienced.



- 4 -
19.      Sales are expected to reach 889 million kwh in 1963 and to increase
to 1694 million kwh by 1970.  System load would increase from 229 Mg to 418 MW
during the same period, These projections result in growth rates which fall
about halfway between the long-term pre-1957 trend (11.5 per cent) and the
trend exper-enced since 1957 when restrictive measures were in effect.  These
projections are reasonable.
20.      Annex 2 shows how capacity additions woild be made to meet expected
load growth. The first two 18 PDT units of the Troneras plant and units 3, 4
and 5, each of 45 PW, of the Guadalupe plant will become available during the
next two and one.half years.  On completion of Guadalupe unit 5 the system
will have a total installed capacity of 388 DT. This will be adequate, in gay
water year except the driest of record, to carry the expected load (without
reserve) until the first 66 M, Nare unit would be completed toward the end of
1968,
IV. FUTURE INTE11COMNECTIO.-N '.ITH CGHER SYSTE9S
21.      The Bank has made sizeable investrients in Colomb_an power to date.
Two loans totaling ~67 million have been made to Fmpresa de Energia Electrica
de Bogota (EE2B);  five loans totaling  44.6 million to the Corporacion Aulto-
noma Pegional del Cauca and/or Central Hidroelectrica del Rio Anchicaya (CVC-
CHIDRAL);  and two loans totaling  43h million to EPM.  In addition, four loans
totaling 414,6 million have been made for power developments in other parts of
Colombia. These loans have helped finance projects whIch have added or will
add about 770 NJ to the generating systems servinq the three major market areas
of Bogota, Cali and Medellin. The general location of these three cities can
be seen on the map at the end of this report.
22.      In the past, each individual system has been able to exploit low-cost
hydro reso-arces whose size has closely matched short-range system requirements.
However, as fature hydro developments are likely to be much lerger, their
rapid full development will be required for maximum economic benefit to result.
Interconnectioi, of the three systems would create a power pool capable of  -
absorbing the output of larger plants planned for the future. The next major
Bogota installation is, for instance, presently planned as a 1 million kw
plant (3 x 125 TAJ units). Nare is itself a large project, with ultimate cap-
ability of 600 Yw to 700 N,PT.
23. 1     The three systems could be connected by a triangular transmission
loop_/ about 800 kilometers (500 miles) long.  The longest leg would be the
I¶edellin-Bocota connection and that wouild be only about 325 kilometers (200
miles) long. These are not particularl.y long transmission distances and the
topography is such that construction should not be particularly dlfficult.
It has thus seemed apparent that the further developmert of the three systems
would be based on integrated operations, probably by the late 1960's.
24.       The major benefits to be derived from interconnecting the three
systems will he twofold.  First, by deferring plant additions, generation
plant investments for an integrated operation are expected to be significantly
less than they wgould be if each system continued as an isolated operation; and
second, the choice of plant additions can be so controlled that investrments
made can be brou7ht into full economic productivity sooner. These benefits
can be gained by taking advantage of diversities in load and hydrology in
different parts of an integrated system, and by reducing requirements for re-
serve capacity.
7/Te initial connection -r%w (December 6) appears more likely to be a riT't con-
figuration.  this would shorten the required transmission.



25.       These views had been brought to the attention of the three power
corrpanies in the past and in June 1963 consultants were engaged by the three
companies acting jointly to prepare a study of the economics and feasibility
of interconnetion. The study is being made by an association of the two
leading Colombian engineering firms, Tngetec and Integral.  This study should
be completed in early 19A64.  If the results confirm the justification for
early interconnectionl,  the corpanies plan to engoge non-Colombian consultants
to prepare recom=endations on the organizational and business aspects of
interconnection. Questions such as how costs snould be allocated, whether a
new transmission undertaking should be formed and if so how capitalized, and
what tvpe of a rate structure to use, and others, will have to be answered.
These questions are likely to be much more difficult to answer than those of
a strictly technical nature, At the same time the Companies will instruct
Ingetec - Integral and non-Colorbian consultants to proceed with detailed design
of the necessary trensmission facilities.
26.       The most economical scheme in terrs of total investment cost (partic-
ularly durinm  the next six years) as well as over the long run, in meeting the
generating capacit-y requirements of each system, and after interconnection, the
integrated system, would be along the following lines:
i,    To proceed with interconnection with an initial in-service
target date of mid-1967.
iio   To consider Nare as in-service, as scheduled, for early 1969.
iii.  To add necessary, but minimum, generating capacity in each
system during the period 1964-1967 by adding to or completing
plants presently existing or under construction.
iV.  To complete Nlre I (four uni.ts) before the scheduled
compl6ttinh of any other rew generating source.
27.       Annex 3 shows how capacity additions might be made following the
above criteria. Low cost additions to existing or under construction plants
would be made before Nare comesinto operation at:
CVCGs Yumbo steam plant, the fourth 33 Ip unit;
EPMTs Guadalupe III plant, the sixth and final 45 DsJ unit and its
Troneras plant, the third and final 18 MW unit;
EEEBts Colegio plant, the fourth and fifth 50 MW units,and its Canoas
plant, a new 42 MaW installation needed for water regulation as
well as its power capability.
All above installations, with the exception of Canoas, wiould be addit-
ions to existing stations; costs would be low. The completion of the Guada-
lupe III and Troneras installations can be carried out for example from funds
available under loan 282-Co at a total cost of not over Ej35 per kw.
1/ As of December 6 there is full agreement among the three companies and the
Bank that interconnection should be made as soon as possible.



- 6 _
28.       It should be no+ed that Annex 3 shows e sequence of possible plant
additions with interconnection, in mid-1967.  The actual scheduling of plant
construction would depend on load growth.  Both the suwmmation of various Bank
forecasts Pnd the Corsultantts forecasts are shown, The difference between the
two would allow one to one and a half years variation in the date by which.a
new plant would have to be in operation.
29.       Methods will obviously have to be devised to equalize the financial
burden which one member of the interconnected system would incur when cor-
structing new plant to serve the total system. Several possible approaches
to the problem ha-ie been discussed by officers of the three coapanies with no
conclusions reached and it is for this reason, as well as others mentioned
above, that great i.portance will be attached to the organizaticnal aspects of
the study (paragraph 25).
V. TIIE PROJECT
Back ground
30.       Early in 1962 EPMts consulting engineers (Integral-Edison) submitted
a report on the alternatives for development of the power potential of the NIare
basin as well as the alterrnatives for development of EPMTs power system, con-
sidering various schemes including thermal. The alternatives studies included
four hydroelectric programs, and three combined hydro-thermal programs. These
seven alternatives were analyzed in detail taking into account required capital
investments, arnual operating costs and cash flow aspects.  The best choice
among the alternatives was the two-stage hIare Project.  A detailed engineering
study or this alternative was prepared by the Consultants during 1962.
The Nare Devrelopment
31.       The project is located on the Nare River about 40 kilometers airline
distarnce east of Iiiedellin.  The g,eneral project layout is at the end of th±s
report.
32.       The first stage which would be financed by the proposed Bank loan,
would include a small diversion dam; one inlet pressure tunnel of about 3.5
meters diameter and 4.7 kilometers length;  an inclined penstock tunnel of about
L,2 kilometers length;  a powerhouse cavern excavated for four 66 I"V units in
which only two units would be installed initially; and a free flow tailrace
tunnel 4.7 kilometers long.  The power plant cavern would be excavated in solid
rock at a depth some 680 meters below ground level. A net hydraulic head of
about 780 meters would be utilized by the first stage development. This would
be increased to about 810 meters after the second stage dam was built,  The
first stage plant output at minimum head, that is with the head available with
four units working simultaneously at full capacity under minimum stream flow
conditions, would be 266 NW.
33.       The proposed project would include about 80 kilometers of two-circuit
230 kv transmission line to Medellin with terminal facilities, and also expan-
sion of EPMts distribution system.



- 7 -
34.       The first stage of ilTare would be completed with the installation of
units 3 and 4, probably by 1970.  It would be an inexpensive and easy instal-
lation since all basic civil works will have been completed. The second or
final stage of lMare will involve the exteneion of the underground powerhouse
to house four or five more units, the constructi.on of a secotnd inlet pressure
tunnel and tailrace tunnel parallel to the first and the construction of a
permanent dam shortly downstream from the first stage diversion dam, The reser-
voir formed behind the second stage dam will allow annual regulation of the
Nare River,
35.       The features of the project are described more fully in Annex 4e
Cost of the Project
36.       The project is estimated to cost about the equivalent of $75.5 mil-
lion including about ~55 million interest during construction on -foreign and
local loans.
37.;      The cost estimates originally prepared by E1H and its consultants
were based on unit prices as generally prevailiilg during the second half of
1962. These estimaates were carefully reviewed during appraisal and updated to
reflect the June 1963 price level.  From this new base, and taking into account
the periods of paTnment for the various work items of the estimate, a factor to
anticipate increases in peso costs at a rate of about 6 per cent annually was
applied. F'oreign exchange costs were escalated in a simiilar manner but at a
lower rate. The resulting estimate should therefore be realistic;  it is sum-
marized below and shown in more detail -n Annex 5,

about 28 percent of the direct foreign exchange costs and about 35 per cent of
the direct local currency costs. These provisions, while unusually large, are
considered necessary because of the large amount of underground work involved in
the project and because of the rather long construction period.



- 8-
Design and Supervision of Construction
39.       It is EPMts practice to engage engineering consultants for the design
and supervision of construction on all its irportant pro4ects.  In the past it
has retained the local Colombian firm, Integral in association with non-
Colombian firms. This has been a satisfactory arrangement.
40.       For the detailed design, preparation of specifications ard engineer-
irg supervision of construction for Nare, EPM, intends to retain the services of
Irtegral associated with Harza Engineering Company of Chicago.  Intearal is
primarily a civil engineering firm. Thus Harza wolld be mainlyr responsible for
the electrical-mechanical features of pro-ect enigineering.  The field position
of Resident Engineer will be an extremelv important one for the Nare proJect and
will require a man well versed in underground work procedures, wTith proven
ability in contract administration.  Integral intends to go outside Colombia in
filling this iob and is piesently reviewirg the qualifications of several
applicants.
Schedule of Construction
41.       To expedite the project EPM has divided the civil works into two con-
tracts,  The first, for which bids Twlere received in Auigust 1963,  would be for
the vehicular access tunnel (into the vicinity of the underground powerhouse)
and about three kilometers of the tailrace tunnel. A letter of intent for this
contract was awarded in September. The contract would be completed in mid-1965.
The cecond contract (possibly the same contractor) would start with the excav-
atiori of the powerhouse cavern and would include all re,naining civil work.
Equipment erection would start during the first half of 1967 with completion
expected by mid-19680 This is a tight schedule but with careful planning it
can be realized.
42.       Construction of Medellin substation additions and distribution system
expansions would be carried out throughout the period with all work included in
the project scheduled for completion by the end of 1968.
43.       The first civil works contract was awarded after soliciting inter-
national bidding and after proper bid evaluation. Remaining civil works and
major equipment contracts would also be open to international bidding.
Justification for the Choice of the Project
44.       The 1962 Integral-Edison report mentioned earlier (paragraph 30) com-
pared alternative methods of developing EPM14's system to be able to meet an as-
sumed peak denand in 1978 of 1,080 vT. Of many hydro developments reviewed
with varying degrees of thoroughness, four energed as the main alternatives.
Although each offered about the same load carrying capacity the selected alter-
native, thle Dual Guatape-Bizcochito development, of which the proposed project
would be the first step, was clearly preferable. This scheme was then compared
to others in -which steam capacity would:
(a)  postpone the date of starting the 3ual Qjuatape development;
(b) partially substitute steam energy for hydro energy; and
(c) replace hydro energy entirely by steam energy.



45,       The construction investment associated with each scheme is shown
below for illustration:
Altqrnative                            Investment
M4illions of pesos
Dual Guatape-Bizecochito                1,318
Steam-Dual Guatape                      1,232
Dual Guatape-Ste2m                      1,162
All 'team                               1,062
46.       The consultants carried out analyses of the investments and
operating expenses associated with each of the alternatives by the present
worth technique.  The useful life of hyrdro and steam plant was assured
to be 50 and 25 years respectively. Current levels of labor costs and
fuel prices were employed. These studies clearly indicated the lowest
cost alternative to be the Dual Guatape-Bizcochito program. A review,
during the appraisal, of the program and its niost favorable alternative
(where construction of Mare would be deferred by the installation of 165 MW
of steam capacity) indicated that the incremental return on the add-tional
investment in the se'lected program would be sorewhat greater than 12%. A
return of this order of magnitude clearly justifies the program, for which
Nare would be the first step.  UIoreover, the interconnection studies mentioned
earlier (paragraph 25) leave no doubt that Nare is the best project to be
undertaken at this time to reet the requ;rerents for inteDrated operations.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Background and Recent Performnance
Financial Background
47.       EPM was formed in 1955, and on January 1, 1956 took over ownershi.p
and operation of the four utility services previously run by the municipality:
power, water, telephone and sewerage.  In return for these properties, ERM
assumed 85 per cent of the service obligation on US$5.3 million external Muni-
cipnl serial (to 197M) bonds, issued to finance utility facilities/ EPW is
completely independent of the municipality, and legally and financially auton-
omous,  The oamership of EPr' resides within itself:  there are no outstanding
equity securities, and all earnin7s are re-invested in the systers. Except for
payments equivalent to the gross receipts tax discussed below, and free street
lighting, the municipality receives nothing from EPM.  By the same token, the
municipality makes no funds available to EPM.
45.       EPM is not required to pay taxes on either property  or income.
However, a payment equivalent to a gross receipts tax is made by each depart-
ment to the munlcipality.&/ This is an operating expense, paid monthly.
Since EPM was constituted, these payments by the electric department averaged
11 per cent per annum of net income.
49. All four departments maintain separate accounts, and Section 5.10 of both
the 1959 and 1961 Loan Agreements provide that revenues and assets of the
electric department may not be used to meet long-term debt obligations of
the other departments.  The electric department furnishes regalar reports to
the Bank on all phases of its operations.
,0.       The current and projected financial positions of only the electric
department have been appraised. In general, the three other departments have
maintained good earnings, satisfactory returns on investment at historical
cost, and acceptable debt/equity ratios. Historical financial data for the
water, telephone, and sewerage operations are given in Annex 6.
Sales and Tariffs
51.       During the 3-year period 1960-1962, EPM had from time to time
rationed sales, and in fact had arrangements for the purchases of small amounts
of energy and power from the large textile operation in Medellin, Coltejer.
PIlthough 1962 stles were 10 per cent above 1960, revmnues fro- s1eFs increased
over 23 per cent, due to tPriff increases.
1/ The obligation of the electric department on June 30, 1963 was US$2.3 million,
the annual service on which is US$153,000.
21 4.425 per cent for power, 2 per cent for water, 3.4 per cent for telephone,
and 2.5 per cent for sewerage, on gross revenues from all sources.



- l -
52.       The tariffs of EPII are subject to approval by the Superintendencia
de Regulacion Economica, an agency of the lAinisterio de Fomento. In the
past six years, tariffs have been increased on three occasions:
expected average revenue
after increase
Date of Increase                        centavos/kwh
(prior to July 1, 1958)                     (3.h)
July 1, 1958                                 4.5
July 1, 1960                                 6.0
April 1, 1963                               10.3
However, the real increase in average revenues is not nearly so substantial
as the above table would seem to indicate. Continuing currency inflation
coupled with devaluation of the peso and a consequent increase in debt ser-
vice requirements have nownullified most of the apparent increases in -tariffs,
so that carrent average revenues are only about 15 per cent higher than 1956
levels in terms of constant local prices.    Moreover, with the completion of
the current Guadalupe program, EPH will have nearly fully explcited the avail-
able modest-sized lo-w-cost hydroelectric schemes upon which its relatively low
tariffs have been based. Future system generating developments will be larger
and require correspondingly higher investments, with further tariff increases
to support them.l/
23.       The current tariffs are expected to produce an average revenue per
kwh sold of not less than 10.3 centavos (US mills 114. at the current Ps 9 =
US"l rate of exchange), which was the average revenue realized from customers
billed at the new rates during T'ay-June 1963.  This figure has been used in
preparing the financial forecasts through mid-1965.2/
54.       The current tariff structure of 1jPiv (see Annex 7) is soriewhat dif-
ferent from that of most utilities, but nevertheless serves the rulrposes of
EP-i. For exairple, residertial rates increase with consumption. This tends
to discourage growth in demand, which is probably desirable during periods
when capacity is short, and new plant is under construction. However, in
connection with the next increase in tariffs, serious attention should be
directed to rationalizing the tariff structure consistent with revenue re-
quirerrents.
1/  Section 5.11 of both the 1959 and 1961 Loan Agreements requires EP1'I to
review tariffs and seek adjustment when a need is indicated, but not
less frequently than every two years.
2/  In July 1963, the Erpresa was forced by the government of Antioquia to
give concessions to certain residential customers, the effect of which
will be to reduce revenues fror this source by a minor amount.



- 12 _
Electric Denartment Performance 1960-1962
55.       Condensed income statements for this period are included in Annex  8.
Revenues increased 23 per cent during this period, but as a result of a 49 per
cent increase in operating expenses, operating income rose only 5 per cent.
At the samie time, return on net plpnt in service at year-end decreased from
18 per cent in 1960 to 8 per cent in 1962, due primarily to major additions
to plant. The return for 1963 should be about 17 per cent as a result of the
recent increase in tariffs. Return on plant, however, does not provide a
significant measure of performance due to understatement of plant accounts.
56.       EPN's only source for financing the local currency costs of its
construction pro raams is internal cash generation from depreciation and re-
tained earnings>_ For this reason, whern Loan 282 CO was made in 1961, the
financial plan was based upon EPM meeting 40 per cent (approximately the local
currency component' of 1961-1965 construction experditures from operations.
However, during 1961-1962 only 26 per cent of expenditures were financed from
this source. This was due both to higher levels of construction expenditures
(in terms of constarqt rmoney values), and the continuing loss in purchasing
power of the peso*2/ As a consequence, EPM is faced with an immediate need to
raise externally new money which should have been generated internally, since
another rate increase could rot be placed in effect at this time. This local
currency financing is required not only for planned new construction expend-
itures, but also to replenish working cash which was drawn dow'n to finance
past expenditures for the Guadalupe program.
57.       Debt/equity ratios were 40/60, 42/58 and 55/45 at the end of 1960,
1961 and 1962, respectively. 9 Debt service coverage was 2.9 times, 1.8 times
and 1.8 times for the same years. These ratios ant coverages are satisfac-
tory.
58.       The most meaningful measure of EPMts performance is its ability to
finance internally the local currency component of its construction expendi-
tures.  Investment in plant has about doubled in the past three years, and
will continue to double about every three to four years under the planned
construction programs. Because of the difficulties in obtaining rate increases
adequate to provide for future requirements, as well as soon enough to offset
the effects of inflation, EPM is now in a difficult cash position. It should
be noted, however, that one of the sain reasons for EPM's continuing cash
problem is the absence of local currency credit facilities.
%/ Long-term peso credits have not been available.
The July 1963 cost-of-living index in Colombia was 51 per cent above the
1960 level; in the same period, the peso had been devalued 34 per cent
in terms of foreign exchange.
Section 5.09 of both the 1959 and 1961 Loan Agreements requires EPM to
maintain debt/equity ratios no greater than 60/4o.

60.        Plant accounts are undervalued in terms of reproduction cost, as a
result of government devaluation of the peso in ternis of foreign exchange, and
inereases in internal prices.  E?N has in the Dast atterpted to partially com-
pensate for anticipated devaluations by carrying new irrported additions to plant
in its accounts at the "free" rate of exchenge, even though corresponding ex-
ternal obligations w-Jere carried at the official rate. A temporary "reserve for
currency fluctuations",, created to account for the difference, was elirinated
when official devaluations took place requiring external obligations to be in-
creased in terms of pesos. While this practice partially compensates for under-
stating the foreign exchange component of plant, it does not take into acconmt
the effect of local currency price increases. Depreciation charges are made on
a straight-line basis, at 3 per cent per annur. on depreciable plant. Since
hydraulic production plant (whose life is greater than 33 years) accounts for
some 70 per cent of all depreciable plant, the 3 per cent depreciation rate would
probably be considered somewhat high if plant accounts were maintained at re-
production cost. However, it corpensates to some extert the overstatement of
income resulting from use of an understated depreciation base.
61.        The current cash positio M reflects the past diversion of EPMrs
working cash resources to construction purposes, as a result of the failure of
internal cash generation to meet construction expenditure reouirements.  EPM
could not undertake the Nare Project without some external source of local cur-
rency financing, although its cash position improved during the second half of
1963 as a result of the recent tariff increase. Bank credits are not normally
available for longer then one year, but EPN has arranged to extend about Ps 2.5
million of the Ps 8.5 million due within twelve months. The interdepartmen,tal
overdraft represents short-term use of other departments' cash surpluses,Y/ and
has been as mLch as Ps 5.9 million during the first half of 1963.
62.        The composition and anounts outstanding (in millions of pesos) of
funded debt were:
1.  three issues of peso bonds due serially to 1973;         Ps   8.o
2.  an Export-Import Bank loan, due serially to 1967;             60o
3.  Loan 225 C0, due 1963-1984;                                 108.1
4.  Loan 262 CO, due 1966-1985;                                  46.9
5.  a portion of Medellints foreign debt, due
serially to 1978;                                            20.7
63.        The peso bonds and the Dxport-Import Bank loan partially financed
the Rio Grande and Guadalupe II hydroelectric plants.  The four foreign currency
debts are carried in equivalent pesos converted at the official Ps 9uOl - US$1.00
rate of exchange, which is the current rate at which EPM buys dollars through the
central bank for servicing debt. Treatment of dollar obligations for calculating
debt-equity ratios is in accordance with the 1959 and 1961 Loan Agreements. The
June 30, 1963 debt/equity ratio was 53/47. Payment of these obligations has been
made in accordance with schedules, but EPM has recently had to incur short-term
bank loans to do so,
As can be seen from the balance sheet on page 13, net working capital, i.e,,
current assets less cuirrent liabilities, does not measure liquidity.

64.       Estimated Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Sources & Appli-
cations of Funds for 1963-1968 are included in Annexes 8-10.
Construction Programs 1963-1968
65.       EPM intends to carry out the following programs during the next six
years:
1)   completion in 1965 of the second Guadalupe program, financed by
Loan 282 CO;
2)   corpletion in 1968 of the Nare Project, preliminary work on which
was sterted in late 1943, ror wh;ch a new uSl 45.0 million loan is
requested; and
3)   a future program to be started in 1966 (for completion in 1970).
Moreover, with the likelihood that interconnection with Bogota and CVC will
be realized in the late 1960's, EPM Ymust be prepared to contribute to its
financing. Studies are not yet completed, but in view of the difficulties
in raising local currency EPM has experienced in the past, it seems prudent
to include funds for interconnection in the financing plan. One-third of
the estimated total local currency requirements for interconnection (Ps 24
million) are therefore included in EPM's financial plan for 1964-1967, on the
assumptions that a new agency will be created to own the interconnection
facilities, and borrow the .Zoreign exchange requirements, and that Bogota and
CVO will contribute the remaining two-thirds of the local currency requirements9
66.       Estimated construction expenditures and inveslment in interconnection
during the period would be a total of Ps 941 million, including US$61.8 million
in foreign exchange, of which U5$16.1 million is already available through
Loan 282 CO. Interest charged to construction during the period would be
equivalent to Ps 73.4 million. financial requirements of these programs are
summarized in the following table.

Financial Plan 1963.1968
67.       In developing a firm financial plan for the period it was recognized
that so-e external local currency financing would be essential.  EPM has been
successful in obtaining:
(1)  a Ps h  million 15-year 5: per cent loan from AID; and
(2)  a US$ 2 million 8 per cent line-of-credit available until December 31,
1965 and repayable December 31, 1966, from Vorporacion Financiera
Nacional (Medellin). (EPM will draw and repay dollars, effecting con-
version to pesos through Colombian banks at the "free" rate. Repay-
ment of each drawing is dlue in 12 months. Thus the e.posure to
exchange risks is limited to 12 months.)
To conglete the finarncial plan, the following principal assumptions were made:
(3)  a US-!. 45 million 35-year 5-1 per cent Bank loan, with 5 yearsl grace}
Will be made by the first of 1964 for the Nare Project:
(h) EPM will place in effect not later than July 1, 1965 a rate increase
of about 25 per cent; end
(5)  a future foreign loan of about US$ 13 million, on terms cormparable
to the proposed Bank loan, will oe obtained in 1966 and drawn during
1966.1970 for the future cornstruction program.

EPMIs contributiGn to construction during the period would be about 41 per cent.
68.       With the approval of the Colombian government's national planning
agency, EPM has made arrangements with AID to obtain a medium-term local cur~
rency loan. The Bank understands from AID that it would finance up to Ps 20
million, of which about Ps 4 - 5 million are currently available, and have been

allocated to EPM. AID has given EPM a letter of intent to lend additional
amounts up to a total of Ps 20 million from expected PL 430 sales proceeds,
or regular AID program funds during the first half of 106h. This additional
financing is not firm, and therefore EPM has made firm arrangements to obtain
the US$ 2 million line-of-credit mentioned in paragraph 67. In making the
financial projections, it has been assumed that only Ps 4 million will be
obtained from AID, and that the line-of-credit will be almost fully drawn upon.
Since the line-of-credit drawings must be repaid not later than the end of 1966,
these assumptions represent the least optimistic possibility. The assumed
local currency arrangements are acceptable.
69.       The proposed Us$ 45 million Bank loan would include US$ 5 million
for interest and other charges during the constraction period. Tt has been
assurmd that the proposed loan would be made by early 1964, and disbursed by
the end of 1968.  Repayment would begin in early 1969.  In view of the main
features of the Nare Project (a large hydroelectric installation with sub-
stantial civil vorks and a very long life) it would qualify for a very long
term of amortization. Thie project is suitable for a loan with a term of 35
years, including a 5-year period of grace.
70.       The need for a further increase in tariffs is indicated, since the
recent increase will not be as effective as expected in providing funds for
expansion as a result of the increases in price levels for goods and services
which have taken place in the last ten months. In making the projections an
increase of about 25 per cent beginning July 1, 1965 has been assumed. This
level would be appropriate in view of current 9onditions, but would have to be
adjusted to conditions as they exist in 1965.11z
71e       It has been assumed that the foreign exchange costs of the future
1966-1970 program, estimated to be a little more than US$ 13 million, will be
financed by a US$ 13 million loan, available on 25-year 52 per cent terms, with
a grace period of five years on repayment.  This future loan would be disbursed
during 1966-1970, with repayment beginning in 1971.  Interest during the con-
struction period has not been included, and the projections assume it will be
paid from operations.
72.       The projections also assume that all earnings will be retained and
reinvested in the business. Current assets and liabilities are projected on
a net basis;  repayment of short-term bank loans and the interdepartmental
overdraft is provided for in debt service.
1/ Payments to the municipality during the period of the financial plan are
estimated at about Ps 35 million total, projected at the current levels.
The decree establishing EPIvi, and under which these payments are made pro-
vides that they may not interfere with either EPM's ability to service
debts, or the carrying out of needed system extensions.  There thus exists
the possibility of reducing these payments below the projected levels, if
the necessity arises.

Summary of Projected Operating Results
73.        The effect of the April 1, 1963 rate increase will be an increase in
net income, producing a return on the book value of net plant in service at
year-end of about 17 per cent. Under the assumptions upon which these project-
ions are based, the rate of return will vary between 22 per cent and 10 per e
centY  during 1963-1968, These rates of return are satisfactory.
74.        In conne^tion with both previous Bank loans, EPM has agreed to main-
tain debt-equity ratios no greater than 60/40. It has done so 'n the past and
should be able to maintain its position during the period of the projections,
provided a rate increase of the order of 25 per cent is placed in effect by
mid-1965.
75.        As of June 20, 1963, EPM had Ps 190 million long-term debt outstanding
(including current maturities) of which nearly 96 per cent was external dollar
obligations. The two Bank loans represented 81 per cent of all long-term debt.
During the period 1963-1968 EPM1 will incur gross new debt of Ps 662 million
(including drawings on Loan 282 C0) while amortization payments will be Ps 106
million. With the assumed rate ircrease in 1965. debt service coverages will be
satisfactory, and not less than 108 times throughout the period.
76,        EFM is required by both previous Loan Agreements to finance a reason-
able proportion of new investment from internal sources.  The May 12, 1961 side.
letter from EPT? in connection with Loan 282 CO states that this reasonable prop-,
ortion shall be 40 per cent of the 1961-1965 investment requirements and after
1965 shall continue to be 40 per cent, but subject to adjustment by EPM and the
Bank. A similar undertaking was obtained during negotiations,
77.        Since EPIFI is engaged in an expanslon program which will increase its
investment four times irl the next 5-6 years, and since economic conditions in
the future are uncertain, the most significant measure of its performance will
be its ability to finance planned expansion, i.e., the contribution from opera-
tions of the local currency portion of ne7r construction, and the satisfactory
servicing of foreign debt. Projected debt service coverages are satisfactory.
The proportion of new construction financed internally during 1963-1965 will be
about 33 per cent, indicating that the April 1, 1963 tariff increase was not
great enough. With the assumed further 25 per cent increase in 1965, however,
EPM should be able to finance internally nearly 50 per cent of 1966-1968 con-
structior expenditures, and repay the 1964-1965 short-term local currency credits
incurred to offset the shortfall in cash generation.
Audits and Accounts
78.        ERIts accounts are audited annually by Haskins & Sells, a recognized
firm acceptable to the Bank. Regular internal financial reporting is carried olut
in considerable detail. EFM generally has unaudited results of operations very
shortly after the close of a period. In the past, however, the independent
auditors have not always completed their review promptly, and EPM has agreed that
this situation should be remedied. Accounting practices are generally acceptable.
V    10 per cent return is for 1968, the year NZare Project is scheduled to come
into service and investment in plant in operation is dcubled.

financial Covenants
79.        During negotiations, the Bank received undertakings from EPM that, in
general accordance with the existing Loan Agreements:
(1) no creditor will enjoy a lien on E?MWs assets prio? to the Bank
except for (i) purchase morey mortgages, (ii) liens on short term
debt (up to one year) incurred in the ordinary course of banking
transactions, and (iii) liens on revenaes of any department other
than tne electric department securing a debt of such other department;
(2) the electric department will not incur long-term debt, or guarantee
the debt of any other ertity, if a 60/h0 debt-equity ratio would
thereby be exceeded, including the guaranteed debt;
(3) no other department will incur long-term debt unless the revenues of
each individually are adequate to pay its operating expenses and ser-
vice its existing and new debt;
(4) no other department will incur long-.term debt unless the holder of
the debt explicity waives ary rights to satisfaction from the assets
or revenues of the electric department;
(5) whenever necessary the tariffs of each of the departments (including
the electric department) will be adjusted to provide revenues suffi-
cient (a) to cover all operating expenses including any taxesp pay-
ments to Medellin or other comrunities, adequate maintenance and de-
preciation, and intsrest; (b) to meet repayments on long-term debt
to the extent they exceed depreciation charges; and (c) leave a
reasonable surplus to finance expansion.
A "reasoniable surplus" has been f'urther defined for the electric de-
part-mient as L0% of construction expenditures during each 5-year
period subsequent to December 31, 1963, EPM has agreed to prepare
each year, for the Bank's approval, a year-by-year cash budget for
5-year periods.
VII. CONCLITSIONS
80.        The proposed project is well planned and its cost estimate based on
conservativre criteria 2
8L.        The management of EFP4 i6 good and the organization's past operations
have been successful,  Satisfactory arrangements are being made to engage engin-
eering consultants for the detailed design and engineering supervision of con-
struction for the project.
82.        Forecssts of continued load growth indicate that new generating cap-
acity will be needed by 1969, The proposed project is clearly the best choice
among the several alternatives available to EPMI. In addition, it would not con-
flict with early interconnection among the three major systems.
1/   Bids for the preliminary tunnel contract were well within the estimates.



- 20 -
83.        EPM's past operatir.g results have been generally good, and are fore-
cast to continue to be good.  Thle financing plan -  the Bank loan  the peso
loan, the short-term peso credits, and the rate increase    should be adequate
and realistic.
8h.        The project would be suitable for a loan of US$ 45 million (includ-
ing UTS$ 5.0 million to cover interest and comnitment charges during the con-
struction period), for a period of 35 years including 5 yearst grace on amort-
ization payments.

APPRAISAL OF THE NAPE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT          ANEX
EMPPR,SP.S pUBLTICAS DE TED- LIN
COLOMBIA
DESCRIPTIO)N OF THE PROJECT
General
The idare pojer plant will be built in two stages. The first stage
calls for a small reservoir on the Ware river and partial construction of the
powerolant, where two turbine-generator units (2 x 66 i,74) will be initially
installed.  (The first stage will contain four 66 H9 units ultimately).  This
initial installation requires the construction of one inlet pressure tunnel,
surge tank and penstock; one tailrace tunnel; and a vehicular access tunnel
to the power plant. Simultaneously with this construction, a 230 kv transmis-
sion line will be built between the project area and J-edellin, and an expansion
of the stepdown substation and distribution facilities at the load center will
be undertaken.
Run-of-river flow, with the storage provided by a small diversion dam
(20 million cubic meters). will provide enough prime power to meet Medellin
load growth until 1972. The final dam to provide regulation of the river, will
therefore be deferred and built as part of the second stage of Nare.
The intake works will be located at the upper part of La Candelaria
creek. Due to the topographic and foundation characteristics of this site, and
to the need of driving the inlet pressure tunnel at an e'levation which will
allow adequate rock cover for the tunnel, a vertical-drop inlet shaft, pro-
vided with a submerged-trashrack-inlet structure, was adopted.
The inlet pressure tunnel will have a circular section with a diam-
eter of 3.45 meters. The water velocity would be around 4.5 meters per second
under Tmximum discharge of 42 cubic meters per second, required by all the
units working simultaneously at overload,  At minimum reservoir pool level,
all four 66 NiW7 units cculd be operated at rated capacity.
The tunnel will be lined throughout its entire length. Preliminary
studies indicate that steel lining will be required for .pproximately 80% of
the tunnel length, and that the remaining part will safely withstand the
internal pressure with a reirnforced concrete lining. Nevertheless, for estim-
ating purposes it was assumed that the inlet pressure tunnel would be lined
with steel throughout its entire length.
The surge tank will be located around 150 meters upstream of the
valve chamber, at a place where the rock cover above the inlet pressure tunnel
is expected to be a maximum. It consists of a vertical shaft excavated through
rock and Drovided with a lower and an upper surge chamber, also excavated in
rock. The upper surge chamber will provide enough capacity to control the
maximum surge level in case of sudden simultaneous load rejection of the four
units, at maximum pool-elevation after the construction of the second stage
reservoir.



ANNEX 4
rage z
The pressure penstock will have a 2.9 meter inside diameter and a
total length of 1,160 meters.  It will be fully lined with steel, and the de-
sign takes into consideration the contribution of the rock to absorb internal
pressure and water-hammer. M4aximum water -velocity in the penstock will be
around 6.5 meters per second. A Pour-branch distribution manifold will be pro-
vided at the bottom of the penstock, and a butterfly valve and an air inlet
valve will be installed at the top, ir a valve chamber excavated in rock, 152
meters dowmstream from the surge tank.
The vehicular access tunnel to the powerplant cavern will have a
total length of about 2,000 meters and will descend with a grade of l2%. A-
seven meter width was edopted in order to provide a convenient truck access
during construction of the powerplant. The adopted height of the tunnel is
controlled by the clearance required to haul the transformers to the powerplante
Besides serving as a vehicular access, this tunnel would also be used as fresh-
air inlet for the powerplant cavern, and as exhaust duct for the warm air from
the transformers chamlber.
The powerplant will consist in its ultimate stage of a 171e4 meter-
long cavern excavated in rock with an approximate width of 25 meters. Since
the cavern construction will be made in two stages and the powerplant will be
connected to two independent inlet pressure tunnels and two tailrace tunnels,
an arrangement consisting basically of two in-line generator halls separated
by the erection bay, was selected.  The left machine hall, named also
Guatape I, will house four units corresponding to the first-stage construction.
of which two will be i7n-italiy installed.  The right machine-hall, known also
as 3iuatape II, will house five urits corresponding to the second-stage con-
struction.
Each of the four units of the first-stage construction will discharge
through a concrete-lined tailrace conduit, excavated below the turbJine floor.
The four conduits will converge 45 meters downstream from ttle powerplant to a
freeflow tailrace tunnel. The tailrace tunnel will have a total length of 455
meters and a slope of around 0.15%  The 4nvert and side walls of the tailrace
tunnel will be lined with concrete to inprove hydraulic characteristics.
Geology
The -eoloaical characteristios of the project area are those typical
of the Antioquenan 'BLtholite, which is a deep-seated intrusive igneous forma-
tion with a surface area of around 7s000 square kilometers. An age determin-
ation made of its quartz-diorite bed rock Lives 'ate cretaceous as the age of
the same, that is, around 70 million years. Eed rock is a remarkable uniform
quartz-diorite of medium to moa.erately coarse grain, composed of feldspar,
quartz, hornblend and biotite; it is a hard, strong, high to medium grade
rock, whose appearance and phqsical characteristics are similar to granite.
The area is characterized by a great depth of overburden, resulting
from weathering of the bedrock, The overburden exhibits rather uniform char-
acteristics and its weathering is gradual from the sound rock to the surface,
varying fromr hard decomposed rock of grayish color and coarse grains close to
the sound rock, to fine-grained plastic red silt near the top.  The past exper-
ience with these lateritic soils has snown that although they are light in
weight, they are irpervious and suitable for emb7nknent construction. They

also to form an impervious layer on top of the rock formation which will pre-
vent leakage from the proposed reservoir and will cut down considerably the
seepage of water to the proposed tunnels, where driven through fractured cr
jointed rock.  Tnese chracteristics are evident in the Quebradona dam and
Troneras earth dams and reservoirs, and were experienced during the constructio
of the following works: Rio-grande pressure tunnel, Tenche-Troneras diversion
tunnel, Troneras dam diversion and outlet works tunnel, and Gsuadalupe pressure
tunnel.
Diamond drilling with five rigs owned by Lipresas and operated under
the supervision of Integral has been performed at all critical areas of the
project and is still continuing,
The final location of the powerhouse will be decided upon only after
the access or tailrace tunnel has reached the approximate area and the bedrock
can be examined in place by srall adits in order to see and determine the natire
and orientation of minor fractures in the bedrock.
Hydrology
Two separate hydrologic analyses were niade in connection with the
Nare project, one related to the available water supply and to the determina-
tion of the capability of Erpresas power system, and the second related to the
determination of the design flood for spillway and diversion requirements.
There are 11 precipitation recording stations in the Nare basin owned
and operated by Empresas.  Records for 8 stations are available since 19h8 and
1949, and for the remairing stations, located in Santa Rita, Rio Abajo and
Penol since 1959. Also, flow-records of the Nare river from two river-stage
recording stations are available since 1955, and in addition the hydrology de-
partment of Empresas Publicas de iKedellin has kept daily flow-records for the
Guadalupe and Rio-grande rivers during a much longer period.
Records for the Guadalupe river extend back 36 years, and those for
Rio-grande cover 22 years. A correlation of the natural flow of the Rio-grande,
Guadalupe, and Nare rivers indicates that during the past seven years for which
records are available for the tnree rivers, their periods of drought and periods
of abundant water have closely coincided.
The analysis of the records shows that the most critical drought in
the past 36 years occurred in 1958-1959, and correlation of the runoff records
with much longer rainfall records suggested that this drought would have a
frequency not greater than once in 40 or 50 years. It consequently was adopted
as the criterion for "worst water" conditions.
A study of the stream flow records disclosed that 1957 was a year of
fair water yield, and that 1956 was abundant. It was concluded therefore that
reservoirs would have been full at the close of the 1957 wet season, and that
the critical period would start with the dry season of 1958, which marks the
beginning of the 1958-59 drought.
If the conditions of the 1958-59 water years were to occur during the
years 1971-72, the first stage of Nare and the proposed 20 million cu,m. stor-
age reservoir would provide enough prime power and enough installed capacity to



ANNEX 4
Page 4
meet the load growth.  Once the second-stage reservoir was built and all the
units of Nare installed, the prime power available would give the system enough
capability to meet the 1977 load, if 1976-77 were critical water years.
Siltatioi
The Nare drainage basin has an area of 1,210 square kilometers, most
of it very well covered by vegetation and grazing lands; mean annual precipit-
ation over the basin is around 2OOO millimeters. The upland regions are well
protected by natural forests; the medium altitude lands are mostly covered by
grass and light bushes, Formation of slides in some of the hillside slopes,
and erosion along the banks of the river tributaries contribute a high propor-
tion of the sediment load to the stream, The low flat zones of the valley are
rather well cultivated, and although some material is washed off these areas by
heavy rains, the slope of the land is so mild that these zones do not represent
a very high contribution to the total sediment load of the stream.
Sediment concentration in the Nare river varies throughout the year
from a small concentration during the first tl-ree or four dry months to a
higher value during wet months, resulting from wash load carried to the river
during heavy rains.
Suspended sediment sampling was started at the Nare river in June
1957 Samples are -aken periodically by Empresas Hydrology Department by means
of a depth-integrating sampler. Also some spotty information has been obtained
at different times at some of the river tributaries.
Fourteen complete suspended load measurements have been taken at the
Santa Rita gaging station at different times of the year, covering river dis-
charge ranging from 15.5 to 118.3 cubic meters per second. Concentration of
suspended particles for the available measurements ranges from 8 to 224 ppm.
The total annual sediment load transported by the Nare river at the
site of Santa Rita was determined by means of the river flow-duration curve and
the selected sediment rating curve.  The results of these calculations indicated
that the annual sediment yield at Santa Rita would be around 320,000 metric tons
per year or 250,000 cubic meters, based on an estimated sediment density of 1.28
(80 pounds per cubic foot).
Since the Santa Rita gaging station is located near the site of the
proposed dams, the estimated sediment transport rate of the Nare river includes
the total sediment load that will be carried to the reservoir by the river and
its tributaries, and consequently the annual silting of the reservoir would be
around 250,000 cubic meters. At this rate, and assuming for conservative
purposes that consolidation of the silt deposits will not take place, total
silting of the reservoir in a 100-year period will amount to only 25 million
cubic meters, or 2% of the total storage of the second-stage reservoir.

EPM's Telephone, Water Supply and Sewerage operations may be summarized
as follows:
A, Telephone Department
As of the end of December 1962 there were 66,000 lines serving Nedellin
and some suburban municipalities, including 2,000 public telephones. Expansion
programs now underway will increase line capacity to 81,000 by 1964 and 94,000
by 1966. The current telephone tariff, which has been in effect since 1961,
may be described as follows:
1) Residential
A monthly fixed charge of Ps 5 per line plus Ps 1 per each Ps 10,000
of value of the property served. The customer has the right to make 100 free
calls Twith this tariff and is charged 10 centavos for any additional call.
2) Industrial and Commercial
A monthly fixed charge of Ps 5 per line plus Ps 1 per each Ps 10,000
of registered capital. All calls are charged at 10 centavos.
B. Water Supply Department
As of the end of December 1962 the Water Supply Department had 70,691
corsumers.  The system is sufficient for present needs during periods of abun-
dant river flow, and is delivering 180,000 cubic meters per day. Rationing is
still necessary during dry periods at the begimning of each year.
The current tariff has been in effect since 1960. The average monthly
tariff amounts to 21 centavos per im) for the first 30 m3 consumed; for excess
consumption, the average tariff is about 20 centavos per n3. (The tariff on the
first 30 m3 of water consumed consists of a fixed charge of Ps 1 plus Ps 0.20
per each Ps 1,000 of value of the property up to Ps 100,000 and Ps 0.15 per each
Ps 1,000 of value in excess of Ps 100,000). EPI4 also charges a connection fee
on new installations amounting to about 3% of the value of the property.
Studies are proceeding in support of an increase in rates.
An expansion program now underway will divert up to 4 cubic meters
per second from the Rio Negro through an 8.3 km tunnel to a new filtration plant
10 km SE of Medellin. New pumping capacity, distribution tanks, and expansion
of the network are included in the program. The work is being financed under a
1961 loan of US$3.3 million and Ps 20 million from the Inter-American Develop-
ment Bank.
C. Sewerage Department
Rates, which are related to water consumption, were increased in April
1963, which increased gross revenues by 70%. Monthly revenues are now about
Ps h65,000 as against Ps 272,000. The increase is derived from a new charge of
10 centavos per cubic meter on consumption of water above 30 cubic meters per
month, and is thus borne largely by the major water consumers.
New studies of means of sewerage disposal are underway, and the possi-
bility of U.S. AID financing of a treatment system is being explored.
