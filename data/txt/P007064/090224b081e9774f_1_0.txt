of this Agreement, the Borrower shall enter into a contract with
Banco Central on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank,
causing thereby Banco Central to enter, on behalf of the Borrower,
into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, with each Financiera, on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, including those set forth
in Schedule 5 to this Agreement, and except as the Bank shall
otherwise agree, the Borrower shall not take or concur in,
nor permit Banco Central to take or concur in, any action which
would have the effect of amending, abrogating, assigning, sus-
pending, or waiving such contract, any Subsidiary Loan Agreement
or any provision thereof.


﻿- 15 -
Section 4.02. (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)
of this Section, the Borrower shall cause Banco Central to exer-
cise, its rights under the applicable Subsidiary Loan Agreement in
relation to each Financiera, each Investment Project and each
Invef-tment Enterprise in such manner as to: (i) protect at all
times the interests of the Borrower and the Bank; (ii) comply with
its obligations under this Loan Agreement; and (iii) achieve the
purposes of the Loan.
(b) The Borrower shall promptly take, and cause Banco
Central acting on behalf of the Borrower to take, all such action
and exercise all such recourse available to it under a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement as the Bank shall request in order to ensure the
prompt and full performance by such Financiera of its obligations
thereunder.
(c) The Borrower shall not, without the prior agreement of
the Bank, suspend or terminate the right of a Financiera to have
access to the proceeds of the Loan under the applicable Subsidiary
Loan Agreement with such Financiera, or declare the principal
amount of the Subsidiary Loan thereunder due and payable prior to
the agreed maturity, unless the right of the Borrower to withdraw
the proceeds of the Loan allocated to such Financiera shall have
been suspended or terminated by the Bank or the Bank shall have
declared the principal amount of the Loan relent to such Finan-
ciera to be due and payable immediately, or a default shall have
occurred in the due and punctual payment of any monies payable by
such Financiera to the Borrower and such default shall continue
for thirty days after notice thereof shall have been given by the
Borrower to such Financiera.
Section 4.03. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in
normal circumstances, special security from the member concerned
but to ensure that no other external debt shall have priority over
its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of
foreign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such
member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public
assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any external
debt, which will or might result in a priority for the benefit of
the creditor of such external debt in the allocation, realization
or distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the
Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso facto and at no cost to the
Bank, equally and ratably secure the principal of, and interest
and other charges on, the Loan, and the Borrower, in creating or


﻿- 16 -
permitting the creation of such lien, shall make express provision
to that effect; provided, however, that, if for any constitutional
or other legal reason such provision cannot be made with respect
to any lien created on assets of any of its political or adminis-
trative subdivisions, the Borrower shall promptly and at no cost
to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other
charges on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets
satisfactory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property;
and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of banking
transactions and securing a debt maturing not more than one year
after its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means
assets of the Borrower, of any political or administrative subdi-
vision thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by, or
operating for the account or benefit of, the Borrower or any such
subdivision, including gold and other foreign exchange assets held
by any institution performing the functions of a central bank or
exchange stabilization fund, or similar functions, for the Bor-
rower.
Section 4.04. The Borrower covenants that it shall not take
or permit any of its political subdivisions or any of its agencies
or any agency of its political subdivisions to take any action
which would prevent or interfere with the performance by the
Borrower, Banco Central and the Financieras of any of the respec-
tive covenants, agreements and obligations of the Borrower, Banco
Central and the Financieras contained in this Agreement, the
contract referred to in Section 4.01 of this Agreement, and the
Subsidiary Loan Agreements, and shall take or cause to be taken
all reasonable action necessary or appropriate to enable the
Borrower, Banco Central and the Financieras to perform such
covenants, agreements and obligations.

less for any loss resulting from changes in the rate of exchange
between currencies (including Sucres) with regard to the amounts
withdrawn from the Loan Account.
(b) The Borrower shall hold CFN harmless for any loss
resulting from changes in the rate of exchange between currencies


﻿- 17 -
(including Sucres) used in CFN's foreign borrowings, and to that
effect, whenever CFN shall have paid an obligation denominated in
foreign currency, the Borrower shall pay to CFN, within 90 days,
an amount in Sucres equal to the negative difference (resulting
from changes in the exchange rate) between the amount of such
obligation expressed in Sucres at the time such obligation was
incurred and at the time it was paid, provided, however, that any
positive difference between such amounts shall be deducted by the
Borrower from future payments to be made by the Borrower to CFN
under the provisions of this Section.
(c) Unless the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise agree,
foreign borrowings contracted by CFN after December 31, 1979,
shall not be covered by the provisions of paragraph (b) of this
Section.

Project, and those of Financieras, and the performance by Banco
Central of its obligations under the contract referred to in
Section 4.01 of this Agreement and the Subsidiary Loan Agreements.
(b) The Borrower and the Bank shall: (i) exchange views
through their representatives with regard to the performance of
the obligations of the Borrower under the contract referred to in
Section 4.01 of this Agreement and under the Subsidiary Loan
Agreements; and (ii) inform each other of any condition which
interferes with, or threatens to interfere with, the performance
referred to in (i) above.

financing to an enterprise or related group of enterprises where
CFN's total exposure to such enterprise or related group of
enterprises, after providing such financing, shall exceed 10% of
CFN's equity; provided, however, that financing which does not
meet the above requirement may be provided by CFN if an adequate
mechanism, satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank, is pre-
viously established in order to protect CFN's equity from all
risks arising from such financing.


﻿- 18 -
(b) For purposes of this Section:
(i) "CFN's total exposure to such enterprise" means the
sum of:

enteprise to CFN including loans, cr6ditos
documentarios, guarantees, acceptances, and
other credits; and
(B) CFN's participation in the enterprise's share
capital;

paragraph (b) of Schedule 5 to this Agreement shall be deposited;
(b) to charge to such special account any losses incurred by
the Borrower resulting from changes in the rate of exchange
between the currencies (including Sucres) disbursed to and those
to be repaid by the Borrower under this Agreement; provided,
however, that if the balance of such account shall at any time be
insufficient for the payment of such losses, the Borrower shall
forthwith deposit into such special account any additional funds
required for such payment; and
(c) after the Loan has been fully repaid to the Bank, to pay
to the Borrower any balance remaining in such account.
