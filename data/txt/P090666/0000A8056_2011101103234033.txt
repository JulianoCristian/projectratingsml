                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The countries of South East Europe, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the European Commission are cooperating to develop a regional energy market, the
                         Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE) and integrate it into the internal energy market of the European Union. The objective of the project is to
                         facilitate BiH's participation in ECSEE through investments to: (i) improve dam safety; (ii) reduce adverse environmental impacts at thermal power stations; (iii)
                         replace ageing existing facilities and equipment at hydropower and thermal power stations; (iv) rehabilitate distribution systems and introduce distribution
                         Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, (v) establish a market operation system, (vi) provide hardware and software to improve the
                         financial management information systems of the Elektroprivredas; and through technical assistance to facilitate project implementation, and determine the
                         best way to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions at a power plant.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation and disbursements is progressing well, and the disbursements have remained higher than the estimates. Cumulative disbursements have reached about US$ 24
                         million (about 67% of the Credit amount). The PIUs have done an excellent job of accelerating project implementation and disbursements and, thanks to their hard work, the project
                         implementation is almost on target as per the schedule revised at the time of restructuring in November 2010. Based on the actual contract prices, and the request of the Government

                         and the EPs, proceeds of the Credit have been reallocated among various disbursement categories. The Government was informed on November 22, 2010 of the revised allocation
                         and the revised Closing Date of June 30, 2012.

                         EPBiH has awarded contracts for all components and completed five out of nine contracts. Of the two components, EPHZHB has completed one (implementation of Financial
                         Management Information System), and is making good progress in the second (the study of dam safety improvement measures). The request of EPHZHB for use of savings of about
                         US$110,000 for a study to assess solar energy potential in Herzegovina was pending signature of amendment to the Finance Agreement by the Minister of Finance and Treasury,
                         which has since been received after the mission. EPHZHB can now start the process of hiring the consultants to carry out the assessment. EPRS has also awarded all contracts
                         including the contract for monitoring and control system at Ugljevik thermal power plant for which IDA would finance only ten percent of the contract value.
