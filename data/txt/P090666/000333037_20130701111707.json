the Energy Community of\n            South East Europe (APL 3) Program Project for Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: in projects with multiple co-financiers, parallel\n            co-financing arrangements as against joint co-financing work\n            better since delays in implementation of components of any\n            financer do not adversely affect implementation of\n            components financed by others. Parallel co-financing\n            arrangements should not include any cross-effectiveness and\n            cross-default clauses. Even intractable problems such as\n            electricity theft, poor billing and collection can be solved\n            if the power utility management pays sustained attention,\n            sets clearly understood targets and enforces them with\n            sanctions and rewards. In such a situation, involvement of\n            external financiers can help address political economy\n            constraints. Implementation schedules for generation\n            rehabilitation projects should take into account the\n            constraints in shutting down large generation units in\n            relatively small systems for a long duration to carry out\n            the rehabilitation. They should be made of discrete packages\n            capable of being done during the regular planned shut down\n            for maintenance (normally about three to four weeks). Even\n            then delays could occur, as it did in Elektroprivereda\n            Republika Srpska (EPRS), when the planned maintenance of\n            thermal plants is postponed or curtailed due to poor\n            hydrological conditions."}, "docdt": "2013-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
