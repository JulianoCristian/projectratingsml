                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The countries of South East Europe, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the European Commission are cooperating to develop a regional energy market, the Energy
                         Community of South East Europe (ECSEE) and integrate it into the internal energy market of the European Union. The objective of the project is to facilitate BiH's
                         participation in ECSEE through investments to: (i) improve dam safety;(ii) reduce adverse environmental impacts at thermal power stations; (iii) replace ageing existing
                         facilities and equipment at hydropower and thermal power stations; (iv) rehabilitate distribution systems and introduce distribution Supervisory Control and Data
                         Acquisition (SCADA) systems, (v) establish a market operation system, (vi) provide hardware and software to improve the financial management information systems of
                         the Elektroprivredas; and through technical assistance to facilitate project implementation, and determine the best way to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
                         emissions at a power plant.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation has progressed well, though slower than projected. Five of the six sub-objectives of the project have been fully achieved. Adverse environmental impacts at Kakanj,
                         Tuzla, Ugljevik and Gacko thermal power plants (TPPs) have been significantly reduced. Air quality has improved at Kakanj TPP. Wastewater treatment and water cooling system
                         rehabilitation and ash handling at Ugljevik and Gacko have decreased the overall emissions and resulted in a more rational use of water. Better coal handling at Tuzla TPP has

                         helped improve environmental performance. Electricity generation has reached 13,988 gigawatt hours compared to a baseline of 12,800. Dam safety studies to recommend
                         measures to improve dam safety have been completed or will be completed shortly. The establishment of a market system operator has only been partially achieved; it has been
                         established as an institution, but is not yet fully functional.
