Original/Current Project Development 
Objectives/Outcomes
 
The countries of South East Europe, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the European Commission are 
cooperating to develop a regional energy market, the Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE) 
and integrate it into the internal energy market of the
 European Union.  The objective of the project is to 
facilitate BiH's participation in ECSEE through investments to: (i) improve dam safety; (ii) reduce adverse 
environmental impacts at thermal power stations; (iii) replace ageing existing facilities and equipment at 
hydropower and thermal power stations; (iv) rehabilitate distribution systems and introduce distribution 
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, (v) establish a market operation system, (vi) 
provide hardware and software to im
prove the financial management information systems of the 
Elektroprivredas; and through technical assistance to facilitate project implementation, and determine the 
best way to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions at a power plant.
