EPHZHB is one of the three\n            implementing agencies for the project.

The request for use of savings\n            could not be processed in November 2010 since the Bank had\n            received a request only from EPHZHB but not from the\n            Recipient, which has been since received."}, "docdt": "2011-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
