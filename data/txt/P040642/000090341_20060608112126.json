the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the project: Baseline indicator data should be\n            gathered and target sets at the beginning of the project to\n            assist in successful implementation. The lack of\n            transparency in this transaction was an important reason for\n            the public's loss of support and the reason that even\n            now, privatization as an integral part of the economic\n            strategy has not taken root. The inclusion of the\n            privatization of utilities in the project goals was\n            overambitious in its assessment of government commitment as\n            well as the amount of time required to privatize utilities.\n            The complexity and political sensitivity of such programs\n            require a comprehensive program that builds capacity of the\n            ministry, regulatory agency as well as opening the sector to\n            private sector participation. Privatization is a sensitive\n            reform; it can affect jobs, national pride and vested\n            interests. Comprehensive employee information, counseling\n            and retraining programs should be integral to privatization\n            projects to ease the burden on the retrenchees and soften\n            the negative effects on public opinion and government\n            commitment to privatization. There was a high turnover of\n            project managers during the second half of the project, a\n            not uncommon situation made worse due to the lack of\n            documentation slowing down the transition between managers."}, "docdt": "2006-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
