        and Investment Promotion Reform Program and to continue the\n            implementation of reforms that were the focus of previous\n            adjustment operations, namely the privatization of\n            parastatals and the reform of the legal framework governing\n            business activity. The project aims to provide technical\n            assistance and other support to the government of Zambia to\n            implement policy, institutional and regulatory reforms that\n            will support the economic reform program. The project will\n            finance the following components: 1) investment-banking,\n            legal and other specialist advisory services to the\n            government of Zambia to assist in the preparation and\n            implementation of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd.\n            privatization plan; 2) further assistance to the Zambia\n            Privatization Agency to finance the services of consultants\n            and specialists to prepare about 30 public enterprises for\n            sale; 3) technical assistance and training to strengthen the\n            Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development to oversee the\n            implementation of the new Mining Act by improving its\n            geological database, its ability to promote the sector to\n            private investors, and its capability to administer and\n            supervise the mining sector, including the small-scale\n            miners; and 4) technical assistance to the Department of\n            Legal Drafting under the Ministry of Legal Affairs to\n            strengthen its capacity to prepare new business legislation\n            to support the economic reform program."}, "docdt": "1996-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
