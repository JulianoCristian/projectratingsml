MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PWEDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXCUIE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THIE REPUBLC OF MALAWI
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit to Republic of Malawi of SDR
33 million (US$45.8 mllion equivalent) are mubmitted for your approval. The proposed Credit would be
repayable over 40 years, including a grace period of ten years at standard IDA terms. It would help to finance
a project which would enhance the capacity of the research, ectension and input supply systems to provide cost-
effective and sustnable technologies suitable to smallholder farmers. Ibe project wold contribute directly to
increasing smallholder incomes and food security.
2.    Cgnta   gac      d: Despite a series of adjustment programs, Malawi remains one of the poorest
countries in the world with a per capita GNP of US$240 (1991). It is extremely vulnerable to extemal shocks,
becase of its land-locked position and narrow resource base. Although the coutry has made sonsiderable
progress on the macroeconomic front over the past four years, the medium-term economic outlook is highly
uncertain because of:
*     the exten  shocks and the adverse impact of an unprecedented drought in 1992 throughout
Southern Africa; and
*     deterioratng relations with biat    donors due to unresolved issues related to governance.
3.    Malawi's period of strong growvl came to a halt In the early 1980s when the country faced a combination
of unforable terms of trade, high interestrates, weather-related shocks, and major domestic policy weaknesses.
The first series of adjustment operations was a response to this set of shocks. However, while the Government
of Malawi (GOM) was responding to these shocks, the country was hit by a worsening of the war and civil strife
in neighboring Mozambique. Mhis not only led to a major increase in intenational transportation costs, but also
to increased security-related expenditures and a large influx of refugees. TIis caused sharp deterioration in the
macroeconomic enviroment in the mid-1980s. Despite the partial reopening of the Nacala rai route through
Mozambiqe in October 1989, and recent peace overtures, the Mozambican situation has not eased and remains
uncertain. Certain policy responses to this second and more drmaic set of shocks, including expanded fiscal
deficits and implementation of import controls, compounded the difficulties and discouraged private sector
investments and output. The situation was further exaeated by the severe drought in 1992 which reduced the
maize crop by nearly 60 percent. Widespread poverty and food insecurity have emerged as important social
dimensions to the economic difficulties. This has resulted in additiona foreign exchage requirements of US$236
million for maize imports in order to avoid widespread food shortages, marition and starvation. Drought-
related expenditures for the inernal distribution of emergency food aid, water supply rehabilitation and health
programs will fiurther worsen the Government's fiscal difficulties.
4.    At the May 1992 Consultative Group Meeng held in Paris, bilateral donors and the EC refrained from
pledging additional exernal assistce to Malawi due to political goverance issues. To close the resulting fiscal
and external financing gap, the Malawian authorities Implemented an austerity package in June 1992, comprising
a 22 percent devauation of the Kwacha, strict expenditure controls, and a tightening of the monetary stance.
ITese measures have helped the economy to remain broadly on track. Nevertheless, timely resumption of
bilatera and EC extera support (eg., balance of payment support) is ccial for the succeful continuon of
the adjustment program.



2
S.    Ae                    Agriculture continues to be the backbone of Malawi's economy. Eighty-five percent
of the popuation of 8.3 million, plus about one million Mozambican refugees, reside In rural areas and rely on
agriculture and natural resources for their livellhood. Agriculture accounts for nearly 33 percent of GDP and
85 percent of exports, provides two-thirds of the inputs for the manufacturing sector, and dominates the
commercial and distnbution sectors. Maize is Malawi's staple food and occupies nearly 80 percent of cultivated
area. Domiat exports are tobacco, tea and sugar, with tobacco comprising 45 percent of total export eatnings.
Production is predominandy under rainfed conditions, relying on one rainy season per year. This makes Malawi
vulnerable to drought, as in 1992. Rapid population growth (3.5 percent p.a.) and limited land have eliminated
fallow in most areas, resulting in environmental degradation and reduced productivity.
6.    Malawi's agricultural sector consists of smallholder and estate farm sub-seors. There are significant
differences in resource allocation and farming practi:es between and within these two categories. 'he smallholder
sector comprises about 1.8 million families, producing mainly for subsistence. This sector farms 75 percent of
the cultivated area, but with 55 percent of households cultivating less than 1 hectare. Some 40 percent are
female-headed households, of which 70 percent cultivate less than 0.5 ha. Low productivity (i.e., 800 kg
maize/ha on average) and small farm sizes result in extremely low incomes and chronic food insecurity for most
families. In an average rainfall year, about 75 percent of households run out of maize 3 months before the
harvest. The estate sector is comprised of about 18,000 farms, which occupy about 25 percent of the cultivated
land and produce mainly export crops and hybrd maze.
7.    Growth of Malawi's agricultural sector since Independence has varied widely (-2 to 10 percent p.a.), due
to a fiaile and narrow resource base and uncertain rainfall. The 1992 drought resulted in a negative growth rate.
The main source of growth has been expansion of the area under cultvation and increased tobacco exports. The
este sector has driven agricultural growth, due to privileged access to land, tobacco licenses, inputs and credit.
By conrast, the smallholder sector stagnated in the 1980s, due to policy distortions, dwindling land resources,
and inadequate agricultural and financial services. With alleviation of these constraints, the smallholder sector
has the greater poteal for growt!' and poverty reduction. For eample, with good weather and improved
policies, smaholder growth in 1991 exceeded 10 percent.
8.    Sector Objetives and Constraints:  The Govemmentes broad sectoral objectives are to promote
agricultural growth, raise rural incomes, ensure food security at the national and household levels, and increase
and diversify export earnings, while conserving natural resources. Government's main strategies involve
deepening policy reforms in agricultural produce markets and cash crop production, improving public expenditure
management and allocation, making the provision of agricultural services to smallholders more cost-effective, and
expanding the role of the private sector. Agriculture has the potential to achieve a sustainable and broad-based
growth rate of at least 4 percent p.a. Realizing this potential Is essential to trigger growth in other sectors and
to reduce iV-espread poverty. Agricultural growth will need to be derived mainly from increases in smallholder
productivity and in returns per unit of land under cultivation. The recent development of high-yielding flint maize
varieties is a promising prospect for such growth and for enhancing food security. While some progress has been
made in increasing productivity, the majority of smallholders, especially the resource-poor, continue to face major
constaints. These include limited land resources; declining soil fertility and deforestation; severely limited access
to cash crop production; lack of access to inputs (especially improved seeds and fertilizer) and financial services;
limited availability of labor during peak-season (especially for female-headed households) and deficient research
and extension services. Steps are being taken to address some of these constraints, with assistance from IDA and
other donor agencies (including ADB, IFAD, EEC, UNDP, USAID, ODA and GTZ). Notwithstauding these
programs, recen studies have highighted the need for additional action in order to: (i) generate and introduce
improved technologies suitable for different household types and agroecological zones, through increasing the
focus of agricultural research and extension; (ii) increase the avaiability and use of improved seeds and fertilizer;
(iii) remove restrictions on smallholder production of cash crops; (iv) expand access to rural financial services;



3
and (v) provide more effective targeted Income-generating intervendons for the resource-poor, most of whom are
women. The ASP would be a catlyst for such actions.
9.    ETect hbJecives: Ie Projects key objectives are: (i) to help formulate and Implement institutional
and management reforms In the national research, extension, and Input supply systems, with the aim of prosiding
cost-effective and sustainable technologies suitable for a range of smallholders; and (ii) to enhance farm incomes
and food security by increasing and diversifying smallholder production, especially among female and resource-
poor farmers. A secondary objective is to provide a policy and operational framework for channeling and
coordinating assistance to the development of agricultural services from other donors.
10. ..       DescipAtion: The Project would be implemented over a six year period and would be comprised
of four major components: research, extension, input supply and institutional strengthening.
(a)    Agrigultural Research (US$18.1 million or 28 percent of total project costs): This component would
support: () formulating and implementing research action pluas which are consistent with the national research
master plan and rei1istic budget ceilings; (ii) strengthening research-extension-farmer linkages to ensure research
responds to smallholders' needs; (iii) diversifying participation in publicly fiunded research through expanding
contract research by qualified bodies, and facilitating progress towards the commercialization of some research
activities; (iv) improving the setting and updating of national research priorities and allocation of public funding
(ncluding donors) by activating the Agricultmal Sciences Committee (of the National Research Council of
Malawi, in the Office of the President); and (iv) improving research system management, and enhancing
researcher career structures, motivation and accountability.
(b)    Agricultural Extension (US$24.2 million or 37 pereent of total project costs): The extension component
would cover five technical areas: crops/agro-forestry; livestock; land resources and conservation; small-scale
irrigation; and food and nutrition. In all these areas, the Project would support activities which would: (i)
increase the efficiency of extension delivery through streamlining organizational arrangements, operations, staffing
levels, functions and capacities; (ii) expand the coverage of smallholders to reach more female and resource poor
farmers, through  separating credit administration from  extension, promoting low-cost and proven
technologies/practices, strengthening research-extension-farmer linkages, integrting technical messages that are
more responsive to smaUholder constrains, collaborating with NGOs, using farmer groups other ta those which
are credit based, increasing the mnmber of female field assistants (FAs), and training all FAs in gender-related
issues, particularly nutrition; and (ill) increase the effectiveness of extension through improving staff traing,
using more interactive teaching methods, and encouraging better quality and consistency of field supervision,
supported by improved operational fumding, close monitoring and rewarding good performance.
(c)    Input Supply (US$10.0 million or 16 percent of total project costs): To increase the availability and
use of improved seeds and fertilizers by smallholders, this component would: (i) help formulate and implement
seed and fertlizer policy reforms to further liberalize importation (fertilizers), production (ybrid seeds), pricing
and domestic distribution; and (ii) help finance incremental fertilizer imports, as well as mobilize additional donor
assistance for fertlizer imports within a consistent policy framework.
(d)    Institutional Strengthening (US$12.5 million or 19 percent of total project costs): This component would
strengthen the capacity of MOA to deliver agricultural services in an efficient, effective and sustainable manner,
and thus ensure the realization of benefits to smallholders from reforms in the extension, research, and input
supply systems. Actions would be supported to Improve: planning and financial management in MOA; transport
management; procurement (including a cross-Ministerial study and action plan); agricutural policy analysis
training (-county); pilot schemes in small scale irrigation, with an emphasis on building capacity of farmer
groups; sectoral and project monitoring and evaluation.

11.   Poject Cost and Financing:  Estmated total project costs would be US$64.8 million. IDA would
finance US$45.8 M (70 percent); ADB US$12.7 M (20 percent) and Government the balance of US$6.3 M (10
percent). Schedule A provides a break-down of estimated project costs and a project finacing plan; Schedule
B provides details of procurement methods, a break-down of disbursements and an estimated schedule of
disbursement; Schedule C provides a timetable of key processing events; and the status of Bank operations in
Malawi and the statement of LFC investments are provided in Schedule D.
12.   Project LmpteMenA&n: MOA would be responsible for overall Project coordination and implementation.
All of the Project activities build on existing programs and would be implemented through established institutional
arrangements, The activities and arrangements, however, would be refocused to generate more tangible and
sustainable results. MOA D)epartment and Unit heads would be responsible for specific components. An
Agricultura Sector Steering Committee (ASSC), would be activated to ensure effective coordinadon among, and
monitoring by participating departments, units and agencies for this Project, as well as the other major projects
being implemented by MOA. The ASSC would be supported by MOA's Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, and
backed-up by a senior Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) officer who would be assigned to monitoring overall
project progress. Project implementation in Malawi has, in the past, suffered from weak institutional capacity.
IDA has carried out workshops in Malawi and provided assistance to various government agencies to alleviate
disbursement problems. In addition, the activities under the ASP have been carefully phased to take into account
weak implemeion capacity and the project provides in-service training and technical assistance to build
capacity. MOA, together with IDA and GTZ, has prepared a detailed implementation manual for project
components to help guide implementation. Project implementation and impact will be closely monitored through
biennial reviews and the use of performance indicators and targets which were developed and agreed with the
implementing agencies.
13.   Proect Sustainabit:  The active participation of Government and especially the key implementing
departments in the design and preparation of the project should enhance the sustainability of project activities.
Various mechanisms, including two workshops and continuous and open dialogue promoted through the Resident
Mission staff, were used during project processing to ensure active participation and ownership of the project
action plans on the part of the relevant officials at both Headquarters and field levels. In addition, the Project
would strengthen the capacity of MOA to plan and provide more effective, efficient and sustainable agricultural
research and extension services. Measues to promote sustainability iniclude: keeping project scope consistent
with existing levels of funding (in real terms) and implementation arrangements and capacities; streamlining
research and extension staff; using improved method (i.e., "yardsticks" and improved budgetary processes) to
estimate and allocate required operating funds; improving the policy environment to expand the role of the
private sector in providing key agricultural inputs; improving the motivation and accountability of research and
extension staff; and ensuring that Govenment gradually absorbs the modest incremental recurrent costs.
1.   Lessons Learnt from Previous IDA Agricultral 3ItJ: Relevant projects in Malawi include: the
Smallholder Fertilizer Project (Cr. 1352); several projects under the National Rural Development Program in the
1970s and 1980s; the National Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 1549); the Agricultural Extension and Planning
Support Project (Cr. 1626); and the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2121). Lessons from these and
similar projects in sub-Saharan Africa include: (i) project scope must be kept simple and adjusted to budgetary
constraints consistent with macroeconomic conditions and implementation capacity; (ii) institutional reforms take
time and require a long-term commitment, phasing, detailed action plans and a broad-based consensus of both
decision-makers and implementors; CMii) effective coordinating arrangements are necessary; (iv) overse degree
courses should be funded sparingly, especially when incentives are weak in the public sector; and (v) strong
capacity in Government/MOA budgeting, financial management, procurement and policy formulation Is essential.
The Project takes these lessons into account by: focussing on the most critical agricultural services; developing
a broad-based consensus during preparation and appraisal; supportng a phased program of institutional and policy



5 .
reforms, backed by agreed action plans; expanding the role of the private sector; emphasizing In-service and in-
country training; and employing simple Implementation and coordination arrangements.
15.   Rationale for IDA Involvement: In the 1980s, IDA played a key role in supporting Malawi's stuct
and agricutural adjustment and investment programs. Currendy, lIDA, In close collaboration with GOM and
donors, is preparing an Agricultural Sector Memorandum (ASM) to update sector strategies and provide the
analyical underpinnings for Project investment. Ihis Project has integrated the initia findings of the ASM into
its design. The ASP is also well-timed in terms of building on past riulti-donor investmets (especially in
infastructure and training), policy and institutional reforms, and the MDA-supported pilot extension initve and
agriculturl research project (coming to closure in 1993). The later, together with the Rockefeller Foundation,
assisted in the development of two promising hybrid variedes of maize which are now ready for dissemination
to smallholders. The Project would support the implementation of specific measures to secure a supply response
(especially for the new maize hybrids) from a larger proportion of smallholders as an engine for growth and
poverty alleviation. The Project also provides an investment framework for coordinat   and mobilizing
additional donor assistance, including co-financing by the African Development Bank and a proposed parallel
project financed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). In addition, the proposed IDA-
supported Rural Financial Services Project would expand smallholder access to finance, and thus enable a wider
adoption of the improvedi technologies being promoted by the ASP. The Project is therefore consistent with
IDA's strategy with respect to Malawi's agricultural sector in that ASP would contribute directly to increasing
smalhoider productivity and incomes and to alleviadng poverty in a sustainable hamer.
16.   Main Assurances Obtained: There is broad agreement with Government on the Project's objectives and
the need for policy and operational improvements during implementation. In order to ensure Government
conmitment to the essential policy and institutional changes, and their timely implementation, the Project design
has emphasized   -At n                     ations. the fllowing aurc      y     :    (a) the ASP
Plan of Action (containing action plans for each component and subcomponent) satisfacwry to IDA would be
implemented; (ii) improved seed and fertilizer policy reforms would be implemented in 1993/4; (dii) the proposals
concering the functions, coamposition and operation of the Agricultur  Sciences Committee (ASC) are
satisfactory to IDA; and (iv) budgetary alloaions for non-salary operang expenditures would be accordance
with realistic requirements, based on improved methods of calculation. Before Board Presentation, the
Government fulfilled the following actions satisfactory to IDA: finalized the sectoral leuer of agricultural
policies; approved and announced the seed and fertilizer policy reforms; finalized and approved measures to
Improve researchers' career structure and incentives; completed the research action plans in accordance with
agreed creria; and completed the implementation reports on the small-scale irrigation and food and nutrition
subcomponents. Conditions of credit effectiveness include the appointment of the head of the ASC technical
secretariat; issuance of a circular formalizing the role of the Agriculhtu  Sector Steering Committee and the
appointment of tbree key technical assistance staff, all satisfactory to IDA. Cnitio of disbursement for the
inputs component will be the implementation of fertilizer policy reforms and action plan satsfactory to IDA.
17.   Environmental Aspects: ASP's environmental assessment category is "B."  The project is ewected to
have a beneficial environmental impact through dissemiating extension messages on: increased, but more
efficient, fertilizer applications (fertiizer use is at low levels in a country with rapidly declining soil fertlity);
soil and water management and conservation; agro-forestry and nitrogen-fixing plants. These efforts would
promote land conservation and environmental protection, as well as sustainable cultivation. The final design and
execution of the small scale irrigation schemes would need to meet pre-defned environment criteria and would
be monitored closely for adverse effects, if any. The Government is currently preparing a national environmental
action plan which will identify measures and establish the policy and institutional framework to stregthen
Malawi's capacity to monitor and address the environmental effects of investment projects such as ASP.

18.   Areas gf Special Emphasis The Project emphasizes household food security and poverty reduction among
resoureor farmers, many of whom are female, ahough increased prodklivity and diversification. The Project
promotes an epanded role for the private sector ir, agriculhua services through contracting out research, using
NMOs and established local farmers' groups in extension and small scale irrigation, and further promoting the
liberalization of seed and fertilizer markets.
19.   Troect Beneft: lhe Project would provide two types of benefits: proluctiontincome and institutional.
Production benefits would include: increased adoption of improved seeds, especially the promising hybrid maize
seed; more efficient and profitable application of fertilizer; use of fertilizer by a larger number of smallholders;
and more widespread adoption of agro-forestry, nitrogen-fixing rotations and water and soil conservation; and
the development and replication of viable technologies for small scale irrigation. Institutional benefits would
include: improved institutional mechanisms and capacity to sustain more efficient research and extension systems,
which are responsive to the needs of smaillholders, especily women and the resource poor; impoved financial,
transport and monitoring systems to support agricultural services, and a beter motivated and :abned research and
extension staff. The net value of smallholder output is expected to increase by 35 percen in red tems by
2002/3. The ASP benefits would also be enhanced by several proposed parallel projects (including support from
IFAD) which would provide additional assistance through the ASP fhamework.
20.   Prie  Ris L: imited Govarment/MOA capacity to formulate and impiement the required policy and
institional changes would adversely affect project Implementation. This outcome would be minimized by
ensuring realistic project scope, developing phased implementation action plans prior to project start-up, and
providing in-service training and carefully designed technical assistance to build local capacity. Deterioration in
economic performance and budgetary funding could undermne the required non-salary recurrent funding of key
services. IThese risks are countered by developing an lnpioved method for estimating and alloctng recurrent
funding, financing incremental operating costs on a declining basis to ensure phased absorption by MOA, and
close monitoring on an anua basis. The proposed improvements in research and extension may not generate
workable solutions to constraints of resource poor smallholders, but priority will be placed on ensuring a rapid
flow of remunerative and affordable technologies, strengthening research-extension-fanr linkages, and closely
monitoring farmer adoption rates. Other donor projects involving agdcultural services may diffuse budgetary
and management resources, but ASP provides an improved framework and mechanisms for more effctive donor
funding support and collaboration.
21.   ROrunedwo: I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement
of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

AGUCULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
Disbursement Delays
'he Bankrs portfolio in Malawi is fairly large and includes 19 ongoing operations. The
Governent's limitet capacity to implemen the project remains a concern. One of the chaeistcs of project
implemeation in Malawi has been slow disbursement - ie., slower than planned in the original project Staff
Appraisal Reports. As illustrated on page 1 of Schedule D, total disbursements as of March 31, 1993 were about
55% of total approved credits. A large part of the undisbursed amount is due to delays in the commencement
of Power V Project and in the release of the second tranche under the Entre eurip Development and Drought
Recovery Project It is also relevant to note however, that 11 out of 19 operations are about 3 years old or less
Cie., they became efecve in 1989 or later). The major causes of delayed disbursements in Malawi are: (i) a
shortage of trained/experienced staff resuting in inadequate knowledge of the Bank's disbursement procedures;
(ii) a frequent turnover of disbument staff (iii) lack of adequate counterpart funds; and (iv) lack of staff
incentives. On the Bank"s side, disbursements are slowed down by: (i) overly complex project components;
Cii) occasional staff delays in procurement approval; and (iii) a failure to resolve project budget issues at
negotiations. To remedy these problems, a number of disbursement workshops have been undertaken in Malawi
and these will cotinue to be held annually, wih disbursement officers working in the Goverment and in
parastatads paricipating. In addition, in FY93 a Bank disbursement officer visited Malawi twice to assist various
NMiistries/agencies in resolving pendin disbursement issues and in clearing the bacldog. Finally, based on the
Country Implementtion Review of May 1993, the Government and IDA joindy formulated an action program
aimed at improving various aspects of project implementation in Malawi, including disbursements.
