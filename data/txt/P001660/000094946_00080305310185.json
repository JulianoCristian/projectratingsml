unlikely, and institutional\n            development impact negligible. Although the project\n            contributed to a number of policy reforms, its principal\n            objective of delivering agricultural services to\n            small-holders, particularly the poor, was not achieved, and\n            the absence of specific performance indicators, retrains an\n            assessment on the extent of small-holder productivity,\n            incomes, and food security. Lessons drawn from the project\n            address, in general, the basics in project design, that is,\n            the realistic assessment of management capacity,\n            particularly as it involves institutional reform, and,\n            stakeholders involvement in its conceptualization. In\n            particular, regarding matters of policy reforms, substantial\n            reforms need to be further addressed, since those reforms\n            implemented under the project, will not contribute\n            significantly to the sector. Research and extension lessons,\n            suggest the need to improve funding procedures, to\n            strengthen farmers participation in the development of\n            research agendas, and, to clearly define public funded\n            extension priorities, as well as partnerships between\n            government, non-governmental organizations, and the private\n            sector. Concerning the Bank, as it relates to effective\n            supervision, it is suggested that additional resources\n            should be allocated to project supervision, when it\n            substantially deviates from its initial objectives."}, "docdt": "2000-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
