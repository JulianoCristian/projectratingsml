sustainable technologies suitable for a\n            range of smallholders; and (b) to enhance farm incomes and\n            food security by increasing and diversifying smallholder\n            production, especially among female and resource-poor\n            farmers.  A secondary objective is to provide a policy and\n            operational framework for channeling and coordinating\n            assistance to the development of agricultural services from\n            other donors.  The project will be implemented over a six\n            year period and will be comprised of four major components:\n            research, extension, input supply and institutional strengthening."}, "docdt": "1993-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
