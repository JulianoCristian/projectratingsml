Third Inland Waterways Project aims\n            to reduce transport and energy bottlenecks in China by a)\n            improving market access of the remote inland areas of Hunan\n            Province; b) providing more efficient and economic inland\n            waterway transport (IWT); and c) generating power to\n            supplement the needs of remote areas. There are seven\n            project components. The first constructs a shiplock and\n            shiplock gates and hoists. The second component constructs a\n            dam and powerhouse; and supplies and installs turbines and\n            power generators, sluice gates, and hydraulic hoists as well\n            as providing trash screens, roof covers, and other small\n            equipment; and provides transformers and a switch yard and\n            builds transmission lines. The third component funds access\n            roads from existing roads to the project site along with\n            access roads within the project complex. The fourth\n            component finances river bank protection works and reservoir\n            area protection. The fifth component upgrades channels. The\n            sixth component strengthens institutional capacity by\n            developing a waterway management strategy and providing for\n            training, a containerization study, and construction\n            supervision. The seventh component finances land\n            acquisition, compensation for resettlement, cleaning of the\n            reservoir area, and other resettlement-related activities."}, "docdt": "2001-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
