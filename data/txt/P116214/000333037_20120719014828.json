"Ratings for the First and Second\n            Programmatic Fiscal Management and Competitiveness\n            Development Policy Loan (FMCDPL) Project for Peru were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Grantee performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: when the global financial crisis\n            erupted in September 2008 and the government asked the Bank\n            for urgent financial support, the Bank was able to come\n            through in record time. The capability to respond quickly to\n            changing country and/or international conditions is\n            essential for maintaining the relevance of the Bank and for\n            its relationship with its clients, particularly with the\n            middle-income countries. The design of the policy matrix\n            balanced ambition and breadth with a focus on areas with\n            strong government commitment. Striking such a balance at the\n            beginning of the series is not an easy task. On the one\n            hand, setting out to do only the reforms that are most\n            likely to be achieved would make for a more satisfactory\n            performance at the end of the program. On the other hand, it\n            is most beneficial if the program can be used to push\n            forward difficult reforms. While a small fraction of the\n            outcomes in the FMCDPL program were not achieved, resulting\n            in only satisfactory performance, the work that took place\n            in the less successful areas had moved the agenda forward\n            and prepared the ground for future reforms, which are being\n            continued and implemented at this time."}, "docdt": "2012-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
