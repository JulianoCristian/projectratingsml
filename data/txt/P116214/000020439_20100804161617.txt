                      and business environment. The loan supports two broad areas of policy reform:

                          Competitiveness

Key Outcome           The proposed loan will contribute to the achievement of the following outcomes:
Indicators               Strengthening the GoP's fiscal position and overall fiscal framework, with timely budget
                            financing at reasonable terms;
                         Improving the efficiency and quality of public spending with the objective of allowing for
                            budgetary savings that could be directed towards priority poverty programs as well as more
                            and higher quality public services for citizens; and
                         Expanding international trade and improving the business environment with particular
                            emphasis on small and medium enterprises that are critical to create jobs.
                      For further details on key outcome indicators please see a complete Results Framework Matrix in
                      Annex 4.

Program               The proposed loan supports progress towards medium-term program outcomes related to three
Development           CPS objectives: (i) maintaining macro stability (pillar I-cluster I), (ii) accelerating growth and
Objectives and        widening the base of growth (pillar I-cluster II), and (iii) modernizing institutions (pillar III-cluster
Contribution to CPS   VI).
Risks and Risk        There are two key sources of risks associated with the proposed loan:
Mitigation
                      Economic: Peru remains exposed to downside risks stemming from renewed uncertainty in
                      international financial markets and doubts about the pace of the global economic recovery. The
                      exposure to commodities remains high, as demand from fast growing emerging economies is
                      shifting the destination of Peruvian exports. The program supported by the World Bank and this
                      operation; in particular, contribute to the mitigation of these risks. The implementation of
                      performance-based budgeting and technical assistance work on procurement to improve public
                      investment capacity are examples of mitigating factors. Commitment to structural reforms and
                      broad national consensus on the macroeconomic pillars remains strong. The decision by the
                      authorities to curb the expansionary stance of fiscal policy demonstrates their commitment to
                      regain fiscal space and is particularly noteworthy in light of the upcoming presidential elections to
                      take place in April 2011.

                      Political and social: Risks arising from social unrest tend to be correlated with high levels of
                      poverty and inequality. These risks could be exacerbated if economic activity deteriorates
                      substantially. Imperfect conflict resolution mechanisms with disaffected social groups remain a
                      challenge to political stability. However, continued improvements in social safety nets and other
                      social programs, a more equitable flow of resources to the country's regions, and an increase in
                      spending on public investment assist in ameliorating social and political risks.

                                    I.      Introduction

1.      This proposed Development Policy Loan for US$100 million is the fourth and
last in a programmatic series of Fiscal Management and Competitiveness Development
Policy Loans (FMCDPL). The FMCDPL series, along with parallel Development Policy
Loans (DPLs) in the areas of social policy and environment, were designed in close
partnership with Government of Peru (GoP) and in line with its policy program­ as outlined
in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The GoP stated a clear vision for: (i) building on
recent economic successes to achieve higher growth and better social outcomes; (ii)
constructing a better social contract between the government and citizens based on effective
social development; and (iii) modernizing state institutions. This FMCDPL programmatic
series has been prepared at the request of the GoP to support Peru's reform program.

2.      The development objective of the loan is to contribute to growth and poverty
alleviation by supporting two main policy areas: (i) efficiency and quality of fiscal
management and (ii) competitiveness. Peru entered the global crisis in a solid position and
has managed its challenges well. Good macroeconomic fundamentals and appropriate policy
responses to the crisis moderated the negative impact of weaker external demand and
external shocks. Aware of the downside risks to economic growth as well to poverty and
employment, the GoP implemented counter-cyclical policies to mitigate the impact of the
crisis. Nonetheless, the GoP has not lost sight of the medium-term objectives of its reform
agenda, and has continued to make progress in improving the effectiveness of fiscal
management and supporting the country's competitiveness and integration into the global
economy.

3.      The GoP has requested Bank financing for three main reasons. First, while Peru
has achieved strong growth and poverty reduction in recent years, it still faces a high poverty
rate as well as other important development challenges in areas such as infrastructure and
human capital formation. This operation supports implementation of key policy reforms that
can help increase the impact of public spending. Second, this is the fourth and last operation
in a programmatic series agreed with the government under the current CPS and which has
been included in the government's financing plan. Third, while global financial markets have
improved, there remain uncertainties and risks that the authorities seek to mitigate with
further Bank financing.

4.      The GoP seeks to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the
outstanding results in debt management and maintaining flexibility to respond to a
volatile global environment. In this regard, the authorities made a strategic choice of
maintaining DPL/DDOs as contingent lines of credit while drawing on traditional DPLs for
immediate budget support. To date, the GoP has disbursed US$460 million of the US$1.56
billion DPL/DDOs approved since August 2008. The Peruvian authorities have informed the
Bank that they intend to disburse an additional US$150 millio n by the end of CY2010 and
US$560 million during CY2011.

A. Economic Developments

5.      Peru faced the global economic crisis after a period of broad-based rapid
economic growth. Before the global economic crisis, Peru displayed one of the strongest
growth performances in the Latin America and the Caribbean region, with growth
accelerating from 6.4 percent in 2005 to 9.8 percent in 2008. Rising commodity prices fueled
export growth but the economic expansion from 2006 to 2008 was also based on buoyant
domestic demand and was led by the private sector. Consumption and investment contributed
roughly equally to economic growth. Private investment rose from 15 percent of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in 2005 to around 22 percent of GDP in 2008, supported by a
positive outlook and sound macroeconomic management. Strong capital inflows led to a
reserve build up and put appreciation pressure on the Nuevo Sol. FDI inflows surged from
US$2.5 billion in 2005, around 3.2 percent of GDP, to US$6.5 billion in 2008, around 5
percent of GDP. Bond spreads declined and in 2008 Peru's sovereign foreign currency rating
was upgraded to investment grade first by Fitch and Standard and Poor's in 2008 and then by
Moody's in 2009, reflecting the strong growth performance, prudent fiscal and liability
management, and the resulting improvement in solvency indicators.

6.      Sound macroeconomic management during the boom years created the fiscal
space needed for countercyclical policies to soften the impact of the global economic
crisis. The GoP maintained a prudent fiscal policy through the commodity boom period,
running fiscal surpluses in the three years to 2008, with the overall budget surplus peaking at
2 percent of GDP in 2008. The authorities saved resources into a fiscal stabilization fund,
which saw its balance increase from US$314 million in 2005 to US$1.8 billion in 2008
(around 1.4 percent of GDP). The authorities also brought public debt down from 38 percent
of GDP in 2005 to 24 percent in 2008. Public external debt decreased from 28 percent of
GDP in 2005 to 15 percent in 2008. In parallel, the Central Bank (BCRP) accumulated net
international reserves which increased from US$14 billion in 2005 to US$31 billion in
2008--close to five times the stock of short-term external debt and 11 months of imports of
goods and services.

7.      Despite the magnitude of the challenges generated by the global economic crisis,
financial and exchange rate stability were preserved. In the wake of the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy in mid-September 2008 the sharp increase in risk aversion in global financial
markets was quickly felt in Peru. From mid-September to late October 2008 net international
reserves fell by US$3.3 billion, or close to 10 percent of holdings. However, the central bank
avoided sharp fluctuations of the exchange rate. The global economic crisis also had a
relatively limited impact on the Peruvian financial sector, which did not rely heavily on
short-term external borrowing or on exotic asset-based derivatives. In addition, there was no
credit crunch as the growth of credit to the private sector remained positive, slowing down
gradually to an annual rate of 9 percent at its trough in December 2009.

8.     Economic growth decelerated sharply in 2009 but remained positive, as external
demand and an anti-cyclical public spending program propped up growth. GDP growth
stood at 0.9 percent in 2009, down from 9.8 percent in 2008, driven largely by a fall in
                                              7
 domestic demand prompted by the global economic crisis. Within the domestic demand, the
 drop in private investment was particularly sharp. Thus, private investment went from
 contributing around half of the growth in 2008 to a negative contribution in 2009. In contrast
 to the situation in previous years, the overall contribution to GDP growth of domestic
 demand was also negative in 2009. On the external side, the global crisis led to a decline in
 exports, which fell by 15 percent in 2009. However, imports decreased more, by 26 percent,
 as imports of capital and intermediate goods dropped sharply on account of the virtual
 standstill from private investment. The terms of trade recovered in the second half of 2009
 and for the year as a whole the terms of trade index were broadly unchanged. These factors,
 together with the decrease in profit remittances (largely by foreign mining companies
 operating in Peru) explain why the current account balance turned from a deficit of 3.3
 percent of GDP in 2008 to a slight surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2009.

 9.      In response to the economic slowdown the authorities launched in 2009 a two-
 year economic stimulus plan amounting to US$4.8 billion, or about 3.5 percent of GDP.
 The plan focused primarily on increased public expenditures and attempts to balance the
 need for a stimulus in the short-term which reflected also medium-term priorities.
 Infrastructure projects accounted for around 51 percent of planned expenditures. In
 particular, about US$412 million were allocated for priority projects and US$567 million
 have been allocated to projects which were already in execution but had undisbursed budget
 balances in 2008--effectively funding the `carry over' of those projects into 2009. An
 additional US$912 million was earmarked to infrastructure projects to be chosen and
 implemented by regional governments. Other large items in the economic stimulus plan
 include US$313 million for a range of social protection policies as well as US$386 million to
 fund the fuel subsidies in place through a Fuel Stabilization Fund. Also, the so-called `duty
 drawback' paid to compensate exporters for the import duties paid on inputs was, was
 temporarily increased. As of end-April 2010 the disbursement ratio of the total economic
 stimulus plan was around 87 percent.

 10.     The fiscal stimulus plan combined with lower fiscal revenues caused a fiscal
 deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP in 2009. Peru's budget balance turned negative in 2009 due

                                                             8
to both lower revenues and increased public expenditure associated with the economic
stimulus plan. The existing Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law sets two limits: (i)
the fiscal deficit is not to exceed 1 percent of GDP, and (ii) the growth of current
expenditures of the central government is not to exceed 3 percent p.a. in real terms. Article 5
of the Law states, however, that in cases of national emergency or international crisis the
legislature can, at the request of the executive, grant exceptions to the fiscal rules for a period
of up to three years. The administration proposed legislation--which the Congress
approved-- to increase the limit on the fiscal deficit to 2 percent of GDP in both 2009 and
2010. In addition, the limit on the real growth of current expenditures by the central
government--set at 3 percent by the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law--was also
temporarily lifted to 10 percent in 2009 and 8 percent in 2010. Finally, some fiscal rules for
sub-national governments were also modified, the most important being that for non-
financial expenditures the deficit limit was raised from 3 percent to 4 percent, excluding
investment. In terms of deficit decomposition, it can be explained by both a 12 percent
falling in Central Government tax revenue and a strong expansion of non-financial
expenditures, particularly public investment.

11.    In parallel, the central bank eased monetary policy as inflation decreased and
exchange rate appreciation pressures resumed. The central bank cut its policy rate every
month from February to August 2009, bringing the rate to 1.25 percent for a cumulative
easing since the beginning of 2009 of 525 basis points. Such a monetary policy easing took
place in a context of declining inflation, down to 0.25 as of December 2009 and growth
deceleration. In addition, the central bank adopted a number of measures aimed at supporting
the flow of credit, such as reducing reserve requirements, accepting new instruments as

                                                        9
collateral for liquidity operations, and the extension of the term of liquidity management
operations.

12.     As the recovery seems to be takinges root, the authorities have started to cut
back on the expansionary stance of fiscal and monetary policies. The authorities
announced in May 2010 a series of measures aimed at controlling the pace of public
spending. In particular, a new limit to ministries and agencies has been set on the growth of
public spending on goods and services for 2010, which is not to exceed 3 percent in nominal
terms. This new measure more than fully reverses the loosening of the constraint on growth
of public expenditure that had been temporarily set for 2010 at 8 percent growth in real terms
and is in fact tougher than the normal limit envisaged under the Fiscal Responsibility and
Transparency Law. In addition new measures have been put in place to limit the increase in
public investment which had grown by 26 percent in real terms in 2009. Thus, public
investment projects that have been granted budgetary funds but which have yet to start
disbursing will only be allowed to disburse 25 percent of their budget allocation. With regard
to monetary policy, the central bank raised the reference rate, which had been held at 1.25
percent through April 2010, to 1.5 percent in May 2010 and to 1.75 percent in June 2010.
The increase in interest rates is a preventive measure to preempt inflationary pressures in an
environment of accelerating growth and despite the lack of substantial inflationary pressures
thus far (see Figure 3).

B. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

13.     While uncertainty about the near-term outlook remains elevated due to risks to
the global economy, prospects for Peru continue to be positive provided that a sound
policy framework is kept in place. While the slowdown in growth in 2009 was acute, Peru
was one of the few economies in the region that avoided negative growth in 2009. Following
a rapid pick-up in economic activity from the end of 2009 driven by both domestic demand
and a recovery of commodity prices, the most likely scenario for 2010 is one of substantial
recovery. Growth is expected to increase to around 6 percent in 2010 and to hover around
5.5 percent over the medium term. Downside risks to this baseline scenario include a weaker
than expected recovery of the world economy which could soften both demand and prices for

                                              10
key commodities of the Peruvian export sector such as copper, gold, and zinc. A weaker than
anticipated global economy would not only translate into decreased external demand for
Peruvian exports but, most importantly, could also affect domestic confidence and
investment, as it did in 2009, slowing down the rebound in domestic demand which is once
again expected to be the key driver for overall growth in Peru.

14.     Peru's debt servicing indicators show a robust position, helped by an active
liability management policy. Peru's total public debt in 2009 stood at US$34 billion, or
26.4 percent of GDP. Net international reserves closed 2009 at US$33 billion, about 15
months of imports of goods and services and near 200 percent of foreign currency deposits.
The country's debt service profile and its currency and interest risks exposures continued to
improve in 2009 as a result of active debt management policies and Peru's access to various
funding sources, including multilateral banks, U.S. and European markets, and local markets.
In particular, in the third quarter of 2009, the authorities pre-paid debt with the Paris Club for
US$952 million while in May 2010 the authorities engaged in a pre-purchase and exchange
of bonds totaling US$1.8 billion that resulted in a lengthening of maturities and a rebalancing
towards domestic-currency denominated debt. The country's debt management strategy aims
to mitigate refinancing risk, increase the share of domestic debt in nuevos soles (the share of
debt in domestic currency has increased from 15 percent of total debt in 2004 to about 40
percent in 2009), lengthen the maturities of fixed-rate debt, and continue to develop the
market for international sovereign bonds.

15.     A debt sustainability analysis suggests that the public debt position is resilient to
a range of simulated negative shocks. The recently completed Article IV consultation by
the IMF in April 2010 included an updated debt sustainability analysis. The results of such
debt sustainability analysis, which was conducted under similar assumptions as those
reflected in the macroeconomic outlook provided in Table 1 above, confirm the results of
earlier analyses provided in previous Program Appraisal Documents for this series of DPLs.
In particular, public debt is expected to decline under the baseline scenario to below 20
percent of GDP by 2015. Public external debt is expected to decline to below 11 percent of
GDP by 2015. A series of sensitivity analyses based on historical standard deviations of key
variables suggest that the public debt profile is unlikely to differ significantly from the
baseline and support the assessment that public debt sustainability is not a major concern in
the medium term.

16.     Notwithstanding the uncertainty about the near-term outlook, Peru's
macroeconomic policies are deemed adequate for the proposed loan. Fiscal policy
remains prudent as the expansion of Government expenditure in 2009 and 2010 does not
threaten fiscal sustainability. In line with the temporary nature of the economic stimulus plan,
the Government has already started to take actions to curb the expansionary stance of fiscal
policy, which is particularly noteworthy in light of the upcoming presidential elections to
take place in April 2011. Similarly, monetary and exchange rate policy is also supportive of
macroeconomic and financial stability.

                 III.      The Government Program and Participatory Processes

17.     The broad objectives in the GoP's program for 2008-2011--a solid
macroeconomic framework and reforms to generate sustainable and equitable
growth--remain unchanged since the first loan in this series. The GoP's program aims to
balance both human and economic development, and is divided into three main areas of
action: accelerating and broadening economic growth; improving social development; and
modernizing public sector institutions. The GoP has established a set of goals for the end of
the administration and is monitoring and publicly reporting progress. The progress achieved
at mid-term has been substantial, with relatively more success on the macroeconomic front
(Table 2).

18.     The two policy areas supported by this proposed loan will assist in sustaining
economic growth and spreading its fruits throughout Peruvian society. In terms of fiscal
policy, the authorities are committed to continue strengthening control of overall fiscal
balances through a more efficient tax system, managing wages and other current spending
and public debt. Beyond quantity, the GoP is also focusing on the quality of public
expenditure, implementing more rigorous monitoring and evaluation of spending programs
using performance-based budgeting techniques, simplifying and rationalizing the tax system
to reduce distortions, and making public sector processes more transparent and effective. In
the area of competitiveness, the GoP has placed emphasis in improving producers' access to
global markets and in reducing bottlenecks to trade and investment. Peru's involvement in
the world economy has continued to increase, evidenced by the full implementation of the
free trade agreement with the U.S. and Chile, the conclusion of negotiations with Singapore,
Canada, Thailand, China, the European Union, and the European Free Trade Association.
The Free Trade Agreement with Mexico was extended until 2011 and trade negotiations
continue underway with Korea and Japan. In addition, Peru started negotiations for the
Transpacific Partnership Agreement.

19.    Since September 2008, the GoP dedicated resources to mitigate the effects of the
global crisis. The GoP's priorities have been reflected in the reformulated 2009 budget, with

                                                      12
the inclusion of a two-year fiscal stimulus package of about 4 percent of GDP. For 2009, the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) increased public investment by 60 percent over the
year before (about US$2.5 billion in one year) with a particular focus on key obstacles to
growth such as social infrastructure and a strong emphasis on poorer regions of the country.
Increased public investment is occurring within a framework of overall fiscal discipline, with
an official target for the overall deficit of the public sector of less than 2 percent of GDP for
both 2009 and 2010, and returning gradually toward equilibrium in the following years. To
ensure sustainability and impact of investment, the authorities are in the process of
implementing medium-term budgeting for investment, which will ensure adequate funding
for maintenance for these new investments. A legal initiative permitting greater private
participation in public infrastructure has recently been approved, which could further spur
increased investment in needed infrastructure.

20.     Due to the expected reduction in transfers to sub-nationals, the central
government created a new mechanism to compensate for these losses by providing
funding (fideicomisos) for regional investments. Reforms to the national investment
system (Sistema Nacional de Inversión Pública--SNIP) and efforts to build capacity for
project planning and execution at the sub-national level are accelerating the ability of sub-
national governments to undertake local investment projects. These initiatives are actively
supported by the private sector and include, for example, efforts by business associations to
train municipal officials. Mining companies also provide funding for numerous local
development projects. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) Technical Assistance
Facility has a project on efficiently investing mining canon resources at the municipal level
which includes a component on public oversight to provide citizen feedback on municipal
projects.

21.     The authorities launched two results-based transfer programs to improve
efficiency of public spending at sub-national level. In January 2010, the Government
launched the Municipal Modernization Program (PMM for its Spanish acronym1) and the
Incentive Plan for the Improvement of Municipal Management (PI for its Spanish acronym2).
Despite its relatively small size (0.3 percent of GDP), the two programs are likely to
influence spending priorities of all municipal expenditures which in 2009 were worth 4.1
percent of GDP. The main goals of the PMM and the PI are: (i) to improve the financial
sustainability of municipalities by raising the collection of the property tax as well as
strengthening municipal tax administration; and (ii) to improve service delivery outcomes,
related to social services (e.g. child nutrition), infrastructure development, and business
climate (e.g. simplification of procedures for business and construction licenses). The Budget
Office at MEF is responsible for the management of these transfers, which includes
information processing and assignment of resources. Targets to trigger disbursements for
February and August 2010 have been established and for 2011 and beyond are under
revision.

22.    The authorities have a strong commitment to transparency and accountability.

targets are published in the annual Multi-year Macroeconomic Framework. The GoP has
made substantial effort to establish a broad national consensus on its policy program with the
legislative branch and society at large as reflected in consultation mechanisms like the
`mesas de concertación'. In addition, a committee consisting of the MEF, the
Superintendence of Banking and Insurance, and the central bank has been created to monitor
the impact of the global crisis and to propose prompt remedial actions.

23.    Government consultations for the policy reforms supported by this operation
take place regularly in the context of an open political process. Policies supported by this
operation were also discussed in consultations held by the government for the preparation of
the CPS with civil society. Participants included representatives of small-scale farmers and
businesspeople from the mountain region in Ayacucho, private sector representatives in
Lima, regional and local government representatives, urban and rural businesspeople, and a
diverse group of community organizations, indigenous groups, academia, religious groups
and NGOs. The CPS progress report also followed up on these issues and confirmed the need
to support the policies supported by the operation. Relevant line ministries were involved in
the preparation and dissemination of performance evaluations of priority social programs
(education, nutrition, health). These activities are supported by this loan series and also by
the Bank's Results and Accountability (REACT) DPL series in the area of social policy. The
Defensoría del Pueblo (Human Rights Ombudsman, appointed by Congress) has participated
in many of these events.


                    IV.     Bank Support to the Government Program

A. Link to the Partnership Strategy and Other Bank Operations

24.      The fourth phase of this programmatic DPL series is at the heart of the CPS.
The latest CPS for Peru was discussed by the Board on December 19, 2006; along with the
first DPL in the series, for a total amount of US$200 million. The second DPL/DDO of the
series amounted to US$370 million and was approved in August 2008. It was complemented
shortly thereafter with additional financing for US$330 million approved in December 2008
to mitigate the impact of a deteriorating economic context. The Progress Report for the CPS,
presented to the Board in February 2009, endorsed the relevance of the reform agenda
supported by this programmatic series to implement the CPS pillars aimed at maintaining
macro stability (pillar I-cluster I), accelerating growth and widening the base of growth
(pillar I-cluster II), and modernizing institutions (pillar III-cluster VI). The third DPL of the
series, amounting to US$150 million, was approved in November 2009. The fourth and final
DPL of this series, proposed under the current CPS, amounts to US$100 million and builds
on the reform progress supported by the previous operations.

25.     In the context of global uncertainty, the authorities seek Bank funding to
buttress market confidence. The GoP seeks to strike an appropriate balance between
protecting the outstanding results in debt management and maintaining flexibility to respond
to a volatile global environment. To date, the GoP has disbursed US$410 million of the
US$1.56 billion DPL/DDOs approved since August 2008. The Peruvian authorities have


                                               14
informed the Bank that they intend to disburse US$200 million by the end of CY2010 and
US$560 million during CY2011.

26.     This operation is complemented by other series of DPLs suppporting the
government's efforts to sustain the economic recovery from the global crisis. The
authorities have sought financing from the World Bank through three complementary series
of DPL-DDOs in the fiscal, social (REACT) and environmental sectors. Since August 2008,
four DPL-DDOs (including the supplemental financing for the second Fiscal Management
and Competitiveness DPL-DDO) have been approved by the Board, totaling US$1.56 billion.
At the request of the GoP, the approval of this series of loans supported the achievement of
fiscal goals set forth by the MEF and sectoral reforms implemented by line ministries.

27.     The REACT DPL series focuses on the social sectors and is complementary to
the FMCDPL series. To date, two of the three operations in the REACT series have been
approved. They support improving the performance of social programs--especially health
and education--through transparent performance standards, mechanisms to empower citizens
to demand improvements from public service providers, and stronger links between budget
decisions and final outcomes. REACT is playing an important part in the adoption of
performance-based budget management through the definition of strategic outcomes in
education, health and nutrition, linked to transparent standards. It also supports the
establishment of effective monitoring systems, based on institutional data, which allow each
service production unit to be held accountable for its performance. Both the FMCDPL and
REACT series support improved budgetary performance.

28.    In addition, a number of investment projects, non-lending technical assistance
(NLTA), and trust funds under implementation are consistent with the reform agenda
supported by this DPL. Specifically, the Institutional Capacity for Decentralization TAL
supports performance-based budgeting efforts. Bank non-lending technical assistance
(NLTA) efforts are assisting in strengthening the quality of public expenditure and the
capacity of the central and sub-national government capacity to execute public expenditures­
in the context of the stimulus package. These NLTA activities include the Programmatic
Governance and Governability NLTA, the Sub-national Pilots NLTA, and several IFC-
funded technical assistance efforts to improve the capacity of the regional and municipal
governments to manage natural resource revenues. Two Institutional Development Trust
Funds (IDFs) are also contributing to the implementation of the reform program supported by
this DPL. The Peru Public Expenditure Management IDF is focused on performance
budgeting and investment management through the Regional and Local Investment
Promotion Fund (FONIPREL) and the Strengthening Congress Budget Oversight IDF
focuses on strengthening the capacity to monitor and evaluate the quality of the budget
formulation and execution of the Peruvian Congress' Budget Commission.

B. Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors

29.    The Bank collaborated closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
the development and implementation of the last Stand-By Agreement (SBA) which
expired in January 2009. The SBA was approved by the IMF Board on January 26, 2007
and entailed SDR172.4 million to support Peru's economic program. Peru treated the
                                            15
agreement as precautionary in a context of strong fiscal discipline. The fourth and last
program review was successfully completed in January 2009. As in the previous two SBAs,
no withdrawals were requested and Peru did not pursue a new agreement. Upon completion
of the SBA, the IMF and the World Bank have maintained a close dialogue on Peru,
particularly in the areas of monitoring the macro situation, discussing the GoP program, and
evaluating Bank operations. The latest IMF Article IV Consultations were satisfactorily
concluded in April 2010.

30.     The Bank's close coordination with the donor community in Peru, including
bilateral and multilateral organizations, continues. The design of policy-based operations
has been coordinated with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), the IMF and the
Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF), as well as several bilateral agencies which also
support policy reform, including the German Development Bank (KfW), GTZ, United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), JBIC, DFID, SDC and the European
Commission, among others. This coordination extends to investment lending operations in
the areas of transport, education, health, social protection, fiscal management,
competitiveness, competitiveness, rural electrification, water and sanitation, water resources
management, rural development, justice and governance initiatives, and nutrition. The World
Bank Group (WBG) is also strengthening its partnership with the Global Water and
Sanitation Program around the "Agua para Todos" program. The Bank has been a leading
actor in donor thematic groups and has hosted several workshops in the areas of
decentralization, justice modernization, education, and rural development.

31.     Strong donor cooperation around budgetary management at the national and
local levels is particularly relevant for this proposed DPL operation. The Bank and the
IADB maintain close coordination in the design and implementation of their policy loans. In
a recent programmatic series now completed, IADB supported performance-based budgeting
specifically linked to investment spending, which complemented well the Bank's work on
budgeting reform in other areas. The GoP has ensured that the areas of support are
complementary and not redundant. Several bilateral programs are also supporting related
reforms, including those of KfW (which co-financed earlier loans in this and previous
programmatic series), USAID and the Swiss aid agency SDC.

32.     Peru's competitiveness agenda has also benefited from coordinated support
between the World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral partners. The Peru teams
of the IFC and the Bank are in close collaboration regarding the competiveness agenda
supported by this operation. The IFC in conjunction with the World Bank's Doing Business
team is providing technical assistance to the National Competitiveness Agency (CNC) in
activities linked to a set of reforms specifically targeted to improve Peru's business
environment. The IADB is also working on helping smaller-scale agricultural producers
improve competitiveness to take better advantage of free trade agreements and reducing
productivity constraints to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). USAID, SDC and
the European Commission are also all involved in projects to increase the flow of credit to
MSMEs to improve their ability to invest and grow.

C. Lessons Learned

33.     An important lesson learned is that a strong focus on a limited number of key
outcomes based on a well-defined program that is a priority for the GoP is essential for
the sustainability of reforms. The GoP's strong desire to consolidate the progress achieved
under the previous operations has resulted in strong ownership of the next phases of the
series-- with a focus on a limited number of outcomes to increase their development impact
and sustainability. In addition, throughout the implementation of the reforms under the DPL
series, it has been clear that complex reforms take time and require building consensus and
awareness of the benefits of reforms among the main stakeholders. In particular, resistance
to modernizing public finance is often strong, so sequencing together with training and
capacity building are critical for success. The program of policies and reforms under this
series has taken this lesson into consideration, as well as with the reality that there is no
perfect "end state" since further improvement is always possible.

34.     In addition to the need for selectivity and adequate phasing, it is important to
maintain flexibility to react to potential changes in policy priorities in the context of
local and global uncertainty. The strong focus on fiscal discipline that characterized the
previous operation had to be adjusted to address the increasing impact of the global financial
crisis. Counter-cyclical policies called for significant increases in public expenditures that
justified a shift in previous fiscal targets and policies. The programmatic approach calls for
built-in flexibility both at the policy level and allocation of resources to address unforeseen
changes in the country's development needs. The evolving impact of the global crisis is clear
evidence of the need for a flexible approach.

D. Analytic Underpinnings

35.     The DPL supports a sub-set of policies within the GoP's broad reform program.
These policies were selected on the basis of analytical work aimed at determining key
policies with large development impact. Substantial diagnostic work has informed the design
of the proposed loan. Some studies have been completed, and others are underway. For
example, the recent Public Expenditure and Financial Management Assessment completed
and the ongoing Public Expenditure Review have contributed to inform policy dialogue in
the areas of public financial management and fiscal transparency. Similarly, the Governance
and Governability NLTA supported policy analysis related to results-based transfers to sub-
national governments, which underpinned the reforms supported by this operation. On the
competitiveness agenda, the Informality ESW addressed the question of how informality
affects the productivity and competitiveness of small and medium-sized businesses (see
Annex 6 for a detailed summary of analytical and advisory work underpinning the proposed
operation).

                             V.      The Proposed Operation

A. Operation Description

36.    The proposed operation responds to the GoP's request for continued Bank
support of its broad reform agenda and its reaction to the crisis. This operation is the
Fourth in a series of four loans each supporting implementation progress in a well defined
economic program. The two policy areas supported by this DPL are:

           Efficiency and Quality of Fiscal Management
           Competitiveness

37.     Fiscal management and competitiveness are mutually reinforcing areas which
offer a potentially significant payoff in terms of economic growth, social development
and poverty reduction. Strong fiscal management improves the effectiveness of limited
public resources and supports country competitiveness by generating private sector
confidence in overall macroeconomic stability and the ability to undertake long-term
investments and planning. In turn, increased competitiveness improves the fiscal situation by
generating tax revenues and decreasing the need for government intervention to stimulate
economic growth. Together, reforms in these two areas may strengthen the ability to achieve
GoP's goal of accelerating and broadening economic growth to improve the standard of
living of all Peruvians, especially the poor. The mix of macroeconomic policy stability with
gradual structural reforms thus far has already shown positive results in terms of greater
business creation and growth, generating confidence that these trends will continue going
forward. Moreover, the combination of high growth with prudent fiscal/financial
management will provide additional fiscal space to address social needs.

38.     The programmatic approach taken by this loan series reflects the flexibility
requested by the GoP to best address evolving challenges. By incorporating flexibility
into the FMCDPL series within a defined policy framework, the Bank is serving the needs of
Peru, a middle-income country with strong macro-economic fundamentals now facing
second and third generation reform challenges. While broad policy areas were established
from the start of the series, specific policy actions have evolved along with Peru's changing
political and economic circumstances. The policy actions supported by this DPL were chosen
by the GoP as critical to achieve fiscal management and competitiveness outcomes (Box 1).

                             Box 1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
 There is broad consensus in the administration and the legislature on the importance of the fiscal
    management and competitiveness reforms supported by this loan series. Evidence of this is steady
    parliamentary support for fiscal discipline by all parties, passage of two successive budgets including the
    new performance-based budgeting initiative, and the broad participation of sub-national governments in
    administrative reforms and e-government procedures.
 The García administration has demonstrated an excellent track record in maintaining a stable
    macroeconomic framework and clear, sustained policy directions regarding improving the impact of public
    spending and improving country competitiveness to sustain high growth and poverty reduction.
 By designing the loan in close alignment with the GoP's own policy reform priorities, the Bank has
    maintained harmony between the loan program and the policy realities faced by the administration. The
    GoP has committed its political capital to reforms which will be positive for the country's development and
    which are supported by this loan series.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
 The policy matrix was negotiated with the aim of choosing measurable, relevant program progress
    indicators while leaving sufficient flexibility to address the changing needs and priorities of a fast-
    developing middle-income country with strong fundamentals.
 The policies addressed in the loan series are well-coordinated with the IADB, which ensures that that the
    programs provide mutual support without overlap and with several bilateral donor and technical assistance
    projects currently working on related projects in Peru.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
 The modalities and timing of the lending program are based on specific requests by the GoP so that the
    Bank can provide optimum support for Peru's specific needs. The Bank program is designed to evolve as
    the country's needs evolve, within a defined group of policy areas and outcome goals.
 The policies involved in the FMCDPL series derive directly from the priorities of both the previous and
    current administrations in the area of fiscal management and competitiveness. For example, to address the
    current difficulties arising from the international economic crisis, the Bank worked with the GoP to replace
    policy conditions related to fiscal decentralization with those supporting a well-targeted economic stimulus
    plan, putting off the original policy reforms until conditions improve.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
 Despite the policy complexity of fiscal management and competitiveness, this loan series has chosen a
    reduced number of benchmarks, and even fewer program triggers, that were considered by both the Bank
    team and the GoP to embody the reforms most critical for maintaining a steady policy reform direction.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
    The progress reviews for FMCDPL III took place in parallel with the discussions for this Fourth proposed
    loan in the series. Bank staff specializing in all loan policy areas as well as fiduciary and oversight areas
    held detailed discussions with relevant representatives of the GoP regarding measurable progress in
    achieving program triggers and benchmarks. Further discussions are planned to assess developments during
    the course of 2009, and the Bank stands ready to provide technical assistance as needed to achieve the
    triggers called for under this proposed loan.

B. Policy Areas

39.     This is the last in a series of four programmatic DPLs supporting policy reforms
in the areas fiscal management and competitiveness. Overall, reform progress in both
policy fronts has been positive. Fiscal policy has remained prudent. Tax administration has
improved thanks to government efforst to simplify tax regulations and tax payment
procedures. Financial management and fiscal transparency have been strengthened.
Achievements worth mentioning include the approval of the Treasury and Accounting
System Laws, which brought the budget classification syste in line with international
standars. The implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) consolidated over 80
percent of all public resources and strengthened the government's cash management system.
The introduction of public expenditure performance information in the budgeting process
(measuring outcomes and performing independent evaluations of service delivery) is also a
remarkable achievement. On the competitiveness front, the authorities have expanded
international trade through the signing of FTAs with the USA, China and more recently, with
the EU, inter alia. These trade agreements have acted as catalysts to improve the country's
competitiveness, opening new market opportunities and facilitating trade across borders. See
Annexes 3 and 4 for a summary of the prior actions and outcomes achieved over the loan
series.

40.     The GoP has continued to make substantial progress as evidenced by the prior
actions taken under this fourth operation. These prior actions are discussed in detail in the
next sections. There has been significant progress in the six policy areas seeking to
strengthen the quality and transparency fiscal management, with the exception of the e-
government agenda, that experienced delays owing to institutional changes. The program has
supported an improved debt and cash management. It contributed to set up the Treasury
Single Account, which now channels 80 percent of all public resources whereas no such
Treasurey Single Account existed at the outset of the program. The DPL series has also
supported the gradual introduction of performance-based budgeting, both in terms of
introducing strategic programs that reflect the policy priorities of the GoP and also making
available new performance information from evaluations of public expenditure interventions.
Ten such evaluations of public expenditure have now been conducted and three of them have
already led to agreements on how to improve public service delivery. Substantial progress
has also been achieved on the policy areas related to competitiveness, as reflected in the
signing of free trade agreements with the EU and EFTA, the reduction of tariffs, and
regulations to promote asset securitization. See Table 3 for a summary of the prior actions
under this fourth DPL and the corresponding indicative triggers that were agreed with the
GoP in the previous operation.

   NB: * Refers to policy measures that are a continuation of a reform already initiated under previous operations in this
   series and are therefore considered a benchmark.



1. Efficiency and Quality of Fiscal Management

41.     A central element of the administration's policy agenda is to continue
strengthening macroeconomic stability and fiscal prudence, while improving the quality
of public expenditure. Policy areas to achieve the program objectives include strengthening
fiscal rules as well as public debt management and tax policy; improving the efficiency of
budgetary accounting; implementing efficient, performance-based budgeting; and increasing
transparency and agility in public processes, including procurement. Going forward, the key
challenge will be to continue improving the quality of public expenditure at all levels of
government while preserving the fiscal prudence that has characterized the conduct of
macroeconomic policy in Peru in recent years.

Increase the Sustainability and Transparency of Fiscal Policy

42.     The fiscal framework has proven to be sufficiently flexible to support a counter-
cyclical stance while preserving long-term fiscal stability. In 2009 the authorities acted
decisively to soften the impact of the global economic crisis by launching a stimulus package
that quickly turned Peru's budget balance from a surplus of 2 percent of GDP to a deficit of
1.9 percent of GDP. Such a counter-cyclical stance was consistent with existing fiscal rules.
The Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law (Law 27958 of May 10, 2003) limits the
annual non-financial public sector deficit to 1 percent of GDP. However, Article 5 states that
in the case of a an international crisis that can seriously affect the domestic economy,
Congress can, at the request of the executive, grant exceptions to the fiscal rules for a period
of up to three years. The global economic crisis was an exceptional situation that justified the
use of the room for maneuver built into the law. In this context, the administration proposed
legislation to increase the limit on the fiscal deficit to 2 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010. In
addition, the limits on the growth of current public expenditures, set at 3 percent annually in
real terms, were temporarily increased to 10 percent in 2009 and to 8 percent in 2010. The
legislation was approved by Congress as Law 29368 on May 29, 2009.

43.    Fiscal policy continues to support macroeconomic stability. The authorities have
responded quickly to the economic recovery in early 2010. As the economy started to pick up
in 2010 the Government has tightened its fiscal policy stance and the fiscal deficit is

                                                          23
projected to be 1.6 percent of GDP in 2010 (instead of the 2 percent of GDP which would be
within the legal framework). The authorities have demonstrated that they remain committed
to a prudent fiscal policy, as shown by the measures adopted in May 2010 to limit the growth
of public spending on goods and services for 2010 at 3 percent in nominal terms. The fiscal
deficit is expected to decrease to below 1 percent of GDP in 2011 and to return to surplus by
2013. Thus, the size of the fiscal deficits planned for the next three years are relatively
limited and are not expected to pose a risk to public debt sustainability (Annex 1). In
addition, the authorities have revised the set up of the Fuel Stabilization Fund, which since its
inception in September 2004 has used up around $1.6 billion in public resources (or 7.5 times
the amount spent on the conditional cash transfer program Juntos). The changes introduced
will allow for a faster adjustment to the consumer price ceilings (which lead to a drawdown
of resources from the stabilization fund) and, as a result, aim to achieve the self-sufficiency
of the fund over the medium term. Overall, the authorities are aware of the importance to
create fiscal space during years of high economic growth that could allow, as it did in 2009,
for a countercyclical fiscal policy during times of crisis.

44.    To incentivize local governments to improve their performance two new
conditional transfer schemes have been launched. The GoP has launched two mechanisms
to provide incentives for municipalities to increase their efforts on priorities such as reducing
malnutrition and improving the business environment and to broaden the still very narrow tax
base at the local government level. The goal is to provide an incentive scheme by which
municipalities that meet certain targets would benefit from higher transfers of Municipal
Compensatory Fund (FONCOMUN) resources--a fund on which many municipalities draw
largely for their recurrent expenditures. The schemes have been designed so that the
heterogeneity of municipalities is taken into account, so that targets on local tax collection
are only set for larger urban municipalities. Importantly, the targets set pertain to areas where
the municipalities play a significant role. For example, targets pertaining to the business
environment refer to the licenses for opening and operating a business, which are a municipal
responsibility.

45.     Targets for municipalities are set so as to require a gradual improvement in
performance. The targets have also been set in a progressive manner, with the first set of
targets being relatively simple ones, such as whether municipalities display information
about their processes to the public. While the transfers are relatively small (around 0.3
percent of GDP), they have the potential to help improve the performance of the local level
of government and also help shape the priorities of the overall local spending, which stood at
4.1 percent of GDP in 2009. So far municipalities have complied with most of the targets set
for them for the first assessment that took place in March 2010 and, on aggregate, will
receive 88 percent of the potential resources available to them (the undisbursed resources
will be distributed at the end of the year among the municipalities that meet all targets in both
the March and September evaluations).

46.    Going forward, a key challenge is to maintain the sound fiscal management that
has served Peru well in recent years. Peru has taken the opportunity of high economic
growth to bring down debt and build a fiscal space. The budget balance was in surplus for the
three years to 2008, when it reached a surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP. This has served Peru

                                               24
well, allowing the authorities to implement a countercyclical fiscal policy in 2009 without
compromising long-term macroeconomic sustainability. As the economy recovers, the
authorities are focused on rebuilding the fiscal room for maneuver.

Actions completed under the Program (DPL IV)

47.    Prior actions completed by the Borrower under the Program include the
following (Annex 3):

       (1) Issuance of various legal instruments pertaining to performance-based transfer of
           resources from the Executive to Municipalities, including, inter alia, the
           following: (a) Decree (Decreto de Urgencia No. 119-2009 Modifican Artículos
           de las Leyes Nos. 29332 y 29465 y Dictan Medidas Extraordinarias Para el
           Financiamiento de la Continuidad de las Inversiones durante el Año Fiscal
           2010) dated December 23, 2009 and published in the Borrower's Official
           Gazette (El Peruano) on December 24, 2009; (b) Supreme Decrees no. 002-
           2010-EF and 003-2010-EF, both dated January 11, 2010 and published in the
           Borrower's Gazette (El Peruano) on January 12, 2010 estalishing the procedures
           regulating performance measurement criteria and targets and the allocation of
           resources to Municipalities; and (c) Resolution no. 008-2010-EF/76.01 issued by
           the Directorate of Public Budget on March 30, 2010 and published in the the
           Borrower's Gazette (El Peruano) on April 1, 2010, approving the results of
           compliance by Municipalities of performance targets as reported by said
           Municipalities by February 2010.

Make the Tax System More Neutral and Stable

48.     The goal of increasing the tax base became increasingly difficult in 2009 as the
authorities coped with the impact of the global economic crisis. In 2009 tax revenues
dropped sharply to 13.8 percent of GDP, down from 15.6 percent of GDP in 2008. By
comparison the average for lower middle income countries stands around 19 percent of GDP.
The difficult economic environment also made it difficult to redress other features of the tax
system that still hamper its neutrality. For example, the severe drop in exports, which fell by
15 percent in 2009, prompted authorities to temporarily increase the so-called `duty
drawback' for exporters (aimed at compensating exporters for tariffs paid on imported
inputs) from 5 to 8 percent of the value of exports. Similarly, a new tax exemption was
introduced by which producers operating in high altitudes of more than 2,500 meters above
sea level (but excluding regional capitals) are exempt from income tax, tariffs, and sales tax
for a period of 10 years (Law 29482).

49.     The authorities introduced a tax on capital gains. In line with the intention to
reduce the gap between the tax rates on labor and capital income, the authorities passed a law
in December 2009 (No. 29492) and its regulations in February 2010 for taxing capital gains
from stocks. The applicable tax rate differs on whether the capital gains accrue to a legal
entity (30 percent) or a person (5 percent). Besides the introduction of the capital gains tax,
other tax measures implemented during 2009 that have helped to make the tax system more

                                              25
neutral include the reduction of the financial transfers tax from 0.07 to 0.06 percent, the
reduction of the temporary tax on net assets from 0.5 to 0.4 percent.

50.     On-line access to tax administration services has continued to improve. The
progress in this regard noted in the previous operation has continued. In the most recent
income tax annual declaration 95 percent of all taxpayers filed online. The administration
remains committed to reducing tax compliance costs, in particular by facilitating on-line
services. Following SUNAT Resolution 036/2010, published on January 31, 2010, the
authorities launched in February 2010 a new simplified virtual tax return for the monthly
returns to be filed by third-category income (income from professional or business activities)
regarding income tax and VAT. In addition, the authorities have launched a new report which
will allow taxpayers to obtain on-line certificates showing that they are current with the tax
authorities, facilitating for example access to credit for the taxpayer. These and other on-line
services are expected to help lower the cost of tax compliance and contribute to broadening
the tax base.

51.     Going forward, continuing to make tax system more neutral by reducing
compliance costs and tax exemptions will help to increase the tax base. The authorities
remain committed to increasing the tax base, which is eroded by tax exemptions as well as
evasion. Addressing tax exemptions has proven to be particularly challenging and remains an
area where further progress can be made. Similarly, while tax evasion has many
determinants, reducing tax compliance costs may help reduce informality and would also
help reduce the burden on micro and small businesses. The authorities have set out a clear
path for simplifying tax administration through a variety of on-line services.

Actions completed under the Program (DPL IV)

52.    Prior actions completed by the Borrower under the Program include the
following (Annex 3):

       (2) Issuance of Resolution No. 036-2010/SUNAT dated January 29, 2010 and
           publihed in the Borrower's Official Gazette (El Peruano) on January 31, 2010,
           providing for procedures aimed at improving tax compliance, through, inter alia,
           the establishment of online tax filing procedures (Formulario Virtual para la
           Declaración y Pago de Renta de Segunda Categoría) in regard to income taxes
           (impuesto a la renta).

Strengthen Budget Reporting and Planning

53.    In terms of security and liquidity, the current coverage of the Peruvian Treasury
Single Account (TSA) is sufficient, at this time, to meet international standards. There
has been, however, a delay with respect to transitioning into the TSA the revenues of
FONCOMUN. The inclusion of FONCOMUN into the TSA is now expected to take place in
July 2010. To that end, the MEF has internally agreed on the actions required, including the
implementation and operation of some functions in the existing Financial Integrated
Administration System (SIAF for its initials in Spanish). Additionally, the National

                                              26
Directorate of the Public Treasury (Dirección Nacional de Tesoro Público, DNTP) is also
working on a strategy that allows them to deal with certain legal and administrative issues
that may arise in the operation of the TSA once FONCOMUN proceeds are included. The
directly collected revenues (RdR) will be gradually incorporated into the TSA following a
medium term framework.

54.    Progress has also been made in eliminating redundant bank accounts within the
public sector. Although the actual number of bank accounts is less important than whether
the funds in all accounts are managed virtually as a virtual single account (TSA), the DNTP
has also made progress in eliminating redundant accounts. Since the implementation of the
TSA, about 5,000 bank accounts (opened in the Banco de la Nación) have been closed and an
additional 2,500 bank accounts are expected to be closed by the end of 2010.

55.     Financial reports from the TSA continue to be generated and evaluated on a
daily, weekly and monthly basis by MEF. These reports are provided to the Cash
Committee that reviews the monthly cash reports, which provide an up-to-date data regarding
projections of the cash position, allowing the committee to make more informed decisions in
adjusting the original cash plan. Additionally, the DNTP will work with the support of an
international consultant in the design of an improved cash flow.

56.    The design of the new integrated financial management system (SIAF II) has
continued to make progress. The conceptual framework for the SIAF II was approved in
March, 2010. On that basis, the budget programming module is expected to be launched in
March 2011 on a pilot basis for the preparation of the 2012 budget.

57.      The 2009 Consolidated Government Financial Statements reflects the
implementation of the new budget classification system and the new chart of accounts.
This change in the presentation of the Consolidated Government Financial Statements
(Cuenta General de la República) will bring Peru in line with international standards.
Despite the challenges associated to the change in such a complex information system, the
transition has been relatively smooth since only 10 percent of the implementing agencies ­
largely small municipalities ­ were unable to comply with the submission of financial reports
under the new system by end-March 2010 (compared to 5 percent of non-complying entities
under the previous system in 2009). The Consolidated Government Financial Statements for
2009 and the corresponding audit report will be presented to the National Congress by
August 15, 2010, thus providing additional elements on the results of the use of public funds
to for the discussion and approval of the budget bill for the following year. This improvement
in the timeliness for the submission of audited Consolidated Financial statements represents a
key step towards increasing transparency in public resource management.

58.     Going forward the authorities aim at strengthening further the transparency of
public accounts, helped by the launch of a new integrated financial system (SIAF II).
While Peru has made great progress to improve the efficiency and transparency of public
accounts, the authorities remain committed to making further progress in this area. [In the
short-term the new Consolidated Government Financial Statements and the corresponding
audit report require an amendment to the General National Accounting System Law (Law

                                             27
28708)]. In the medium-term, the shift to a new integrated financial system (SIAF II) will
pose logistical challenges to ensure a smooth transition.

Actions completed under the Program (DPL IV)

59.    Prior actions completed by the Borrower under the Program include the
following (Annex 3):

        (3) Enactment by the Legislature of the Borrower's Law No. 29537 dated June 7,
           2010 and published in the Borrower's Official Gazette (El Peruano) on June 8,
           2010, mandating the timely preparation and disclosure of consolidated
           government financial statements (Cuenta General de la República) and audit
           reports aimed at strengthening further the Borrower's budget reporting capacity.

Increase Equity in Intergovernmental Transfers

60.     The launch of FONIPREL and the changes to the allocation of the FONCOR
were early efforts to address the inequity in the transfer mechanisms. The first two years
of operation of FONIPREL proved a success in competitively allocating funds for projects in
poor regions. Under this fund, municipal and regional governments submit proposals for
investment projects that are assessed on the basis of project feasibility and their expected
impact on poverty reduction. Moreover, 88 percent of resources went to areas which are
classified as having less access to other resources. Besides FONIPREL, the GoP also
introduced changes in 2007 and 2008 to the formula for calculating the coefficients used for
distributing transfers under the Regional Compensation Fund (FONCOR). The new formulas
take into consideration the gap between regional needs (a function of population, poverty,
geographical location, and a performance indicator related to the execution of investment
projects) and other transfers that the region receives, including canon and regalías.

61.     The fiscal stimulus plan also included measures to help make transfers to the
regions more equitable in 2009 and 2010. As part of the economic stimulus plan the
authorities earmarked 2.6 billion nuevos soles for regional governments (Decree 028-2009).
The specific allocations take into account the extent to which individual regional
governments receive other transfers. While all regional governments are to receive transfers
under this policy, the final allocation was tilted towards poorer regions and those without
access to canon and regalías.

62.     Most recently, the authorities have modified the methodology to distribute the
FONCOMUN among municipalities, resulting in more equitable transfers. In 2010 the
authorities changed the methodology for distributing the municipal compensation fund, so
that a broader set of unmet needs was taken into account (under the previous methodology
the only criterion for the allocation of funds among provinces was the infant mortality rate).
The new methodology also considers variables such as the fiscal effort of municipalities and
the extent to which they are prioritizing on public investment to allocate funds among
different municipalities within a given province. All in all, the change in methodology for the



                                              28
allocation of FONCOMUN will decrease the Gini coefficient of FONCOMUN transfers from
0.39 in 2009 to 0.35 in 2010.

63.     Going forward a key challenge to increase the equity of inter-governmental
transfers is to take account of existing mechanisms to share revenues from natural
resources. The canon and other mechanisms by which revenues from natural resources are
divided between the central, regional and local governments can exacerbate regional
disparities as well as generating vertical asymmetries between levels of government. The
authorities have continued to allocate funds to regional governments using the new
methodology for determining transfers under FONCOR that was first used in 2007 and that
helps to reduce inequities in intergovernmental transfers. The authorities have increasingly
taken such factors into account. This is evidenced by the changes to the FONCOR and
FONCOMUN transfer schemes, and the setting up of the FONIPREL.

Actions completed under the Program (DPL IV)

64.    Prior actions completed by the Borrower under the Program include the
following (Annex 3):

        (4) Issuance of Supreme Decree No. 060-2010-EF dated February 17, 2010 and
            published in the Borrower's Official Gazette (El Peruano) on February 18, 2010,
            setting forth a new methodology for the allocation of FONCOMUN resources to
            Municipalities, thereby promoting equity in transfers of resources from the
            Executive to the Municipalities.

Improve the Efficiency and Impact of Public Spending

65.    The GoP has maintained a strong emphasis on improving the quality and impact
of public spending, giving a results-orientation to the budget. The GoP decided to
introduce performance-based budgeting, and launched its formal efforts in the 2007 and 2008
Budget Laws to aid budget decision-making, with the focus on improving the performance
and accountability of public spending. The results-orientation is based on the gradual
implementation of three complementary pillars: (i) budget programming; (ii) monitoring and
evaluation; and (iii) developing tools to collect the information required.

66.      Progress was made in 2009 in all three pillars of the results-oriented budget.
First, budgetary programming with a results orientation was extended to 15 strategic
programs for the 2010 budget, up from 9 strategic programs in 2009 and 5 programs in 2008.
As a result, the share of budget under strategic programs increased from 4 percent in 2008 to
9 percent in 2009 to 13 percent in 2010. In addition, the authorities have introduced 60
institutional programs in the 2010 budget. Such institutional programs also display a results-
orientation as they relate inputs to outputs of a given agency. Second, results-oriented
executive evaluations continue to be developed. Following the initial independent
evaluations of four budgetary programs in 2008, the authorities commissioned an additional
ten independent evaluations in 2009, all of which have been made public on the MEF
website. Agreements with the implementing agencies on the recommendations from three of

                                             29
the first four evaluations have been reached and were made public. Third, the data gathering
efforts have been noteworthy. The number of executing agencies that report detailed
information on inputs, outputs, and intermediate outcomes to the results secretariat in MEF
through software (SIGA-PpR) has increased from one thousand in 2008 to more than six
thousand in 2010.

67.    More broadly, Peru continues to make progress in putting in place the
foundations for performance-based budgeting. These include the multi-year budget
perspective, a programmatic budget classification, robust financial management and
evaluation information management systems, and the development of well-defined measures
of performance that link priority policies, objectives and programs. The Budget Office
(DGPP) has also strengthened its role in the process, as reflected by the internal
reorganization within MEF in March 2010.

68.    Going forward the challenge remains to continue strengthening the linkages
between budget allocations and program outputs. The authorities intend to continue to
extend and deepen their reforms as described above over the medium term. This is an
ambitious undertaking and international experience suggests that it will be important to
continually monitor and evaluate the experiences and to adapt the performance-informed
budget framework where desired. Over the longer term, it will be important to link the
performance-based budget framework to the process for the drawing up of a Multiple-year
Budget Framework.

Benchmarks completed under the Program (DPL IV)

69.    Benchmarks completed by the Borrower under the Program include the
following (Annex 3):3

             The Borrower has included six additional budgetary programs with a results-
             orientation framework in the 2010 Budget Law.

Make Public Sector Processes More Transparent, Accessible and Agile

70.     The e-procurement agenda has shown significant progress since the last
operation in this series. The Bank continued providing technical assistance to the
Government supporting the National Procurement Strategy and its implementation plan. The
strategy along with the use of OECD benchmarking indicators helped in establishing a
baseline of the performance of the national procurement system with the appropriate
strategies to strengthen the system. The authorities have also reorganized the Supervisory
Unit for State Procurement (Organismo Supervisor de las Contrataciones del Estado--
OSCE).

  The policy measures completed by the Borrower are a continuation of a reform already initiated under
previous operations in this series and are therefore considered a benchmark.


                                                 30
71.     The development of the National Procurement Strategy sets Peru on a path
toward consolidating a modern national procurement system. The Plan to implement the
Procurement Strategy identifies eight key areas that will be addressed within a coordinated
framework to strengthen the performance of the national procurement system. When
implemented, these strategic areas will provide the GoP with a dynamic, transparent and
efficient system--an increasingly critical tool to implement the GoP's policy agenda.
According to OSCE information database, Peru's national procurement system only achieves
about 40 percent of its planned activities. Further pressure is placed on this system by the
government stimulus program. Currently, at the request of the GoP, the Bank is providing
procurement assistance in the context of the economic stimulus package, with a particular
focus on infrastructure spending.

72.     The legal framework for procurement has been improved. A new procurement
law was approved (Decree 1017), together with its regulation. This law establishes the
division of the regulatory and procurement functions. OSCE will continue its regulatory
role, while the newly-established PeruCompras agency will be in charge of
aggregate/strategic procurement and framework contracts. However, the appointment of a
director and team for PeruCompras is still pending.

73.     In contrast, progress in other areas of e-Government, including regarding the
digital signature, has experienced delays. The authorities remain committed to the
objective of bringing the e-government and digital agendas in line with changes in evolving
international information and communications technology (ICT) standards. However,
progress has been limited, in part as a result of institutional changes at the National E-
Government Office (Oficina Nacional de Gobierno Electrónico e Informática--ONGEI).

74.     Going forward, further progress in public procurement will help to make public
processes more agile. While progress has been made in the procurement agenda, there
remain a number of key areas to be strengthened. In the short- and medium-term these
include: (i) implement the procurement accreditation framework; (ii) carry out in-depth
studies and diagnoses of Procurement Planning Manuals, planning and payroll systems,
mechanisms for assessing the quality of planning and, ranking of entities in the quality and
efficiency of its procurement; (iii) develop three standard bidding documents for specific
sectors; (iv) review the Regulation of the Procurement Law and; (v) continue with the
development of the new version of the e-GP System SEACE II.

2. Competitiveness

76.     Peru's resilience to the global crisis owes to its prudent macroeconomic policy
management. However, sustaining economic growth requires improvements in the
country's competitiveness. The World Economic Forum ranks Peru 78rd in its
Competitiveness Index, an improvement compared to the 83rd ranking in the previous year.
However, Peru lags behind regional competitors, such as Chile (30), Brazil (56) or Mexico
(60) (See Figure 5). Competitiveness is affected by cumbersome business regulations, high
trade and logistics costs and low innovation.
                                 Figure 5: Peru's Competitiveness Ranking5




                        Source: World Economic Forum, 2009


77.     Competiveness and policies to foster deeper trade integration continue to be key
pillars of the Government's policy agenda to support growth. Competitiveness and the
investment climate have and will continue to benefit from several of the reforms noted in the
previous section, in particular fiscal and public debt consolidation, improved transparency in
economic policy and a modern public sector. A number of bottlenecks to private sector
activity are being addressed by specific policies, particularly regarding procedure
simplification, sustainable expansion of private credit, and fostering innovation practices
especially to MSMEs. The government has also launched measures to reduce transaction
costs to start, operate and close a business. According to Doing Business (2010), in 2009
starting a business took 9 procedures and 41 days, compared to 10 procedures, 65 days and
25 percent of per capita income in 2008.

Expand and Deepen International Trade

78.  Peru's export performance was affected by the global crisis but recovered by
December 2009. Peru's export performance has been impressive over the last years, with

compound annual growth rates averaging above 21 percent between 2003 and 2009.
However, as the global crisis unfolded, export growth slowed down to 12 percent in 2008
and -14 percent in 2009. The global slump hurt the performance of Peru's large exporting
companies producing traditional commodity products (especially minerals and
hydrocarbons). However, by December 2009, they were back to the levels prior to the crisis,
with traditional exports amounting to US$2.8 billion, a 43 percent increase compared to the
same month in 2008. Non-traditional exports (textiles and agro-business) held up relatively
well, although they represent a small share of total exports, about 23 percent (about US$6.3
billion). In spite of their strong performance, total exports in Peru still represent a low
percentage of GDP, about 21 percent in 2009.

79.     The administration has moved ahead in deepening connections to international
markets and promoting trade diversification. The Peru-U.S. Trade Promotion Agreement
(TPA), a comprehensive free trade agreement, entered into force on February 1, 2009. Since
this date, Peru has passed more than 100 regulatory measures related to the treaty's
implementation, including those related to intellectual property and copyright protection.
Peru's FTA with Chile came into effect in March 2009. The FTA with China (Peru's second-
largest trading partner) became effective on March 1, 2010. In August 2009, two additional
FTAs--one with Canada and one with Singapore--went into effect, and similar
arrangements with Republic of Korea, Japan and other countries are underway. Trade
expansion is expected to continue to help Peru create a more diversified portfolio of export
markets. In 2009 the United States (U.S.) and the European Union (EU) accounted for about
one-third of traditional exports products and 40 percent of non-traditional products, with the
remainder purchased by other countries around the world. China, in particular, has become a
major consumer of Peruvian traditional exports, roughly equal to the U.S. and EU in 2009.

80.    The GoP continued reducing average tariffs and tariff dispersion as well as
simplifying the tariff structure, benefiting consumers as well as exporters who rely on
imported inputs. Following the major tariff reduction in October 2007 involving over 4000
products, the administration undertook two further reductions in 2009, simplifying the tariff


                                                                     33
structure to just three levels--0 percent, 9 percent and 17 percent--with an average tariff of 5
percent and tariff dispersion of 5.9 percent.

81.    The administration took several temporary measures to ease the impact of the
crisis on export industries, and is gradually reversing them. In January 2009, the
drawback program to support non-traditional exports was increased from 5 to 8 percent for
the duration of the calendar year. In December 2009, the government issued a decree seeking
to reduce the drawback program from 8 to 6.5 percent by July of 2010, and back to 5 percent
by December 2010.

82.    The promotion of micro, small and medium exporting enterprises remains a key
policy priority. In early 2009, the administration set aside US$100 million to expand access
to credit for small and medium exporting firms. These resources will be available until
March 2011. In addition, the administration supported the creation of a new insurance
program called Sepymex, backed by US$83 million and managed by the second-tier
development bank COFIDE. The program offers insurance coverage to pre-shipment credits
given by a financial institution to a small or medium exporting firm (less than US$8 million
of exports per year). The coverage is 50 percent of the total loan insured, up to a maximum
US$3 million. In addition, to promote exports by micro and small firms, the GoP increased
the exportable sale value of products of the Exporta Fácil program from US$2,000 to
US$5,000.

83.     In 2009, the GoP created two funds geared toward the support of small and
medium-sized enterprises and their integration into global markets through the
provision of training, technological innovation and access to finance. The Research and
Development for Competitiveness Fund (Fondo de Investigación y Desarrollo para la
Competitividad--FIDECOM) aims to (i) promote research and development for productive
innovation in firms and (ii) develop and strengthen capacities for generating and applying
technological knowledge towards upgrading productive and management capabilities in
micro-firms. Project proposals will compete for FIDECOM resources on the basis of impact,
feasibility, and cost-benefit considerations. Calls for projects will be conducted periodically
and a process of evaluation is contemplated to select the beneficiaries. Currently FIDECOM
has allocated 200 million nuevos soles to develop its activities. FIDECOM's regulations
were approved in February 2009, an executive committee has been convened, and the science
and technology fund FINCYT--which has proven experience in administering technology
funds--has been named as FIDECOM's technical secretariat. Putting FIDECOM in
operation, however, implies a significant challenge, as there is no experience of managing a
competitive fund in Peru's public sector. A proper legal framework needs to be developed to
operate FIDECOM, which is under design by the fund's executive committee. The second
fund to access financial factoring services is still in the design stage.

84.    Going forward, the GoP is committed to continue trade expansion through the
signing of Free Trade Agreements. The GoP successfully concluded negotiations of the
FTA with the EU in May 2010. Four negotiation rounds of the FTA with Korea have already
taken place and negotiations are expected to be very close to conclusion. Four negotiation
rounds have been completed with Japan, achieving progress on rules of origin, procurement,

                                              34
competition policy and cooperation, among others. In 2010, Peru started negotiations with
the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (Chile, New Zealand, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam,
Australia, Peru, and U.S.) and Central America. In addition, the FTA with Mexico has been
extended until December of 2011.

85.    Another challenge is to deepen efforts to simplify customs procedures. The One-
Stop-Shop for Trade (Ventanilla Única de Comercio Exterior, or VUCE) is underway but the
implementation of phase one is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. The GoP is
committed to undertake actions for trade facilitation. The introduction of an electronic
processing of the cargo manifest and the customs declaration is expected to be fully
operational by October 2010. Customs clearance procedures will be further simplified
through the following measures: (i) data harmonization with other agencies based on the
WCO Customs Data Model; (ii) integration with other customs and One-Stop-Shop of the
world; and (iii) the implementation of the phase two of the VUCE. In the medium-term, the
GoP plans to complement these efforts with additional measures to improve customs services
and customs duty regulation.

Actions completed under the Program (DPL IV)

86.    Prior actions completed by the Borrower under the Program include the
following (Annex 3):

        (5) The Borrower has expanded and facilitated international trade through: (i) the
            closure of the negotiation process of a proposed trade agreement between the
            Borrower and the EU, as evidenced by the signing of the Joint Declaration on
            May 19, 2010; and (ii) the issuance of Supreme Decree no. 096-2010-EF dated
            March 26, 2010 and published in the Borrower's Official Gazette (El Peruano) on
            March 27, 2010 establishing October 1, 2010 as the completion date for the
            progressive implementation of simplified customs procedures.

Promote Sustainable Financial Deepening

87.     The Peruvian financial sector proved resilient to the global crisis with solid
indicators. Credit growth decelerated significantly but remained positive in 2009. Despite
the global financial crisis, access to credit has expanded during the last years accompanied by
stronger supervision. Credit portfolio growth in all client segments has been strong among
supervised financial entities during the last three years.6 Credit growth to the private sector
by the banking sector has been led by the retail market. It maintained a robust expansion
during 2008 and first semester of 2009, with annual growth rates above 30 percent, though
this pace decelerated on a monthly basis from the second part of 2009, reaching 4.32 percent
in December 2009. Total credit to the private sector stood at 35.5 percent of GDP in 2009,
from which 24.1 of GDP was credit provided by the banking sector.

6
  Supervised financial entities include banks, financial companies (empresas financieras), municipal and rural
savings and loans institutions (cajas municipales and cajas rurales) and microfinance institutions (EDPYMES).

                                                     35
88.     Peru's strong policy framework and timely response to the global crisis were key
to contain the financial impact on the Peruvian economy. The financial sector was well-
positioned to face the global financial crisis, with a regulatory and supervisory framework
that had been strengthened significantly in recent years. These regulatory measures
contributed to improve the performance of asset quality indicators, with non-performing
loans (NPLs) decreasing from levels of 4 percent in 2005 to 1.5 in 2008. The impact of the
economic slowdown on portfolio quality was limited, as NPLs loans increased modestly
from 1.91 in 2009 to 2.08 percent in February 2010. The coverage of provisions over NPLs
has been above 200 percent during the last two years. In February 2010 coverage was 206
percent decreasing from 219.1 in February 2009. Banks remained well-capitalized, liquid,
and profitable during 2009. Moreover, as of February 2010, the SBS reported a capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) for the banking sector of 13.4 percent, well above the minimum 8
percent recommended by the Bank of International Settlements.

89.     In reaction to a deteriorating economic environment, the central bank took
several preventive measures at the beginning of the crisis. During the period of
heightened global risk aversion and deleveraging, the central bank injected substantial
liquidity in the system, both in Soles and U.S. dollars in order to prevent liquidity squeeze
and credit crunch. Starting September 2008 and along 2009, the central bank offered repos in
dollars to boost dollar liquidity, with total interventions reaching more than US$8.1 billion. It
also extended the terms of repo operations up to one year and allowed pension funds and
mutual funds to participate in these operations. Also in October, the central bank cut the
marginal reserve requirements for foreign currency from 49 percent to 35 percent and
eliminated marginal reserve requirements for local currency. The marginal deposit
requirement was cut to 30 percent from 35 percent for foreign currency accounts. The
minimum legal reserve requirement has been cut three times since December 2008, from 9
percent to the current 6 percent, increasing liquidity by a total of 1.2 billion nuevos soles.

90.     Peruvian authorities remain strongly committed to further enhancing the
regulatory framework by applying the lessons from the financial crisis. The Peruvian
authorities have taken additional measures to mitigate risks and promote sustainable credit
expansion. Regulatory norms on capital, liquidity and dynamic provisioning are ahead
international standards. SBS issued a regulation (Resolution 1237/2006) to ensure that
supervised institutions are adequately managing over-indebtness risk and that their corporate
governance arrangements and underwriting standards adequately reflect these risk
management practices. Further regulations changing the ways to calculate net worth of
financial institutions, specifying criteria for classifying different types of debtors, and
mandating systems to prevent money laundering and terrorism finance have also put into
place since 2008, improving the management and resilience of the financial sector. More
recently, regulatory authorities have established additional capital requirements linked to the
assessment and risk of borrowers' FX credit risk, which will become effective in July 2010,
to further promote that banks internalize such risk. In addition, authorities are considering
several initiatives, including capital requirements for systemic risk; strengthening the crisis
resolution framework; and improving liquidity provisioning under systemic stress.


                                               36
91.     The GoP has also taken measures to further develop domestic capital markets.
Although a regulatory framework for securitization has existed in Peru since 1997, a
relatively limited number of transactions have been conducted. This was in part due to an
outdated framework which did not keep pace with market developments. However, in recent
years the Peruvian Securities and Exchange Commission (Comisión Nacional Supervisora de
Empresas y Valores--CONASEV) has approved new securitization regulations (Resolution
087/2007 and Resolution No. 068-2009/94.01.) to facilitate the development of new
instruments, to allow the issuance of asset-backed securities and reduce transaction costs. In
addition, steps are being taken to develop the mortgage market in Soles of a covered bond
instrument, and to foster the development of key financial instruments such as the repo and
interest rate swap markets that would facilitate lending in Soles. Moreover, the authorities
intend to strengthen the function of CONASEV which would help ease access to the
domestic capital markets. A current agreement to integrate the Chilean, Colombian and
Peruvian stock markets by 2011 is also expected to increase investible assets for pension
funds and increase market liquidity. The rationale behind these regulatory efforts is to create
an enabling environment for structured financing solutions to flourish, to tap the potential
demand of institutional investors, while channeling much-needed financing to under-served
sectors.

92.     The MSME sector continues to be a particular focus of attention for credit
expansion by the Peruvian authorities. The GoP is seeking to diversify the product
offering of financial institutions by lowering the regulatory costs involved. The 2008 law on
MSMEs gave the state development bank COFIDE the power and means to promote access
to financing for MSMEs, including 900 million nuevos soles (about US$300 million) to
finance working capital, pre and post shipments, investment and exports of capital goods for
MSMEs exporting non-traditional products. On February 19, 2009 the decree 024-2009
created Fondo de Garantía Empresarial (FOGEM) to provide partial guarantees on new
loans granted by Peruvian banks to MSMEs. In addition, COFIDE developed a reverse
factoring scheme for MSMEs to provide an alternative way for smaller firms to access
financing. This fund was settled on May 2009 and will operate through private banks by May
2010.

93.     Going forward, facilitating sustainable financial deepening remains a key
challenge. This will require the design and implementation of more flexible financial
instruments. The GoP is currently considering two areas of policy reforms: (i) securitization
and mortgage product development; and (ii) improve banking services and access to finance
by MSMEs. As of February 2010, there were approximately 124 thousand mortgages in the
banking sector, which is relatively low if compared with 837 thousand mortgages in Chile (a
country with roughly half of the population of Peru). Additionally, the penetration of
mortgage products in low income groups (groups C and D) could be significantly increased.
Improvements in SBS regulations on bank's mortgage registration and liquidation processes
as well as standardized documentation and improved clarity on the scope of mortgage
collateral would significantly improve the development of the capital market.



                                              37
       (i) Securitization and mortgage product development. In September 2009, the
           GoP approved a regulation to promote asset securitization. The primary objective
           of this regulation aimed at reducing transaction costs for securitization. The first
           issuance of mortgage securities took place in 2009 for a total of US$35 million
           with the participation of BCP, Interbank and IFC. An additional issuance in the
           amount of US$100 million is currently being prepared by Titulizadora Peruana. In
           addition, covered bonds (synthetic securitization) for mortgages and principal
           home are being developed and the draft regulation for the implementation has
           already been prepared. The Bill was sent to Congress on February 17, 2010.
           Finally, a new segment of mortgage administration companies is currently being
           developed. These are securitization companies issuing tradable securities targeted
           to mortgages between US$25 thousand and US$60 thousand. A company -
           INCASA- has already been created and it has issued already S/ 7 million.

       (ii) Improve banking services and access to finance by MSMEs. The GoP has
            undertaken measures to provide access and guarantees on loans to support
            MSMEs. However, considering the importance of MSMEs for the economy
            (accounts for nearly 97 percent of total firms), it is essential to expand credit and
            improve access to finance. The government expects to issue new regulations on
            bank correspondents by end June 2010. As a medium run objective, the GoP
            expects to issue a new regulation for the use of electronic payment instruments
            (pre-paid cards).

Prior Actions completed under the Program (DPL IV)

94.    The prior actions completed under the Program include the following (see Annex
3):
       (6) The adoption of Resolution CONASEV No. 068-2009/94.01.1 dated September
           24, 2009 and published in the Borrower's Official Gazette (El Peruano) on
           September 29, 2010, aimed at strengthening the Borrower's regulatory framework
           for asset securitization and therefore promoting the development of the
           Borrower's capital markets.


                             VI.     Operation Implementation

A. Poverty and Social Impact

95.     The actions supported by this operation are not expected to have significant
negative poverty and social impact. In fact, the poverty and social impacts of the policies
supported by this loan series have been positive. On the fiscal side, the sound fiscal policy
framework supported by the FMCDPL series has allowed the GoP to increase its attention to
social spending, particularly through the Juntos conditional cash transfer program for the
poor, and to undertake a sizeable emergency fiscal stimulus program to mitigate the effects
of the global economic downturn on Peru and sustain the social and economic gains of recent

                                              38
years. Actions to improve the performance orientation of budgeting processes began with
pilot projects in specific areas related to improving the impact of social spending on the
poorest sectors of the population. These activities are also receiving intensive support from
the parallel REACT DPL series working to improve results and accountability in public
social programs. Initiatives to improve the equity of how fiscal resources are distributed
throughout the country, in particular through the new FONIPREL investment fund, have also
benefited poorer parts of the country. The fund accepts project proposals not just on project
viability, but also on poverty rates and the level of a locality's resources, thus
disproportionately benefiting regions with high poverty levels and limited natural resources.
More than half of the fund's investments thus far have been in the country's six poorest
regions.

96.     Competitiveness policies have helped with the impressive economic activity
experienced in Peru in the past several years, which in turn has boosted employment
creation and poverty reduction. This has been particularly notable in the growth of micro,
small and medium enterprises and the non-traditional export sector, which contribute more
significantly to employment creation than the traditional commodity export sectors. The
long-term strategy for reducing barriers to international trade through reductions in tariffs
and export subsidies and pursuing free trade agreements with Peru's major trading partners
has unquestionably benefited Peru overall, as evidenced by recent high rates of export growth
and overall economic activity. By opening new markets and helping to diversify the export
mix of Peru, the measures adopted by Peru to expand and facilitate international trade are
likely to have positive poverty and social impacts. As well, consumers have benefited with
lower prices for many goods.

97.     To assist the poor and those living in rural areas to take advantage of the
opportunities from Peru's greater integration into the world economy, the GoP is
combining short-term social assistance programs with medium- and longer-term efforts
in human capital and infrastructure investments. While Peru's greater integration in the
world economy will bring opportunities for the country as a whole, it must also be
acknowledged that not all social groups are in the same position to take advantage of these
opportunities. One of the flagship programs of the administration is Sierra Exportadora, a
package of measures designed to promote greater economic opportunities through trade and
market integration to poorer, heavily indigenous Andean mountain region. The project is
directing significant technical assistance, infrastructure investment, and credit to boost
export-oriented agriculture, forestry and artisan production based on local knowledge and
specialties. The Bank's Sierra Development Project, included in the CPS, is supporting
aspects of Sierra Exportadora. In the medium and long term, the GoP is undertaking
significant efforts to increase logistical links to more remote areas of the country to help
these poorer areas access broader domestic and international markets. Additionally, the GoP
is cognizant that human capital deficits are critical in holding back many poorer Peruvians,
and improving the quality of education is a top administration priority. This is fully
supported by the Bank, through the RECURSO analytical project on social sector results, the
ongoing social sector DPL (which has a strong focus on education), and through the results-
budgeting orientation included in this operation.
                                             39
98.    Fast economic growth in recent years has been accompanied by poverty
reduction and job creation. Between 2005 and 2009 poverty fell from 48.7 percent to 34.8
percent, while extreme poverty was reduced from 17.4 percent to 11.5 percent (Table 4). The
continued reduction in poverty is remarkable given that 2008 saw high food price inflation
and that economic growth slowed down in 2009 as a result of the global economic crisis. The
reduction of poverty in 2009 was concentrated mainly in urban areas, especially in Lima, and
took place at a lower rate than in previous years. Poverty incidence remains highly unequal in
geographic terms, with some regions posting poverty rates above 60 percent.

99.    While inequality of opportunity remains high, Peru has made substantial
progress in addressing it. The Human Opportunity Index, which measures equality of
opportunity in access to social services, shows substantial improvement between 1995 and
2006 when compared to other countries in the region (Figure 7). Increased public
investments in water, sanitation and electricity during the last years support a trend of
reduction in inequality of opportunity. Despite this progress, large opportunity gaps remain a
challenge for policy-makers.

B. Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation

100. The Bank will monitor actions and review progress of the implementation of the
proposed operation using different sources including:
          Fiscal transparency reports ­ MEF, www.mef.gob.pe
          Central Bank of Peru, reports and research publications, www.bcrp.gob.pe
          SIAF ­ MEF, www.mef.gob.pe
          Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INEI), www.inei.gob.pe
          Investment Climate Survey
          Credit rating agencies reports ­ several sources
          World Bank Doing Business indicators
          World Economic Forum competitiveness indicators
          Government Tax Agency SUNAT ­ www.sunat.gob.pe
          IMF and IADB reports

101. The GoP and the Bank have agreed from time to time, at the request of either
party, exchange views on the Borrower's macroeconomic policy framework and the
progress achieved in carrying out the Program. The Sectoral Loans Coordination Unit
(Unidad de Coordinación de Préstamos Sectorales--UCPS) in the MEF is the main
counterpart agency for the proposed loan, which will be in charge of M&E for the loan and
for collecting the appropriate data to track indicators. Other important agencies are the
central bank, SUNAT, PCM and Ministerio de Comercio Exterior y Turismo (MINCETUR).

C. Fiduciary Arrangements

102. During 2009, in the context of the preparation of a series of DPLs, including the
Programmatic Fiscal Management and Competitiveness DPL series, the Environmental

                                              41
DPL series, and the REACT DPL series, the Bank undertook a review of Peru's public
financial management (PFM). The review of the status of PFM in Peru was further
complemented by a joint assessment with other development partners following the
Performance Measurement Framework (Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability,
PEFA) assessment. The final report was published and disseminated in June 2009.

103. The results of the PEFA assessment, from the perspective of the six budget
dimensions measured by the framework, concluded that, overall, PFM in Peru is
functioning well and is in line with international best practices. The main findings of the
PEFA assessment are summarized below:

        (i) The central government's budget in Peru is a reliable and credible financial
              tool, despite the discrepancies between the executed and the initial budget.
              Overall, the budget formulation follows international best practice. It is an
              orderly and institutionalized process; is transparent; and the documentation
              attached to the Budget Bill submitted to Congress for scrutiny is fairly
              comprehensive, with the public having access to key information in a timely
              manner.
        (ii) The predictability of budget resources and internal controls of budget
              execution are also working relatively well. Budget execution is well
              documented and Consolidated Government Financial Statements (Cuenta
              General de la República) are prepared annually and submitted in a
              comprehensive document that contains information regarding revenues,
              expenditures, and financial assets and liabilities, and is audited within the legally
              established time periods by the Supreme Audit Institution (Contraloría General
              de la República, CGR). The annual audit of public institutions covered
              approximately 73 percent (for 2008), and it is conducted pursuant to the
              respective regulations and within the time frames established by law7.
        (iii) Legislative scrutiny of the annual budget bill is conducted in accordance
              with well-established procedures and the scrutiny of the Cuenta General is
              performed in a similar way. However, there is limited capacity in the Congress
              for following up on the audit recommendations proposed to Congress, which are
              not always implemented due to lack of follow-up capacity.

104. The most critical reforms to improve the management of public finances and
efficiency of public spending initiated during the last two years are well advanced, and
key reforms were completed in 2009. A new budget classification system and a new
accounting chart of accounts was adopted in line with international standards and are
operating in all government ministries and agencies. The implementation of the Treasury
Single Account (TSA) at the central government level is progressing well, with its coverage
sufficient enough at this time to meet international standards. The foundations for
performance-based budgeting have made steady progress with the development of well-
defined measures of performance that link priority policies and programs. The reforms in the
area of performance based budgeting included several policies and procedural changes and

7
  The time frame for the submission of the Cuenta General de la República and the corresponding audit report
issued by the CGR, from the President to the Congress has been modified to August 15.

                                                     42
expansion of the strategic programs in the budget. Continued efforts are currently underway
to fully implement the TSA and ensure common standards and timely budget and financial
reporting by all levels of government (central and subnational).

105. Efforts to continue modernizing the budget and improving PFM could be scaled-
up by prioritizing activities within the PFM reform agenda using the results of the
country PFM performance (complemented by other sources of information and GOP
strategies The dissemination of the results of the PEFA assessment among GOP stakeholders
and the donor community has facilitated the dialogue between the GOP and the donors
around a common framework. Thus, following the PEFA dissemination, the formation of a
working group led by MEF -including high level government officials and representatives of
donor agencies is in place and as a result the GOP, with the support of donors resources has
been able to establish a PFM study group within MEF, to monitor and follow up on concrete
reforms within the PFM agenda. The study group will initially provide strategic support in
three areas: (i) implementation of the new SIAF; (ii) design and gradual implementation of a
multi-annual budget framework; and (iii) support to the recently re-structured Budget
Directorate in certain new units such as quality of expenditure.

106. The Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF) is a cornerstone of the
country's reform process and as such constant adjustments are needed to it to support
changes in policies, processes, and institutions. Thus, the design and implementation of the
new system are critical for Peru to support the PFM reform agenda. The design of the new
system and its platform began at the end of 2008, and the conceptual framework has been
approved in March, 2010. On such basis, it is expected that on a first stage the Budget
Programming module be launched in March, 2011 on a pilot basis for the preparation of the
2012 budget.

D. Disbursement and Audits

107. Disbursement arrangements will follow the standard procedures for DPLs. The
Bank would make the single tranche disbursement of US$100,000,000 following the
provisions set out in OP. 8.60, namely (i) the Bank will deposit the funds into an account
designated by the GoP which forms part of the country's foreign exchange reserves at the
Central Bank of Peru; and (ii) the GoP shall ensure that upon deposit of the funds into said
account, such amount or an equivalent amount is credited in the GoP's accounting system to
an account that finances budgeted expenditures. The GoP may be required to provide
confirmation of steps (i) and (ii) as soon as funds are received. The proceeds of the loan may
not be used to finance expenditures typically excluded under the Loan Agreement.

108. The last IMF Safeguards Assessment was completed in 2007, and the assessment
concluded that there were no significant weaknesses in the Central Bank's safeguards
framework (IMF Country Report No. 07/241). The external audit report on the 2009
financial statements of Central Bank does not reveal any significant issue related to the
internal control environment.




                                             43
109. No dedicated account at the central bank will be required for this operation.
Given that the Bank's review of the borrower's current PFM system is satisfactory and
fiduciary arrangements for this operation are adequate, the Bank will not require a dedicated
account at the Central Bank for loan proceeds. As such, no audit will be required for the
deposit account.

E. Environmental Aspects

110. This DPL operation is not likely to have any significant effects on the
environment, forests, and other natural resources. The reforms supported by the program
are related to the adoption of policies and only a few could have a future environmental
impact. In fact some of the proposed policy reforms under the proposed DPL are likely to be
positive for environmental management, particularly related to improved monitoring and
evaluation for government expenditure, including environmental expenditure. These reforms
could contribute in strengthening GoP's ability to set clear environmental priorities,
coordinate with environmental authorities on developing indicators to evaluate the impact of
spending on achieving these priorities, and ensure that all sectors follow legal norms related
to the environment. The Bank is supporting the authorities' efforts to reform environmental
management through the parallel programmatic Environmental DPL series. The fiscal space
created through making the budget and expenditure process more efficient could also serve to
strengthen under-funded environmental spending.

111. In the medium and long term, further trade liberalization and economic activity
in Peru--by means of desirable growth and poverty reduction--would lead to greater
infrastructure development. While SNIP does evaluate environmental considerations for
each infrastructure project approved, this is done in an ex-ante manner. The challenge
regarding potential environmental impacts is during execution. The Bank's Country
Environmental Assessment highlighted shortcomings in Peru's institutional framework for
environmental protection and sustainability. It also pointed to the need to continue protection
efforts in natural areas such as tropical forests while mitigating the serious health impacts and
high costs of environmental degradation, particularly in terms of air and water contamination.
As a result of this study and the ensuing dialogue with GoP, the Bank prepared a planned
three-phase DPL operation on environmental policy, the first phase of which (for US$330
million) was approved by the Board in February 2009.

112. The environmental DPLs supported by the Bank (the third and last in the series
is currently under preparation) focus on reordering the institutional and legal
framework for environmental management.8 The creation of an adequate national-level
authority to enforce environmental issues (Environmental Evaluation and Enforcement
Office--OEFA) is a major step, given that the system in place is fragmented and adversely
affects the country's ability to tackle numerous environmental challenges. An important
trigger under the second environmental DPL is the approval of the regulation of the Law on
the National System of Environmental Impact Assessment, which allows the Ministry of the
Environment to review environmental impact assessments for large infrastructure/investment
projects with potentially significant impacts. An IDF grant was awarded to promote capacity
8
    A new Ministry for Environment was created on May 20, 2008.

                                                     44
building within the key environmental authority. The areas covered under the environmental
DPL include implementing an updated mining environmental legacies (MELs) inventory and
a national strategy for remediation of priority MELs, reducing air pollution through reduction
of sulfur content in diesel to 50 ppm and promoting and implementing vehicle conversions to
natural gas. In addition, the Bank has recommended that the authorities include environment
and resource management in the desk evaluation pilots programmed for the next years.

F. Risks and Risk Mitigation

Macroeconomic Risks

113. Peru remains exposed to downside risks stemming from renewed uncertainty in
international financial markets and doubts about the pace of the global economic
recovery. Following developments in Europe in May 2010, volatility in global financial
markets increased to levels last seen in March 2009 while asset markets worldwide posted
substantial losses. So far, the spread of the sovereign stress in European countries to Peru and
other emerging countries has been limited, due to stronger economic fundamentals in
emerging countries and the EU/IMF intervention. However, global growth prospects may be
affected by concerns about the recovery in Europe and how it may spill over other regions of
the world. Stock markets in emerging markets, as measured by the MSCI emerging market
index, dropped 9 percent in May while the price of commodities such as copper decreased by
7 percent.

114. The exposure to commodities remains high, as demand from fast growing
emerging economies is shifting the destination of Peruvian exports. Traditional exports
still account for over three-quarters of Peru's exports. In fact, the share of traditional exports
rose slightly in 2009 on account of the increase terms of trade for Peru recorded for 2009 as a
whole. The importance of emerging markets as a destination for Peruvian exports has grown
sharply during the global economic crisis. Thus, while Peru's total exports dropped by 13
percent in 2009, its exports to China grew by 14 percent. In 2009 China was the second
largest destination of Peruvian exports, accounting for 15.3 percent of all exports (up from
11.6 percent in 2008). In contrast the share of exports to the US dropped from 19.1 percent in
2008 to 17.0 percent in 2009. Similarly, there were large declines in excess of 30 percent in
exports to large European trading partners, like Spain, Italy, the UK, and the Netherlands.
These developments suggest that while exposure to weaker EU growth may be more muted
than in the past, exposure to commodities may have increased. In addition, the fast recovery
of economic growth observed in Peru has also contributed to making the country a more
attractive investment destination, adding to exchange rate appreciation pressures from
already high portfolio capital inflows and affecting the prospects of the non-traditional sector
to gain competitiveness and export shares.

115. Commitment to structural reforms and consensus over the macroeconomic
pillars has been and remains strong. The decision by the authorities to curb the
expansionary stance of fiscal policy demonstrates their commitment to regain fiscal space
and is particularly noteworthy in light of the upcoming presidential elections to take place in
April 2011. In early June 2010 Fitch Ratings confirmed the investment grade rating for

                                               45
Peruvian foreign currency sovereign debt and upgraded the outlook from stable to positive on
account of the resumption of fast growth in the country. The country's solid fundamentals
suggest that, in the absence of unexpected policy shifts, it is unlikely that the macroeconomic
situation would become incompatible with continued budgetary support lending during the
course of this proposed operation.

Political and Social Risks

116. The policy reforms supported by this loan enjoy broad support across the main
political groups and the population at large, however social tension remains a risk.
Improved fiscal management has the potential to threaten some vested interests, but the
consensus on the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending is
strongly supported by the President, the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, and all the
main parties in the National Congress. Some measures to simplify the tax code by
eliminating regional exemptions, particularly in the Amazon region, have proved politically
difficult, but the administration has moved this agenda forward in a consensual way. As well,
reforms to ease the ability of companies--especially small and medium companies--to
access credit, receive licenses, and access export opportunities are widely supported by all
relevant stakeholders. Local governments that may have resisted simplifying procedures have
been brought along with technical assistance support to undertake reforms. The free trade
agenda is also generally supported by the political class and the population at large, but some
issues have caused social conflict. In particular, recent conflicts in a region of the Amazon
basin have centered on amendments to the code governing the exploitation of forest
resources, which were done to comply with the free trade agreement with the U.S. The
administration is moving to build a consensus on the issue with the main political groups and
the human rights ombudsman, and has continued its dialogue with representatives of the local
population.

117. The upcoming change in administration in Peru in 2011 could present risks
related to the sustainability of the policy reforms supported by the operation. As with
any change in administration, the upcoming electoral process and change in administration in
Peru implies a certain risk about the continuity of policy reforms. Mitigating this risk is the
broad political consensus for the policy reforms supported by this programmatic series. The
drive for many of the reforms supported by this programmatic series and the maintenance of
a sound macroeconomic management framework precede the current administration and are
relatively well-entrenched. To continue the policy dialogue on these areas of reform, the
Bank is preparing a series of Policy Notes that will be presented to the Peruvian authorities in
2011.

118. While the government has made efforts to set up consultation mechanisms with
the society at large, the lack of appropriate conflict resolution channels with disaffected
social groups is still a significant challenge. More decisive efforts for conflict resolution
would be welcome (see Box 2). However continued improvements in social safety nets and
other social programs, more equitable flow of resources to the country's regions, and an
increase in spending on investments as part of the economic stimulus package should
ameliorate social and political risks.

                                        Box 2: Social Conflict in Peru

A society like Peru's always had and (most likely) will continue to have some degree of social unrest and
polarization. Social conflicts are partly explained by a historically high degree of inequality, in spite of
government's efforts to reduce it. They are also partly driven by the country's development process itself, as
sustained growth episodes may raise societal aspirations and demands for improved opportunities. Against this
backdrop, Peruvian governments have to live with latent social conflicts, some of which eventually emerge
from time to time. But these conflicts tend to remain focalized; both in terms of the issues and the geographical
area. The vast majority are resolved peacefully. However, sometimes social conflicts eventually drag on for
some time, and risk becoming nationally politicized, making conflict resolution harder. The most recent
example was the conflict that emerged in June 2009 in Bagua, in Peru's Amazon region, which caused 34
deaths and led to the resignation of the president of the council of ministers and other members of the cabinet.
Indigenous communities in the area feared that a new forestry law and other legal changes would lead to over-
exploitation of natural resources by foreign companies, while they would lose traditional rights. A key
contentious point was that it was unclear whether these laws needed to be consulted with indigenous
communities prior to their approval (as per ILO agreements on indigenous populations). Legal opinions on
whether these laws required prior consultation were divided on this, but indigenous communities felt that they
had been excluded from decision-making processes. The main lesson emerging from the Bagua conflict is the
need to listen and have a sustained dialogue with all stakeholders whose livelihoods could be affected by
government decisions.
The Government of Peru has made efforts to set up consultation mechanisms with the broader society. In 2001,
the government set up the National Accord (Acuerdo Nacional), a national discussion forum designed to
provide a space to build national consensus around policy priorities. It included broad representation from
across Peruvian society, including government officials, politicians, academics, church officials, labor and
business representatives and indigenous groups. More recently, discussions had been underway since early 2008
between indigenous groups, the Human Rights Ombudsman (Defensoría del Pueblo), members of Congress and
representatives of the executive branch. When talks broke down in the spring of 2009, road blockades were
erected, eventually leading to the events of June. In the weeks after the violence, the laws in question were
repealed and the blockades removed, agreements were signed between the government and local protestors and
a formal dialogue mechanism was instituted (Mesas de Concertación) to ensure sustained dialogue with
indigenous communities.

                       Annex 1. Fiscal and External Debt Sustainability Analysis9

Peru's public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline under the baseline debt scenario to
below 20 percent of GDP. Economic growth will recover after the dip in 2009, and will reach
potential this year. Growth will average 6 percent a year in 2010­15 underpinned by domestic
demand dynamics and the global recovery. The public sector revenue-to-GDP ratio is expected
to increase by a cumulative 0.9 percentage points, reflecting the recovery in growth and mining
revenues. Under these assumptions, Peru's public sector debt stock (including CRPAOs) would
decline from 27.4 percent of GDP at end-2009, to 19.7 percent of GDP by 2015.

External debt is projected to remain below 30 percent of GDP. The decline in external public
sector debt over the medium term (of about 5 percentage points of GDP) would be compensated
by a marginal increase in private sector external debt as financing conditions improve globally.
Given the recent declines in public external debt, total external debt is projected to diminish from
32 percent of GDP at end-2007 to 26 percent by 2015 (public external debt would decline from
18 percent to 11 percent over the same period).

Peru's external and public sector debt ratios are robust to alternative assumptions about
underlying macroeconomic variables. Sensitivity tests based on 10-year historical standard
deviations for GDP growth and interest rates show that Peru's debt dynamics are only
moderately vulnerable to such changes.

Despite the increasing share of public sector debt in domestic currency, external and public
debt ratios remain sensitive to large and permanent exchange rate shocks. Under a one-off
30 percent real depreciation of the exchange rate, the external and public debt ratios would
increase by about 10 percentage points above the baseline projections over the medium term.
This test assumes that the exchange rate would remain at a depreciated level permanently, which
would occur if the current level of the exchange rate was significantly overvalued. CGER
estimates, however, indicate that the Sol is broadly in line with fundamentals. Noninterest
current account shocks (such as in the terms of trade) would have a moderate adverse impact on
external indebtedness.

A contingent liabilities shock to the public sector of 10 percent of GDP would increase
public debt by a similar amount over the medium term. The public debt ratio would rise
sharply in the short run and decline over the medium term. By 2015 the debt ratio would remain
9.6 percentage points above the baseline scenario.

The authorities are strongly committed to continue improving the debt profile through the
implementation of a proactive debt management strategy. Currency risks have declined
significantly in recent years, with the foreign currency share in total public debt declining from
94 percent in 2000 to less than 60 percent in 2009. In 2010, the authorities are targeting a decline
in the share of debt at fixed interest rate to 70-80 percent, as well as extending the average
maturity of debt to 11-12 years.

3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
 at their levels of the last projection year.

Mr.
ROBERT B. ZOELLICK
President
World Bank


Reference: Programmatic Loan for Fiscal Management and Economic Growth IV

Dear Mr. Zoellick,

This document confirms the commitment of the Government of President Alan Garcia to continue efforts
to implement a series of policies aimed at ensuring sustained economic growth based on efforts to
increase public and private investment, improve the country's infrastructure and promote inclusion of the
most vulnerable sectors of society.

In this framework, we have developed the fourth operation of the "Programmatic Loan for Fiscal
Management and Economic Growth" with the World Bank (WB) and have requested US$ 100 million.
This loan will cover specific actions with regard to: i) enhancing the efficiency and quality of fiscal
management and public spending and ii) developing policies aimed at strengthening competitiveness. It is
important to emphasize that this loan will be used to continue the reforms undertaken in the third
operation, which was signed in December 2009.

Next, we will describe Peru's economic context, the objectives and reforms achieved and the proposals
linked with the loan requested.

A.      Economic Context

The global economy is in the process of emerging from the most significant contraction since the Second
World War. Global GDP dropped 0.6% in 2009 and is expected to rebound to 4.2% [1] due to the fiscal
and monetary stimulus plans in place.

In terms of the growth forecasts for our main trading partners, the United States has been experiencing
rapid recovery. Progress, however, is rooted primarily in transitory factors (inventory effects and stimulus
plans). Fiscal problems in Europe and plans to implement austerity measures limit perspectives for
growth in the region in the mid-term. In the Asian block, China continues to lead economic growth and

exchange suffered significantly, contracting 15.5% in the 2008-2009 period. In this context, GDP grew
only 0.9% in 2009. This low growth is primarily due to an over-adjustment in private investment and a
contraction in inventory levels. Nevertheless, the move to implement adequate expansive monetary and
fiscal policies helped the Peruvian economy avoid further deterioration. In the fiscal ambit, a strong
Economic Stimulus Plan (PEE) was implemented for the 2009-2010 biennium for 3.5% of GDP.
Emphasis has been placed on infrastructure projects, which has allowed public spending to contribute 2.5
percentage points to product growth. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru has also reduced the interest rate
to historic lows (1.25%) and is focused on ensuring the liquidity levels needed to maintain the continuity
of the chain of payments.

In the current context, the signs of recovery are clear. Since 3Q09, the economy has grown in
deseasonalized terms due to monetary and fiscal stimuli and inventory restructuring over the last few
months. Proof of the PEE's success is evident in the construction sector, which has grown more than 10%
since last October. Non-primary manufacturing sector was hardest hit by the crisis. In December 2009,
this sector achieved its first positive growth figure (in yearly terms) and over the last few months, it has
shown high growth rates. The pace of exports began to fall in 2Q09 but has reported positive rates since
4Q09 in nominal terms. In 1Q10, the economy grew 6.0%, which is the highest growth rate since 4Q08.
Private investment grew 11.3% while private consumption rose 3.6%, indicating that private demand is
undergoing rapid recovery.

In the same way, internal indicators of activity forecasts indicate that good economic performance will
continue to consolidate over the next few months. In April, GDP grew 9.3%, which is primarily
attributable to a rebound in manufacturing (16.4%), commercial activity (11.1%), services (7.1%) and
construction (21.1%). During this same month imports of consumer goods rose 36.2% and new vehicle
sales surged 63.8% in annual terms. In the month of May, local cement deliveries, electricity production
and total imports grew 20.4%, 7.8% and 33.9% a year respectively.

Based on international and local economic recovery, 5.5% growth is expected in 2010. The main factors
behind this growth are: i) improved perspectives for global growth and terms of exchange; ii) an increase
in exports, which will return to pre-crisis levels and, iii) an increase in private investment due to the
business community's renewed confidence.

B.      Reforms associated with the Program

1. Strengthening Fiscal Policy Management

Sustainability and Transparency of Fiscal Policy

The Peruvian Government set an Economic Stimulus Program (PEE) in motion to offset the international
financial crisis's impact on economic activity, public investment in infrastructure and social protection.
The PEE is expected to culminate in 2010 when the infrastructure projects scheduled by the national and

                                                                              MERCEDES ARÁOZ FERNÁNDEZ
OFICIO N°                 -2010-EF/10                                                 MINISTRA

regional governments are executed. At the end of April 2010, the PEE had executed 93% of the budget
allotted and 87% of the total estimated cost.

In order to generate conditions that ensure sustained growth in the local economy, the Law Nº 29465- The
Public Sector Budget Law- was passed for the 2010 fiscal year and the Municipal Modernization Program
(PMM) was approved for the 2010-2013 period. The PMM's purpose is to incentivize the municipalities
to increase municipal tax collections by bolstering financial management and generating favorable
conditions in the business climate by improving public service provision, basic infrastructure and
procedure/process simplification.

Along these lines, Supreme Decree N° 002-2010-EF approved the procedures to meet goals and allot
PMM resources. The latter are disbursed according to the municipalities' classification criteria, which are
based on each municipality's specific characteristics and potential and compliance with requirements for
municipal tax collection results and efforts to generate a favorable business climate.

The Government created the Incentive Plan to Improve Municipal Management (PI) through Law N
29332. This effort seeks to incentivize Local Governments to improve municipal tax collection levels as
well spending on investment and reduce chronic childhood malnutrition throughout the country. This
plan is implemented with resources from the Municipal Compensation Fund (FONCOMUN) for the 2010
fiscal year. Supreme Decree N° 003-2010-EF approved the procedures to ensure that goals are met and
allot PI resources.

Finally, Supreme Decree N°100-2010-EF was passed. This decree stipulates that beginning this year,
additional FONCOMUN resources will be transferred to the municipalities to implement the PI and PMM
to promote investment at the local level.

More stable and neutral tax system

The National Superintendence of Tax Administration (SUNAT) has created an internet-based
Consultation and Payment Declaration to help taxpayers search for the declarations and payments they
have made. A new system for differentiating search criteria has been implemented (by format, period or
date range of declarations filed) and will generate more precise search results while consuming less of the
system's resources. SUNAT's virtual search option for declarations and payment consultation has been
improved, which will allow taxpayers to visualize the declarations and/or payments they have made by
entering a single module to ask questions and store all information that has been sought.

 SUNAT has also created a new tax payment portal offering the possibility to pay taxes online for
taxpayers who use simplified tax payment forms from SUNAT On-line. This will increase the number of
transactions that are conducted on-line, generating a subsequent decrease in payment transactions through
banks.

Transparency in Budget Planning and Reporting

In terms of the process to implement the Treasury Single Account (CUT), the Government has continued
to make efforts to liquidate and close the bank accounts held by the Executing Units of the National
Government and Regional Government and the budget allotments to Local Governments, that are

OFICIO N°                 -2010-EF/10                                                 MINISTRA

currently inactive in the National Bank. Efforts are also being made to include the FONCOMUN item
(Municipal Compensation Fund) in the CUT as well as Resources from Direct Collections (RdR).

Equity in inter-governmental transfers

Supreme Decree 060-2010 has been passed to ensure the continuity of efforts to implement the equity
policy for inter-governmental transfers. The decree in question approves the criteria, procedures and
methodology to distribute FONCOMUN. This entails calculating geographic allotments by province in
order to distribute funds among all the district municipalities, including the provincial municipality. The
new methodology consists primarily in replacing variables such as the infant mortality rate with other
variables that better reflect the basic unsatisfied needs of the target population.

Public Spending Efficiency and Impact

The process to implement a Results-Based Budget (PPR) to ensure efficient public finance management
has made significant progress in terms of strategic budget planning, follow-up and independent
assessment as well as systems for managing inputs and products. Strategic budget planning generates
Strategic Programs by requiring that the design and execution of efficient strategies and interventions be
geared to achieve results that reduce chronic childhood malnutrition; reduce maternal and neonatal
deaths; increase children's learning levels up to second grade of primary; increase access to energy, water
and human waste disposal in rural areas; increase the productivity of small and medium businesses;
improve citizen safety; increase productivity of small farmers in rural areas, etc.

In this context, the Public Sector Budget Law for the 2010 Fiscal Year includes designing six new
strategic programs related to: i) Non-communicable diseases, tuberculosis, HIV and metaxenic diseases
and zoonosis, ii) Learning achievements in primary education and alternative basic education, iii) Child
labor, iv) Domestic and sexual violence and food safety, v) Environmental Sustainability and vi)
Expanding the tax base.

Transparency, accessibility, agility of public sector processes
The Supervisory Body for State Contracts approved, through Resolution N°195-2010-OSCE/PRE, the
Directive that stipulates the content of the Standardized Bases that the State Entities must use in selection
processes. This directive aims to inform State entities about the content of an obligation to use the
Standardized Bases that will be applicable to twenty (20) types of selection processes.

2.      Strengthening competitiveness in the country

Expand and deepen Foreign Trade

In order to maintain a policy to promote foreign trade development of all kinds as well as expand the
universe of exporters, which should include micro and small businesses, the Government has
implemented projects to facilitate the export process for micro and small businesses by means of the
postal service. As such, it was necessary to increase the FOB value of the merchandise exported through
this system. It was also necessary to enact a set of complementary norms relative to this export method.

According to the General Customs Law approved by Legislative Decree Nº 1053 and its Rules, the
advanced delivery process under the import regimen for consumption will be in effect as of April 12,
2010 at the Superintendence of Maritime Customs of Calla and              as of April 12, 2010 at the
Superintendence of Air Customs of Callao. In this sense, a plan and schedule was approved to
progressively implement the new customs delivery process at the aforementioned customs
superintendence units and later at the customs superintendence facilities in Arequipa, Chiclayo, Cusco,
Iquitos, Post Office of Callao, Pucallpa, Puerto Maldonado, Puno, Tacna, Tarapoto, Tumbes and the La
Tina Customs Agency. Implementation will be complete by October 01, 2010.

Additionally, the Trade Agreement signed by Colombia, Peru and the European Union will facilitate the
progressive and reciprocal liberalization of goods and services through a free trade area that complies
with the regularizations and obligations put forth by the World Trade Organization and establishes
common rules in all of the trade areas included in the agreement.

Finally, negotiations are underway to sign a Trans-Pacific Association Agreement (TPP) with Australia,
Brunei, Chile, the USA, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam to build an inclusive and high-
quality agreement for economic growth, development and employment generation in member countries.
This will be used as the basis for the Free Trade Agreement for the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP).

Deepening the financial sector

To clarify the regulatory framework regarding securitization and reduce transaction costs, the National
Supervisory Commission of Companies and Securities (CONASEV) authorized the registration of asset-
backed securities known as the "First Issuance of Mortgage Securities TP USD E-1" for a maximum of
US$ 35 000 000 (thirty-five million US Dollars) and the registry of the respective informative prospectus
in the Public Registry of the Securities Market.

In order to ensure that mortgage market development benefits sectors of the population that still do not
own their own their own homes, a Bill was sent to the Congress of The Republic to regulate the treatment
applicable to the issuance of covered mortgage bonds (CMB) as negotiable securities that give holders
credit rights that are backed by Asset Backed Securities. These assets can be mortgage loans for housing,
cash, instruments issued by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP), securities issued by the Peruvian
State, CMB and other entities authorized by the Superintendence of Banking, Insurance or AFP (SBS).
The quality of the asset backed securities makes the CMB attractive for investors, which allows the
issuers to exercise a degree of flexibility in terms of maturity of loan installments.

Finally the Financial Cooperation Development Entity (COFIDE) has created the Peru Factoring Program
to facilitate financing for micro, small and medium (SMEs) suppliers of goods and services. This effort
allows national financial institutions that are supervised by SBS and have signed an inclusion agreement
with COFIDE to make advance payments on invoices. In this regard, COFIDE has signed inclusion
agreements with the National Health Service - ESSALUD, Gloria S.A. and the Banco de la Microempresa
S.A.- MIBANCO.

Conclusion

The aforementioned attests to the Peruvian Government's commitment to continue undertaking
significant efforts to ensure sustained economic growth that goes hand-in-hand with more efficient and
equitable processes to allot public resources in a framework for fiscal management based on
responsibility and transparency.

The Government is committed to continuous progress in these areas and as such will require the World
Bank's support in the areas outlined above.

Accordingly, the Peruvian Government would like to request the approval of the "Programmatic Loan for
Fiscal Management and Economic Growth IV" for a total of US$100 million.

1.      Peru's commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies and economic resilience during the
global financial crisis has been commended by the Executive board of the IMF. In April, the
Executive Board concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation (see the Public Information Notice at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2010/pn1050.htm). The next Article IV consultation is
expected to take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

2.       Peru successfully managed the global financial crisis. Following a decade of strong
growth that peaked at 9.8 percent in 2008, activity decelerated sharply in 2009, expanding
0.9 percent for the year. Thanks to sound fundamentals and the strong buffers built in recent years,
Peru was able to launch a significant countercyclical fiscal and monetary policy response, which
helped avoid a credit crunch, supported economic activity and sustained employment. Poverty
alleviation gains continued at a slower pace.

3.      Peru's banking sector also proved resilient to the global crisis. The banking system was
well-positioned to weather the global financial crisis as the regulatory and supervisory framework
had been strengthened substantially in past years, including through the introduction of dynamic
provisioning in 2008. The proactive response of the central bank helped maintain orderly financial
conditions and avoid a liquidity squeeze. Banks remain well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable.

4.      Economic activity is expected to grow strongly in 2010. Activity began to rebound in the
second half of 2009 supported by faster execution of the fiscal stimulus, the lagged impact of the
monetary easing, dynamics from the inventory destocking cycle, and better terms of trade and global
recovery prospects. Growth for 2010 is projected at around 6¼ percent of GDP and 6 percent in
2011. Peru's recovery appears less dependent on policy support than in other economies, as it did not
open a significant output gap and the balance sheets of the corporate, household, and financial sectors
remain unimpaired.

5.      Risks to Peru's outlook are tilted to the upside. Prospects of renewed capital inflows to
strong emerging markets, the cyclical rebuilding of inventories, and acceleration of private
investment projects put on hold last year, could intensify growth this year and next. With limited
slack in resource utilization, the announced fiscal consolidation and policy rate hike are judicious to
avoid inflationary pressures later on as inflation is already at 1.04 percent (yoy) by May, above the
lower limit of the 1-3 percent inflation target range. A relapse in global growth and a return of global
risk aversion are the principal downside risks, but Peru retains policy room to limit the fallout. Peru's




                                               75
fiscal deficit remains moderate (about 2 percent of GDP in 2009) and is expected to be reduced in
2010, while public debt stands at about 25 percent of GDP.

6.      Peru's medium-term outlook remains bright, linked to sustained efforts in the
implementation of an ambitious structural reform agenda. The authorities' reform agenda is
focused on sustaining high growth and the trend of poverty reduction, including through enhancing
productivity and competitiveness, developing the local capital market, and solidifying further the
policy framework.

Public Expenditure     PEFA is a partnership between the World Bank, the European Commission, the UK's               FY09
and Financial          Department for International Development, the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic
Assessment             Affairs, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Royal Norwegian Ministry of
                       Foreign Affairs, and the International Monetary Fund. PEFA aims to support
                       integrated and harmonized approaches to assessment and reform in the field of public
                       expenditure, procurement, and financial accountability. The PEFA exercise for Peru
                       was completed in FY2009 and the findings were used to inform the reform progress,
                       triggers, and indicative actions that aim at strengthening budget reporting and planning
                       that are part of this operation.
OECD-DAC               This activity financed the application of the OECD-DAC methodology for assessment             FY09
Procurement            of the quality and effectiveness of the national procurement systems in Peru. The
                       assessment provided the basis to formulate Peru's national procurement strategy. The
                       strategy is made up of eight key areas, one of which focuses on capacity development
                       to improve Peru's procurement systems. The assessment was also useful to design a
                       capacity develop plan to mitigate risks in the individual operations financed by the
                       Bank. The Bank's technical assistance in this area helped accelerate reforms that had
                       been considered as part of the FMCDPL II to support the objective to make the public
                       sector processes more transparent, accessible and agile.
REDI                   The Infrastructure Public Expenditure Review (REDI) aims at providing the GoP with            FY10
                       a strategic assessment of three infrastructure sectors--transport, water/sanitation,
                       electricity. Building on a large number of background studies, this assessment is
                       structured around cross-cutting thematic issues (e.g. decentralization of infrastructure
                       services, the PPP agenda, infrastructure and logistics planning) and around sector-
                       specific analysis. Strategic recommendations are provided in the broader context of the
                       infrastructure focus of Peru's stimulus package. The REDI is expected to be completed
                       before the end of the FY10.
PER                    The PER's main objective is to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of public             FY11
                       expenditure in a context of decentralization and performance-informed budgeting and
                       provide policy recommendations to support the use of fiscal policy as an effective
                       development tool. In addition, the PER will review policy challenges on the revenue
                       side, in particular those related to narrow tax base and heavy reliance on natural
                       resources activities.
Evaluation of SIAF's   This evaluation was supported by the Bank's Social TAL and conducted by                       FY10
Consulta Amigable      Ciudadanos al Día, an independent Peruvian NGO. It identified the main obstacles
                       preventing citizens and civil society organizations from accessing and using Consulta
                       Amigable to track public expenditures in the social sectors. The study recommended
                       the publication of the modified budget as a key action to improving budget
                       transparency and civil society monitoring. This is an essential element in the reforms
                       supporting the objective to make the public sector processes more transparent,
                       accessible and agile.
Informality ESW        This programmatic ESW aimed to better understand the trajectories of businesses               FY09
                       towards formalization and to identify the key factors that maintain most businesses in
                       the informal sector. The topic has implications for both pillars of this operation. On the
                       fiscal side, the limited tax base is in part the consequence of a large informal sector. In
                       this regard, the ESW investigated the extent to which tax regimes, particularly due to
                       compliance costs, may be contributing to informality. On the competitive agenda the
                       ESW addressed the question of how (in) formality affects the productivity and
                       competitiveness of businesses.

Education ESW          This AAA responds to a request from the National Assembly of Regional                        FY10
                       Governments (ANGR), which is concerned with improving the efficiency and efficacy
                       of performance-based budgeting (PBB) at the regional level. The objective is to
                       improve education quality through enhanced PBB planning and intervention strategies
                       in the education sector in the context of decentralization. The ESW will focus on the
                       analysis of the relationship between resources, physical outputs and the high-level
                       development outcomes of the PBB program in education so as to increase the potential
                       of the system to align priorities and actors; improve efficiency and effectiveness of
                       financial allocation and product costs identification; help identify critical bottlenecks;
                       and recommend the reassignment of resources, the definition of responsibilities, and
                       improvements in the institutional arrangements to tackle the main weaknesses of the
                       program. This ESW was delivered to the client in March 2010.
Nutrition NLTA         This NLTA supports the restructuring and re-launching of the conditional cash transfer       FY10
                       program Juntos, which is to become the country's emblematic program for reducing
                       chronic malnutrition and extreme poverty as part of the National Strategy CRECER.
                       The NLTA is helping an inter-institutional effort to effectively articulate the demand
                       and supply side of the program with emphasis on ensuring health/nutrition services.
                       The activities are closely linked with the PBB agenda, as nutrition is one of the first
                       strategic programs launched in the context of PBB. This NLTA is expected to be
                       completed by the end of the FY10.
Policy Effectiveness   This NLTA is helping to develop processes and mechanisms for continuous and                  FY10
NLTA                   systematic evaluation and improvement of anti-poverty interventions. In particular, the
                       activity provided technical assistance for the design and evaluation of specific
                       programs, including Juntos, and is also supporting an institutional framework to
                       facilitate the systematic use of existing information systems and analyses of the
                       effectiveness of anti-poverty interventions in Peru. These activities complement and
                       are closely coordinated with the monitoring and evaluation efforts being undertaken in
                       the context of PBB. This NLTA is expected to be completed by the end of the FY10.
Education Sector       This NLTA complemented the Education ESW by working with different                           FY09
NLTA                   counterparts, with an emphasis on regional governments, to improve the design and
                       implementation of priority strategies within the PBB program. The activities were
                       organized in three components. First, clarifying the PBB framework in education by
                       promoting dialogue with counterparts (MEF, MED, ANGR) to agree upon the
                       elements of an effective PBB system and highlight areas that merit more attention and
                       support. Second, improving intergovernmental fiscal relations and institutional
                       arrangements for the implementation of the PBB program. Third, fostering the
                       evaluation of learning and teaching to improve results. The NLTA also responded with

Sub-national Pilots   This NLTA addresses the need to build capacity in subnational governments by                 First phase
NLTA                  providing on-site support to help them design and implement public investment                completed
                      projects. In particular, this NLTA has helped subnational governments build capacity         in FY09
                      to develop technically sound proposals for investment projects eligible for FONIPREL         Second
                      funding. A second phase currently under implementation is intended to (i) support the        phase
                      implementation of projects awarded resources by FONIPREL, and (ii) tackle delays in          underway
                      public investment projects. This NLTA also supported the adoption of performance-
                      based budgeting by a regional government and the preparation of project proposals for
                      submission to FONIPREL.
Decentralization      A multi-sectoral ESW on decentralization is currently underway. It includes an overall       FY10
Policy Notes          assessment of the evolution of the political and fiscal decentralization in Peru. A
                      second component will assess the use of participatory budgeting as an instrument to
                      increase voice of local actors and its potential impact on improving results, particularly
                      those prioritized in performance-based budgeting (PBB). A third component will
                      focus on analyzing the actual and potential contributions of PBB approaches to
                      improving the efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures in the education sector
                      (Education ESW mentioned above).
