                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project implementation was much slower than anticipated mainly due to long and cumbersome domestic procedures for the approval of the sub-projects and related
                         investments which affected mainly Component 3 (Social Assistance Services). In Spring 2011, the World Bank approved two restructurings of the project (a 23 months extension of
                         the closing date, to enable the completion of the ongoing activities; and new technical assistance activities in support of the Social Assistance System Modernization Project.

                         Components 1 (Priority Interventions in Roma communities) and 2 (Early Childhood Development) continued to perform well. Under Component 1, all 100 sub-projects initially
                         approved were completed. Under Component 2, all the construction/rehabilitation works for the 27 kindergartens included in the program have been completed as well as the
                         consulting services related to the development of curriculum for inclusive early childhood education, the delivery of training for the educators were completed as well as the purchase
                         of furniture and household appliances. Now, that the inputs have been achieved, the project results should materialize.

                         Under Component 3, the approval of investments related to 33 sub-projects for social services for persons with disabilities and youth at risk and victims of domestic violence, enabled
                         the launch of the procurement of civil works for 31 sub-projects, but three of them were dropped by the local authorities. The works were completed for 2 sub-projects and are well
                         under way for a further 14 sub-projects. Tenders are being launched for the other 11 sub-projects.
