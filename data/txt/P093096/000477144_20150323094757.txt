F. Results Framework Analysis


Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The SIP’s development objective is to improve the living conditions and social inclusion of the
most disadvantaged/vulnerable people in Romanian society by (i) improving the living conditions
and social inclusion of Roma living in poor settlements; (ii) increasing the inclusiveness of ECE
services in targeted areas; and (iii) improving the quality of services for PWD, youth at risk, and
victims of domestic violence.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The project development objective (PDO) was revised through a level-1 project restructuring on
March 28, 2011 to include the new technical assistance (TA) activities related to the
strengthening of Romania’s social assistance administration under the project. The TA activities
were to support implementation of the GORs ongoing social assistance reforms and its then
recently approved Social Assistance Reform Strategy. The TA activities also complemented the
Bank’s support for those reforms under an ongoing programmatic development policy loan (DPL)
series and a Social Assistance System Modernization Project (SASMP) that was under
preparation at the time.

The revised PDO was to (i) improve the living conditions and social inclusion of the most
disadvantaged and vulnerable people in Romania and (ii) strengthen the administration of social
assistance benefits.

                                Executive Summary
1.     The Social Inclusion Project (SIP) was developed and launched whilst, in the
mid-2000s, Romania was preparing to join the European Union (EU). Such process
included paying renewed attention to social inclusion matters, particularly among
Romania’s large Roma population. At that time, the Bank had contributed to increasing
awareness on Roma issues – including helping to launch the Decade of Roma Inclusion
2005-2015 – as well as partnering in project operations. The loan of €47.2 million for the
SIP was approved by the Bank’s Board on June 2006 and became effective on March
2007. The original project development objective (PDO) was to improve the living
conditions and social inclusion of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in
Romania.

2.     The project was restructured twice. The first restructuring took place in early
2011, including to revising the PDO to expand its scope, reallocating project funds from
savings between components and introduce a new subcomponent, modifying the Results
Framework Agreement, and extending the Project’s closing date by two years from
March 1, 2011 to March 1, 2013. The second restructuring was held in December 2012 to
extend the Project’s closing date by 17 months from February 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014,
and amend the description of activities from one sub-component.

3.      The Project comprised four components, the first of which featured the “Priority
Interventions Program” (€11.7 Million). This supported the Romanian Social
Development Fund’s (RSDF) program to improve living conditions and social inclusion
for Roma through better infrastructure and basic social services. The second component
of the SIP, “Inclusive Early Childhood Education Program” (€6.1 Million) in the
Ministry of Education and Research (MER), was pursued through various activities.
These mainly included construction of Early Childhood Education (ECE) infrastructure
in communities with a high percentage of Roma, development of an inclusive ECE
curriculum, provision of training to ECE staff, formulation of coherent ECE legislation,
communication initiatives, and other activities.

4.      The third component, “Social Assistance Programs” (€28.6 Million), originally
envisioned three subcomponents housed under the Ministry of Labor, Family and Social
Protection (MLFSP). The Disabilities Program subcomponent (€14.4 million) aimed at
restructuring of institutionalized care and development of alternative community-based
systems of assistance. The subcomponent of Youth at Risk Program (€11.1 million) was
designed for youth aged 18 years and above graduating from the institutionalized care
system to provide them with increased access to integrated social services. The last
subcomponent, Victims of Domestic Violence Program (€3.1 million), was designed to
support the development of specialized integrated social services for such victims until
their family situation was resolved. A new fourth subcomponent was subsequently
introduced in 2011 to support the implementation of the Social Assistance System
Modernization Project (SASMP) and included a range of activities in support of MLFSP
to increase efficiency in the administration and monitoring of social assistance benefits.
Finally, the SIP fourth component, “Capacity Building for Roma Social Inclusion” (€0.8

                                          xviii
Million) was intended to provide assistance to the National Agency for Roma (NAR) and
its eight regional branches to coordinate activities such as inclusive planning, monitoring
and evaluation.

5.      Several factors affected the SIP’s implementation and outcome. During project
preparation, two distinct projects were under preparation, one to address the needs of the
Roma and another to meet those of ‘other vulnerable groups’. In line with the
Government’s vision, however, these were merged into a single project. The preparation
phase identified four key risks, which were rated as ‘significant’. While relevant
mitigation measures were set out, the project’s risk analysis may have underestimated
some key risks, chiefly the complexities around providing institutional coordination,
monitoring and evaluation of a comprehensive program implemented at multiple levels
and by several ministries. In practice, each of the implementing agencies would use their
own administrative, fiduciary, and procurement structures, with no single agency
entrusted with overall coordination of the project, its implementation, and reporting
requirements (the MLFSP assumed a de facto role in overall reporting coordination).

6.      When the project was approved, three of the project’s Operational Manuals
(OMs) (i.e., RSDF, MER, and MLFSP) had not been completed and adopted, and the site
selection for activities had not been decided. This was mainly due to efforts to ensure
participation of local communities and Roma counterparts in identifying locations,
priority works, and activities. As a result, baseline data could only be collected once site
selection had been decided. Finally, the RF was designed to measure progress achieved
through activities that were to be supported by the project, which was adequate as a
measure of improvements in ‘living conditions’, but not for defining and tracking ‘social
inclusion’.

7.      The project’s early implementation was slow. Three years after effectiveness,
disbursements totaled only about 10 percent (but commitments totaled slightly over 70
percent). Several factors had a negative impact on the project’s implementation,
including the limited capacity of the NAR, lengthy subproject approval procedures, the
financial crisis of 2008, low local government capacity, and central government staffing
changes. With regards to NAR in particular, due to the protracted lack of progress in
implementing activities under Component 4, savings amounting to €0.6 million were
reallocated to other components under the restructuring in 2011. Monitoring presented
several challenges in the project’s early implementation that resulted in successive
‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’ or ‘Unsatisfactory’ ratings for M&E in the project’s
Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR). The RSDF developed its own survey,
implemented it, obtained the baseline data (collected in 2008 and 2009), and conducted
evaluations. Efforts made by the other implementing agencies to select consultant
services to carry out baseline indicator studies were hindered by limited interest of
potential bidders. For Component 3, there were four attempts by the MLFSP to contract
these services.

8.     The project’s overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. It was, and
continues to be, highly relevant and central to the Government’s strategy and the Bank’s

                                            xix
assistance priorities. Its outcomes, as measured by the indicators in the project’s RF, were
achieved and surpassed with respect to the first two components, and were partially
achieved with respect to the third component. However, the project was not successful in
strengthening the NAR to assume a more central role in the coordination, monitoring, and
evaluation of programs focused on Roma communities. Based on available data and
expectations, the project was implemented efficiently and is expected to either generate
positive returns or improve living conditions for disadvantaged persons. In other words,
outputs were achieved, although they were compounded by limited evidence on impacts
and efficiency.

9.      The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. Responding to Government’s request for assistance in a very short period,
the project addressed most vulnerable groups under one single operation. The project was
designed with a clear sustainability objective, not only by using existing government
structures, but also by requiring up-front investments commitments from local authorities.
While recognizing the risk that it posed and responding to the GOR’s request for rapid
assistance and the World Bank’s desire to respond quickly, the preparation team may
have underestimated the complexities of the project’s institutional arrangements. Finally,
the project’s RF, while relatively concise, presents mostly output indicators and depends
on often subjective surveys of beneficiary satisfaction. It did not include important
indicators—for example, how many beneficiaries were served by different investments,
their gender breakdown, and the number of Roma who benefited—that would have been
valuable to monitor progress and retroactively adjust programs to more effectively
address the needs of vulnerable groups. However, these data were collected internally by
the RSDF and the MER for Components 1 and 2.

10.     From the monitoring side in particular, the project did not systematically track the
full range RF indicators. For instance, 10 out of the 24 indicators that were to be
monitored as per 2011 restructuring were not included in the ensuing ISRs. Data for some
of those indicators was, however, availed in commissioned studies, these only provided
final data instead of reporting on indicators’ value on an annual basis. Although there
were challenges in the establishment of baselines, recruitment of M&E consultants and
possible unclear nature of some indicators, more efforts could have been put in place to
ensure a systematic collection, monitoring and reporting of RF indicators.

11.     The quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Supervision was
undertaken in a challenging environment, including, for example, a fluid and frequently
changing institutional context. Supervision was regular and focused on obtaining up-to-
date information on indicators in the project’s RF. Yet the project’s components were
supervised individually and implemented separately by the respective agencies with, as
per design, limited coordination among them. Although the 2011 restructuring reallocated
funding in favor of well-performing components, at times, supervision efforts could have
seized opportunities to adapt, adjust, and reformulate the project in a way that would have
enhanced the impact and use of available resources. As a result, €10.2 million that could
have been used to finance additional activities by the RSDF and the MER had to be
cancelled.

                                            xx
12.    The Government performance was Moderately Satisfactory. The Government
displayed ownership and commitment to the project throughout implementation despite
the frequent changes that affected the political leadership and fiscal constraints.
Nevertheless, the Government, despite expressing its objective of addressing the needs of
vulnerable groups in a coordinated fashion, did not to put in place a workable mechanism
to develop a concerted strategy, prioritize, disseminate, and monitor progress in
addressing their needs.

13.     The implementing agencies’ performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The
RSDF’s performance exceeded expectations. Its strong performance benefitted from
competent, committed staff and good governance. The MER’s performance was also
highly satisfactory because it was able to implement activities under Component 2
effectively and efficiently. The performance of the MLFSP (including the National
Agency for Family Protection (NAFP) NationalAuthority for Persons with Handicap
(NAPH) until they were made directorates) was weaker than that of either the RSDF or
the MER. This was largely the result of several government changes (leadership changed
seven times during implementation with consequent changes at lower levels in the
Ministry), as well as major restructuring in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis.
Clearly, local-level implementation was also affected by the Government’s cumbersome
procedures.

14.      The project’s implementation provides several lessons. For example, project
design should set out a clear definition of what constitutes social inclusion, how to
measure it, and a theory of change for the project overall; design needs to incorporate a
comprehensive pre-assessment of institutional capacities; decentralized and centralized
implementation models present potential tensions that need to be considered explicitly
during project preparation; the establishment of a coordination mechanism among project
components is important, especially when multiple implementing agencies are involved;
there is a potential trade-off between rapid preparation of a project and establishing an
effective monitoring and evaluation system; committed leadership and champions have a
critical role to play in laying the foundations for social inclusion; project design should
consider flexible and tailored arrangements that allow for intra-community and spatial-
sensitive approaches; the role of and consultation with NGOs and civil society should be
embedded within the project cycle on inclusion projects; finally, pilot experiences can
provide an effective instrument to test alternative approaches to implementation of
assistance delivery models.

1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

15.     At the time of appraisal of the Social Inclusion Project (SIP, the project) in early
2006, Romania was focusing all of its efforts on accession to the European Union (EU)
and had initiated a significant number of actions to facilitate smooth integration. Among
these, social inclusion and poverty reduction measures, targeted at disadvantaged groups,
were being designed to contribute to the country’s continued stability, social cohesion,
and participation in growth and economic integration. A Joint Inclusion Memorandum
(JIM), signed by Romania and the European Commission in June 2005, aimed to prepare
the country for full participation in the ‘open method of coordination’ agreed by EU
member states on social inclusion. The JIM identified the following vulnerable social
groups: the Roma minority, children at high risk, persons with disabilities, youth over 18
years leaving the state child protection system, and victims of domestic violence.

16.     Romania’s large Roma population1 was, in particular, in need of social inclusion.
An estimated 74 percent of Roma lived in poverty, with almost half of the poor living in
extreme poverty. Their infant mortality rate was four times higher than the country’s
average, and only 12.9 percent of the active Roma were formally employed. Problems
facing the Roma were considered systemic, with interrelated issues with regard to
education, housing, employment, and health, and their ability to relate to institutions and
influence policies and programs was limited. Also, the poverty risk among children was
high, and this had a disproportionate impact among Roma populations 2.




1
  According to the National Census 2002, only 535,250 persons self-identified as Roma, but sociological
surveys reported a much higher Roma population (1.5 million estimated in 1998 by the Institute for Quality
of Life).
2
  Around 30 percent of children under the age of 15 were poor (compared to 23 percent of the total
population); Romania’s infant mortality (18.4 percent) was the highest of all EU member states and
candidate countries; most children under five who died at home belonged to Roma families and to families
living in extreme poverty; and 12–20 percent of Roma children dropped out of school during primary and
secondary education. The availability of early childhood development (ECD) services had declined
dramatically during the transition period. A large number of the nurses in crèches were unqualified, and
participation of Roma children in preschool education was four times lower than among the rest of the
preschool population. Of Romania’s population of 21.7 million at the time, about 430,000 were registered
as persons with disabilities (PWD), including about 55,000 children. Among the adults, almost 20,000
PWD lived in 141 long-term care (LTC) institutions that functioned under the authority of local
governments. Due to financial constraints, however, those LTC institutions had unacceptable conditions.
Furthermore, disability determination criteria were somewhat arbitrary and restrictive, and employment
opportunities for persons with less severe disabilities were lacking. Although the number of youth over 18
years in the state residential care system had been halved, slightly under 14,000 children aged 14–17 years
still lived in childcare institutions. About 5,000 of them left these institutions annually when they turned 18
years and state assistance ended, and a significant number of these youth were Roma. The number of
victims of domestic violence had been increasing—from about 8,000 reported cases in 2004 to slightly over
9,500 in 2005.

                                                      1
17.     Government strategy. The government of Romania (GOR) had developed, and in
some cases, begun implementation of strategies to address the challenges confronting
each of these disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. In 2001, the GOR adopted a ten-year
National Strategy for Improvement of the Roma Situation (NSIRS). It had also been
active in the launch of the Decade of Roma Inclusion (2005–2015), for which Decade
Action Plans had been prepared (and were under implementation) for education,
employment, housing, and health. The Ministry of Education and Research (MER) had
developed an Early Childhood Education (ECE) strategy (2005–2011) as part of an
envisaged Convergent Early Childhood Development (ECD) Strategy. The ECE strategy
aimed to improve access to and quality of early education for children aged 0–6 years,
providing linkages with health and child protection programs.

18.     Building on social protection and anti-discrimination legislation, in September
2005, the GOR approved a Strategy for the Social Protection, Integration, and Inclusion
of Persons with Disabilities (2006–2103) and related action plans. It initiated activities
aimed at prevention of institutionalization, deinstitutionalization, development of
alternative community-based services (CBS), and social inclusion for persons with
disabilities. A National Strategy for Social Inclusion of Youth over 18 Coming Out of the
Residential Care System (2006–2008), which contemplated the concept of
multifunctional centers to temporarily assist these young people in preparing for an
independent life, was in the process of approval. Finally, the then significant increase in
the incidence of domestic violence led to the approval of the National Strategy for the
Prevention and Fight Against Domestic Violence in 2005.

19.     Rationale for World Bank involvement. The rationale for Bank involvement was
strong. The Bank had contributed to increasing awareness on Roma issues by co-
organizing a series of regional conferences with the Open Society Foundations and the
EU. This led to the creation of the Roma Education Fund and the launch of the Decade of
Roma Inclusion (2005–2015). Romania had participated in these events and declared its
commitment to reduce the social exclusion of Roma. The GOR’s strategies and plans to
modernize the approach to social assistance of PWDs, youth at risk, and victims of
domestic violence would benefit from the Bank’s earlier work in these areas, including
support to Romania’s highly successful child welfare reform under the Child Welfare
Reform Project. 3 Further, the project would build on earlier Bank assistance under the
two-phase Social Development Fund Program APL (including, in part, implementation
arrangements) that also aimed to improve the livelihood of beneficiaries from poor, rural
communities, and disadvantaged groups while promoting social capital enhancement and
civic engagement among beneficiaries. 4

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (As
Approved)

20.      The SIP’s development objective was to improve the living conditions and social
inclusion of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in the Romanian society by (i)
improving the living conditions and social inclusion of Roma living in poor settlements;
(ii) increasing the inclusiveness of ECE services in targeted areas; and (iii) improving the
quality of services for PWD, youth at risk, and victims of domestic violence.

21.   The key indicators identified to measure progress toward achieving project
outcomes were the following:

    •   20 percent reduction in the gap between targeted poor Roma settlements and
        neighboring communities as measured by the living conditions index;
    •   70 percent of Roma in targeted poor settlements acknowledging an improvement
        in basic living conditions;
    •   5 percentage points increase in children from vulnerable groups in targeted
        communities participating in ECE;
    •   Services developed for the PWD score at least 80 percent on the standards
        compliance index for each category of quality standards; and
    •   At least 40 percent increase in the rate of employment of youth aged 18 years and
        above benefiting from multifunctional centers’ services.

22.  Intermediate outcome indicators were also defined in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD). These are presented in annex 10.

1.3 Revised PDO (As Approved by Original Approving Authority) and Key
Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

23.     The project development objective (PDO) was revised through a level-1 project
restructuring on March 28, 2011, to include new technical assistance (TA) activities
related to the strengthening of Romania’s social assistance administration under the
project. The TA activities were to support implementation of the GOR’s ongoing social
assistance reforms and its then recently approved Social Assistance Reform strategy. The
TA activities also complemented the Bank’s support for those reforms under an ongoing
programmatic development policy loan (DPL) series and a Social Assistance System
Modernization Project (SASMP) that was under preparation at the time.

24.    The revised PDO was to (i) improve the living conditions and social inclusion of
the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in Romania and (ii) strengthen the
administration of social assistance benefits. The project’s original outcome indicators
remained, but the following new indicator was included to reflect its expanded PDO: 5


5
 The Restructuring Paper mentioned that two new indicators were included, but only listed the one
mentioned here.

                                               3
    •   The scope of National Agency for Social Benefits (NASB) management
        information system (MIS), as measured by the number of large social assistance
        programs 6 (or their successors) paid through SAFIR, increases from 4 (2010) to 8
        programs by 2013.

25.     The project’s intermediate outcome indicators were also revised to reflect its
restructuring as well as to adjust them to implementation progress (annex 10).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

26.     The project’s main direct beneficiaries were to include (i) the most disadvantaged
Roma who lived in 100 (later, 116 after the project’s restructuring) poor settlements and
would be provided with improved living conditions and efforts aimed at promoting social
inclusion; (ii) Roma children aged 0–6 years, who would benefit from the ECE through
mainstreaming into the MER’s regular policies and programs; (iii) PWD, with a high
dependency on residential services, who would be provided with better quality care and
increased access to CBS; (iv) youth over 18 years graduating from the institutionalized
child care system, who would no longer be eligible for state support and who would be
provided with social services aimed at increasing their readiness for independent living;
and (v) victims of domestic violence and their dependents who would benefit from
specialized, integrated social services until their family situation was resolved. Project
beneficiaries also included the institutions of social protection responsible for
implementation of different activities and the new CBS—the Romanian Social
Development Fund (RSDF), the MER, the Ministry of Labor, Social Solidarity and
Family (MLSSF), the National Authority for Persons with Handicap (NAPH), and the
National Agency for Roma (NAR). These institutions would benefit from training, TA,
and miscellaneous services to support the strengthening of their service delivery and their
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capabilities. 7 Through project restructuring, the
Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (MLFSP), and the broader government
were introduced as beneficiaries, through the institutional strengthening that would be
provided to them.




6
  The eight largest social assistance programs in 2010 were the State Child Allowance (SCA); Child
Raising Benefits (CRB); Complementary Family Allowance (CFA); Single Parent Allowance (SPA);
Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI); Heating Benefits (HB); Indemnity for Disabled Adults (IDA); and
Complementary Budget for Disabled Adults (CBDA).
7
  The name of the Ministry of Labor, Social Solidarity and Family was formally changed to Ministry of
Labor, Family and Social Protection (MLFSP) in 2012 (December 22). The acronyms MLSSF and MLFSP
are used in this document to refer to the ministry based on timing, that is, information from the PAD uses
MLSSF, and later references use MLFSP.

1.5 Original Components (As Approved)

27.    The SIP comprised four components:

(i)    Component 1: Priority Interventions Program (€11.7 Million)

28.     This component was designed to support RSDF’s program of poverty alleviation
and capacity-building interventions by expanding the fund’s activities to specifically
address the needs of the Roma. The project aimed to improve living conditions and social
inclusion for Roma living in about 100 poor settlements, bringing those most
disadvantaged settlements up to minimum conditions in terms of infrastructure and basic
social services. The project was to support (i) financing of demand-driven, integrated
Priority Interventions subprojects, on a grant basis awarded by the RSDF following a
competitive process from among a list of eligible settlements provided by the NAR; (ii)
carrying out of promotion, information, and education campaigns; M&E activities; and
the provision of training for local authorities, community groups, and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs); (iii) provision of assistance in capacity building at the community
level through preparation, facilitation, evaluation, and supervision of Priority
Interventions subprojects and provision of related training, including training to the
RSDF; and (iv) provision of TA to poor Roma communities to prepare projects to be
financed through EU funds.

(ii)    Component 2: Inclusive Early Childhood Education Program (€6.1 Million)
By helping mainstream Roma into the regular policies and programs of the MER, this
component was designed to support the MER’s ECE program (2005–2011) that aimed to
ensure every child’s right to education and overall development starting from a very early
age. The project would help jump-start the inclusive measures of the MER’s overall ECE
program through (i) construction, extensions, rehabilitation, and furnishing of ECE
infrastructure in communities with a high percentage of Roma; (ii) development of an
inclusive ECE curriculum, provision of training to ECE staff, development and
distribution of ECE teaching and learning materials, and provision of TA to entities
entitled to submit financing applications for projects to be financed through EU structural
funds; (iii) promotion of integrated services and alternative community-based solutions
for the ECE, including development of coherent ECE legislation, and provision of
training and counseling programs for parents; and (iv) carrying out of M&E, information,
education, and communication activities.

(iii) Component 3: Social Assistance Programs (€28.6 Million)
This component was designed to support programs of the MLSSF aimed at improving the
situation of PWD, youth at risk, and victims of domestic violence through three
subcomponents:

Subcomponent 3.1: Disabilities Program (€14.4 million). This subcomponent aimed to
improve the quality of care in residential services and increase the access to CBS for
PWD in need, especially those with a high dependency on residential services. It would
support the MLSSF/NAPH program for restructuring of institutionalized care, prevention
of institutionalization, de-institutionalization, and development of alternative community-
                                            5
based systems of assistance and social inclusion through (i) subprojects—submitted by
local authorities and selected in accordance with a competitive grant scheme—aimed at
restructuring and rehabilitation of existing institutions and construction of new
infrastructure facilities, in line with improved standards developed by the NAPH, and
development of alternative CBS to support the de-institutionalization process; (ii)
institutional capacity building through provision of training to professional staff in the
new standards of care and development of the M&E system for the NAPH; and (iii)
provision of occupational counseling services to the beneficiaries of the newly
restructured institutions. 8

Subcomponent 3.2: Youth at Risk Program (€11.1 million). This subcomponent was
designed for youth aged 18 years and above, graduating from the institutionalized care
system, to provide them with increased access to integrated social services that would
increase their readiness for independent living. It would finance subprojects submitted by
local authorities (and awarded on a competitive basis) to support the establishment of a
network of multifunctional centers, where eligible beneficiaries would have access to
protected housing, complemented by a range of psychological, social, vocational,
occupational, and legal counseling services. It would also finance M&E activities,
provision of training to counseling providers and MLSSF staff involved in supervising
the function of the multifunctional centers established, and implementation of public
awareness campaigns.

Subcomponent 3.3: Victims of Domestic Violence Program (€3.1 million). This
subcomponent was designed to support the development of specialized integrated social
services. Victims of domestic violence could have access to these services for a limited
period of time until their family situation was resolved, so that they could return to a
normal life. It would finance subprojects submitted by local authorities for rehabilitation
and/or construction of housing infrastructure to shelter victims (and their dependents) and
endowment with furniture and household appliances. It would also finance professional
training for staff that would provide counseling services, development of a specific MIS,
and implementation of public awareness campaigns.

(iv)   Component 4: Capacity Building for Roma Social Inclusion (€0.8 Million)
This component aimed to provide assistance to the NAR and its eight regional branches
to coordinate activities aimed at improving inclusive planning; M&E; and identification,
preparation, and implementation of programs to be financed by the EU and other funds,
through (i) provision of training to NAR staff, Roma NGOs, local authorities, and Roma
community initiative groups; (ii) preparation and implementation of an information,
education, and communication strategy; and (iii) strengthening of the M&E system.



8
  The provision of occupational counseling services would scale up the positive results obtained in the pilot
employment counseling offices for the PWD established under the Social Sector Development Project
(SSDP). Under that project, 8 out of 46 district employment agencies established pilot centers for disabled
jobseekers, accommodating their infrastructure, office equipment, and staff training to the needs of the
PWD.

1.6 Revised Components

29.     Level-1 project restructuring approved in early 2011 (section 1.3) also included a
new subcomponent under the project description, reallocated funding among categories
of expenditure, and extended the loan closing date by 21 months from May 1, 2011 to
February 1, 2013. The loan’s closing date had previously been extended by two months,
from March 1 to May 1, 2011, to provide additional time to process the project
restructuring.

30.      A new Subcomponent 3.4, social assistance cash transfer program, was added to
the project to support the implementation of the SASMP (results-based financing). This
subcomponent provided ‘Support to the MLFSP and other relevant governmental
institutions in its subordination and/or coordination to increase efficiency in the
administration and monitoring of social assistance benefits through, inter alia, (i)
upgrading of the MIS for the NASB with modules for family support allowances and
guaranteed minimum income (GMI); (ii) harmonization of means-testing procedures for
the eligibility of social assistance benefits; (iii) harmonization of disability assessment
criteria and the institutional framework for disability benefits and invalidity pensions; (iv)
development of institutional capacity and tools to prevent and combat error and fraud; (v)
promotion of public information campaigns to present proposed reforms for efficiency
and targeting of the social assistance system; and (vi) implementation of M&E activities
to assess the incidence of social assistance transfers and their impacts and the savings
gained from consolidation of social assistance benefits and simplification of social
assistance benefits administration.’

31.    Additional changes in the level-1 restructuring included (i) an additional number
of 16 subprojects (a total of 116 instead of 100) aimed at improving access to basic
community infrastructure and social services for the most disadvantaged Roma living in
poor settlements under Component 1; (ii) reallocating €1.4 million from Component 3 to
Component 1 to finance the additional subprojects and €6.0 million to the new
Subcomponent 3.4, resulting from cost savings once the subprojects for services to
vulnerable groups were approved; and (iii) reallocating €0.6 million in uncommitted
funds under Component 4 to Component 1, as the NAR had secured significant grant
financing (almost €25.0 million) from the EU structural funds for consulting, training,
and public awareness campaign activities.

32.     A last level-2 restructuring, approved on December 14, 2012, extended the
closing date by an additional 17 months, to June 30, 2014. It also modified the project
description of Subcomponent 3.4 to provide for upgrading of the MIS to include modules
not only for family support allowance and the GMI but also for any other new social
assistance benefits to be agreed with the Bank.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

33.     Project preparation. The project was prepared expeditiously, in slightly over six
months from identification to approval by the Bank’s Board of Directors, and included
specialists in social protection, operations, fiduciary functions, and other areas. The
project was fully consistent with the GOR’s priorities and counted upon its commitment
and ownership. During preparation, several project design options were considered. Two
projects were under preparation at the time, one to address the needs of the Roma and
another to address the needs of ‘other vulnerable groups’. 9 However, the government did
not want to limit and segregate support within separate projects but rather wanted to
address the needs of all vulnerable groups comprehensively.

34.     Preparation had classified priorities as ‘short-term interventions’, to include a
basic infrastructure package that would be financed by the RSDF; a ‘social inclusion
program’ that would finance activities of four ministries (education, health, living
conditions and) involved in the preparation of inclusive programs; and ‘long-term priority’
financing activities complementary to those funded by the EU and strengthening the
capacity of institutions to tap EU funding for social inclusion. 10 Eventually, while the
concept note addressed each of these levels of priority, the project focused only on some
of those. For example, it did not target the elderly as a vulnerable group nor did it address
the totality of needs of the vulnerable groups to achieve ‘social inclusion’ (for example,
housing and health). The government had institutional coordination mechanisms in place
to ensure that all the needs of all vulnerable groups could be identified, addressed, and
monitored in a comprehensive and coordinated manner.

35.     The project was in-line with the poverty alleviation and social inclusion pillar of
the Country Partnership Strategy 2006-2008 (and with the social and spatial inclusion
pillar of the Romania Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009–2013) and the rationale
for World Bank involvement was strong (section 1.1). 11 Preparation counted on a detailed
social assessment that incorporated stakeholder views obtained through a consultative
process that included advocacy groups and Roma NGOs as well as NGOs involved in
provision of services to children and the disabled. The objective of those consultations
was not only to identify issues facing those groups, but more importantly, to design



9
  According to World Bank staff, the Bank had embarked on preparing a larger, inclusive preschool
education project. When the decision was made to address inclusion in one Bank-funded project for all
categories, the Ministry of Finance proposed a larger preschool education project (not Roma-focused) to
the Council of the Europe Development Bank. This could be considered somewhat complementary to the
SIP.
10
   In early project documentation, the possibility of addressing the health needs of vulnerable groups and
the needs of the elderly was also considered but later excluded, presumably to provide better focus to
project activities.

arrangements that would promote and facilitate stakeholder participation in
implementation and monitoring mechanisms.

36.      Earlier, several Bank-financed projects and Institutional Development Fund (IDF)
grants (and projects financed by other donors) in Romania had addressed the needs of the
most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, albeit in a less comprehensive manner 12 .
Lessons of experience from those projects provided important input to guide the project’s
preparation. The project built on the highly successful experience of the Social
Development Fund APL, implemented by the RSDF, and the Rural Education Project
implemented by the MER. An extensive list of challenges in working with Roma
communities guided the project’s community-based design by incorporating lessons from
pilot activities as well as from the RSDF’s experience in working with these communities.
Experience under the Rural Education Project fed into the design of Component 2.
Similarly, the successful experience of tapping the CBS as an alternative to
institutionalized LTC for PWDs and other vulnerable groups (youth at risk and victims of
domestic violence) under the Social Sector Development Project (SSDP) provided
important lessons that were incorporated in the design of the project’s Subcomponent 3.1.
Finally, experience from other countries in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region
with a program-based approach (PBA) was taken into account in the project’s design.

37.     Preparation revealed four key risks, which were assigned with an overall risk
rating of ‘Significant’, mostly since implementation would rely on existing government
systems and programs. To address these, the team identified relevant mitigation measures,
including capacity-building measures under the SIP and other projects and TA activities
in the Bank’s assistance program. The project’s risk analysis underestimated these risks:
(i) achieving coordination with what was to be a comprehensive program for addressing
the needs of vulnerable groups, (ii) counting on a strong institutional framework for
providing that coordination, and (iii) putting in place an effective system for monitoring
the needs and the progress made in addressing those needs. It also underestimated the
multiple institutional and implementation risks of a project that was to be implemented
by several institutions, at the central, local, and community level (and the differences in
implementation processes that would entail).

38.     Project design. The project was designed as a PBA, whereby the investment
project would support several of the GOR’s existing inclusive programs, as opposed to a
‘stand-alone project’ that would support only a predefined investment project. Every year,
the GOR and the Bank would agree on specific activities and implementation priorities to
be financed by the project in support of the overall inclusive investment programs of each
of the executing agencies. This approach to project design was chosen by the preparation
team as it would allow Bank financing to assume more of a catalytic role that would help
jump-start all of the GOR’s inclusive programs, with fewer resources allocated to each
but with greater impact at a broader level. It was also considered relevant as it would
support the strengthening of the GOR’s country systems—in terms of investment

  IDF Grants included a US$350,000 grant for Capacity Building for Roma Inclusion Programs and a
US$264,000 grant for Capacity Building for Anti-Poverty Commission.

                                               9
planning, budgeting, and monitoring that was important to align them with EU
standards—and build capacity in Romania to absorb EU structural funds in support of its
inclusive programs. In fact, project preparation was coordinated closely with the EU
delegation in Romania and the project’s results framework (RF) included an intermediate
outcome indicator to capture the capacity of local groups to access EU funds for social
inclusion programs. 13

39.      By opting for a catalytic approach that would impact most of the GOR’s inclusive
programs, the project’s design, almost by definition, required complex institutional
arrangements. These involved implementation by two ministries, the MLFSP—and two
agencies reporting to it, the NAPH and the National Agency for Family Protection
(NAFP)—and the MER as well as two agencies, the RSDF and NAR. As a mitigating
factor, the MLFSP, MER, and RSDF had extensive implementation experience, including
with Bank-financed projects. Nevertheless, each of the implementing agencies would use
their own administrative, fiduciary, and procurement structures. Individual program
coordinators in the agencies would prepare, implement, and monitor their respective
agencies’ Annual Development Plans (ADPs) under the overall coordination of a steering
committee that included the secretaries of state of the MLFSP and MER in addition to the
Ministry of Public Finance (MPF) and the presidents of each of the four agencies. There
was no single agency entrusted with overall coordination of the project, its
implementation, and reporting requirements, although the MLFSP assumed a de facto
role in overall reporting coordination. The project was implemented in accordance with
three Operational Manuals (OMs), one each for the RSDF, MER, and MLFSP.

40.      The RSDF implemented Component 1 through communities and coordinated
activities by relying exclusively on its internal administrative structure. Implementation
of activities under Components 2 and 3 were coordinated by project management units
(PMUs), of which there were two in the MER (Rural Education PMU and School
Rehabilitation PMU), and one in the MLFSP. The PMU in the MLFSP also provided
support to fiduciary requirements of activities carried out by the NAR under Component
4—a design feature that at least in perception may have affected the relative standing of
the NAR, the agency that was to have a central role in coordination of activities targeted
at the Roma population that is, site selection and monitoring of implementation, but not
of communicating with the Bank) vis-à-vis other project implementing agencies.

41.     Institutional arrangements were additionally complex in that the activities under
the project’s four components were, following Romania’s institutional framework, to be
implemented by different levels of government. Coordination and implementation of
Component 2 was ensured by two PMUs in the MER. County councils were responsible
for the processes required for construction of centers for PWD, youth at risk, and victims
of domestic violence under Component 3. Nevertheless, during preparation, no capacity
assessments were done at the local level. Local levels had varying, generally poor
capacity, large distances separating them from the respective PMUs. This led to little

  The relevant intermediate outcome indicator is: ‘Percentage of SIP assisted promoters of mature project
proposals eligible for EU financing’.

                                                   10
interaction, following of different reporting systems, and unfamiliarity with procurement
and financial management procedures for Bank-financed projects, all of which together
with cumbersome domestic approval procedures, came to adversely impact the
implementation of Component 3.

42.     Further, the project was designed to promote the participation of Roma and other
disadvantaged persons in the prioritization, identification, and implementation of
subprojects that addressed their needs. Due to this, implementation by each of the above
implementing agencies involved not only implementation of activities that would build
their own capacity but also their working with and through targeted local communities
(including representatives of the Roma communities, NGOs, and other stakeholders),
dispersed throughout the country, to promote, inform, and build capacity to prepare,
implement, and monitor demand-driven inclusive subprojects. It also required inter-
agency cooperation among the various implementing agencies, especially with the NAR,
which had an important role in terms of providing input for the selection of targeted
communities under Components 1 and 2. In an attempt to combine local interests with
national strategies, several local communities were consulted during preparation to
ensure that the proposed project met their needs.

43.     Over and above the project’s institutional complexities, the works were not ready
for implementation when the project was approved. The project’s three OMs (RSDF,
MER, and MLFSP) had not been completed and adopted, and more importantly, the site
selection for activities had not been decided. Mostly, this was the result of the project’s
design that aimed to ensure the participation of local communities and Roma counterparts
in identifying locations, priority works, and activities. Yet, this was especially important
for site selection under Components 2 and 3. These components were to involve large
scale works with lengthier and more complex implementation procedures and were to be
implemented by the local units of their respective ministries. That would involve not only
coordination with the NAR (for Component 2), but more importantly, working with local
authorities to mobilize subproject requests.

44.     The project’s RF was concise and limited to outcomes and intermediate outcomes
that could directly be attributable to its implementation. This was especially important for
a project that was to support the implementation of several of the GOR’s inclusive
programs. Nevertheless, the project’s outcome indicators relied heavily on composite
indices (Living Conditions Index and Standards Compliance Index) and surveys to be
carried out in beneficiary communities, which were undefined and could be seen as
subjective. As a result, baseline data could only be collected once site selection had been
decided. Also, the project’s indicators were inconsistent in their choice of wording, at
times referring to Roma and at other times to vulnerable groups. Finally, the RF was
designed to measure progress achieved through activities that were to be supported by the
project, which was adequate as a measure of improvements in ‘living conditions’
(although any improvement, even building a road in a community, could theoretically be
construed as an improvement in basic living conditions) but fell short of measuring
‘social inclusion’. In fact, social inclusion was not explicitly defined in the project’s



                                            11
documents, and its RF did not include specific indicators to track progress in achieving it,
relying instead on indicators based on living conditions.


2.2 Implementation

45.    The loan of €47.2 million for the SIP was approved by the Bank’s Board on June
13, 2006, and became effective on March 16, 2007 (after two extensions resulting from
slow ratification by the Romanian Parliament). The original closing date of the loan was
March 1, 2011. The mid-term review was held from March 8 to 12, 2010.

46.     The project’s early implementation was slow. Three years after effectiveness,
disbursements totaled only about 10 percent (but commitments totaled slightly over 70
percent). The project was considered at risk from mid-2009 until mid-2011. Several
factors had a negative impact on the project’s implementation, including the capacity of
the NAR, lengthy subproject approval procedures, the financial crisis, local governments’
capacity, and central government staffing changes. Romania’s EU accession process, cost
savings in the implementation of planned activities under the project, and a coordinated
program of Bank (and other) assistance in support of Romania’s social protection sector
had a positive impact on implementation.

47.     The NAR. It was established in 2004 with the responsibility of elaborating
government policy and strategy on Roma issues, administering funds for Roma programs,
representing Roma in specific national and international events, and the overall
monitoring of the GOR’s Roma strategy. The agency is led by a President, with the rank
of Secretary of State, and functions under the General Secretariat of Government (GSG).
During preparation, the NAR’s institutional capacity was known to be weak—the agency
had counted on the Bank IDF grant for capacity strengthening—and further support to
strengthen its capacity was contemplated under Component 4. The goal was to strengthen
the NAR’s capacity to carry out its mandated functions, especially M&E of Roma
programs not just under the project but across all GOR programs.

48.     In addition, the NAR was also to have a very central role in both site selection and
M&E of activities under Components 1 and 2, especially as they affected the Roma
population. However, due to its weak institutional capacity, it was not able to do so in a
timely manner, hampering the progress in the other components. Indeed, delays in site
selection had trickle-down effects on the late launch of infrastructure rehabilitation and
construction. It also significantly affected the collection of baseline data for monitoring
once site selection had been decided. Weak institutional capacity, changes in
management (the NAR had five presidents during the implementation period), high staff
turnover, and apparent lack of interest delayed these processes despite repeated
agreements with Bank implementation support missions on specific action plans to
improve performance. Changes in political leadership in Romania and in the president of
the NAR, together with the sensitivity of the issue for which the agency is entrusted,
clearly had an impact on the NAR’s irregular performance under the project. The
decision to entrust the MLFSP PMU with the fiduciary responsibilities for activities

                                            12
under Component 4 apparently did little to build ownership and commitment to the
project within the NAR. Toward the end of the SIP, significant EU financial support
(almost €25 million) became available to the NAR for various programs (although not
necessarily for the same activities contemplated under the project). With continued lack
of progress in implementing activities under Component 4, savings amounting to €0.6
million were reallocated to other components under the restructuring in 2011. The
remaining funds were committed for development and maintenance of the NAR’s
website. The NAR continued to have a consultative role for the selection of sites in the
Roma-related components. The site selection process was smoother for Component 1,
since the NAR’s president is on the Board of the RSDF. Nevertheless, the NAR’s
monitoring responsibilities were assumed by both the RSDF and MER for their
respective components. However, the NAR lacked the capacity to assume the central role
that had been envisaged for it with respect to overall coordination of Roma strategies,
policies, programs, financing, and monitoring.

49.     Lengthy subproject approval procedures. Activities under Component 3 were
affected by long delays resulting from the lengthy and cumbersome subproject cycle—
totaling in some cases up to 600 days from the launch of the competition for subprojects
by the MLFSP until the start of execution of civil works. This was a generic issue for all
projects in the Romania portfolio that financed civil works. The site selection process by
the MLFSP (and the respective agencies) took over two years to complete and involved
consideration by three selection committees. Once the sites were selected, the subproject
cycle or process included three main phases: (i) technical design and investment
approval; (ii) procurement of civil works; and (iii) execution. Most of these phases
required processes (pre-feasibility, feasibility, and bidding) that were implemented by
local authorities that had, in general, insufficient capacity to prepare technical documents.
In addition, the various processes required approval not only by the MLFSP but also by
local authorities, inter-ministerial committees, and even the GOR. These procedures have
since been streamlined. Still, their impact on the implementation of Component 3, at
several stages of subproject preparation and implementation and among various levels of
government, cannot be underestimated.

50.     Financial crisis. From the year 2000 up to the global financial crisis of 2008,
Romania grew at an average of 6 percent per annum and growth was shared broadly with
the bottom two quintiles. The global financial crisis of 2008 triggered a severe recession
in Romania, halting income growth and poverty reduction. Social transfers played an
important role in mitigating the impact of the crisis on the bottom 40 percent, especially
through increases in pension payments. However, the growth in pension costs and other
social transfers contributed to a rise in fiscal deficits that led to budget cuts for projects
across the portfolio and measures being taken internally to curtail salaries and other
expenses.

51.     Although less affected than others in the Romania portfolio, the project was still
affected by budget cuts and delays in receiving funds for implementation in a timely
manner. The GOR had implemented a new public debt management policy whereby the
state budget pre-financed Bank-supported (and other) project activities, which are then

                                             13
periodically reimbursed through external financing. However, fiscal constraints presented
challenges for the MPF to fully pre-finance project activities in a timely manner, delaying
the launch of activities implemented by MLFSP under Component 3 and to a lesser
extent, the MER under Component 2. Several administrative and staffing measures, taken
in the aftermath of the crisis to curtail expenditures, also impacted the project at the
national and local levels. To rationalize and cut costs, the MLFSP was restructured,
NAPH and NAFP became first general directorates and later directorates of the ministry,
and lost positions and specialized functions. Staffing constraints were imposed. The
PMUs were impacted negatively by a government ordinance related to PMU staff salaries
(common for other PMUs implementing Bank-financed projects). Staffing ceilings
precipitated by budgetary constraints also affected the contracting of specialized staff by
local governments that would be responsible for the delivery of services under the
subprojects financed under Components 2 and 3.

52.     The crisis also appears to have affected the demand for funding of subprojects,
especially under Component 3, since local authorities were required to fund not only a
share of the original investment but also assume responsibility up front for operations and
maintenance for a period of fifteen years upon completion. Faced with the closing of
many firms and a decline in local revenues and transfers, local governments became
cautious in commitments that would affect future budgets. For example, a total of 37
subprojects (centers for social assistance services) were initially approved for financing
by the project selection committees at the level of the MLFSP. However, five subprojects
were dropped, mainly due to the scarcity of counterpart funds at the level of some local
administrations, which was caused by the economic and financial crisis.

53.     Also, as a result of the crisis, curtailing and improving the efficiency of social
assistance programs became a priority for the GOR. Preparation of the results-based
SASMP that would support a comprehensive reform of Romania’s social assistance
programs was underway to support the GOR’s reform. While the reform program would
require significant amounts of TA for its implementation, the GOR had opted not to
borrow for investment financing. 14 With resources that were not being utilized under
Component 4, the project was restructured to finance the TA required to support
implementation of the GOR’s social assistance reform program.

54.     Changes in leadership. In addition to the changes that affected the NAR and other
executing agencies, the project’s implementation was affected by several governmental
and ministerial changes. From preparation through completion, Romania had four
different prime ministers, seven different government coalitions, twelve ministers of the
MLFSP, ten ministers of the MER, nine ministers of MoPFb and five presidents of the
NAR. These changes affected not only the highest levels but generally the second levels
in the executing agencies as well. At the same time, general elections in 2004 and 2008
coincided with local elections, which affected the administrations of local governments


14
  Although an investment project by definition, the SASMP’s design was to provide disbursement not
against incremental project expenditures but on the achievement of activities, outputs, and outcomes as
defined by selected ‘disbursement-linked indicators’.

                                                  14
that were implementing subprojects at the local level. The RSDF, an autonomous agency
and the only executing agency not affected by significant changes in leadership and
staffing, worked closely during electoral periods with candidates and then recently
elected officials to provide continuity, assume ownership, and maintain trust between
communities and local authorities.

55.     EU accession. Romania’s accession to the EU took place on January 1, 2007,
shortly after the project’s approval by the Bank’s Board. Obligations stemming from the
EU membership status of Romania, such as the implementation of the
acquiscommunautaire, and the Europe 2020 agenda for smart, sustainable, and inclusive
growth have constituted a solid foundation for Romania’s development planning process
and provided strategic direction to guide the GOR’s development priorities, including for
social inclusion and poverty reduction. Accession to the EU has provided access to
considerable resources and obligations and targets in specific areas, including social
inclusion (section 3.1).These obligations provided an environment that is supportive of
continued commitment to the project’s objectives, and the project aimed to strengthen the
capacity of agencies and local communities to prepare proposals to mobilize EU funding.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

56.     M&E design. The PAD specified that M&E of outcomes and results would be
done through a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, conducted at both
the national and local levels using administrative and ad hoc data collection mechanisms.
Nevertheless, monitoring of project outcomes presented several challenges. First, the
project’s RF included indicators that depended on the availability of evaluation,
beneficiary assessment, and site surveys to be carried out by the NAR and MLFSP. Most
of the indicators did not have baseline data when implementation began and could only
be compiled after sites for project interventions had been decided. Second, outcomes
were to be monitored through the systems of each of the implementing agencies and later
consolidated into aggregate yearly reports. These would evaluate progress toward the
project’s ADPs, frame the following years’ priorities under each of the programs, and
feed the system for monitoring the National Action Plan for Implementation of the JIM
(JNAP) on social inclusion. The NAR was to have a central role in building a database of
Roma living conditions and social exclusion indicators based on data provided by other
implementing agencies and its own surveys and in producing regular reports on the
Roma’s social exclusion. Finally, the implementing agencies’ capacity for M&E varied
widely in general. The RSDF and MER had built some capacity for M&E while both the
MLFSP and NAR had very limited capacity. Under the project, funding was allocated to
strengthen the M&E systems of the NAPH, MLFSP, NAFP, and NAR.

57.     While the project’s RF was concise, it did not contain basic information on
project beneficiaries of its several interventions, including descriptive data such as the
number of Roma beneficiaries and the beneficiaries’ gender, types of RSDF projects
financed (for example, roads, community centers, water, and education services), or
indicators that would show institutional progress toward addressing exclusion (for
example, number of local governments that incorporated Roma coordinators in their

                                           15
institutional framework). Similarly, monitoring of activities implemented by the MER
and MLFSP could have included indicators classified according to vulnerable groups and
gender, which would allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the project’s benefits.
While some of this information has been compiled ex-post, it would have been desirable
to establish and maintain a comprehensive monitoring framework that would inform
progress on the governmental programs as a whole while selecting a few key indicators to
monitor the project’s progress toward its objectives in parallel.

58.     M&E implementation. Monitoring presented several challenges in the project’s
early implementation that resulted in successive ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’ or
‘Unsatisfactory’ ratings for M&E in the project’s Implementation Status and Results
Report (ISR). Despite repeated focus by the Bank’s implementation support, none of the
agencies had initiated project monitoring or collection of baseline data, in part due to
delays in site selection under the various components and in part due to delays on the part
of the NAR that was expected to carry out the required surveys once sites were selected
according to the original project design. In 2009, an external consultant was contracted
by the NAR to help collect the data. When that consultant didn’t comply with contractual
obligations, each ministry and agency assumed responsibility for developing
methodology and carrying out surveys to compile baseline data and later monitor the
project’s outcomes. The RSDF prepared an evaluation tool to be applied in each
community to obtain the needed data for project indicators. The tool was applied to 42
Roma communities and 42 control, neighboring non-Roma communities, gradually
increasing on a yearly basis (as completed) to all 133 communities. The RSDF developed
its own survey, implemented it, and obtained the baseline data. The RSDF’s evaluation
tool comprised (i) an impact evaluation questionnaire; (ii) a community ‘fiche’ assessing
the conditions of life; (iii) an evaluation of the annual consultations between the local
authorities and the community members. The baseline values for key performance
indicators were collected in 2008 and 2009.

59.    Efforts made by the other implementing agencies to select consultant services to
carry out baseline indicator studies (combining methodology design and survey
implementation) did not succeed due mostly to the lack of interest on behalf of potential
bidders. For Component 3, there were four attempts by the MLFSP to contract these
services.

60.     During the project’s mid-term review, executing agencies questioned the
relevance of some of the monitoring indicators and suggested revisions. The project’s RF
was amended in the level-1 project restructuring in 2011 to address the concerns that had
been raised as well as to reflect the modifications to the project that had been agreed upon
(annex 10). It is not clear if any of the information produced by the project’s monitoring
fed into project-related decisions or the GOR’s efforts to monitor and report progress on
addressing the needs of vulnerable groups. The project did not succeed in putting in place
an integrated framework for monitoring needs, investments, and progress and results of
programs targeted at either the Roma or all vulnerable groups as a whole.




                                            16
61.     More specifically, as reported in Annex 10, out of the 24 indicators that should
have been regularly monitored as per 2011 RF, data for 10 indicators was not included in
ISRs following the restructuring. Their systematic tracking would have enhanced the
project’s monitoring, evaluation and reporting performance, although for some final data
was eventually captured in commissioned studies 15. Although there were challenges in
the establishment of baselines, recruitment of M&E consultants and possible unclear
nature of some indicators 16 , more efforts could have been put in place to ensure the
regular collection, monitoring and reporting of RF indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

62.     Fiduciary (procurement and financial management) functions were implemented
by the RSDF for Component 1, the MER for Component 2, and the MLFSP for
Components 3 and 4 in accordance with the project’s three OMs. All these agencies had
previous experience in complying with the requirements of Bank-financed projects.
Despite the substantial risk to financial management due to complex institutional
arrangements that had been identified during appraisal, financial management
performance including accounting, budgeting, and reporting was satisfactory throughout
implementation, and proper control procedures were maintained. On-site supervision was
conducted regularly, twice each year, with spot checks of selected transactions. All audit
reports were received, occasionally with slight delays, but opinions were clean with only
minor recommendations. The only issue that altered the project’s original financial
arrangements related to the closing of the project’s three designated accounts and
reimbursement to the Bank of amounts that had been advanced when the government
took the decision to pre-finance all externally financed project expenditures with budget
resources (section 2.2).

63.     Procurement processes were satisfactory but complex nevertheless, mostly
because of the different size and scale of the civil works financed under each of the
project’s components as well as the different arrangements followed by each of its
implementing agencies. For Component 1, the RSDF followed procedures in an Annex to
its Operational Manual: Procurement Handbook for RSDF-financed Projects, with small
procurement carried out at the local level and site supervision by RSDF supervisors. For
Component 2, the MER carried out two infrastructure-related procurement processes, one
for school construction and the other for rehabilitation, and then supervised
implementation at the county level.




15
  See reports (both in Romanian) by Impreuna and ECHOSOC (2013) “Evaluation Study of the Early
Childhood Education Program” and RSDF (2013) “Monitoring Report: An Independent Study of the
Performance Indicators of PIP”.

16
 For example, according to staff the indicator “% of PWD services implemented in high-priority areas”
was particularly unclear and difficult to measure.


                                                 17
64.      In addition, the MER implemented important procurements related to provision of
furniture, teaching-learning materials, consulting services for the development of
curricula and associated guides and materials, teacher training, parenting programs, and
other ‘soft’ activities. Component 3 presented the greatest challenges as the procurement
of civil works for the construction and rehabilitation of residential centers was carried out
in a decentralized fashion by the local public administrations that owned the centers. The
national procurement legislation required approval at several phases of the process by
several entities at the local and national level, including the need for inter-ministerial and
even government approvals. This led to continuing delays in implementation. The Bank
carried out post-procurement reviews on an annual basis, including site visits and
physical inspection of the works financed. Only minor issues were identified (for
example, limited bids received, minor reporting issues on evaluation reports, and bid
opening procedures). One recurring issue was the lack of interest in potential bidders and
firms expressing interest in consultancy assignments.

65.     The project triggered the Bank’s Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01)
safeguard in view of the small infrastructure works and rehabilitation of existing works. It
was classified as ‘FI’, with primarily B and some category C subprojects expected. The
OMs included a chapter setting out environmental screening criteria and approach to
identify and mitigate risks. The involuntary resettlement safeguard policy was not
triggered since the project’s OMs stated that subprojects involving land acquisition would
not have Bank financing. The implementing agencies’ compliance with environmental
screening criteria was supervised periodically, including reviews of subproject feasibility
studies, with occasional site visits. Only minor issues were identified, which were
promptly addressed.

66.     During the mid-term review, a field visit was organized in four counties covering
all three of the project’s components that had investment subprojects in different stages
of preparation or implementation. Nine subprojects were visited and the review
concluded that in most of the cases, the technical and engineering aspects of the
environmental protection and mitigation measures included in the subprojects were
compatible with the national and international practice and suitable for the works. The
performance control and supervision of the works was generally well-organized and
coordinated by the PMUs, with direct involvement of site supervisors and local
beneficiaries (local authorities or schools representatives). The Construction State
Inspectorate participated in all the works contacts for the approval of the works’ quality
during the main phases. The mid-term review concluded that all works financed under the
project’s three components were implemented in accordance with the health and safety
requirements and in compliance with local and Bank environmental safeguards. The
review made recommendations regarding site selection for two subprojects implemented
by the MER under Component 2: one kindergarten was in close vicinity of an existing
church with little consideration for maintaining proper access to the religious facility and
the location of another kindergarten would require children to cross a busy, national
railroad to reach the facility, raising safety concerns. In both cases, alternative sites were
identified and the works rebid.



                                             18
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

67.     The GOR remains committed to the project’s PDO and to continue making
progress in addressing social exclusion. The lessons learned under the project, together
with inputs from a reimbursable advisory services (RAS) engagement on poor and
disadvantaged communities and another report on ‘Diagnostics and Policy Advice for
Supporting Roma Inclusion in Romania’ will feed into the design and implementation of
a social inclusion and integrated basic services project that is expected to support
interventions in education, health, employment support, and social services coordinated
at the local level. The project is at the concept stage. Its design will also be aligned with
the draft Social Protection Strategy for Romania, the updated National Roma Integration
Strategy, and EU financing for Roma Inclusion.

68.     The project financed activities under existing GOR programs that will remain in
operation after its completion. Further, the EU has committed an amount of €4.22 million
for 2014–2022 to help the GOR address social exclusion. These funds can be used to
finance specific programs, such as those under the project, which will support Romania
in complying with its targets for social inclusion under the Europe 2020 strategy. In
addition, the RSDF has €30 million financing available in EEA Norway Grants for
projects in Roma communities, mostly in rural areas.

69.     Continuing support to the MLFSP and other governmental institutions aimed at
increasing efficiency in the administration and monitoring of social assistance benefits
will be provided under the SASMP (still ongoing) as well as through new RAS
engagements and a proposed new DPL series. Several TA activities under Component 3.4
supporting the implementation of the ongoing SASMP, including the second phase of the
MIS (SAFIR) upgrade for the National Agency for Payments and Social Inspection
(formerly NASB) and the implementation of the public awareness campaign will be
transferred to the SASMP following a planned forthcoming restructuring that will now
(following a GOR decision to adjust its earlier position on borrowing for investment
projects) provide financing for TA activities.


3.     Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

70.     The project’s objective (to improve the living conditions and social inclusion of
the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in the Romanian society) reflected a
priority at the time it was approved and one that remains highly relevant today. Almost 2
million of Europe’s 10 million Roma live in Romania. The census reports Romania’s
Roma population at 3.3 percent, but unofficial expert estimates reported in the National
Roma Integration Strategy range up to 10 percent as many Roma do not self-identify.
According to a recent European Commission-United Nations Development Programme-
World Bank 2011 report, the vast majority of the Roma population is in the bottom
income quintile. Most live with severe material deprivation and are from large

                                             19
households living in sparsely populated rural areas. Poor educational outcomes start early
with low preschool enrolment rates, poor quality education, and segregated classrooms
and later contribute to poor labor market outcomes. Discrimination continues to be a
hurdle the Roma face. Tackling this discrimination with an integrated solution to break
inter-generational transmission of poverty and following through in the medium-term is
the only way to successfully address the continued social exclusion of low-income
populations, including the Roma.

71.     The project’s objective is consistent with the GOR’s stated strategic priorities.
Romania’s medium-term development strategy is framed within the broader context of
the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy, which is designed around the concept of ‘sustainable,
smart, and inclusive growth’. Europe 2020 proposes a set of specific targets (including
for social inclusion) for the EU as a whole and for each member country. 17 Romania’s
social inclusion target is to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty or exclusion
after social transfers by 580,000.

72.     The project is also consistent with the Bank’s FY14–17 CPS, discussed by the
Board of Directors on May 22, 2014 18 which focuses on reducing poverty in Romania
and fostering sustainable income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population. The
CPS specifically mentions social protection and inclusion of low-income communities,
especially the Roma, as a priority. The CPS has three pillars, of which on is social
inclusion, for which it states that Bank assistance will focus on inclusive services for
marginalized communities, especially the Roma, and on improving the social protection
system.

73.    The project’s design was relevant, albeit ambitious, at approval and maintained its
relevance throughout implementation. By involving local communities and beneficiaries
in the definition, preparation, and implementation of local subprojects, the project
ensured that the activities financed were responsive to local needs. At the same time, it
helped create capacity at the local level for preparing and proposing additional
subprojects that in future could benefit from EU accession funding. Still, its design was
undoubtedly complex given the institutional realities of addressing the needs of several
vulnerable groups. It was (and continues to be) ambitious in attempting to provide a
coordinated approach for addressing the needs of vulnerable groups when the GOR did
not and does not have a mechanism in place to oversee and coordinate the needs of these


17
   The national targets for Romania under the Europe 2020 strategy included several targets for poverty and
social exclusion, including early school-leaving, completion of tertiary education, employment, and of most
relevance to the project, reduction of the population at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Romania’s target
was to reduce by 580,000 (2.9 percent) the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion after
social transfers (base year 2008 out of a population of 20 million). In 2008, 23.4 percent of the population
was considered at risk of poverty or social exclusion, defined as persons affected by at least one of the three
indicators surveyed by EUROSTAT: at risk of poverty, severe material deprivation rate, and those living in
households with very low work intensity. By 2012, 22.6 percent of Romania’s population was considered
at risk of poverty or social exclusion.

groups in a comprehensive manner. Further, while it is relatively straightforward to aim
to improve living conditions of vulnerable groups, addressing and measuring ‘social
inclusion’ is more complex. By incorporating Roma coordinators in local governments,
and reforming the curriculum for the ECD and ensuring its inclusive approach, the
project design was aimed at addressing this issue. Nevertheless, there are other factors
affecting social inclusion that the project did not, and could not, address in such a short
time. Overall, strategies to tackle social inclusion have policy and design implications.

74.     The project maintained its relevance during implementation through the
restructuring approved in 2011. First, realizing that the activities in support of the NAR
under Component 4 were not progressing, the restructuring reallocated funding for the
NAR (and funding from cost savings) to alternative activities. In retrospect, the decision
to reallocate funding from the NAR to other components was pragmatic given the strong
implementation performance of other executing agencies, especially the RSDF. However,
the decision may have reduced the project’s impact and duplicability in that it was not
successful at putting in place a strong mechanism to coordinate and monitor GOR
programs targeted at the Roma population.

75.      Furthermore, during the final years of implementation, when it became
increasingly clear that the demand for funding by local governments for initiatives aimed
at vulnerable people by the MLFSP was declining, perhaps the project could have put in
place a mechanism to finance an even greater number of investments by the RSDF and
MER, which had stronger implementation capacities. The project restructuring also
reallocated funding within the MLFSP to address the new objective of strengthening the
administration of social benefits. Improved efficiency in the administration of social
benefits had become an even higher priority for the GOR in the aftermath of the financial
crisis, which resulted in increasing fiscal deficits (that could eventually affect funding for
social programs such as those supported under the project) and a halt in previous progress
toward reducing poverty. Cost savings and reallocations under the project became
instrumental in supporting this new objective in coordination with Bank assistance under
the SASMP.

76.    The policy documents developed by the MER under Component 2 are fully
relevant and compatible with the new Education Law approved in 2011, including the
ECE Curriculum 3-6/7, and associated Good Practices guide, the ECE Curriculum for 0-3
and associated Methodological Guide, Quality Standards for ECE programs, Quality
Standards for Teaching and Learning Materials, and well as Normative Standards for
Minimal Supplies in Kindergartens.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives




                                             21
77.     The achievement of the PDO, as measured by the defined key outcome indicators
(annex 10) is considered to be ‘Moderately Satisfactory’. 19 The project was very
successful in terms of improving the living conditions and social inclusion of some of the
most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in Romanian society. Its outcomes, as
measured by the indicators in the Project’s Results Framework, were achieved and
surpassed with respect to improving the living conditions and social inclusion of Roma
living in poor settlements and increasing the inclusiveness of ECE services in targeted
areas (Annex 10). Although delays in implementation precluded it from completing a
few of the activities initiated under Component 3, the majority of planned activities were
carried out and also completed successfully, and the few that were not are included in the
GOR’s programs and are expected to be completed, staffed and become operational in the
near future. The Project had an important impact in terms of supporting and
strengthening a successful delivery model that incorporated local and beneficiary
participation in the preparation, proposal and implementation of sub-projects, and in
addition, strengthened the ability to present project proposals for EU funding upon
completion. Finally, the Project was successful in strengthening the administration of
social benefits through the implementation of several technical assistance activities and
information system modernization that contributed to the GOR’s broader social
assistance system reform supported under the SASMP. Progress towards the Project’s
objectives, as measured by relevant intermediate outcome indicators, is described below.
Details of the activities financed that led to their achievement is presented in Annex 2.

Improving the Living Conditions and Social Inclusion of Roma Living in Poor
Settlements

78.      The Project was successful in improving the living conditions and social inclusion
of Roma living in poor settlements, although data is based on information not reported
yearly as the Project should have done as per restructuring. Indeed, RSDF’s Community
Facilitators compiled assessment sheets of the living conditions index for each of the 133
and neighboring communities at the beginning and end of sub-projects implementation.
Based on the data they compiled, the gap in living conditions between the 133 targeted
poor Roma settlements financed by the Project and neighboring communities was
reduced by 61.8 percent (against a target of 20 percent) 20. The Facilitators also compiled
responses to annual questionnaires distributed to members of the 133 communities
soliciting their views on the improvement in their minimum living conditions. Overall,


19
   As per the ICR guidelines, the project’s achievement of its PDOs is to be evaluated as a Formally
Restructured Project. The required weighting of achievement before and after restructuring is provided in
annex 11. In reality, the weighting makes little difference in the overall evaluation as the loan had disbursed
very little before restructuring, and the project was rated ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ at the time of and after
restructuring.
20
   The average value of the living condition index of the 133 Roma communities before sub-project
implementation was 10.04 (where the maximum possible value is 28). The value for the neighboring
communities was 16.58, yielding a difference of 6.54. Upon completion, the average value of the living
conditions index of the 133 Roma communities was 15.8; the index of neighboring communities was 18.30.
As a result, the difference between both types of communities decreased from 6.54 before implementation
to 2.5 upon completion, representing a decrease of 61.77%.

                                                     22
73.8 percent of respondents noted an improvement in the minimum living conditions in
their communities, with regards to investments supported by their community sub-
projects. 21 Also, Facilitators’ questionnaires found that 75.7 percent of members of the
133 Roma communities reported that the sub-projects reflected to a very high extent the
communities’ priorities (the remainder found that they reflected priorities to a high
extent).

79.     Although the Project did not have specific indicators to measure progress towards
social inclusion there is evidence that the sub-projects had an impact on that. Roma in
poor settlements report a closer link (through annual consultation) with the local
authorities, for addressing community needs: 1659 consultations sessions between Roma
in poor SIP settlements with local authorities for addressing community needs; the
number of annual consultations between members of Roma communities funded under
Project and the local authorities, was 4.93, against a target of three consultations. A total
of 82.7 percent of Roma communities that benefitted from the Project reported access to
improved community infrastructure (roads, water supply systems, etc.), against a target of
60 percent. Also, anecdotal evidence shows that there was an increase in coordination
and enhanced dialogue and cooperation between local communities (prevalently Roma)
and officials, especially local mayors. Also, there are encouraging examples of role
models, for instance Roma teachers, which bolstered confidence in Roma communities
and can be expected to generate multiplier effects on the value of and demand for
education in Roma communities. These are difficult-to-measure, yet central benefits
sparked for longer-term social inclusion, including laying the foundations for building
follow-up interventions in the domain.

80.      More importantly, the Project had an important impact in terms of
institutionalizing a process for addressing concerns of the Roma population in
communities. All of the communities that benefited from the Project with the help of
RSDF Facilitators, succeeded in establishing community groups and selecting community
leaders to prioritize community requirements and many local administrations established
the position of Roma Coordinators to work directly with the community groups as an
interlocutor that understands and can relay to local officials the realities of the
community. The beneficiary participation in the selection/decision making process, and
the manner in which communities began communicating with authorities together created
a model for using small investments as a catalyst for social inclusion.

Intermediate result: Progress is achieved toward addressing the needs identified by
disadvantaged Roma in targeted poor settlements.




21
   The 73.84% improvement represents a weighted average value resulting from the percentages obtained
among different types of sub-projects, as follows: for access roads 81.37% improvement; for community
roads improvement, 82.99%; for utilities, 77.92%; for access to education and social services, 63.71%; for
access to medical services, 87.57%; for housing, 21.25%; and for access to cultural-educational/leisure
activities, 37.93%.

                                                   23
81.      Despite initial delays in selecting the disadvantaged communities to receive
support, progress towards this Intermediate Result was highly satisfactory and the targets
established in the Project’s Results Framework were all exceeded. Through a highly
participatory process, disseminated and facilitated by RSDF’s Community Facilitators,
133 communities with a majority Roma population (as opposed to the originally
contemplated 100), in a pilot and two subsequent rounds, confirmed their eligibility for
financing, identified their priorities and submitted sub-project proposals for approval by
RSDF. RSDF carried out three rounds of information and communication campaigns and
community facilitation campaigns, through which its Community Facilitators verified
eligibility, informed community members and local authorities of details and
requirements for participation, and assisted them is assessing needs, establishing
priorities, organizing initiative groups, setting local contributions, preparing the financing
requests, and obtaining the documents required for sub-project processing. This
participatory process ensured that the priorities reflected needs identified by the targeted
Roma communities themselves.

82.     A total of 58,800 persons benefitted from the sub-projects, of which
approximately 19,500 were women. In all, 89 km of roads and three bridges were
rehabilitated, 17.93 km of potable water distribution network was built, three small
hydro-technical works were built, 19 community buildings were rehabilitated, 31
multifunctional centers, 16 day care centers, and 16 cultural centers or clubs were
established, 14 information and counseling services and 54 healthcare and health
promotion activities were organized and 21 environmental campaigns were carried out.
There are, however, no indicators in the Project’s Results Framework to measure the
outcomes of these activities (e.g., reduced transport times, improved health indicators),
but it can be shown that overall living conditions have improved in the treatment
communities.

Increasing the Inclusiveness of ECE Services in Targeted Areas

83.     Progress towards this objective was also Highly Satisfactory, especially in
relation to the originally established targets in the Project’s Results Framework. The
number of children from vulnerable groups in targeted communities participating in ECE
increased from 70 percent to 76 percent, exceeding the target of a five percent increase.
In all, following 434 meeting with local councils and schools, the MER built and
furnished 19 new buildings for preschool units, creating facilities to enroll children in
areas where there was a large proportion of Roma children aged 0-6. The MER also
rehabilitated and furnished eight existing buildings to improve the quality of education
and facilitate the access of more children from disadvantaged communities with a
majority Roma population. In all, 69 classrooms were built and/or rehabilitated,
benefitting 1,060 children aged 3-6, of which 769 (73 percent) were from disadvantaged
groups.




                                             24
Intermediate result: The MER effectively implements inclusive policies and programs. 22

84.      The MER made substantial progress in grounding new, inclusive and systemic
improvements in the ECE curricula. It developed the ECE curriculum for children aged
0-3, and revised the curriculum for children aged 3-6. The new curricula enhance the
socio-emotional and physical health of children, and provide continuity between the early
education curriculum for 0-3 years and 3-6 years. The curriculum for children aged 3-6
was formally approved and applied in the system. The curriculum for children aged 0-3,
together with a Methodological Guide for teaching and other staff have been completed
and are awaiting formal approval; the documents have already been sent out to pre-school
institutions and they are already used as reference materials. A Good Practice Guide for
ECE of children aged 3-6 was developed to provide support for all teaching and non-
teaching staff in kindergartens. Quality standards for teaching-learning materials and a
Normative for Minimal Supplies in Kindergarten were updated, and Quality Standards
for ECE Programs were developed. Both the ECE curriculum for children aged 3-6 and
the corresponding Good Practice Guide were printed (6,000 copies each), and have been
distributed to (and are in use in) all kindergartens in the country. To disseminate to the
public the importance of ECE, the MER developed a communications strategy and action
plan for its ECE programs.

85.     The MER also put in place a program of in-service training for targeted persons
from communities supported by the Project, using a cascade model starting with training
the trainers (that were selected from among already qualified or experienced teachers).
The main aim of the training was to help the target population, represented by ECE staff
(educators, care personnel, nurses, principals and auxiliary personnel), upgrade their
teaching and care services and become familiar with and apply inclusive approaches in
their activities. Based on the revised curricula, the MER developed, printed and
distributed three training modules designed to raise awareness of disadvantaged groups
and promote an attitudinal change with respect to the Roma population, and to address
issues related to social inclusion and cultural sensitivity. In view of additional needs
identified, and benefitting from cost savings of EUR0.95 million under Component 2,
and supporting materials were printed and distributed to an additional 1,422 participants.

86.    Based on the revised standards for teaching/learning modules, materials and
books (including covering inclusion and cultural aspects) were provided to children in
100 kindergartens in targeted communities, based on an assessment of the needs of the
ECD units and their priorities.

Intermediate result: Vulnerable communities benefiting from alternative community-
based solutions in ECE23



22
   This intermediate result reads as: MER and MLFSP effectively implement inclusive policies and
programs. For purposes of this ICR, it is divided among this and the next section (for MLFSP) to discuss
progress in policies implemented in the areas of ECE services, and services for vulnerable persons
separately.

                                                  25
87.    An alternative CBS approach to delivering ECE services to children aged 3-6 was
piloted in four isolated and vulnerable communities. The pilot included family
kindergartens, specifically targeting Roma and disadvantaged groups, and provided
support for training of eight mothers, teaching/learning materials, and incentives for care
givers and children. A total of 69 children benefited from the pilot. The MER also
implemented a program to train and counsel parents to develop new skills and attitudes
and become sensitive to social, psychological, nutrition, health, accident prevention,
children’s rights and other issues. Modules for teachers and thematic brochures for
parents were printed and developed to support the training delivered by 53 qualified
teachers to 1,257 parents in eight MER Resource Centers in each of the country’s regions
that were supplied with furniture and equipment for this purpose.

88.      The pilot activities represent good practice examples for addressing the needs of
hard to reach children in isolated vulnerable groups and communities. The children had
access to a totally new and healthier environment; they were introduced to basic things
like hands and tooth washing), as well as to typical kindergarten and extra-kindergarten
activities. The impact on the community is very important given the exposure of parents
to the importance of early childhood education and practices. The challenge now is to
disseminate the lessons of the pilot and scale up the apparently highly successful
initiatives that have been piloted.

89.     The MER also made progress in establishing an ECD monitoring and evaluation
system based on clearly identified indicators including a survey instrument to monitor
child readiness in domains including: physical health and well-being, social competence,
emotional maturity, language and cognitive development, communication skills and
general knowledge.        The ministry developed a school readiness assessment
tool/instrument and a User’s Guide on how to use the Child Development Evaluation
Tool in the children’s last year of kindergarten (and by primary teachers in the first year
of primary). The MER then piloted the use of these instruments in 60 kindergartens in all
eight of the country’s regions; teachers also participated in training program on their use.
The MER has compiled the results of the pilot application of these instruments, with a
view to improve their quality and ease of use.

Improving the Quality of Services for PWD, Youth at Risk, and Victims of Domestic
Violence

Intermediate result: The MLFSP effectively implements inclusive policies and programs.

90.    Progress toward this objective was ‘Moderately Satisfactory’, mostly because of
the delays suffered due to complex implementation arrangements under Component 3.



23
  This intermediate result was revised in the level-1 restructuring on March 28, 2011. It was originally
‘MLFSP and MER identify targeted, disadvantaged groups and adjust programs to better respond to their
needs’.

                                                  26
Through a competitive process, the MLFSP received proposals from the General
Directorates for Social Assistance and Child Protection (GDSACP) at the local country
level to raise the quality of care for persons with disabilities in old, overcrowded
residential centers. Eight Neuropsychiatric Recovery and Rehabilitation Centers were
constructed and/or rehabilitated, benefitting 394 adults with neuropsychiatric disabilities
and low skills by providing accommodation in centers with less than 50 adults,
nourishment, assistance and personal hygiene, medial and recovery assistance,
emergency and therapeutical assistance, and psychological counseling services.

91.      For PWD who were considered to have potential for semi-independent life and
community integration, 25 protected dwellings, benefitting at most 6 beneficiaries per
dwelling, were established to provide accommodation, nourishment, access to leisure and
social activities, and support for activities aimed at leading an independent life. Six
Assistance and Care Centers capable of serving at most 50 beneficiaries each were
established for those persons with severe disabilities who were considered totally
dependent on caregivers in view of their reduced potential for independent life. The
facilities constructed and/or rehabilitated conform to the GOR’s quality standards for
residential centers, day centers, and assisted housing for adults with disabilities that aim
to improve the quality of life of PWD. Due to delays in works implementation,
professional staff training was not carried out under the project, which constitutes a risk
to sustainability.

92.    Four centers for victims of domestic violence, with capacity for 12 victims each,
were established to provide protection; accommodation; medical care; and social,
psychological, legal, and occupational counseling. The period of care in the centers
ranges from 60 to 180 days, and to date 209 victims of domestic violence (91 women,
118 minors) have benefitted from the accommodation and services provided. The MLFSP
also carried out an extensive public awareness campaign to prevent and fight against
domestic violence. The objective of the campaign was to increase the involvement of
members of the community and raise awareness of local authorities with regard to the
importance of participating in the prevention and response to domestic violence.

93.      Several national conferences on the topic were held, in which over 500 persons
attended. A survey of public attitudes and opinions with respect to domestic violence was
carried out and the existing services for victims evaluated, 35 street events with mobile
units and promotional materials were held, a promotional video for television was
prepared and aired, all with the objective of increasing public awareness of family
violence and how to prevent it. An informal survey of victims of domestic violence who
have benefited from services provided by the project reveals that (i) they appreciate the
accommodation, the understanding, support and warmth that they receive from shelter
staff; (ii) they feel safe in the shelters; (iii) many are concerned with the prospect of
leaving the shelter finding employment and housing, and earning an income to support
themselves; and (iv) they believe that there is a need for even more publicity and
promotion of these social services.




                                            27
94.     A total of ten subprojects for constructing Multifunctional Centers for Youth at
Risk were approved, but at present three are still under construction (and will be
completed with GOR funding). The centers provide temporary accommodation,
emotional support, psychological and legal counseling, social counseling, support and
guidance for integration, rehabilitation, employment counseling and retraining, and
socializing. The centers’ capacity varies from 12 to 30 beds, and victims can remain in
the centers for a maximum of 3 years. The 7 centers that are functional are staffed with
52 employees, of which about half have received training to improve their service
delivery skills in a variety of areas. Sixty-three percent of the project’s 164 beneficiaries
are employed, of which 30.5 percent became employed after entering the centers. An
informal survey of beneficiaries’ opinions reveals that (i) most (66.7 percent) of them
found the quality of accommodation, meals, and support services provided as very good
and 21.7 percent found them good and (ii) 67.5 percent of beneficiaries rated their
relationships with center staff as very good and 23.2 percent rated them as good.

Intermediate result: Improved capacity of local groups to access EU funds for social
inclusive programs

95.      Both the RSDF and MER aimed to improve the capacity of local groups to access
EU funds for social inclusive programs. Through the information dissemination and
facilitation process, RSDF community coordinators worked with communities to assist
them in preparing project proposals for EU funding. As of December 2013, the RSDF
had received 24 requests for TA, of which six were approved by its Board of Directors
(one was subsequently withdrawn and the applicant identified alternative financing). Of
the remaining five projects prepared for EU financing, four have been prepared; but in
view of the schedules for submission of proposals, only one has been submitted, declared
eligible, and approved for financing. The MER also prepared ECE projects for human
resources development, eligible under the European Social Fund, thereby leveraging the
use of project funding. For this, it designed and implemented a training program (with a
training curriculum, course modules, and a practical guide for writing eligible project
proposals) that was delivered to 122 participants in five sessions of five days each. The
MER also provided follow-up assistance on accessing EU structural funds for projects
targeting ECE actions, under the following priority axes of intervention: 1.3 – human
resources development in education and training and 2.2 – preventing and correcting
early school-leaving. Three months after completion of the training, 34 project proposals
were elaborated and four submitted for priority axis 1.3. Ten project proposals were
elaborated for priority axis 2.2.

Strengthen the Administration of Social Benefits 24

Intermediate result: Improve the administration of the social assistance benefits




24
     Additional objective included in project restructuring, dated March 28, 2011.

                                                       28
96.     Progress toward this sub-component that was incorporated under the project
through project restructuring is considered ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ as several of the
planned activities were completed, but others were either financed through alternative
funding sources or delayed and expected to be financed under a proposed restructuring to
the SASMP. The first phase of the SAFIR upgrade (hardware and software has been
completed and upgrades were made to the system for it to centralize the beneficiary
registry and financing the GMI program 25 that had previously been administered in a
decentralized setting. This will allow for better control and analysis of the data of about
400 to 250,000 households. The SAFIR was also updated to implement the parametric
reform for benefits to mothers with young children whereby the period of maternity leave
was reduced from two years to one year, the replacement wage was reduced from 85 to
75 percent and a back-to-work bonus was introduced to make going back to work more
attractive.

97.     The project mainly financed small upgrades to SAFIR. Three small social
assistance programs were eliminated and two (Complementary Family Allowance and
Single Parent Allowance) were consolidated to become a Family Allowance, with
associated adjustments to the information system. In addition, under the project, the
MLFSP completed the national registry (hardware and software) for persons with
disabilities—a simple national database that captures and consolidates information from
various systems at various government levels, allowing the GOR to track the impacts of
disability within families and provides linkages with other GOR systems. The project
financed training on the basic processes of a social inspectorate—legislation and
preparing a case for the prosecutor to act. The development of a social inspection module
in SAFIR (to help document the finding of inspections in electronic format and
recalibrate risk models to identify persons with high risk of error) is expected to be
financed under the SASMP restructuring. The Public Awareness Strategy for Social
Assistance Reforms and Statistical Bulletin were developed, but the implementation of
the public awareness campaign is expected to be financed by the SASMP restructuring.
Finally, the project supported the NASB with TA in strengthening its ability to detect
errors (non-intentional and intentional) through data matching and risk profiling; develop
draft legislation for a comprehensive sanction and recovery policy (different benefits had
different sanctions, the level of penalties were not correlated with the loss, and there were
many ambiguities such as what constitutes fraud and what constitutes error); review the
statutes of a social inspector; and initiate a data matching process to eliminate fraud,
errors, and duplications in the GOR’s social assistance programs. 26

3.3 Efficiency




25
   The GMI is Guaranteed Minimum Income is defined by the law regarding social assistance, no. 133-
XVI/ 13.06.2008, as the minimum level of computed income that the state guarantees to a family.
26
   A Public Financial Management Trust Fund for governance and accountability, in the amount of
US$250,000, was also used to finance several activities under this subcomponent.

                                                29
98.      The PAD did not include a cost-benefit analysis but an analysis of economic and
fiscal rationale for public intervention of its various activities. It remains difficult to carry
out economic and financial analysis for the project as a whole since it was demand-driven,
multisectoral, multicomponent, and designed by the communities, making economic
evaluation techniques for larger projects not applicable. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to
assume that the project was implemented in an efficient manner and expected to generate
positive economic returns.

99.     The project did not compile data to allow a recent comparison of the cost-
effectiveness of RSDF’s investments in small infrastructure. Although dated, a study
prepared by the RSDF in 2005 found that its costs were systematically lower than those
under two other comparable programs. 27 As the RSDF continued to exhibit streamlined
and strong performance under the project (implementing a greater number of subprojects
than originally contemplated), in the absence of reliable, more recent data, it is reasonable
to assume that its implementation continues to be an efficient alternative.

100. Investment in the ECE for disadvantaged persons under Component 2 is expected
to generate positive economic returns in the medium-term, given the large body of
international evidence that highlights the importance of early intervention—from
conception to age 8—for child development and later educational and life outcomes.
ECD programs are seen as particularly beneficial to children from disadvantaged
backgrounds. 28 In Romania, only an estimated 37 percent of children aged 3–6 years
attend preschool. Although a small step toward increasing enrollment, the project
supported the implementation of effective models for delivering ECE programs,
including piloting alternative delivery models and more important modifications in the
ECE curriculum, associated guides, and standards that address cultural sensitivities and
social inclusion. There is evidence that these ECE activities were implemented efficiently,
especially since the MER was able to train more teachers and procure additional
materials utilizing €0.95 million in cost savings from civil works for construction of ECE
centers, mostly due to the efficient, centralized procurement of civil works by MER.

101. Activities implemented by the MLFSP under Component 3 did not have financial
and economic efficiency as an objective. By adhering to the GOR’s new quality standards
that reduce the average size of institutions for PWD from an average of 126 at the time of
appraisal to below 50 residents per center, the GOR’s program supported by the project
was actually expected to increase the overall recurrent costs of institutionalized care, at
least until the old institutions can be closed. Further, the implementation arrangements for
Component 3, although participatory and important in terms of the transfer of knowledge


27
   The ICR report for the Second Phase of the Social Development Fund Program (Report No.
ICR0000538, dated August 15, 2007) presented the findings of a cost-efficiency comparison of 46 rural
roads subprojects implemented by RSDF, the World Bank-financed Rural Development Project, and the
European Union’s Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development. The study found,
that in all cases, the RSDF’s costs were lower than those in the other two programs.

to local authorities, were not as efficient as those implemented by the MER and led to
several implementation delays.

102. Finally, adjustments to SAFIR to reduce fraud and corruption in the
administration of social assistance benefits (Component 3.4) resulted in savings in
overpayment as outlined in table 1.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

104. The project’s overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. It was and
continues to be highly relevant and central to the GOR’s strategy and the Bank’s
assistance priorities. Its outcomes, as measured by the indicators in the project’s RF, were
achieved and surpassed with respect to improving the living conditions and social
inclusion of Roma living in poor settlements and increasing the inclusiveness of ECE
services in targeted areas, and were partially achieved with respect to improving the
quality of services for PWD, Youth at Risk and Victims of Domestic Violence. The
project’s institutional objectives, especially with respect to the MER’s development of
ECE curriculum and associated standards, were met. However, the project was not
successful in strengthening the NAR to assume a more central role in the coordination,
monitoring, and evaluation of programs focused on Roma communities. Based on
available data and expectations, the project was implemented efficiently and is expected
to either generate positive returns or improve living conditions for disadvantaged persons.
Most of the project’s outputs were achieved, but there is little information on either its
impact or efficiency. In short, outputs were achieved although they were compounded by
limited evidence on impacts and efficiency.




3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development.

105. Poverty impacts and social development have been discussed in section 3.2,
which provides the actual results achieved by the project toward improving the standards
of living of its beneficiaries.


                                                32
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening.

106. Although the project did not have a specific institutional strengthening objective,
it did support several activities in this respect. The project’s main institutional
development impact was on the MER for revisions to the ECE curricula for children aged
0–3 and 3–6 years. The curriculum for children aged 3–6 years was formally approved
and is already being used throughout the country and that for children aged 0–3 years is
awaiting formal approval (while they are already in use by practitioners as reference
materials). Both are supported by the new Education Law approved in February 9, 2011.
Support to the MLFSP under Component 3.4, involving improvements in the system for
social assistance, although not completed under the project, also had an important
institutional aspect. Finally, the institutionalization of the position of Roma coordinators
in several local councils to act as liaisons between the communities and local
governments has shown promising results in terms of addressing social inclusion.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible

107. Assessment of risk to development outcome is rated Negligible. In analyzing the
risk to development outcome, two separate risks were considered: (i) the risk that the
strengthening of social inclusion programs at the national level can be sustained and can
continue to make progress in reducing social exclusion and (ii) the risk that the
investments financed by the project at the local level will be sustained and maintained. At
the national level, the risk to development outcome is considered negligible based on the
GOR’s commitments on various fronts, including EU commitments for Europe 2020, its
National Roma Integration strategy, and the ongoing preparation of a National Strategy
on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction for the 2014–2020 period (under preparation
by the MLFSP, with support from the Bank RAS, and under a condition for accessing EU
structural funds in the programming period). Both the RSDF and the MER have strong
implementation capacity and commitment and have their mandate with respect to
vulnerable groups grounded in legislation. Several project-supported activities have
routine allocations for these programs supported in regular, albeit constrained, GOR
budget financing. Finally, continued Bank and EU financing, among others, should
maintain the project’s objectives high on the government’s agenda.


                                            33
108. At the local levels, the risk to sustainability of project-supported investments is
considered Moderate. Project design had contemplated issues of sustainability, requiring
that local councils assume ex-ante the obligations for operations and maintenance of
investments for a period of fifteen years (or five years in the case of investments financed
by the RSDF) as a pre-condition for being awarded financing. In fact, this was one factor
that affected demand for financing at the local level in the aftermath of the economic
crisis, when local governments were reluctant to assume additional financial
commitments given uncertainties with respect to their future revenues. The RSDF is
considering the continued use of community facilitation of the post-implementation
period to avoid the possibility of facilities being closed on completion. In addition,
community members, through their facilitators, can contact the RSDF to complain if the
local authorities do not comply with their obligations during this period.

109. The development of the ECE curriculum for children aged 3–6 years has been
completed, the document was formally approved and together with the Good Practices
Guide for ECE for children aged 3–6 years, has been printed, distributed, and is in use in
all kindergartens in the country. For alternative ECE solutions, a successful pilot activity,
a sustainability challenge remains since the project was actually implemented over a short
period and resources are needed to continue this initiative at the local level. There is a
good example provided by one county (Iaşi) that issued a decision allocating resources
for continuing the activities initiated under the project. The Bank has recommended that
the MER identify resources and/or facilitate access to other funds to support communities
that cannot otherwise continue these activities. In addition, it has recommended that the
MER should facilitate the promotion of these activities through communication and
awareness events at county and national levels involving relevant local authorities,
representatives of school inspectorates, and other Roma-related organizations.

110. Finally, representatives of the NAR expressed to the ICR team that the NAR has
begun a process to establish an M&E system that would be instrumental in carrying out
its mandated function.


5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry - Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory

111. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
On the positive side, the project responded to a strategic priority of the GOR tied to its
obligations toward EU accession. Responding to a GOR request for assistance in a very
short period, the project addressed most vulnerable groups under one single operation.
The project’s design was built on the lessons learnt from earlier Bank-financed operations.
The project was designed with a clear sustainability objective, not only by using existing
government structures and staffing (as opposed to implementation by a stand-alone

                                             34
implementation unit) but also by requiring up-front commitments from local authorities
to operate and maintain investments for a predetermined period upon completion.

112. However, there were some important shortfalls in preparation. First, while
recognizing the risk that it posed and responding to the GOR’s request for rapid
assistance and the World Bank’s desire to respond quickly, the preparation team severely
underestimated the complexities of the project’s institutional arrangements, especially the
differences in implementation (procurement and works supervision) procedures of each
of the implementing agencies for the four components, and the time that would be
required to implement the project as designed While fully participatory, the MLFSP’s
approach to prioritizing the project’s somewhat larger investments at the local level and
later implementing them through local councils (but with cumbersome critical approvals
required at the national level) pre-supposed a much more complex and lengthy critical
path than, for example, for investments financed by the RSDF.

113. The difficulties that this created became all the more evident in the absence of a
unit to coordinate the GOR’s approach to address the needs of all vulnerable persons.
Somewhat related, the preparation team underestimated the weak institutional capacity of
the NAR, which was made all the more difficult by the ‘political’ nature of the agency
and the negative impact that NAR’s weak performance would have on the project’s
implementation and ability to put in place a strong institution to help prioritize, monitor,
and evaluate the effectiveness of GOR programs targeted at the Roma population. The
project was not fully prepared when the Bank’s financing was approved—sites had not
been selected, OMs were yet to be finalized, baseline data that was dependent on site
selection had not been collected as a result—and the difficulties in working with a weak
NAR, which was to have a central role in this process, further delayed the start of
implementation. To be fair, sites were not supposed to be pre-selected exactly in order to
ensure the participation of communities, especially in the case of the RSDF-implemented
component. In this case, the project’s planned implementation period could have taken
this into account.

114. Finally, the project’s RF, while relatively concise, presents mostly output
indicators and depends on often subjective surveys of beneficiary satisfaction (what
community would respond that their living conditions have not improved if a road has
been paved?). It did not include important indicators—for example, how many
beneficiaries were served by different investments, their gender breakdown, and the
number of Roma who benefited—that would have been valuable to monitor progress and
retroactively adjust programs to more effectively address the needs of vulnerable groups.
However, these data were collected internally by the RSDF and the MER for
Components 1 and 2.

(b) Quality of Supervision -- Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

115. The quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. One country office-
based task manager (who had participated in its preparation) was responsible for
supervision, with the support of other specialists, throughout implementation until loan

                                            35
closing. Supervision was regular and focused on obtaining up-to-date information on
indicators in the project’s RF.

116. Although the 2011 restructuring reallocated funding in favor of well-performing
components, at times, supervision efforts could have seized opportunities to adapt, adjust,
and reformulate the project in a way that enhanced the impact and use of available
resources. As a result, €10 255 259, 17 that could have been used to finance additional
activities by the RSDF and the MER had to be cancelled. For instance, early issues with
NAR’s performance were addressed repeatedly through action plans. However, in light of
NAR’s diminishing capacity to absorb funds, these were eventually reallocated to other
components. Supervision of the project tried repeatedly to support the NAR in improving
effectiveness, especially since a decision to reduce financing for NAR was considered
difficult. Despite the efforts, NAR’s performance lagged behind, with implications for
overall coordination of Roma-related issues, for which NAR’s role was central. In the
2011 restructuring, issues with delays (chiefly due to cumbersome procedures and limited
local demand) had become evident. At this point, supervision could have considered
refocusing Component 3 toward those investments that could be realistically
implemented, including reallocating more funding to other components that were
progressing adequately.

117. Supervision was undertaken in a challenging environment, including, for example,
a fluid and frequently changing institutional context. Yet the project’s components were
supervised individually and implemented separately by the respective agencies with, as
per design, limited coordination among them. From the monitoring side in particular, the
project did not track its RF indicators systematically. As mentioned in section 2.3, 10 out
of the 24 indicators that were supposed to be regularly monitored as per 2011
restructuring were not included in the ensuing ISRs. Final values for some of those
indicators were, however, availed in commissioned studies, these only provided final data
instead of reporting on indicators’ value on an annual basis.

118. The project restructuring responded in a timely manner to the emerging priority of
TA for the social assistance reform. However, this helped address a challenge emerging
in another initiative and provided limited contribution in enhancing coordination among
the project’s components. The restructuring did not amend the project’s RF to address an
issue with the definition of its indicators (that is, percentage increase when the base was
0) or increase the target for Component 1 when additional funds had been allocated. The
RF did not include indicators enabling a focused monitoring of the project’s benefits on
beneficiary populations, and it may have been useful to request implementing agencies to
provide them regularly. During a visit to the country in preparation for this ICR,
representatives from local NGOs cited the consultations during preparation but expressed
the concern that these tended to diminish as projects were approved.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance -- Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory




                                            36
119. Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on similar
ratings for both Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and quality of supervision.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance --Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

120. The Government performance was Moderately Satisfactory. For purposes of this
section of the ICR, government is considered to be the broader GOR, especially the MPF,
MoE, MLFSP, and RSDF. The government displayed ownership and commitment to the
project throughout implementation despite the frequent changes that affected the political
leadership. This was witnessed through continued funding at the national level for the
project’s investments despite the fiscal constraints resulting from the economic crisis
starting in 2008. The government also sought the Bank’s and EU’s funding in support of
the project’s objectives through complementary vehicles such as the RAS. Nevertheless,
issues relating to government processes, such as requirements for effectiveness,
cumbersome implementation, and approval requirements for investments carried out at
local levels, delayed the start of implementation and required approvals throughout.
However, more importantly, the GOR, despite expressing its objective of addressing the
needs of vulnerable groups in a coordinated fashion, was not able to put in place a
workable mechanism to develop a concerted strategy, prioritize, disseminate, and monitor
its progress in addressing their needs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance -- Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory

121. The implementing agencies’ performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The
project was implemented by two ministries, the MLFSP (including NAPH and NAFP)
and MER, and two agencies, the RSDF and NAR. The Ministry of Finance was an
implementing agency insofar as it was responsible for allocating the required budgetary
allocations to each of the implementing agencies.

122. The RSDF’s performance exceeded expectations. Its strong performance, based in
part on its previous highly satisfactory experience in implementing Bank-financed
projects, benefitted from competent, committed staff and good governance. Its
procedures pre-suppose outreach by RSDF facilitators and beneficiary involvement
throughout, both of which bode well for future sustainability and inclusion. The RSDF’s
implementation model and procedures have become an example of good practice and
have recently succeeded in attracting additional grant financing from European donors.

123. The MER previously had a successful experience in implementing Bank-financed
projects and was therefore fully familiar with the requirements that financing entails. Its
performance was also highly satisfactory because it was able to implement activities
under Component 2 effectively and efficiently. The MER was able to circumvent the
GOR’s investment and procurement approval procedures by centralizing implementation

                                            37
and packaging works, thereby limiting the many approvals that would be required for
individual subprojects. Further, the MER pursued and obtained approval for systemic
changes in the legislation, curricula, and teaching practices for the ECD that will have a
lasting impact on vulnerable groups, especially Roma, well beyond closing.

124. While assuming a de facto coordinating role for the project, the performance of
the MLFSP (including the NAPH and NAFP until they were made directorates) was
weaker than that of either the RSDF or the MER. This was largely the result of three
factors. First, the successive government changes had an inordinate impact on the
MLFSP, whose leadership changed seven times during implementation (along with
consequent changes at lower levels in the ministry). Second, the MLFSP went through a
major restructuring resulting from GOR budget constraints in the aftermath of the 2008
economic crisis. Finally, of all the project’s components and subcomponents, those
implemented by MLFSP through local governments were the most affected by the GOR’s
cumbersome investment and procurement approval procedures. The long processes
required for approval of investments, coupled with the staffing and other changes in the
MLFSP, presented a difficult environment for maintaining implementation on track.

125. The NAR had the weakest performance of the implementing agencies,
demonstrating intermittent commitment to the project, and, because of the central role it
was expected to play, delaying the implementation start of other components. Local
governments and city and county councils were also responsible for implementing
investments, especially under Component 3 where they were responsible for tendering,
contracting, and supervising civil work for centers of social assistance services. The poor
institutional capacity of these local governments, coupled with a weakened demand for
financing (section 2.2) at the local level, required intensive supervision from the MLFSP
and impacted the outcomes under Component 3. The Ministry of Public Finance
allocated funding to implementing agencies in a timely fashion, albeit with delays on
occasion.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance -- Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory

126. Overall borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on similar
ratings for both government performance and implementing agencies performance.


6.     Lessons Learned
127. The project’s implementation provides several lessons with respect to project
design, implementation, and especially the challenges of addressing the needs of Roma
and disadvantaged groups.

128. Social inclusion is a broad-encompassing concept. Project design should set
out a clear definition of ‘social inclusion’ and how to measure it. The concept of
social inclusion can be interpreted at different levels, through the lens of different

                                            38
disciplines and from a wide range of perspectives, some of which may not necessarily be
fully compatible. Therefore, it is important that the design of projects that have social
inclusion as an objective provide a concrete, working definition of social inclusion that is
relevant to different actors and that can be clearly attained and measured. Such definition
and metrics should possibly be part of a broader ‘theory of change’ for a project,
including laying out pathways and mechanisms to achieve the intended objectives.

129. Project design needs to incorporate a comprehensive pre-assessment of
institutional capacities at all levels of government. This would be important in order to
calibrate project objectives and activities, establish realistic implementation schedules
and make possible course corrections. Under the Project, the various implementing
agencies had very different operating and implementation procedures that affected the
pace with which activities were implemented. These differences were exacerbated since,
over time, the capacity of implementing agencies was severely affected by a number of
factors, such as the reduction in government staffing levels in Romania as a result of the
financial crisis that impacted staff motivations due to institutional reform (i.e., NAPH
downgraded from Agency to Directorate); and also the pressure on limited local
capacities for attaining and managing funding from the EU and other sources. In such a
rapidly changing environment (that most projects experience), a full ex-ante assessment
of implementing agencies’ capacities, processes and implementation models at all levels
assumes an even greater importance to ensure that objectives are realistic, program
design is commensurate to existing arrangements, gaps are identified, and flexible
mechanisms are prepared to adjust should circumstances require so.

130. Decentralized and centralized implementation models present potential
tradeoffs that need to be considered explicitly during project preparation.
Decentralized implementation, such as that by MLFSP, builds buy-in, local capacity,
sustainability, and responsiveness to local needs. However, it requires additional time,
and may not be compatible with the short-time schedules of other, more centralized,
implementation models, such as that of the MER. If the decentralized approach is taken,
local authorities require strong implementation support, especially when required to
follow guidelines of externally financed projects with which they may not be familiar.

131. The establishment of a coordination mechanism among project components
is important, especially when multiple agencies are involved in project
implementation. Social inclusion programs tend to operate in a context of fragmented
approaches, across sectors, and including a range of different interventions, diverse actors
and differing institutional arrangements. The existence of an overall coordinating
institutional umbrella would serve to ensure coordination and connection among project
components and activities. This type of coordination should not rely only on the
requirements of a World Bank-financed project, but should be matched by coordination
mechanisms established within the government and that cut across the relevant
dimensions envisioned by social inclusion projects. For example, a number of countries
have introduced inter-ministerial working groups for facilitating coordination and the
exchange of information on a given theme, and Romania may consider doing so for
social inclusion.

                                            39
132. A potential tension might emerge between rapid preparation of a project and
establishing an effective monitoring and evaluation system. Baseline data should be
available before implementation begins, with metrics identified and protocols for data
collection and monitoring agreed upon with partners and implementing agencies. Specific
operational activities, such as project site selection, should be undertaken in advance of
project implementation and as part of the preparation phase. Yet many of these activities
could be compromised by rapid project preparation and design.

133. Project sustainability should be framed in ways that recognize the
importance of securing commitments while at the same time not hampering the
demand and capacity of local authorities. While it is important to ensure up-front
commitments to sustain interventions over time (as the Project did), this may present a
trade-off between short-term demand of local authorities to participate in projects and the
longer-run sustainability through up-front commitments. In the case of the Project, local
demand was somewhat limited precisely because of the sustainability requirements in
contexts of often limited financial and other capacities, and uncertainties. While devising
an appropriate set of incentives between central and local governments is a recurrent
challenge in most countries, trade-offs should be more fully recognized and weighed and
project expectations set accordingly.

134. Committed leadership and champions, including, in the case of the Project,
local mayors and Roma community representatives, have a critical role to play in
laying the foundations for social inclusion. The ability of interventions to foster social
inclusion would, ultimately, heavily hinge upon the sustained engagement, commitment,
mutual trust and partnerships between Roma communities and government officials
(central and local). Social inclusion projects should include as an indicator to monitor
progress specific metrics to measure progress in incorporating Roma representatives in
local governments or other community organizations.

135. Project design should consider flexible and tailored arrangements that allow
for intra-community and spatial-sensitive approaches. Under the Project, there were
important cultural and socio-economic differences among Roma communities that should
be more explicitly recognized and considered in project interventions (e.g., differentiating
approaches to mobile and sedentary communities). Similarly, programs in urban areas
should more deliberately account for the different socio-institutional setting compared to
rural areas (e.g., definition of ‘community’, their level of cohesiveness, etc.). In particular,
such differences may have implications for the complexity of undertaking consultation
with Roma communities and their level of participation in decision-making (i.e., more
challenging in urban areas with more fragmented communities), as well as the degree of
integration with different sectors (and requirements for technical support). For example,
road-construction programs in urban areas may entail closer integration with hard-core
urban development interventions (e.g., in water, sanitation and drainage systems), with
implications for technical standards required in the planning, execution and supervision
of works.



                                              40
136. Design of social inclusion projects should include measures that capture how
activities ultimately contribute to social inclusion. The physical construction and
rehabilitation of social centers, community infrastructure and trainings of teachers – the
core of the SIP activities – are key to provide marginal areas with kindergartens, paved
roads, or community baths that previously lacked these. Yet, these interventions, per se,
may not represent a full measure of social inclusion and empowerment. It is important
that projects’ results frameworks not only capture and measure what was built or
maintained, but how those assets contributed and translated into enhanced dialogue,
mutual understanding, trust and partnership between Roma and non-Roma Romanians as
a people. An indicator, for example, might be the number of communities where local
councils include Roma representatives. Also, it would be important to try capturing
whether elements of Roma traditions and culture (e.g., materials, decorations, posters,
etc.) are included in kindergartens, somewhat mirroring the learning materials for
teachers produced by the MoE.

137. The role of and consultation with an organization responsible for addressing
the needs of minorities and civil society should be embedded within the project cycle
on inclusion projects. It is important to ensure that government agencies that have a
legal mandate to work with and represent Roma communities are engaged as partners
alongside other institutions. In the case of NAR, the agency proved to have limited direct
relationship with the World Bank as it was the only project implementing agency that
was financially and programmatically subordinated to a line Ministry. As an agency that
was expected to have a coordinating role (if not for the Project, for the GOR’s progress in
addressing Roma inclusion), it may well have been more appropriate for NAR to not be
subordinated.

138. While the involvement of Roma institutions and NGOs cannot guarantee
success, per se, civil society should be involved throughout the project cycle through
engagement and consultation. An active participation of NGOs will help ensure that the
priorities, perspectives and voice of communities is considered as an integral part of the
project preparation, implementation and evaluation stage, as well as a core tenet of the
broader dialogue on social inclusion beyond a specific project. The community facilitator
in the activities financed by RSDF played a key role in bridging institutions and
communities, including providing assistance to ensure that projects reflect community
priorities as identified from the bottom-up. Yet it is important to ensure that such
facilitation role does not translate into the ‘clearance’ of predefined lists, but rather
identifies needs and interventions as expressed and demanded by communities.

139. Projects should incorporate mechanisms to promote sharing of innovations
and lessons, and outreach. There was a wealth of experience that communities,
kindergartens, and other institutions accumulated in implementing activities under the
Project that would be highly relevant for other eventual stakeholders. For example,
initiatives such as a mayors yearly local gathering – e.g., knowledge fairs, ‘community of
practice’, or similar – would help share challenges and solutions among peers and other
actors. For programs involving Roma communities, NAR could play an important role in
identifying, documenting and disseminating emerging models and best practices. Such

                                            41
forums would also provide a vehicle for encouraging innovations (e.g., alternative
education model), discuss how they could be scaled-up, and ensure support of local and
central authorities. Similarly, lessons-sharing platforms could also help bolster outreach,
communication and awareness about social inclusion projects, issues and experiences,
both positive and less-positive ones.

140. Pilot experiences can provide an effective instrument to test alternative
approaches to implementation of assistance delivery models. The alternative CBS
pilot produced some encouraging, positive approaches to scaling up the provision of ECE
services in remote areas. Yet, for pilot experiences to be productive, there is a need for
platforms in which to disseminate, communicate and raise awareness to benefits,
possibilities and lessons.


7.   Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

141. The Borrower provided a few editorial comments that have been incorporated in
the text. The Borrower subsequently provided a second round of comments in a letter
dated December 5, 2014, in which it recommended that the ratings for Borrower,
implementing agency and World Bank performance be satisfactory (as opposed to
moderately satisfactory). This recommendation was justified by the Borrower as with the
exception of Component 3, all components achieved their objectives, and RSDF was able
to absorb more funds than originally allocated.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Priority Interventions Program (€11.7 Million)

This component was designed to support RSDF’s program of poverty alleviation and
capacity-building interventions, by expanding the Fund’s activities to specifically address
the needs of the Roma. The project aimed to improve living conditions and social
inclusions for Roma living in about 100 poor settlements, bringing those most
disadvantaged settlements up to minimum conditions in terms of infrastructure and basic
social services. The project was to support: (i) financing of demand-driven, integrated
Priority Interventions subprojects, on a grant basis awarded by RSDF following a
competitive process from among a list of eligible settlements provided by the NAR; (ii)
carrying out of promotion, information, and education campaigns, M&E activities, and
the provision of training for local authorities, community groups, and NGOs; (iii)
provision of assistance in capacity-building at the community level through preparation,
facilitation, evaluation and supervision of Priority Interventions subprojects, and
provision of related training, including training to RSDF; and (iv) provision of TA to
poor Roma communities to prepare projects to be financed through EU funds.

RSDF financed 133 integrated projects—that benefited 58,800 people, of which
approximately 19,500 were women—as follows:

      90 had a community road rehabilitation component;
      30 had a utility access component (water supply, sewage network, including street
       sewage, public baths and washrooms);
      62 had a social services component (day care and educational centers, vocational
       training and professional counseling services, information and health campaigns);
      17 had a medical services component (establishment of medical office or cabinet);
      9 had a housing component (rehabilitation of houses, apartment buildings, flood
       protection works, public toilets);
      21 had a community center component (cultural and educational centers, art and
       sports clubs, music and dance clubs/bands); and
      21 had an environmental protection component.

In addition, the following activities were produced and/or delivered under Component 1:

      4 public information campaigns, conducted in the target communities
      Information dissemination to 214 communities
      18 regional information seminars, attended by 647 people
      23 training sessions for the members of the project coordination committees,
       benefiting 991 participants
      3 experience-sharing networks between beneficiaries, 12 network meetings
       organized
      171 eligible Roma communities received community facilitation services




                                            45
€17.86 million was allocated to component 1, of which €1.37 million (76.71 percent) was
external funding. Of the remaining €16.94 million (94.85 percent), €13.0 million was
external funding and was used to finance activities under the component.

Of the €16.94 million cost of this component, €14.15 million (83.56 percent) was
allocated to subprojects, and €1.05 million (6.31 percent) for activities aimed at
increasing community capacity to contribute to local development (TA—information,
community facilitation, project evaluation and supervision, consultancy for development
of other projects—and training for the representatives of the beneficiary communities). In
addition, the operational costs, goods, and training for RSDF staff totalled €1.72 million
(10.22 percent) of the total expenditure for Component 1.

Of the amounts allocated to subprojects, €11.55 million (representing approximately 81.6
percent) financed construction works for improving the livelihood in Roma communities
(rehabilitation of roads, water supplies, and building education and community centers).

The total costs of Component 1 were allocated as follows:


                                 Training     Operational Costs
   Construction   Goods and                                        Project Management
                                   and        (Related to Social
     Works        Materials                                                Costs

Component 2: Inclusive Early Childhood Education Program (€6.1 Million)

By helping mainstream Roma into the regular policies and programs of the MER, this
component was designed to support the MER’s ECE program (2005–2011) that aimed to
ensure every child’s right to education and overall development starting from a very early
age. The project would help jump-start the inclusive measures of MER’s overall ECE
program through: (i) construction, extensions, rehabilitation, and furnishing of ECE
infrastructure in communities with a high percentage of Roma; (ii) development of an
inclusive ECE curriculum, the provision of training to ECE staff, the development and
distribution of ECE teaching and learning materials, and the provision of TA to entities
entitled to submit financing applications for projects to be financed through EU structural
funds; (iii) promotion of integrated services and alternative community-based solutions
for ECE, including the development of coherent ECE legislation, and the provision of
training and counseling programs for parents; and (iv) carrying out of M&E, information,
education, and communication activities.

Rehabilitation of ECE infrastructure
Component 2 financed the building and furnishing of 19 new buildings for preschool
units, creating facilities to enroll more children in the areas where there was a large
percentage of Roma children aged 0–6 years. It also financed the rehabilitation and
furnishing of approximately eight existing buildings, to improve the quality of education
and facilitate access to more students coming from disadvantaged communities with a
majority Roma population.

Development of ECE curriculum, human resources and teaching/learning materials
The development of the ECE curriculum

      National individual consultants developed the ECE curriculum for children aged
       0–3 years and revised the curriculum for children aged 3–6 years. They worked
       with inspectors from the Ministry of National Education (MNE), and the
       Department for Primary and Secondary Education and the Department for
       Minority to develop the curriculum to be integrated into the MNE policy and
       practice and be accepted by education decision-makers and beneficiaries. The
       new ECE curriculum enhances the socio-emotional and physical health of
       children, and the continuity between early education curriculum for 0–3 years and
       3–6 years.

      Since the educational curriculum for children aged 0–3 years had not previously
       existed, a methodological guide for teaching and other staff was prepared to orient
       the specific activities and organize the learning environment in crèches. Both the
       ECE curriculum for children aged 0–3 years and the methodological guide are
       still awaiting formal approval, which is necessary for their legal application.

      A good practice guide for ECE for children aged 3–6 years was also developed by
       individual consultants. It provided support for all teaching and non-teaching staff
       in kindergartens.

      The quality standards for teaching and learning materials and the normative for
       minimal supplies in kindergarten were updated. Quality standards for ECE
       programs were developed through consultations with representatives from the
       Romanian Quality Assurance Agency for Pre-university Education, to be used as
       a grounding document for the development of other standards.

The development of human resources (teaching and care services)

      An international consulting company provided TA for training the trainers,
       coordinated and monitored the in-service training for upgrading skills of staff
       primarily working in project supported ECE units, and developed modules for
       ECE and a preparatory guide for all staff. To organize the training activities, the
       consulting company selected an appropriate number of persons, from the already
       qualified or experienced teachers and trainers, to ensure training for the targeted
       persons from the communities with building and rehabilitation interventions and
       other similar communities in proximity, lacking qualification and competence in
       ECE. They provided in-service training (by gathering people in clusters), and
       presented and discussed the basic module for all the trainees and the specific ones
       for distinct groups including follow-up sessions. The clusters have been placed
       where resources allowed quality teaching environment and availability of
       education staff. The main aim of the training was to help the target population,
       represented by the ECE staff—educators, care personnel, nurses, principals from
       kindergartens, and auxiliary personnel—to upgrade their skills (teaching and care

                                           50
       services), and also become familiar and apply inclusive approaches in all their
       activities.

      Training modules were designed to raise awareness about disadvantaged groups
       and bring about an attitudinal change toward Roma, address issues related to
       social inclusion and cultural sensitivity:
           o Module 1: General module on concepts for early childhood education,
               focused on inter-cultural principles
           o Module 2: Interactive methods module on practices in ECE services
           o Module 3: Educational management module on management of diversity
               in the ECE system
      The modules were developed based on the revised curriculum for children aged
       3–6 years and the early childhood education guidelines for children aged 0–3
       years, using the methodological guide developed under the project and other
       relevant documents for ECE that have been recently developed and implemented
       in the ECE system.

      2,600 modules were printed and distributed to trainees, and the number of
       participants was 2,769.
      Based on the training needs of the new-entry ECE staff and budget savings, a
       second round of training was organized in 2014 by another consulting company,
       selected as a result of QBS.
      During the second round of training, 1,500 modules were printed and distributed
       to trainees, and the number of participants was 1,422.
      On the whole, more than 4,000 people were trained, as targeted in the beginning
       of the project.

The development of standards of ECE teaching and learning materials, and provision of
such materials primarily in project ECE units

      6,000 copies of the ECE curriculum for children aged 3–6/7 years and the good
       practice guide for ECE for children aged 3–6/7 years were printed in two tranches,
       and distributed to all kindergartens, through the county inspectorates.
      Teaching and learning materials and books were provided for the children from
       targeted communities (100 kindergartens), as follows:
           o set of balls
           o tunnels for crawling
           o magnetic boards with letters and numerals
           o magnetic boards for teachers
           o sets of geometric shapes in various colors, sizes, and thickness
           o construction sets - small pieces, set of wooden cubes for construction, and
               big pieces
           o sets of musical instruments
           o models of human body and internal organs
           o models of various animals, insects, and fishes


                                          51
      12 book titles (575 copies of each title) were distributed based on the assessment
       of the needs of ECD units and their priorities. The selected books also covered the
       inclusion and cultural aspects.

Access to the EU Structural Funds

The use of SIP funds was maximized by utilizing them for the preparation of ECE
projects for human resources development eligible under the European Social Fund
(ESF), further contributing to the implementation of the overall MNE ECE program.

      Consultants were contracted to design and implement training and provide follow-
       up assistance on accessing EU structural funds for projects targeting ECE actions,
       under the following priority axes of intervention:
           o 1.3 - Human resources development in education and training
           o 2.2 - Preventing and correcting early school leaving
      The training was provided to 122 participants, in 5 sessions of 5 days each, as
       follows:
           o Priority axis 1.3: 3 sessions with 77 participants (from Teachers’ House,
               School Inspectorates, County Centers for Psycho-pedagogical Assistance,
               schools, and kindergartens) in 36 counties
           o Priority axis 2.2: 2 sessions with 44 participants (from kindergartens) in 13
               counties
      The training involved experts from the Intermediary Body for Human Resource
       Development Operational Program, the MNE unit responsible for managing the
       funding policies and instruments available for human resources development
       through the European Social Fund.
      All trainees received certificates for participation.
      The following training materials were provided:
           o training curriculum
           o training course modules
           o practical guide for writing eligible proposals under the European Social
               Fund

Three months after the completion of the training, 34 eligible project proposals had been
prepared of which 4 had been submitted for priority axis 1.3, and 10 had been prepared
for priority axis 2.2.

Promotion of integrated services and CBSs for ECE
Alternative community-based solution

      The project financed a consultant to design a plan for alternative community-
       based solutions.
      Based on this plan, an international consulting company implemented an
       alternative CBS in four pilot-isolated and vulnerable communities with no access
       to education services for children aged between 3 and 7 years.


                                           52
      The intervention included family kindergartens, specifically targeting Roma and
       disadvantaged groups, support for training, teaching and learning materials, and
       incentives for care mothers and children.

The pilot communities were:
           o Poiana cu cetate, Grajduri parish, Iaşi county
           o Baneasa town in Carpinis district, Constanta county
           o Maciova, Caras-Severin county
           o Racos village, Racos parish, Brasov county

In the four communities, eight care mothers were trained based on the adapted alternative
curriculum for children aged 3–6 years and the methodological guide for care mothers.

During project implementation, 69 children benefited from CBS, most of them Roma.

Training and counseling programs for parents

      A consultant was contracted to train and counsel parents to become sensitive to
       social, psychological, nutrition, health, accident prevention, children’s rights, and
       other specific issues when raising children and to develop new skills and attitudes.
      A needs analysis for teaching staff and parents from the target group was
       developed—in the field of particularities of education, development, and care of
       the young child (0–7 years old).
      A set of modules for trainers and thematic brochures for parents were developed
       and printed, to support the training and counseling sessions.
      The training program included 53 qualified teachers who trained and counseled
       1,257 parents.
      A final study was developed, including 3 questionnaires: one for teachers, one for
       parents, and one for the trainers.
      The services were implemented in eight resource centers:
           o ValeaLunga Kindergarten, Alba county
           o Bunesti Kindergarten, Brasov county
           o Modelu Kindergarten, Calarasi county
           o Iveşti Kindergarten, Galati county
           o Lunca Cetatuii Kindergarten, Iaşi county
           o Glina Kindergarten, Ilfov county
           o Odorheu Kindergarten, Satu Mare county
           o Pătrăuţi Kindergarten, Suceava county
      All eight resource centers received furniture and equipment: tables for equipment,
       tables for discussions, chairs, laptops, multifunctional printers, video projectors,
       projection screens, and filing machines.

Monitoring & Evaluation and IEC activities

      National and international consultants supported MNE in setting up an ECD
       M&E system based on clearly identified indicators, including a survey instrument

                                            53
       to monitor child readiness in domains including: physical health and well-being,
       social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive development,
       communication skills, and general knowledge.
      The consultants developed a child’s school readiness assessment tool and a user’s
       guide on how to use the Child Development Evaluation Tool (CDET) in the
       child’s last year of kindergarten and also, by primary teachers, in the child’s first
       year of schooling. The tool’s major aim is to define a child’s profile at the end of
       kindergarten, which will serve as reference data in supporting the child’s
       development and learning in the next years (child’s level of development,
       domains in which the child needs more support, child’s strengths, and child’s
       style of learning).
      Later, different consultants were contracted to pilot the two instruments. The
       piloting process was carried out in 42 units, two kindergartens and two schools in
       each of the eight regions (South, South-West, West, North-West, North-East,
       Center, and Bucharest-Ilfov).
      The piloting process included teachers and parents from 60 kindergartens and
       schools. All the participants received copies of the instrument to apply it to each
       child they supervise.
      Upon conclusion of the pilots, a study was carried out incorporating the results
       with a view of improving the quality and ease of using the CDET and user’s guide
       by teachers and parents.
      Consultants also designed and prepared a communication strategy and action plan
       for the ECE program. They developed a strategic communication appraisal
       document, a communication strategy for the IECE program, and an action plan for
       implementing the communication strategy.

Project Management Units

Within the MNE, two PMUs were responsible for managing the project’s component 2:
the Externally Financed Projects Management Unit (EFPMU) and the School and
University Network Rehabilitation Projects Management Unit (SUNRPMU). The PMUs
had general coordination responsibilities, and were responsible and accountable for
procurement, financial management, and reporting, as well as M&E activities.

Component 3: Social Assistance Programs (€28.6 Million)

This component was designed to support programs of the MLSSF aimed at improving the
situation of PWD, youth at risk, and domestic violence victims through three
subcomponents, as follows:

Subcomponent 3.1: Disabilities program (€14.4 million). This subcomponent aimed to
improve the quality of care in residential services and increase the access to CBS for
PWD in need, especially those with a high dependency on residential services. It would
support the MLSSF/NAPH program for institutionalized care restructuring, prevention of
institutionalization, de-institutionalization, and development of alternative community-
based systems of assistance and social inclusion through: (i) subprojects—submitted by

                                            54
local authorities and selected in accordance with a competitive grant scheme—aimed at
restructuring and rehabilitation of existing institutions and construction of new
infrastructure facilities, in-line with improved standards developed by NAPH, and
development of alternative CBS to support the de-institutionalization process; (ii)
institutional capacity-building through both the provision of training to professional staff
in the new standards of care and the development of the M&E system for NAPH; and (iii)
provision of occupational counseling services to the beneficiaries of the newly
restructured institutions.

Under Component 3.1, the project financed the restructuring or closing of existing
residential care services, and the construction and establishment of new residential care
centers with a maximum capacity of 50 residents and protected dwellings with a
maximum capacity of six persons. In all, six neuropsychiatric recovery and rehabilitation
centers, seven assistance and care centers, and 25 protected dwellings were established
(and services provided), as follows:

The new services conform to specific quality standards for residential centers, day centers,
and assisted housing for adults with disabilities, approved by presidential order on
National Authority for Disabled Persons no. 559/2008.

Subcomponent 3.2: Youth at risk program (€11.1 million). This subcomponent was
designed for youth aged 18 and above, graduating from the institutionalized care system,
to provide them with increased access to integrated social services that would increase
their readiness for independent living. It would finance subprojects submitted by local
authorities (and awarded on a competitive basis) to support the establishment of the
network of multifunctional centers, where eligible beneficiaries would have access to
protected housing, complemented by a range of psychological, social, vocational,
occupational, and legal counseling services. It would also finance M&E activities,
provision of training to the counseling providers and MLSSF staff involved in
supervising the function of the multifunctional centers established, and implementation of
public awareness campaigns.

Ten subprojects were approved for the establishment of multifunctional centers for youth
at risk. Of these, seven are already in operation. The centers provide temporary
accommodation, emotional support, psychological and legal counseling, support and
guidance for integration, rehabilitation and retraining, and socializing. They are staffed
by administrative (chief, night watchman - if applicable, a cleaning lady, or janitor) and
specialized staff (one full-time social worker for 20 people), and other professionals who
comprise a multi-disciplinary team required to deliver services (a psychologist, a
psycho/social educator, a socio-educational animator, advisor, and a vocational/training
counselor). The maximum period of stay for residents is three years.

Details of each of the ten centers are provided below:

Subcomponent 3.3: Victims of domestic violence program (€3.1 million). This
subcomponent was designed to support the development of specialized integrated social
services. Victims of domestic violence could have access to these services for a limited
period of time, until their family situation was solved so that they could return to normal
life. It would finance subprojects submitted by local authorities for rehabilitation and/or
construction of housing infrastructure to shelter victims (and their dependents) and
endowment with furniture and household appliances. It would also finance professional
training for staff that would provide counseling services, the development of a specific
MIS, and the implementation of public awareness campaigns.

Component 3.3 of the project financed the construction of four shelters for victims of
domestic violence, and social welfare units that provide protection, accommodation, care,
and counseling for victims of domestic violence. The centers are in Bucharest and in
three counties. The maximum stay at the shelters is between 60 and 180 days, with the
possibility of extension. The centers are staffed to provide social, psychological, legal,
and occupational counseling, as well as medical care and counseling.

Part I - Romanian Social Development Fund

Part II – Ministry of Education

Part III – Ministry of Labor, Social Solidarity and Family

Part IV – National Agency for Roma

The main achievements in implementation of the project parts are presented below as they

Part I: Priority Interventions Program


Priority Intervention Programme aimed at improving the minimum living conditions
and increasing the level of participation to the local decision making process of people
living in poor Roma settlements, through promoting social inclusion. The programme
provided to Roma people living in poor settlements from rural and urban areas, the
opportunity to improve their abilities to solve problems, through a „learning by doing”


                                            76
process, by identifying their needs and articulating priorities, by participating to the
design, implementation and monitoring of subprojects.

PIP consisted of a grant scheme designed to finance projects initiated by local
communities and to provide support (technical assistance and training) for the
beneficiaries, in order to build the Roma communities’ capacity to contribute at local
development. The main expected outcomes of the programme was to improve living
conditions and social inclusion for Roma living in 133 poor settlements, to upgrade these
disadvantaged Roma settlements up to minimum standards in terms of infrastructure and
basic services. Under the SIP, the following activities were supported: (i) financing of
grants for demand-driven, integrated community development subprojects, targeting poor
Roma settlements from a list of priorities provided by the National Agency for Roma; (ii)
carrying out of information and education campaigns, and the provision of training for
local authorities, community groups and NGOs; (iii) provision of assistance in capacity
building at community level through preparation, facilitation, evaluation and supervision
of Priority Intervention subprojects and provision of related training; (iv) provision of
technical assistance to poor Roma communities to prepare projects to be financed through
EU structural funds and (v) carrying out of monitoring and evaluation, promotion and
communication, networking and training activities for the project implementation.

The stage of achieving the outcomes at the end of the programme implementation is the
following:

“I could say that Bora is still a success story as regard the measures which we, as an
organization and people dedicated to a cause, take, in respect of the inclusion of people
belonging to disadvantaged ethnic groups and social categories. What has been achieved
here is a step forward towards the measures we will take next”, School Inspector for
Roma Education Matters, Sandu Ion.

“If so far we only addressed the material part and invested in the water, gas and road
infrastructure, it is now time to also address the spiritual part. We hope that this is a
small and first step towards emancipation, because many Roma children attend school,
kindergarten, they have a medical office and this way we are trying to attract the largest
possible number.” Mayor of Slobozia, Alexandru Stoica, at the inauguration of the center

“We could show our appreciation for RSDF’s support, by keeping the area clean, by
taking care of the asphalt, not destroying it, as we have to take care of them because they
are for us and for our children.” Moldovan Călin Filip, volunteer, Petelea, Mureş
County

“UMTF Roma community has 169 members and a special program was developed for
them, financed with RSDF funds. We invested in the improvement of their health
conditions and in their integration in the Romanian community. As I was saying, the
problems that traditional copper pot makers who live here encounter are many and very
diversified... Therefore, we conceived this integrated project which did not imply only the
construction of a public bath, but also the education of Roma on matters of health and
social counseling. These are approaches addressed to children, but also to adults, and
they are carried out here, at the public bath, as well as in the Roma homes.” Elena
Coşofreţ, project coordinator Vânători Neamt, Neamţ County

“I couldn’t say that we don’t know how to wash, to be clean, but we don’t have the means.
Now we have a public bath in our community, with a washroom and a drier. We are
thankful for the understanding. We are not educated enough to understand all problems.
But thanks to the understanding and patience of the project facilitators, a good thing was
done for the Roma of this community.” Codrea Lăcătuş, Leader of the Roma community
of Vânători Neamt, Neamţ County

“All persons present agreed that the project has achieved its objectives. The two matters
proposed for settlement were entirely resolved. The access road to the community is now
practicable on its entire length and the day care center is and will be a permanent
support for the families in the community and their children who face problems at school.
The students have improved their school records and they have widened their knowledge
horizon”. (focus group at the end of the implementation, Brateiu, Sibiu)

“The members of the community are satisfied with the results of the project. Both with the
road rehabilitation and with the after school services. As dissatisfaction – they said all
children should benefit from after school services.” (focus group at the end of the
implementation, FNC Livadă community, Călăraşi)

                                            78
“The community can become involved in activities that improve their life. They became
more confident and they understood that if they become involved and they collaborate,
they can achieve their objectives. Roma people can collaborate with significant persons
from the city hall management and their behavior during the implementation of the
project (voluntary work, the LMU’s activity- local monitoring unit) has reassured APL
that they can rely on Roma people. The leaders appointed by the Roma community have
proved that they are reliable and have done their duty, rewarding the community’s trust.
Roma may also learn to carry out monitoring activities, even prepare documents if they
are trained and supported”. (focus group at the end of the implementation, Brateiu,
Sibiu)

“Further to the involvement in the project, we learned to be confident that good things
can be done for the community, we learned to try and do something for the community, to
request assistance from the city hall, to access other funds”. (focus group at the end of
the implementation, FNC Livadă community, Călăraşi)

“As dissatisfaction, we could mention that the bitumen layer poured on the road does not
seem durable”. (focus group at the end of the implementation, Brateiu, Sibiu)

“To a great extent, the community members are satisfied with how the project was
implemented by the Coordination and APL Group. As reasons of satisfaction, we could
mention: the pouring of asphalt on the access road to the community and the construction
of the social group. As reasons of dissatisfaction, we could mention: the fact that asphalt
was not poured on the road and alleys inside the community and the fact that, although
the social group is constructed and equipped, it is still not functional”. (focus group at
the end of the implementation, Brad, Hunedoara)

The evaluation performed by the Local Monitoring Units of the project outcomes, upon
their conclusion, has revealed the satisfaction of most members of the Roma community,
both with regard to achieving the projects’ objectives, and with regard to how they were
implemented, although they noted that they only solved part of the problems faced by
these communities and they expressed the desire for their other needs, deemed equally
urgent, to be resolved as well in the future. The impossibility to perform more extensive
or better quality (infrastructure) investment works, due to the limited financial resources
supplied by the project was also raised by the representatives of the Roma communities.


   •     Outputs financed by the Loan:
             o Number and small description of Sub-Projects financed (broken down by
                type, focus, purpose, capacity)
In total, within the PIP 133 integrated projects were financed, of which:

- 90 had a community road rehabilitation component
- 30 had a utility access component (water supply, sewage network, including street
sewage, public baths/washrooms)

                                            79
- 62 had a social services component (day care/educational centers, vocational
training/professional counseling services, information and counseling services, health
campaigns)
- 17 had a medical services component (establishment of medical office/cabinet)

protection works, public toilets)
- 21 had a community center component (cultural and educational centers, art and sports
clubs, music and dance clubs/bands)
- 21 had an environmental protection component


           o Number of beneficiaries that have benefitted from Projects/Sub-Projects,
             broken down by gender, and by disadvantaged groups.

The total number of beneficiaries was approximately 58,800, of which approximately
19,500 women.


           o Other activities financed (e.g., MIS, information campaigns, training,
             studies, consultations etc.). For example, 2 trainings on social counseling
             for victims of domestic violence for X staff of a given center X; 500
             experts participating in a conference, etc.

       -   4 public information campaigns, conducted in the target communities, one for
           each call: 214 communities informed
       -   18 regional information seminars, attended by 647 people
       -   23 training sessions for the members of the Project Coordination Committees
           (inclosing representatives of the initiative groups): 991 participants
       -   3 experience sharing networks between beneficiaries – 12 network meetings
           organized


           o Other activities financed, with description of activities and beneficiaries

       -   171 eligible Roma communities received community facilitation services


   •   Prospects for Sustainability:

Responsibility for ensuring the maintenance of the objectives resulting from the
implementation of projects funded by PIP and for continuing to provide social services
created by the project lies entirely with the Management Agent who implemented the
project. In this regard, since the submission of projects, Management Agents were
required to submit a Plan for maintenance of integrated project after PIP funding ends,
and a Local Council decision which are assumed to continue financing the maintenance

                                            80
of investments financed by project (for infrastructure works) and the services provided to
beneficiaries in the project (in the case of social services created by the project).




   •   Prospects for Continued Funding of activities and new Sub-Projects

FRDS promoted participatory approach, integrated projects for poor communities and
best practices drawn from the Priority Intervention Program to other donors. Thus,
Financial Mechanism of the European Economic Area (EEA) is funding now a similar
component which focuses on increasing access to education in the Roma communities
(targeting about 37 communities).

   •   Major factors that affected implementation of Component/Sub-Component

-       the lack of preparation of the communities included in the pilot stage for the
intervention provided under PIP. The conditions stipulated in the PIP Operation Manual,
based on which ANR followed to select the pilot communities have not been fulfilled but
very little. Therefore, on the date of RSDF intervention, with just one exception, the
beneficiaries in the 10 eligible communities for the pilot stage have not had established
their priorities, had not identified at least one project idea, respectively there were no
conditions for the mobilization of the resources (contribution, people). At the same time,
no community had, at least under preparation, the technical documentation required for
the submission of a project under PIP;
-       lack of ownership documents for the lands and houses of the Roma community
members, which made it impossible to satisfy within PIP the needs designated as priority
by the majority of the eligible community members (rehabilitation of the houses or their
connection to the power supply network), which lead to the necessity of extending the
period for establishing the community priorities, long after the originally estimated term;
-       the location of some eligible Roma communities in floodable areas, with no
access to road infrastructure or drinking water resources, on private or claimed lands,
which made it impossible to design investment works for the community infrastructure.
That is why, in such cases, only integrated projects with exclusively social services
components could be submitted;
-       lack of investment funds at the local budgets level, which entailed the allocation
of more important time resources in the community facilitation process, in order to
identify alternative financing sources to cover the costs for the technical documentation
required for submitting the projects;
-       reduced capacity for target communities mobilization (including the demand of
those involved in the initiative groups to be remunerated for the work performed for the
project), the process of identification of priority problems by the communities requiring a
longer period of time than the one estimated by RSDF / allocated for this process in other
programmes previously developed by RSDF;




                                            81
-       reduced cohesion within the target communities, which often generated
difficulties in gathering a unitary group to get involved in the PIP projects (communities
consisting of several different Roma groups / varieties);
-       mistrust of the community members in the successful development of a project to
improve their living conditions due to the multitude of previous promises (in particular
during election periods) which were not kept;
-       desire of the local actors (local authorities, political parties, NGOs, etc.) to exploit
the PIP projects for electoral and own image purposes, which may generate mistrust and
confusion among the target communities during the projects preparation and
implementation period;
-       lack of perceptiveness of some local authorities regarding the accomplishment of
some investments in the Roma communities;
-       lack of resources at local level (financial, human, etc.), which makes it difficult to
assure the preparation of viable and sustainable projects;
-       reduced expertise level of some of the beneficiaries / Management Agents in the
field of project management, which lead to delays in the projects progress and procedures
infringement tendency;
-       the insufficient funds made available for RSDF for PIP implementation during the
last 3 years, which entailed the slowing down of the projects implementation rhythm and
accumulation, in time, of delays in the payment of instalments to the projects. This fact
made RSDF to move the focus of its activities from supporting the progress at high
rhythm of the projects under financing to their controlled slowing down, to the mediation
of the relationships between the Management Agents responsible for the implementation
of the projects and the companies employed to accomplish the projects objectives (for
which the delayed payments for the accomplished works represented a reason for
tensions and dissatisfaction), as well as to maintaining a certain level of trust among the
beneficiaries, dissatisfied, in their turn, by not finalizing in time the activities proposed by
the project, by the delayed payment regarding the services, delivery of goods and, in
particular, the payment for the construction works execution;
-       the existence of legal provisions which restricted the personnel employment by
the local authorities during the last years, which imposed the identification, together with
the Management Agents, of other legal alternatives for contracting members in the
financed projects implementation teams, respectively for taking over the costs for the
salaries of the experts employed in PIP projects by the local authorities after finalizing
the projects;
-       the reduced interest of the beneficiaries/ Management Agents in accessing the
technical assistance services supplied by RSDF in view of helping them to also attract
other financings intended for supporting the local/ community development process (in
particular EU funds), reduced interest due to inclusively the limited financing
opportunities existing during this period, in particular for poor rural communities,
respectively the restrictive financing conditions and the reduced capacity of the
Management Agents to fulfil them (in the absence of human resources with expertise in
the implementation of EU projects and of the financial resources to assure the required
cash flow, in the conditions of massive delays in assuring the financing/ reimbursements
of the expenses). The lack of expertise in this field of the Management Agents could also
be noticed from the low quality of many of the technical assistance applications

                                              82
submitted to RSDF. The low information level of the local actors regarding the existing
financing opportunities and the conditions requested by the financers made the majority
of the technical assistance applications received by RSDF to be either non-eligible or
insufficiently substantiated. The quick exhaustion of PNDR funds as well as the absence/
permanent postponement of opening new financing rounds under POSDRU for grant
projects – the most attractive and accessible financing sources for local communities
eligible under PIP – represented other reasons that explain the low number of technical
assistance applications received by RSDF and their low quality.
-       the reduced involvement of the representatives of some of the financed Roma
communities in the projects monitoring and participating evaluation activities, due to the
lack of expertise, to the low level of education and of social capital, to the lack of time or
long periods of absence of the Local Monitoring Units members from the community;
-       the limited financial resources supplied by the project (the maximum grant value
under PIP) and the local financial capacity for maintaining the objectives did not allow
the accomplishment of major investment works (in infrastructure) or of a higher quality,
which lead to the discontent of some Roma communities representatives (several of the
problems they are confronting were not solved, impossibility of adopting more complex
or more expensive technical solutions, with consequences on the level of satisfaction of
the community members regarding the quality of the performed works, etc.).

    •   Any views on the preparation/implementation support provided by the World
        Bank

-   consultation meetings with the involved actors have been organized;
-   the World Bank team had an important contribution in establishing the project design
    and implementation conditions, by continuous consultation with RSDF;
-   during the implementation, RSDF received support for monitoring the process, for
    identifying the problems and finding the solutions to solve them.

    •   Aspects (design, procedural, strategic, etc.) worth replicating (positive lessons
        learned from implementation)

- supply of community facilitation services, including during the projects implementation
period, in particular for supporting the local monitoring and evaluation activities, and
during post-implementation for supporting the steps to assure the sustainability of the
project outputs;
- provision of support to the potential beneficiaries for preparing the projects, and in
particular for preparing the budgets and the social component design;
- allowing a sufficiently long period of time for the projects preparation (minimum 3
months) and for the projects implementation (minimum 2-3 years);
- provision of technical support / verification during the implementation;
- involvement, with priority, of the local Roma NGOs in the projects, as they are aware
of the situation and as this does not imply high travel / personnel costs or just good
practice transfer from other NGOs situated far away – cost effectiveness;
- involvement of Roma community members in the management / implementation teams,
if they have the required training and expertise;

                                             83
- maintaining a relative autonomy of the implementing entity, respectively as concerns
the financing and payment approvals – the same financial mechanism applied until now
within the programmes financed by the World Bank, based on RSDF’s responsibility,
without additional reporting and approval levels;
- utilization of the World Bank procedures as concerns the procurement for RSDF,
respectively the community procurement for the implementing entities;
- involvement of the community members in performing the activities and their step-by-
step information regarding the development of PIP projects, action which generated
benefits, such as: awareness of the importance to participate, even if volunteer, in
activities of common interest and, in particular, awareness of the necessity to contribute
to maintaining the projects outputs;
- training of the beneficiaries and of the specialists involved in their support, in view of
implementing the projects in proper conditions;
- facilitation of collaboration relations development, of experience exchange and good
practice transfer between/ for the beneficiaries. The experience exchange and partnership
establishment activities, grouped under the general name of “networking” activities were
intended for the information and experience exchange between the actors involved in the
financed projects implementation and having similar mission and interests, with the
purpose of increasing their capacity to assure the good functioning and sustainability of
the projects;
- sustaining a participating monitoring process, aimed at involving the community
members in the close monitoring of the implementation process and in the project outputs
evaluation. The evaluation of the participating monitoring and evaluation activities –
performed by RSDF facilitators together with ULM members and members of the
Projects Coordination Groups – in the middle of the implementation period, represented a
good opportunity to identify, together with the Roma communities representatives, all the
problems occurred during the projects implementation and participating monitoring and
evaluation activities performance, respectively to find the best solutions for overcoming
these problems and finalizing the projects in good conditions.

    •   Aspects (design, procedural, strategic, etc.) that should be adjusted/refocused
        before replicating or continuing with activities

-   the necessity of revising certain targets of the Programme. For instance, the
    performance indicator regarding “the percentage of Roma communities members
    (who benefited from financing under PIP) who declare that their minimum living
    conditions have improved as a result of the Programme implementation”, for which
    the target of 70% was established, proved to be difficult to document / achieve, as the
    general perception of the Roma communities members on the general living
    conditions in the community is difficult to change on a short term, and only by means
    of individual interventions aiming a small part of the (complex) needs of a poor Roma
    community;
-   the analysis of the possibility to give up the lists of eligible Roma communities
    supplied by ANR and allowing the access of all eligible communities to the resources
    provided by the Programme, in conditions of open competition;



                                             84
-   refocusing the intervention on poor multiethnic communities, with a high/ relevant
    percentage of Roma ethnics, in order to avoid possible tensions/ conflicts at local
    level, to raise the interest of local authorities in developing such projects and to better
    facilitate the organization of intercultural activities under the projects, with the
    majority population/ other ethnicities in order to avoid the possible interpretations
    concerning the segregation of the Roma community members;
-   involvement of the initiative groups both in training activities and in networking
    activities with the financing beneficiaries.
-   increase the maximum level of grant / funding for a project, to be able to cover/ solve
    more of the community needs and at a higher level of quality


At its closing date, of the 17.86 million euro allocated to the program (of which, 13,7
million euro, representing 76.71%, were external funds) were actually spent
approximately 16.94 million euro (94.85%), of which approx.13 million euro (76.75%)
representing external funds.

Out of 16.94 million euro, 14.15 million euro(83.56%) has been allocated for projects,
and 1.05 million euro(6.31%) for activities aimed at increasing community capacity to
contribute to local development(technical assistance – information, community
facilitation, project evaluation and supervision, consultancy for other projects
development - and training for the representatives of the beneficiary communities).
Additionally, the operational costs, goods and training for RSDF accounted 1.72 million
euro (10,22% of total expenditure).

Regarding project implementationcosts,11.55 million euro out of total14.15 million euro
(representingapprox.81.6%) were allocated for construction works for improving the
livelihood in Roma communities (rehabilitation of roads, water supplies, building
educational/community canters etc.).

Overall, proportionally, the utilization of the funds allocated to project implementation
has the following structure:

Construction   Goods and      Training    Operational costs(related      Project management
works          materials      /Consulting to social services)            costs
81.6%          6.6%           1.1%        5.7%                           5.1%

 Of activities aimed at increasing the capacity of Roma communities to contribute to local
 development, the community facilitation-focusing mainly on consulting community
 members in various stages of preparation and implementation of the project-assumed
 total expenditure of approx.166,000 euro, of whichapprox.75,800 euro has been
 allocated for community facilitation specific to the implementation phase of projects,
 including participatory monitoring at the level of the community.

                Support to MER to mainstream Roma into the regular policies ano1 programs of
       MER through: (i) the construction, extension, rehabilitation and furnishing of ECE
       infrastructure in communities with a high percentage of Roma; (ii) the development of an
       inclusive ECE curriculum, the provision of training to ECE staff, the development and
       distribution of ECE teaching and learning materials, and the provision of technical
       assistance to entities entitled to submit financing applications for projects to be financed
       through EU structural funds; (iii) the promotion of integrated services and alternative
       community-based Solutions for ECE, including the development of coherent ECE

       the carrying out of monitoring and evaluation and information, education and
       communication activities.


       Rehabilitation of ECE infrastructure
       The program supported building and furnishing of nineteen (19) new buildings for
       preschool units from the list, creating facilities to enroll more children in the areas where
       there was a large percentage of Roma children with age between 0-6. At the same time,
       the project supported the rehabilitation and furnishing of approximately eight (8) existing
       buildings, to improve the quality of education and facilitate access of more students
       coming from disadvantaged communities with a majority of Roma population.

       1.Development of ECE curriculum, human resources and teaching/learning
       materials

       The development of the ECE curriculum
       National individual consultants have elaborated the ECE curriculum for children 0-3
       years and revised the curriculum for children 3-6 years. They have worked with
       inspectors from the Ministry of National Education (MNE) and Department for Primary
       and Secondary Education, Department for Minority to develop the curriculum to be

                                                  87
integrated into the MNE policy and practice and to be accepted by education decision-
makers and beneficiaries.
The new ECE curriculum enhances the socio-emotional and physical health of children,
and the continuity between early education curriculum for 0-3 years and 3-6 years. Since
educational curriculum for children 0-3 has not been developed before, a Methodological
guide for teaching and other staff has been provided in order to orient the specific activity
and to organize the learning environment in crèches. Both ECE curriculum for 0-3 years
and methodological guide are still awaiting formal approval, necessary for their legal
application.
A good practice guide for ECE of children from 3 to 6 years of age has also been
developed by individual consultants and provided support for all teaching and non-
teaching staff in kindergartens.
Also, under this sub-component, the quality standards for teaching-learning materials
and the Normative for Minimal Supplies in Kindergarten were updated and quality
standards for ECE programs were developed through consultations with representatives
from the Romanian Quality Assurance Agency for Pre-university Education, to be used
as a grounding document for the development of other standards.

The development of human resources (teaching and care services)
An international consulting company, selected as a result of QCBS in 2009, ensured the
technical assistance for training the trainers, coordinate and monitor the in-service
training for upgrading skills of staff primarily working in project supported ECE units,
develop the modules for ECE and the preparatory guide for all staff.
In order to organize the training activities, the consulting company selected an
appropriate number of persons, from the already qualified or experienced
teachers/trainers to ensure the training for the targeted persons from the communities
with building/rehabilitation interventions and also from other similar communities in
proximity, lacking qualification and competence in ECE. They provided in-service
training gathering people in clusters, presented and discussed the basic module for all the
trainees and the specific ones for distinct groups including follow-up sessions. The
clusters have been placed where resources allowed quality teaching environment and
availability of education staff.
The main aim of the training was to help the target population, represented by the ECE
staff: educators, care personnel, nurses, principals from kindergartens and auxiliary
personnel to upgrade their skills (teaching and care services) and also become familiar
and apply inclusive approaches in all their activities.
The training modules have been designed to raise awareness on disadvantaged groups
and bring about an attitudinal change about Roma, to address issues related to social
inclusion, and cultural sensitivity:
Module 1: General Module – Concepts for early childhood education, focused on
intercultural principles
Module 2: Interactive Methods Module – Practices in ECE services
Module 3: Educational Management Module – Management of diversity in ECE system.
The modules have been developed based on the revised curriculum for 3-6 and the early
childhood education guidelines for 0-3, using the methodological guide developed under


                                             88
the project and other relevant documents for ECE that have been recently developed and
implemented in the ECE system.
During the training, 2,600 modules were printed and distributed to trainees, and the
number of participants was 2,769.
Based on the training needs of the new-entry ECE staff and budget savings, a second
round of training has been organized in 2014 by another consulting company, selected as
a result of QBS.
During the second round of training, 1,500 modules were printed and distributed to
trainees, and the number of participants was 1,422.
On the whole, more than 4,000 people were trained, as targeted in the beginning of the
project.

The development of standards of ECE teaching and learning materials and
provision of such materials primarily in project ECE units
EFPMU developed two selection procedures (shopping) for printing the ECE Curriculum
for Children from 3 to 6/7 Years of Age and the Good Practice Guide for ECE of
Children from 3 to 6/7 Years of Age, previously developed under sub-component The
development of the ECE curriculum. The two materials have been printed in 6,000 copies
each, in two tranches. They have been distributed to all kindergartens, through the county
inspectorates.
Within the project, teaching-learning materials and books were provided for the children
from targeted communities (100 kindergartens):
    • set of balls, tunnel for crawling, magnetic board with letters and numerals,
        magnetic board for teacher, set of geometric shapes in various colors, sizes and
        thickness, set for construction - small pieces, set of wooden cubes for construction
        - big pieces, set of musical instruments, human body / internal organs models,
        models of various animals, insects, fishes
    • 12 book titles – 575 pcs for each title
They were distributed based on assessment of the needs of ECD units and their priorities.
The books selected covered also the inclusion and cultural aspects.


The access to the EU Structural Funds
The use of SIP funds was maximized by utilizing them for the preparation of ECE
projects for human resources development eligible under the European Social Fund
(ESF), further contributing to the implementation of the overall MNE ECE program. For
this purpose, a consultancy firm was selected by LCS to conduct the design and
implementation of training and follow-up assistance programs on accessing EU structural
funds for projects targeting ECE actions, under the following Priority axes of
intervention:1.3. - Human resources development in education and training and 2.2. -
Preventing and correcting early school leaving.
The training was provided to a number of 122 participants, in 5 sessions of 5 days each as
follows:


                                            89
• Priority axis 1.3: 3 sessions with 77 participants (from Teachers’ House, School
   Inspectorates, County Centers for Psycho-pedagogical Assistance, schools,
   kindergartens) in 36 counties,
• Priority axis 2.2: 2 sessions with 44 participants (from kindergartens), in 13 counties.
All trainees received certificates for participation.
The training materials provided were: the training curriculum, the training course
modules and the practical guide for writing eligible proposals under the European Social
Fund.
3 months after the training completion, the number of eligible project proposals
elaborated/submitted was: 34 elaborated and 4 submitted for Priority axis 1.3, and 10
elaborated for Priority axis 2.2.
The training involved also experts from the Intermediary Body for Human Resource
Development Operational Program, the unit from the level of MNE responsible for
managing the funding policies and instruments available for human resources
development through the European Social Fund.

2. Promotion of integrated services and CBSs for ECE

Alternative community-based solution
A national individual consultant was selected to design a plan for alternative community-
based solutions. Based on this plan, an international consulting company, selected by
QCBS, implemented an alternative CBS in 4 pilot isolated and vulnerable communities
with no access to education services for children aged between 3 and 7 years.
The intervention included family kindergartens, specifically targeting Roma and
disadvantaged groups, support for training, teaching/learning materials, incentives for
care mothers and children.
The pilot communities were:
1. Poiana cu cetate, Grajduri parish, Iasi County
2. Carpinis district from Baneasa town, Constanta County
3. Maciova, Caras-Severincounty
4. Racos village, Racos parish, Brasov County
In the 4 communities, 8 care mothers have been trained based on the adapted alternative
Curriculum for children aged 3 to 6 years and the Methodological guide for care mothers.
During project implementation, 69 children benefited from CBS, most of them being
roma.

Training and counseling programs for parents
A national consultant has been selected by QCBS and to train and counsel parents to
become sensitive to social, psychological, nutrition, health, accident prevention, children’
rights and other specific issues when raising children and to develop new skills and
attitudes.
A needs analysis for the teaching staff and parents from the target group has been
developed – in the field of particularities of education, development and care of the
young child (0-7 years old).
A set of modules for trainers and thematic brochures for parents were developed and
printed, to support the training and counseling sessions.

                                            90
The training program included 53 qualified teachers who trained and counseled 1,257
parents.
A final study was developed, including 3 questionnaires: one for teachers, one for parents
and one for trainers.
The services were implemented in 8 Resources Centers:
- ValeaLunga Kindergarten, Alba county
- Bunesti Kindergarten, Brasov county
- Modelu Kindergarten, Calarasi county
- Iveşti Kindergarten, Galati county
- Lunca Cetatuii Kindergarten, Iasi county
- Glina Kindergarten, Ilfov county
- OdorheuKindergarten,Satu Mare county
- Pătrăuţi Kindergarten, Suceava county
All 8 Resources Centers received furniture and equipment: tables for equipment, tables
for discussions, chairs, laptops, multifunctional printers, video projectors, projection
screens, filing machines.

3. Monitoring & Evaluation and IEC activities
An international individual consultant and 2 national individual consultants were selected
to support MNE in setting up an ECD monitoring and evaluation system based on clearly
identified indicators including a survey instrument to monitor child readiness in domains
including: physical health and well-being, social competence, emotional maturity,
language and cognitive development, communication skills and general knowledge. They
developed a child’s school readiness assessment tool/instrument and a User’s Guide on
how to use the Child Development Evaluation Tool (CDET) in the child’s last year of
kindergarten and also by primary teachers in the child’s first year of schooling. The
tool’s major aim is to define a child’s profile at the end of kindergarten which will serve
as reference data in supporting child’s development and learning in the next years
(child’s level of development, domains in which children needs more support, child’s
strengths, child’s style of learning, etc.).
Further on, in order to pilot the 2 instruments, a national consulting company was
selected by LCS.
The piloting process was carried out in 42 units, 2 kindergartens and 2 schools in each of
the 8 regions (South, South-West, West, North-West, North-East, Center and Bucharest-
Ilfov). The number of participants in the training session was represented by 50% of the
kindergarten teachers in 8 regions.
The piloting process included teachers and parents from 60 kindergartens and schools.
All the participants received copies of the instrument in order to apply it to each child
they supervise.
In the end on the piloting process, a study was elaborated with the results of these
activities, in view of improving the quality and easiness in using the CDET and User’s
Guide by teachers and parents.
A local consulting company was selected by CQ to conduct the design of the
communication strategy and action plan for the Early Childhood Education Program. It
developed a strategic communication appraisal document, a Communication Strategy for
IECE Program and an Action Plan for implementing the Communication Strategy.

                                            91
Project Management Units
Within the Ministry of National Education, the overall responsibility for managing the
project was placed with two national executing bodies (PMUs): the Externally Financed
Projects Management Unit (EFPMU) and the School and University Network
Rehabilitation Projects Management Unit (SUNRPMU). The PMUs have had general
coordination responsibilities, have been accountable for procurement, financial
management and reporting, as well as monitoring and evaluation activities. The PMUs
have created an interface for the coordination of the project with MNE and its local
correspondents and ensures that all Government inputs committed to the project are made
available.

Sustainability
Under the project sub-component The development of the ECE curriculum, the
Curriculum for children aged 3-6 years has been revised and, together with the Good
practice guide for ECE of children from 3 to 6 years of age, have been printed and
distributed to kindergartens in all the country, to be used in the education process.
The ECE curriculum for children 0-3 years and its Methodological guide have been
elaborated and are waiting formal approval to be used in kindergartens.
Both PMUs due to their experience over project management are still implementing other
projects with different foreign donors, World Bank, Development Bank of European
Council, European Union etc., each unit having in implementation various projects with
resources that have been created in this project.

   Part III: Social Assistance Programs

   1.     Disabilities Program

         The Social Inclusion Project (SIP) - program for people with disabilities
         (Part 1) - funding on a competitive basis to the Sub-projects for people with
         disabilities


  Government of Romania, through the Government Program decided to develop and
  diversify social services for vulnerable groups not covered by existing services.
  The crucial role of social services in a constantly evolving society is given by the social
  and economic changes that may have seriously/ badly effects, because they often
  generate situations of vulnerability or increase vulnerability to certain categories of
  people.

  Analyses revealed the precarious situation of social services infrastructure and the need to
  investments in buildings for social sites, rehabilitation, modernization and equipping of
  the buildings in which those services are created/ developed. However, the need for
  investments arouse following of the establishment of minimum quality standards for
  social services which has to be met by the existing social sites, as well as those who has
  to be built, depending on the type of beneficiaries.

                                              93
This program aims to support Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Protection for the
Elderly (MMFPSPV) and the National Authority for Disabled People (NADP), to raise
the quality of care in residential settings:
-         (i) financing on a competitive basis to sub-projects for people with disabilities;
-         (ii) providing training professional staff who will apply new standards of care;
-         (iii) developing a monitoring and evaluation system for NADP;
-         (iiii) providing occupational counseling.

The new services were realised in accordance with the Specific quality standards for
residential centers, day centers and assisted housing for adults with disabilities, approved
by order of the president of the National Authority for Disabled Persons no. 559/2008.




The specific objectives of the Program for people with disabilities were:
- reducing the number of people with disabilities in the old, isolated and overcrowded
residential centers, by restructuring these centers, according to the district strategy and
county plan of restructuring / closing;
- increasing the institutional capacity of the local authorities on the development of social
services according to the profile of the beneficiaries and their individual needs, the social
services to promote social inclusion of persons with disabilities;
- increasing the quality of life of adults with disabilities in the target group which benefit
by hosting, support and attention in the residential centers and the assisted housing,
newly created and properly equipped.
So, the resulting profitability by implementing of the project activities is the increased
quality of life of beneficiaries, respective the persons with disabilities in the residential
centers undergoing restructuring through the development and diversification of
specialized social services.

Prospects for Sustainability:

The projects sustainability is ensured by the grant beneficiaries, respective the General
Directorates for Social Assistance and Child Protection for a period of 15 years, with
obligation to keep the destination and operating costs of newly created services for adults
with disabilities.


Following the restructuring of the old residential centers with large capacity is necessary
to identify new sources of funding to establish new residential centers, with small
capacity for the people with disabilities.

The purpose of the Program for Youth at Risk component of the Social Inclusion
Project (SIP), financed by the loan offered to the Romanian Government by the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is to promote social
inclusion of young people leaving the child protection system, representing a type of
population whose vulnerability is caused, in particular, by their limited capacity to adapt
to an independent living.
The program aimed to create multifunctional centres with the capacity to provide
accommodation, psychological and legal counselling, social work and employment
provision in order to develop skills for independent living, to recover and social
reintegrate the youth at risk.
The overall goal of the program was to prevent the risk of social exclusion of young
people who leave the child protection system through the development and
diversification of social services for this vulnerable population.
The specific objectives have been:
    • diminishing the number of young people in the situation of not having a safe
        shelter by creating multifunctional centers that provide accommodation and socio-
        professional reintegration services.
    • increasing the institutional capacity of the local public authorities on the
        development of social services, according to the profile of the beneficiaries
        and their real needs;
    • improving the quality of services by using trained personnel in a specific area
        of intervention;
    • increasing the quality of life of young people from the target group benefiting
        both accommodation in adequately equipped multifunctional centres and
        social assistance and support in order to achieve their socio-professional
        integration.
    • progress towards expected Outcomes (based on Outcome and Intermediate
        Outcome Indicators for the Component/Sub-Component) in the Project Appraisal
        Document
            o Include anecdotal evidence supporting the quantitative accomplishments,
                e.g. beneficiaries’ perspectives as gathered during field visits, etc.

Beneficiaries’ opinion regarding the services of shelter, asked after your request, reveals
the following:
    • concerning the quality of accommodation, meals and support services provided in
        the center, 66,66%of the center’s beneficiaries appreciate the quality of these
        services as very good, 21,66% as good, 10,83% as satisfactory and 0,85% as
        unsatisfactory (figure no.1).

        appreciate these relationships as very good, 23,33% as good, 8,3% as satisfactory
        and 0,83% as unsatisfactory (figure no.2).

        beneficiaries of the multifunctional centres, 103 are employed representing a
        percentage of 62,8% within the total number of beneficiaries and 50 are
        employed after they entered the center representing a percentage of 62,8%

Local public authorities have committed to maintain the activity of multifunctional
centers and to ensure its functionality for at least five years from the date of the final
receipt of the work funded by the SIP and, after this time span, to maintain its activity in
social services’ domain another 5 years.

No applications were submitted for other projects regarding this issue but the need still
exists. Regarding the possible other sources of financing, it could be used structural funds
allocated to Romania for the next programming period, 2014-2020.

Major factors that affected implementation of Component/Sub-Component
The main problems that affected implementation of Component3/Sub-Component 3.2 -
youth at risk:
   • the lack of interest from eligible applicants;
   • the lack of financial funds from the General Directorates Social Assistance and
       Child Protection. The contribution required from local public authorities - 10% of
       the total amount of funding requested.

     • Any views on the preparation/implementation support provided by the World
       Bank
Very good collaboration with the Project Management Unit of the Ministry of Labor,
Family, Social Protection and Elderly and World Bank staff.

     • Aspects (design, procedural, strategic, etc.) worth replicating (positive lessons
       learned from implementation)
Legislation should be amended in order to have a faster procedure for approving
investment objectives (approvals were obtained from the County Council, Technical and
Economic Council of the Ministry of Labor, Family, Social Protection and Elderly, the
Interministerial Council and Government.
       It’s recommended to give a pre-financing in order to carry out the projects more
       easily.

     • Aspects (design, procedural, strategic, etc.) that should be adjusted/refocused
       before replicating or continuing with activities
Because the local authorities could not allocated enough money to co-finance projects (It
was required a contribution of 10% of the total amount of funding requested), General
Directorates of Social Assistance and Child Protection applied for a few projects.


3.       Victims of Domestic Violence Program

     Program for family violence victims, component of the Social Inclusion Project
     (SIP), financed by the loan offered to the Romanian Government by the International
     Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The purpose of the program is to

                                            103
enhance the living conditions and the social inclusion of the disadvantaged group of
family violence victims.


The objectives have been:
Creating new social services for family violence victims by developing a network of
centers, training the specialists, raising awareness regarding the phenomenon and its
consequences and the development of a toolkit for the specialists within the field.
Therefore, four projects ware financed by the Romanian Government and IBRD (four
shelters for the victims of domestic violence in Bucharest, District 3 and in the
counties of Suceava, Dâmboviţa and Iaşi).

•   Progress towards expected Outcomes (based on Outcome and Intermediate
    Outcome Indicators for the Component/Sub-Component) in the Project Appraisal
    Document
       o Include anecdotal evidence supporting the quantitative accomplishments,
           e.g. beneficiaries’ perspectives as gathered during field visits, etc.

Beneficiaries’ opinion regarding the services of shelter, asked after your request,
reveals the following:
All beneficiaries appreciate the accommodation conditions, the understanding,
support and warmth that they receive from the staff of the shelter.
Victims feel safe in the shelter.
They are concerned, most of them are worried by the perspective of leaving the social
assistance-employment, housing, getting an income necessary maintenance on their
own.
The victims believe that isn’t enough publicity and promotion of the social services;
their proposals are related to visual media in the neighborhoods in the blocks scale in
the buildings, in the stores in the public institutions network of family doctors and
audio media-radio stations stores.


• Outputs financed by the Loan:
A. Program for family violence victims, component of the Social Inclusion Project
(SIP), implemented in 2008 - 2013 in order to establish new shelters for victims.
The results of the 2 organized selections were: 4 projects are financed by the Romania
Government and IBRD (4 shelters the victims of the domestic violence, Bucharest:
District 3 and in the counties Suceava, Dâmboviţa and Iasi).
The centers for sheltering victims of domestic violence are social welfare units and
provide protection, accommodation, care taking and counseling to the victims of
domestic violence forced to resort to this social welfare service.

   •   Any possible indicators to substantiate that the Project’s activities were cost-
       effective, and expected to increase efficiency and generate positive economic
       returns:
           o Construction/training etc. costs compared to other similar construction or
               other costs
           o Measures of increased efficiency in providing services/activities to target
               population, e.g., reaching a greater number of beneficiaries with existing
               staff, improved targeting of social assistance
           o Possibly, citing average economic returns to ECD

   •   Prospects for Sustainability:
          o Actions taken to ensure continued funding for operations and maintenance
              of activities financed
          o By which agency, what source of funding
          o Internal government plans for replicating/disseminating, etc. positive
              experiences

       Public shelters are financed from local budgets for at least 10 years.


   •   Prospects for Continued Funding of activities and new Sub-Projects
          o Projects submitted for EU Contingency Financing
          o Financing secured, by source of funding and number/type of Sub-Project
          o Financing applied for by source of funding and number/type of Sub-
              Project
          o Possible other sources of financing

No applications were submitted for other projects regarding this issue but the need still
exists.

   •   Major factors that affected implementation of Component/Sub-Component

It was found the lack of financial funds during this projects especially from the General
Directorates Social Assistance and Child Protection.

   •   Any views on the preparation/implementation support provided by the World
       Bank

It was a very good collaboration with the Project Management Unit of the Ministry of
Labor, Family, Social Protection and Elderly and World Bank staff.

   •   Aspects (design, procedural, strategic, etc.) worth replicating (positive lessons
       learned from implementation)

Legislation should be amended in order to have a faster procedure for approving
investment objectives (approvals were obtained from the County Council, Technical and
Economic Council of the Ministry of Labor, Family, Social Protection and Elderly, the
Interministerial Council and Government.
It’s recommended to give a pre-financing in order to carry out the projects more easily.

   •   Aspects (design, procedural, strategic, etc.) that should be adjusted/refocused
       before replicating or continuing with activities

Because the local authorities could not allocated enough money to co-finance projects,
General Directorates Social Assistance and Child Protection applied for a few projects, so
this is a reason for which these institutions should be financially supported.
