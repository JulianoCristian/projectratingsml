The\n            restructuring aims to: (i) extend the project's closing\n            date by 17 months from February 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014,\n            and (ii) amend the description of activities from\n            sub-component 3.4 of the Project to allow the upgrade of the\n            management information system for the administration of the\n            social assistance benefits. This was requested by the\n            Government through letter to the World Bank dated October 4,\n            2012. It is proposed to extend the project by 17 months from\n            February 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014. Within this new\n            timeframe, it is expected that the project will fully meet\n            its project development objective (PDO). The project is\n            currently rated Marginally Satisfactory due to the extensive\n            delays in sub-project approval, which have prevented timely\n            implementation of component three and therefore the\n            inability to reach the PDOs by the current closing date of\n            February 1, 2013. All the necessary approvals have been\n            received, the works are under implementation and the project\n            is now set to disburse quickly. Thus, the PDO should be\n            achieved by the revised closing date."}, "docdt": "2012-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
