                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project implementation was much slower than anticipated mainly due to long and cumbersome domestic procedures for the approval of the sub-projects and related
                         investments which affected mainly Component 3 (Social Assistance Services). In Spring 2011, the World Bank approved two restructurings of the project (a 23 months extension of
                         the closing date, to enable the completion of the ongoing activities; and new technical assistance activities in support of the Social Assistance System Modernization Project. A third
                         restructuring approved in December 2012 (effective beginning with January 2013) extended the project closing date until June 30, 2014.

                         Components 1 (Priority Interventions in Roma communities) and 2 (Early Childhood Development) continued to perform well. Under Component 1, all 100 sub-projects initially
                         approved were completed, as well as 20 out of the additional 33 sub-projects. Other 13 sub-projects are in advanced stages of implementation.

                         Component 3, Out of the 34 sub-projects for social services approved for persons with disabilities, youth at risk and victims of domestic violence, a number of 12 sub-projects were
                         completed and for 12 sub-projects the construction works are in advanced stage of implementation. Tenders for other 8 sub-projects are ongoing and 2 sub-projects were dropped by
                         the local governments due to the lack of counterpart funds. All the sub-projects are expected to be completed by the current project closing date (June 30, 2014).
