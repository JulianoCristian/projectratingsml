                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project implementation was much slower than anticipated mainly due to long and cumbersome domestic procedures for the approval of the sub-projects and related
                         investments which affected mainly Component 3 (Social Assistance Services). In Spring 2011, the World Bank approved two restructurings of the project (a 23 months extension of
                         the closing date, to enable the completion of the ongoing activities; and the inclusion of new technical assistance supporting the implementation of the Social Assistance System
                         Modernization Project. A third restructuring approved in December 2012 (effective beginning with January 2013) extended the project closing date until June 30, 2014.
