                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project development objective was largely met. The gap in living conditions between targeted poor Roma settlements and neighboring communities was reduced by 62%; social
                         inclusion improved through the provision of Inclusive Early Childhood Education to kinds from poor Roma communities and of related teacher training to educators from a large
                         number communities. and the employment of 39.6% of the youth 18+ who attended multi-functional centers constructed under the project. The Social Assistance system was
                         strengthened as cash benefit programs were transferred to the central payment agency for 8 large program and cross-checks undertaken between the social assistance database

                         Component 1 (Priority Interventions in Roma communities- small infrastructure and social services) - all the activities were successfully completed including, all 100 sub-projects
                         initially approved + 33 additional (new) sub-projects.

                         Under Component 2 (Inclusive Early Childhood Development), all the construction/rehabilitation works for the 27 kindergartens included in the program have been completed
                         (including the procurement of furniture and teaching materials) as well as the consulting services related to the development of curriculum for inclusive early childhood education and
                         the delivery of training for the educators. Savings amounted to EUR 0.4 million, have been contracted to support the training of additional teaching staff.

                         Component 3 (Social Assistance Services), Out of the 32 sub-projects for social services approved for persons with disabilities, youth at risk and victims of domestic violence, 28
                         sub-projects were completed. For another 4 sub-projects, the works will be completed shortly beyond the project closing date. Significant savings were identified under this
                         component. As a result, in 2011, EUR 1.4 mil. were reallocated to Component 1 allowing the implementation of additional sub-projects in poor Roma communities. Also, additional
                         savings amounted to EUR 8.5 mil. will likely be canceled from the loan after the project closing date.

                         Several technical assistance activities, introduced in 2011 as sub-Component 3.4 - Social Assistance Cash Transfer Program, supporting the implementation of the ongoing SASMP
                         haver been implemented. The ones that could not be launched will be taken over by the SASMP following its upcoming restructuring, including the second phase upgrade of the
                         Management Information System (SAFIR) of the National Agency for Payments and Social Inspection.

                         Component 4 (Capacity Building for Roma Social Inclusion), Most of the activities initially included in this component were canceled as they became eligible for non-reimbursable EU
                         Funds and the related savings (EUR 0.6 mil) were reallocated in 2011 to Component 1, allowing thus the implementation of more sub projects in poor Roma communities.

                         However, project implementation was much slower than anticipated. In Spring 2011, the World Bank approved two restructurings of the project (a 23 months extension of the closing
                         date) to enable the completion of the ongoing activities; the inclusion of new technical assistance supporting the implementation of the Social Assistance System Modernization
                         Project (SASMP) and the Development Policy Loan; and (iii) the reallocation of savings identified in Components 1 and 2 to Component 1. A third restructuring approved in
                         December 2012 (effective beginning with January 2013) extended the project closing date until June 30, 2014 primarily to give more time for the newly introduced TA activities in
                         Component 3.4 to support the SASMP.

                         The project remains relevant to the Government of Romaniaâ€™s needs and will be followed by a proposed new Romania Social Inclusion and Basic Services project. Sustainability is
                         assured for most of the project, either through inclusion in regular budget financing or through the follow-on project. Only the activities relating to People with Disabilities may not be
                         sustainable since some centers have not been staffed and training was canceled.
