Second Structural Adjustment Loan\n            Project supports the government's structural adjustment\n            program designed to: lay the analytical framework for an\n            extensive public sector modernization; consolidate and\n            deepen reforms supported by the first loan in tax reform,\n            privatization, trade, financial and social sector reforms,\n            and poverty alleviation; and promote actions to strengthen\n            public expenditure, civil service, environmental management,\n            and restructuring the hydrocarbon sector. Political and\n            economic accomplishments over the past two years have left\n            El Salvador poised for sustained social and economic\n            development and equitable growth. The Bank's strategy\n            is to support the government in meeting its development\n            challenges through a blend of adjustment lending, investment\n            lending in selected sectors, analytical work to address\n            sectoral issues and guide the policy dialogue, technical\n            assistance to deepen reforms and strengthen institutions,\n            and donor coordination. Progress on implementation of the\n            Bank's assistance strategy will be judged on four\n            criteria: maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic\n            framework; successful implementation of the reform program\n            supported by this loan; government willingness and ability\n            to carry out a comprehensive public sector reform program;\n            and continued government commitment to poverty alleviation\n            and improved environmental management."}, "docdt": "1993-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
