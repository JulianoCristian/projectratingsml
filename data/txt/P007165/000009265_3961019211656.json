the Second Structural\n            Adjustment Loan Project for El Salvador were as follows:\n            outcomes were highly satisfactory, project sustainability\n            was likely, Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also highly satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: as in any adjustment program,\n            Borrower ownership is critical. Because of the\n            Government's strong commitment to the reforms supported\n            by SAL II, the negotiation and implementation of the program\n            was achieved in an environment of mutual confidence. The\n            success of one structural adjustment operation is likely to\n            be repeated in a follow-on operation if: (i) sequencing is\n            appropriate; and (ii) there is continuity in the staff, both\n            in the Government and in the Bank, working on both\n            operations. The financial sector is highly vulnerable to\n            structural economic changes, requiring a gradual and careful\n            sequencing of reforms. In the case of El Salvador, banking\n            sector reforms were well sequenced and gradual\n            (restructuring, capitalization, and privatization of the\n            banks, accompanied by actions to reinforce the Superintendence)."}, "docdt": "1996-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
