  enhance its contribution to the overall growth and stability\n            of the Peruvian economy. The loan will support the\n            implementation of a modernized bank resolution framework\n            coupled with improved surveillance and prompt corrective\n            actions, as well as finer-tuned rules for providing\n            liquidity support to healthy banks. In addition, the loan\n            will support reforms aimed at more systematic coordination\n            of prudential supervision and crisis management across the\n            banking, capital markets and pension sectors."}, "docdt": "1999-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
