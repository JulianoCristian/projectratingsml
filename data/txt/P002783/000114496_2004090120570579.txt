Dear Sir:
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the
Integrated Roads Project between the United Republic of Tanzania
(the Borrower) and the International Development Association (the
Association) dated September 28, 1990, as amended to date.  We also
refer to various discussions between the Borrower and the
Association and to Mr. P.J. Ngumbullu's letter dated September 4,
1992, requesting amendments to the Development Credit Agreement and
a reallocation of Credit proceeds.
     This letter is to inform you of our agreement to the request.
We therefore propose to amend the Development Credit Agreement as
follows:
     1.   The table in Schedule 1 is amended to read as in the
          attachment to this letter.
     2.   Part A.3 of Schedule 2 is amended by the addition of a
          sub-part (c) as follows:
               "(c) Establishment of computer courses for
               highway technicians at the Dar es Salaam
               Technical college and provision of training
               equipment."
     3.   The amount in Paragraph 1 (c) of Schedule 5 is amended
          to read 11 12,000,000".
     All other provisions of the Development Credit Agreement as
amended herein shall remain in full force and effect.  These
amendments shall take effect as of the date of countersignature of
this letter.
     Please confirm your agreement to the above by signing and
dating the form of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter
and returning it to us.
                              Sincerely,
