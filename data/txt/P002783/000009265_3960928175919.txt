MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR AN INTEGRATED ROADS PROJECT
1.    I submit the following memorandum and recomendation on a proposed Credit
to the United Republic of Tanzania for SDR 139.9 million (US$180.4 million
equivalent) for approval. The proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms,
with 40 years maturity, and would assist in financing the restoration of
Tanzania's essential road network, and restructurs and develop the institutional
capacity in the Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW) to properly maintain
and administer the road network. The project would be cofinanced by 14 other
donors who are contributing US$576.4 million equivalent to the financing.
2.    Background and Strategy.   The Economic Recovery Program (ERP) launched
by the Government of Tanzania in 1986 has, inter alia, led to a major expansion
of the production of agricultural commodities. The higher production of export
crops has not, however, been fully translated into export earnings. The basic
infrastructure, after nearly one and a half decades of nzelect, has deteriorated
to a point where less than 15% of the road network is in a passable condition.
Road conditions have resulted in high transport costs, two to three-fold
increases in travel times and frequent disruptions in tr.nsport during wet
seasons. The annual direct cost to the economy, in terms of higher transport
cost, is of the order of US$150 million, or about one-third of the country's
export earnings. The deterioration of the road network has been caused primarily
by: (a) inadequate funding for road maintenance and diversion of scarce funds
to lower priority investments; (b) a cumbersome and inefficient institutional
structure involving three ministries and over 100 entities in road
administration; (c) a highly centralized and bureaucratic procurement and
decision-making process which stifles effective management; (d) insufficient
public and private sector capacity to undertake road works and equipment
management; and (e) substandard technical capacity to keep the road maintenance
equipment operational and manage contracts.   Efforts to develop trunk road
maintenance capacity under the Fourth and Fifth Highway projects (Cr. 507-TA and
876-TA) failed to realize improvements in road conditions, and rehabilitation
works under the ongoing Sixth Highway Project (Cr. 1688-TA) has been extremely
slow, mainly due to the institutional weakness of MCW and the protracted
procurement process caused by outdated and unfocussed government regulations.
3.    The Government has  recognized that a major restructuring of roads
administration and rehabilitation of the deteriorated network is necessary if
the ERP is to maintain its momentum. At the July 1987 Consultative Group meeting
for Tanzania, the Government and donors supporting Tanzania's ERP requested the
Bank to assist the Government in carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the
sector and in convening a Transport Sector Donors' Conference to present a
strategy for improving the road conditions. At the Donors' Conference held in
Arusha in December 1987, the following key recommendations were endorsed. For
the roads sector: (i) road administration would be reorganized to bring all roads
essential to supporting the agricultural sector under MCW; (ii) funding for
maintenance of trunk and regional roads would be increased substantially to meet
the full maintenance requirements; (iii) MCW operations would be decentralized
by providing greater executive authority to its regional offices; (iv) a



- 2 -
substantial part of equipment management would be separated from MCW; and (v)
greater participation of the domestic construction industry in road maintenance
would be encouraged through expanding the training initiated under Cr. 1688-TA,
and by limiting the awouat of Government-managed force account activities. For
tte transport parastatals each entity would: (a) develop a corporate financial
strategy to make it financially autonomous; (b) develop an incentive scheme to
increase productivity of its workers; and (c) the Board would take greater
responsibility in ensuring financial and operational efficiency. This project,
along wi a the Tanzania Port Modernization Project II approved in February 1990,
and the proposed Railways Restructuring Project which will be presented next
fiscal year, totaling nearly US$1.3 billion over the next five to seven years,
forms an integral part of the comprehensive program discussed and agreed at the
December 1987 Transport Sector Donors' Conference.
4.    Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the Government took steps to
implement the main recommendations endorsed at the 1987 Conference.   In the
roads sector, the Government has: (i) injected more dynamic leadership into MCW;
(ii) significantly increased MCW's road maintenance budget for FY1990; (iii)
formulated a road network stabilization program under the proposed project; (iv)
approved a major reorganization of roads administration and appointed key staff
to the new Regional Engineer's Offices (REOs); (v) approved the interim
procurement regulations to be applied to the proposed project which delegate
substantial contracting authority to MCW from the Central Tender Board, and
drafted terms of reference to cacry out a nationwide revision of the procurement
regulations; (vi) engaged consultants to formulate a plan to commercialize
equipment maintenance and management; (vii) prepared a National Construction
Industry Development Strategy which will promote private sector participation
in road maintenance; and (viii) approved various contracts which have been
pending under the Sixth Highway Project, resulting in satisfactory progress being
achieved.   Furthermore, to improve the financial discipline and resource
mobilization in the transport sector, the Government has (a) approved a financial
restructuring proposal for the Tanzania Harbours Authority (which would more than
double its annual net contribution to Government revenues); (b) approved tariff
increases and route restructuring for Air Tanzania Corporation and is currently
reviewing a capital restructuring proposal to make the airline self-financing
from FY1992; (c) commissioned a study to review and recommend a strategy to
improve the financial and operational efficiency of urban passenger transport;
(d) completed a major study on the Tanzania Railways Corporation to restructure
its operations and finances; (e) commissioned an urban passenger transport study
to improve the cost effectiveness of bus transport in Dar es Salaam; (f) formed
a Presidential Committee on Taxation and a Task Force on Road User Charges to
improve overall revenue generation, including an action plan to generate further
revenues from road users to finance the planned increase in road rehabilitation
and maintenance budget; and (g) increased the prices and tax rates on petroleum
products (by 60-100%) in February 1990.
5.    Proiect Obiectives.  The primary objective of the proposed project is to
restore Tanzania's trunk and regional road networks and to develop MCW's
institutional capacity to properly manage the networks, building on the steps
taken by the Government noted in the previous paragraphs. The physical target
is to have, by 1996, 60% of trunk roads in good condition from the current 15%
and 50% of the regional road network in eleven of the agriculturally most



- 3 -
productive regions in good condition from the current 10%, and to install regular
maintenance on 80% of the trunk and 60% of the regional road networks.  In
patticular, the project will assist the Government in developing strong
manazgem.lent and technical capacity to maintain the trunk and regional road
networks, and transform MCW from a construction-oriented ministry to an
administration and management-oriented ministry
6.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.   IDA's involvement in the project is a
logical extension of its role in assisting the Government to carry out its
macroeconomic reform.   IDA's role includes assistnace in reform of sectoral
institutions and in removing bottlenecks that have emerged as obstacles to the
*        sustainability of the recovery program.  In the roads sector, the Government and
the donors have agreed that IDA's main role is to assist the Government to
implement the detailed institutional and policy changes agreed at the December
1987 Donors' Conference and to help coordinate donor participation in the
project.   Furthermore, at the request of the Government, IDA has agreed to
station an experienced highway engineer in Tanzania for about three years, to
assist in the overall coordination of the project.
7.    Project Description.    The proposed  project would  consist  of:  (a)
institutional support to strengthen road management capacity in the country,
including strengthening of MCW headquarters and its REOs, development of lcal
contractors and equipment mneaagement capacity, training of technicians and
expanding the output of engineers from local institutions, and s.rengthening
institutional capacity to manage procurement; (b) civil works including
rehabilitation and improvements of about 4,600 km (or 43%) of the trunk road
network, rehabilitation of 30 bridges and minor structures along trunk roads,
improvement of about 10 vehicular ferry crossings, rehabilitation of about 3,000
km (or 21%) of regional roads in eleven core regions, renovation of offices and
workshops, and upgrading office technology and communications; (c) road
maintenance support program including establishment and equipping of privately
operated plant pools, rehabilitation of existing equipment and establishment of
an autonomous MCW plant pool to manage road maintenance equipment, rehabilitation
of equipment by contract, road maintenance by contract, hiring of equipment from
plant pools, and emergency road works; and (d) management assistance to Air
Tanzania Corporation, National Transport Corporation and Dar es Salaam bus
companies to implement the financial and corporate restructuring plans.
8.    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$871.1 million, of which
US$652.1 million (75%) is in foreign exchange.  A financing gap of US$33.8
million (4% of total project cost) remains, specifically for rehabilitation and
resealing works in the fourth year of the investment program (FY1992/93). It
is expected that financing would be found through future donor meetings. Details
of the project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement
methods, amounts involved, and the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and Bank Group operations in
Tanzania are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map of the road network
in Tanzania, noting the various locations of civil works under the project and
the areas selected for the Core Regional Roads Program is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8367-TA, is being distributed separately.
9.    Agreed Actions.  The following main actions were agreed upon with the



- 4 -
Government during negotiations. The conditions of effectiveness: (a) adoption
by the Government of the Construction Industry Development Strategy; (b)
finalization of the procedures and documentation for the interim procurement
regulations; (c) selection of consultants for undertaking the procurement
regulations and supply management study; (d) agreement on regulations for
establishment of MCW's plant pool, and on bidding documents and the list of
prequalified companies for estaolishment of private plant pools; (e) approval
by the Government of the agreed budget estimate for road r,'iabilitation and
maintenance for FY1990191. The conditions of disbursement for the Second Year
(FY1991192) and the Third Year (FY1992193) Trunk Road Rehabilitation Programs
will be that the Government has allocated the agreed budget for those years and
that it has made adequate and timely releases of funds from the previous fiscal
year's budget for road rehabilitation and maintenance. Other main agreements
reached are: (i) annual physical and budget targets for road maintenance with
Government contribution fully covering road maintenance requirements by
FY1995/96; (ii) action plan for completing the MCW reorganization; (iii) complete
implementation of the revised procurement regulations oy December 31, 1993; (iv)
joint review of a program to improve the delivery of urban passenger transport
services, institutional reorganization and pricing policy by December 31, 1991;
and (v) specific aspects affecting the environment to be included in terms of
reference for studies and conditions of contract for works, satisfactory to IDA.
10.   Justification and Risks.  The maiii justification of the project is that
the economic recovery cannot be sustained unless the transport costs cre reduced
and accessibility to the primary agricultural areas are improved. The economic
rate of return (ERR) for the rehabilitation works (83% of project cost) is
estimated at about 24%. The success of the project hinges ultimately on MCW's
capacity to execute the program. The particular risks include: sl'w progress
on privatization initiatives; failure to effect the agrecd procedures to delegate
executive authority for contracting goods, works and services; a- failure to
meet the agreed road budget targets.  To guard against these risks   xperiences
learned from past projects have been incorporated into the project _esign: (i)
by undertaking the main institutional and policy changes prior to project
effectiveness, including changes in the procurement regulations, aDpropriation
of the agreed road budget for the first year of proj'ct impleme..~.ation, and
reorganization of roads administration; (ii) by making the approval of road work
contracts financed by IDA conditional on the Government appropriating the agreed
annual road budget; (iii) by completing the engineering works for the first two
years of the program prior to Board presentation; (iv) by developing closer
coordination amongst the Government, donors and IDA; and (v) by stationing in
Tanzania an experienced highway engineer from the Bank to assist the Government
in coordinating implementation of the project.
11.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit complies with the
Articles of Agreement of the International Development Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve it.
