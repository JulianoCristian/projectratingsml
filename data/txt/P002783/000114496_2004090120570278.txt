                    (Integrated Roads Project)
                    Amendment
Dear Sir:
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the
Integrated Roads Project between the United Republic of Tanzania
(the Borrower) and the International Development Association (the
Association) dated September 28, 1990. We also refer to various
discussions between the Borrower and the Association and to Mr. P.J.
Ngumbullu's letter dated May 9, 1992, requesting amendment to the
Development Credit Agreement to reflect the split in the Ministry of
Communications and Works, and the establishment of the Plan and
Equipment Hire Company. This letter is to inform you of our
agreement to the request. We therefore propose to amend the
Development Credit Agreement as follows:
     1.   Section 1.02 (b) is amended to read as follows: "MOW"
          means the Borrower's Ministry of Works;
     2.   "MCW" in Section 1.02 (g), (i), (n) (o), Section 5.01
          (c), Schedule 2, Part A.1, and 9, Schedule 4, paragraphs
          1 (a), (b) and (c), 4, 5, 6 (b) and 6 (c) is amended to
          read "MOW";
     3.   Section 1.02 (n) is amended to read as follows: "MWTI"
          means the Morogoro Works Training Institute;
     4.   The following subsections are added to Section 1.02;
          "(q)  "MCT" means the Borrower's Ministry of
          Communications and Transport; and
          (r)  "PEHCOL" means the Plant and Equipment Hire Company
          Limited, a public company incorporated under the
          Companies Ordinance."
     5.   Section 3.01 is amended to read as follows;
          "Section 3.01 (a)  The Borrower declares its commitment
          to the objectives of the Project as set forth in

          for the Project.
          (b)  The Borrower shall make the proceeds of the Credit
          allocated to Parts A.10; A.11; C.2 (b), 3 and 6; D.1 and
