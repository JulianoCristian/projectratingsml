                         Following the January 12, 2010 earthquake, the Government of Haiti (GoH) requested that Haiti Emergency Recovery and Disaster Risk Management Project (P090159) be
                         restructured to account for the following: (i) an extension of the closing date of the project by twelve (12) months, specifically an extension of the closing date of both the Development
                         Grant Agreement (IDA Grant No. H143-0-HT) and the Financing Agreement (Grant No. H353-0-HT) until December 31, 2011; (ii) a reallocation between categories of disbursement

                         to cover existing and projected category expense overruns, (iii) the elimination of one minor subcomponent under Part B4 of the Project (related to the installation of a national
                         communication system to coordinate the operations between the national and regional levels); and (iv) a revised results management framework.

                         Following the GoH's request, the project team prepared a second level restructuring for the Country Director's approval. The Country Director approved the second level restructuring
                         on November 2, 2010. The countersigned Amendment Letter was received by the World Bank on November 23, 2010.

                         Overall progress toward the realization of the PDO remains satisfactory. To date, 93.3 % (US$11.2m) of IDA Grant H-1430-HT is disbursed and 68.3 % (US$5.06m) of IDA Grant
                         H-3530-HT is disbursed. US$ 3.142m remains undisbursed; however 95 % is committed under contract. The project is on schedule to close by December 31, 2011

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following the GoH's request, the project team prepared a second level restructuring of the project for the Country Director's approval. The Country Director approved the second level
                         restructuring on November 2, 2010. The restructuring of the project was required for (i) an extension of the closing date of the project by twelve (12) months, specifically an extension
                         of the closing date of both the Development Grant Agreement (IDA Grant No. H143-0-HT) and the Financing Agreement (Grant No. H353-0-HT) until December 31, 2011; (ii) a
                         reallocation between categories of disbursement to cover existing and projected category expense overruns, (iii) the elimination of one minor subcomponent under Part B4 of the
                         Project (related to the installation of a national communication system to coordinate the operations between the national and regional levels); and (iv) a revised results management
                         framework. The countersigned Amendment Letter was received by the World Bank on November 23, 2010.

                         Overall progress toward the realization of the PDO remains satisfactory. To date, 93.3 % (US$11.2m) of IDA Grant H-1430-HT is disbursed and 68.3 % (US$5.06m) of IDA Grant
                         H-3530-HT is disbursed. US$ 3.142m remains undisbursed; however 95 % is committed under contract. The project is on schedule to close by December 31, 2011
