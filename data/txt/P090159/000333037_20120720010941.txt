F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The original project development objectives (PDO), as stated in the Technical Annex,
were to:
  i) support the rehabilitation of the areas affected by the recent adverse natural
       disasters;
  ii) strengthen the country's capacity to manage natural disaster risks and better
       respond to emergencies resulting from adverse natural events; and,
  iii) reduce the vulnerability of communities through risk identification and risk
       mitigation activities.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Context

1.      At the time of project approval, in January 2005, Haiti was a fragile state
emerging from political conflict. A year earlier, a period of turmoil had culminated with
the resignation of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Haiti‘s political landscape then
changed dramatically. A provisional government took control of the country with the
mandate to create the conditions for democratic elections and to support economic and
social recovery. A few months later, the Security Council approved the establishment of
the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Despite these
developments, profound challenges remained – particularly in terms of governance.
Many of these challenges persisted during the entire project implementation period. It is
important to view the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project (ERDMP)
within this challenging context.

2.     Haiti was one of the most disadvantaged countries in the world. In 2005, The
estimated per capita Gross National Income (GNI) was US$ 390, making Haiti the
poorest country in the Americas and the Caribbean. Over half of its population lived in
extreme poverty—less than US$1 per day, and 76 percent on less than US$2 per day. The
2005 United Nations Human Development Index showed indicators below the regional
average: infant mortality rate was 79 per 1,000 live births; life expectancy was 49 years;
and the adult literacy rate was 51.9 percent. Overall, the index ranked Haiti 153rd out of
177 countries.

Sector Context

3.      Haiti was highly exposed and vulnerable to natural hazards. Due to its
geographic location, Haiti was exposed to hydro-meteorological and geophysical hazards.
Widespread poverty, extensive deforestation and overall land and watershed degradation
further exacerbated the country‘s vulnerability. In 2004, Haiti was hit by two severe
events—flash floods and landslides in Belle-Anse and Fonds Verrettes affected more
than 100,000 people (May) and claimed more than 1000 lives. Storm Jeanne caused flash
floods affecting 300,000 people in the region between Cap Haitien, Port-de-Paix and
Gonaives (September). More than 3,000 people died as a result of the flooding. In this
context, the Government of Haiti (GoH) asked the World Bank for emergency support.

4.      The 2004 May and September floods illustrated the need to strengthen the
country’s capacity to address natural disasters. In 2001, the GoH had established the
National Disaster Risk Management System (SNGRD) and the National Disaster Risk
Management Plan (PNGRD) as its operational framework. On the operational level, the
Ministry of Interior and Territorial Collectivities (MICT)'s Directorate of Civil Protection
(DPC) and the Permanent Secretariat for Disaster Risk Management (SPGRD) were
given the responsibility of implementing the PNGRD.
                                             1
5.      At the time, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) was providing
technical assistance to the DPC in the following areas: i) capacity building; ii)
development of response and preparedness plans; iii) strengthening preparedness; and, iv)
establishment of a national training center. Despite external support, the DPC remained
primarily engaged in short-term reactive planning. In order to enhance the DPC‘s
capacity, the transitional GoH expressed interest in changing the institutional status of the
DPC to a General Directorate.

Rationale for Bank Intervention

6.      The ERDMP was the first International Development Association (IDA)
project prepared since 1997. Following a steady decline in IDA disbursements between
1997 and 2000, Haiti began accumulating arrears with IDA. As a result, the country was
placed into non-accrual with the Bank. In 2002, the World Bank Task Force on Low
Income Countries Under Stress (LICUS) called for a new approach to assist the most
marginalized and fragile states in non-accrual status. The LICUS reengagement grant
package aimed to contribute to the kick-start of initial reforms and the delivery of quick
wins in the absence of access to IDA resources. This included two initiatives to
strengthen the capacity for emergency recovery and disaster risk management activities.
The total LICUS package amounted to US$6.4 million.

7.       Following the clearance of arrears (US$52.3 million) in early 2005, the GoH was
ready to receive IDA support again. The Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF), the
partnership of the GoH, donor agencies and international and regional organizations,
aimed to identify priority interventions and needed resources to support Haiti‘s recovery.
The ICF called for i) simplification, rationalization and harmonization of donor
procedures; ii) making funds available in proportion to the real absorptive capacity; and,
iii) strengthening institutions.

8.     The ERDMP was fully aligned with the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS)
FY2005-06 (Report no. 30541, December 10, 2004). Building on the ICF, the TSS
focused on i) delivering hope through quick wins such as improved basic services
delivery and job creation; and, ii) restoring credibility in institutions through reforms that
promoted longer-term economic governance and institutional development. By
supporting the GoH to rehabilitate areas affected by the May and September 2004 floods
and to support civil protection committees at the local level, the ERDMP was consistent
with these two key objectives.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

9.      The original project development objectives (PDO), as stated in the Technical
Annex1, were to i) support the rehabilitation of the areas affected by the recent adverse
natural disasters; ii) strengthen the country‘s capacity to manage natural disaster risks and
better respond to emergencies resulting from adverse natural events; and, iii) reduce the
vulnerability of communities through risk identification and risk mitigation activities.

10.    Related key outcome indicators were: (i) satisfactory planning and completion of
a rehabilitation scheme for affected settlements in the regions of Belle-Anse, Fonds
Verrettes and Gonaives; (ii) capacity established within the DPC to prepare for, and
respond to, natural disaster events which include: (a) a validated legal framework; (b)
stronger management systems; (c) improved technical capacity; and, (d) an operational
National Response Plan; iii) functioning disaster committees in at least 70 communes and
the successful implementation of risk-prevention and reduction measures in vulnerable
communities.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and key indicators
and reasons/justification

11.   The PDO remained unchanged during project implementation. However, the key
outcome indicators were revised. See details below.

  According the guidelines for Emergency Recovery Assistance (OP/BP 8.50 – August 1995), the project
team was required to prepare a Memorandum and Recommendation of the President (MOP) and a
Technical Annex (TA) instead of the regular more comprehensive Project Appraisal Document (PAD).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     While the Technical Annex did not specify the targeted population, it is clear that
the project‗s main beneficiaries would be the people affected by the 2004 floods. The
people in the affected regions of Belle-Anse, Fonds Verrettes and Gonaives would
benefit from the rehabilitation of affected public infrastructure. The project was also
expected to benefit the population of the communities where Communal Civil Protection
Committees (CCPC) would be established2. Other beneficiaries were government staff
working with the project implementing agencies.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

13.      The PDO was expected to be met through the three components described below:

Component 1: Reconstruction and Risk Reduction in the Areas Recently Affected
by Floods (US$2.5 million equivalent)

14.      Based on the needs identified in the GoH‘s recovery plan and the LICUS
activities, the project would support the rehabilitation of small-scale public infrastructure
in Fonds Verrettes, Belle-Anse and Gonaives. The focus would be on the rehabilitation of
drainage systems, public buildings and community centers.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening of the DPC and SPGRD (US$3.5 million
equivalent). The activities financed under this component focused on four key areas:

15.     Institutional and Technical Support. Activities aimed at supporting the DPC and
the SPGRD included: i) providing institutional and technical support for the creation of a
training and documentation center and risk management units within key ministries as
well as the establishment of three thematic committees; ii) revising and validating the
National Response Plan and developing related emergency procedures and protocols;



2
 The 5 Departments and 76 municipalities covered by the project have an estimated population of 6.68
million.

                                                 4
iii) providing support to disaster assessment and disaster intervention teams within DPC
and key ministries; and, iv) organizing simulation exercises.

16.     Technical Studies. The establishment of three thematic committees under the
SPGRD would lead to three essential technical initiatives/studies: a public awareness
program, an initiative for building norms, and an environmental assessment study for
natural disaster vulnerability.

17.     Rehabilitation of the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) of the DPC. The project
would assist the retrofitting of the national EOC and the purchase of the necessary
equipment to make it operational. The project would also support the retrofitting of
regional EOCs in each department as well as the installation of a national
communications system to coordinate operations between the national and departmental
levels.

18.      Strengthening Management Systems within DPC. Activities included: i)
strengthening the DPC with a new accounting system and an updated inventory system;
ii) reinforcing management, administrative and technical capacity within the DPC and the
SPGRD; and, iii) supporting the development of institutional development plans and
emergency funding procedures.

Component 3: Local Risk Management (US$5.5 million)

19.     Under this component, the project sought to support the DPC to create or
reactivate CCPCs and provide disaster risk-management training. These committees
would prepare local risk and vulnerability maps and identify local risk mitigation micro-
projects to be financed by the project. Most activities under this component would be
implemented using the Community Driven Development (CDD) approach.

1.6 Revised Components

20.    The three components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

21.     Additional Financing. In October 2007, Tropical Storm (TS) Noel caused severe
flooding resulting in significant loss of life and damage to Haiti‘s public and private
infrastructure. In the aftermath of the event, the GoH requested additional financing to
scale up investments in Component 1 and Component 3. The additional financing was
approved on January 31, 2008, and became effective September 5, 2008.

22.     The project‘s original‘s closing date was extended by two years, from December
31, 2008 to December 31, 2010. The additional financing supported (i) small works
consisting mainly of rehabilitation of affected drainage and irrigation systems, schools,
health clinics and community centers; and, (ii) the expansion of the local risk-
management activities to ensure full coverage within the five departments where the
project was engaged, including the creation and implementation of additional training

                                           5
modules and the financing of additional local risk-mitigation micro-projects for each
operational CCPC.

* In order to cover the additional audit cost associated with the 2008 project extension, funds were
reallocated from the original project. The reallocation process was conducted separately from the additional
financing, but carried out in parallel.

23.     Restructuring. Following the January 12, 2010 earthquake, the GoH requested
that the project be restructured to account for the following: i) an extension of the closing
date of the project by 12 months until December 31, 2011; ii) a reallocation among
categories of disbursement to cover existing and projected category expense overruns; iii)
the elimination of one minor subcomponent related to the installation of a national
communication system to coordinate the operations between the national and regional
levels; and, iv) a revised results management framework.

24.     Following the GoH‘s request the project team prepared a second-level
restructuring for the Country Director's approval. The Country Director approved the
second-level restructuring on November 2, 2010. The countersigned Amendment Letter
was received by the World Bank on November 23, 2010.

25.    Outcome Indicators. The revision of the PDO level outcome indicators is
discussed in Section 1.3. Below is an overview of the intermediate outcome indicators.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

26.      The following section is based on i) an in-depth review of the Project files; and,
(ii) the findings of an ICR field mission carried out March 4-16, 2012.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

27.     Processed on a fast-track basis, consistent with the guidelines for Emergency
Recovery Assistance (OP/BP 8.50, dated August 1995), the project was approved by the
World Bank‘s Board of Directors on January 6, 2005. The grant agreement between the
International Development Association (IDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance
of Haiti was signed on January 6, 2005 and the project was declared effective on June 1,
2005. The original project had an implementation period of four years with an expected
closing date of December 31, 2008. There was no Quality Assurance Group (QAG)
review of the project.

28.     Assessment of project design. At the time of design, the PDO was relevant and
consistent with the transitional government‘s Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF) and
fully aligned with the IDA Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for the period 2005-06
(Report no. 30541, December 10, 2004). The PDO continued to be relevant to the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2009-12 (Report No. 48284, May 4, 2009). It also
remains relevant to the current Interim Strategy Note (ISN) (Report no. 65112,
November 1, 2011), which places importance on reducing Haiti‘s vulnerability to
disasters and increasing its resilience to shocks.

29.      To achieve the PDO, the project was divided into three operational components:
i) reconstruction and risk reduction in the areas recently affected by floods;
ii) institutional strengthening for the DPC and SPGRD; and, iii) local risk management.
Two aspects of the project design are particularly noteworthy. First, the design was built
on close coordination with other development actors which ensured complementarity
among efforts. Second, recognizing the current ad-hoc nature of community engagement
in disaster response and preparedness, the design incorporated a more productive
systematic approach to community engagement on which future Bank projects and others
could build.

30.    With regard to the implementation arrangements, the project design provided for
the establishment of two Project Coordination Units (UCP): the UCP/DPC and the
UCP/BMPAD (formerly known as the UCP/PL-480). The DPC was given the overall
responsibility for the project, but the day-to-day implementation was divided up by

                                              8
component. The UCP/DPC would be responsible for the execution of component 2 and
the UCP/BMPAD for component 1 and 3. In retrospect, these implementation
arrangements should have been supported by clear policies and protocols for inter-UCPs
communication and coordination. Section 2.2 will provide more details on how the
arrangement of two UCPs played out over the course of implementation.

31.     Given the emergency nature of the project, the project results framework and
related monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements were understandably weak. The
PDOs were relevant but rather broad. Another weakness was that the outcome indicators
did not have baselines or targets. Moreover, intermediate outcome indicators were not
provided – the common practice for emergency projects at the time of preparation.
Finally, there were no formal M&E arrangements in place. A further discussion on M&E
will be covered in Section 2.3.

32.      Incorporation of lessons learned. It is essential to bear in mind that, as one of
the first projects following the World Bank‘s re-engagement in Haiti, the project design
could not take into account general lessons learned from previous projects in the country.
Moreover, the project could not build on examples of best practices in the area of disaster
risk management (DRM) as this was a new field for both the GoH and the World Bank.
However, it was anticipated that the project would be able to build on two LICUS
initiatives during its implementation.

33.     Adequacy of government commitment. At the time of design, the GoH
recognized the need to strengthen the capacity of the DPC, the national agency
responsible for emergency and disaster management in the country. The government
expressed strong interest in elevating the agency to the level of General Directorate. This
would provide the DPC with increased autonomy and enhance its ability to develop a
more comprehensive disaster risk management system. Even though it was not explicitly
stated in the Technical Annex, it is evident that the Bank considered this institutional
change to be essential for the success of the project.

34.      The Bank anticipated that this transformation would occur during the project‘s
first year of implementation. However, this expectation turned out to be overly optimistic.
Haiti‘s fragile political environment and lack of financial resources undermined efforts to
change the institutional status quo. In hindsight, the project could have benefitted from a
more comprehensive analysis of the country‘s political economy and its operational and
institutional weaknesses that could affect project performance. That said, is important to
keep in mind the considerable speed with which the project was prepared―there were
approximately four months between the concept note review (August 2004) and the
Board approval (January 2005). The demands of the GoH and the desire of Bank
management to respond to the emergency in a timely manner provided little time for such
an analysis.

35.     Assessment of risks and mitigation measures. The project design identified a
number of risks: i) capacity building was delayed; ii) government funding and personnel
allocation to the DPC was inadequate; and iii) NGOs lacked understanding of the project.
Additional risks were identified in the technical assistance, including: i) project funding
                                            9
and human resources were reallocated to reconstruction in the case of major disaster
during implementation; and, ii) delays in government approval of the change of DPC to a
General Directorate. After taking mitigating actions into consideration, the overall risk
rating was substantial.

36.     According supervision reports the achievement of the PDO was never at risk.
Some risks, however, should have been rated higher, particularly the inadequate
government support to the DPC and the delays in the agency‘s institutional change. The
proposed mitigation measures were: i) the government would commit to early
identification of additional human resource needs of the DPC; and, ii) the government
would commit to prepare and present the needed decree. The legal document was being
prepared through UNDP consultations. The Minister of Interior would take the necessary
steps to follow up the approval process at Cabinet level. The proposed mitigating
measures appear to have been of little value as these were not within the control of the
Bank.

37.     In addition, the risk framework should have given consideration to the risks
related to the medium/large scale works financed by the project. Given the country‘s high
vulnerability to natural disasters, the framework should have included measures to ensure
that best practices would be taken into consideration during the design and construction
of these works (i.e. making sure that the works would be resilient to future disasters). It is
important to note that this risk was indeed recognized during implementation, and
subsequently included in the updated risk framework.

2.2 Implementation

38.     There are four major factors that affected implementation progress, both
positively and negatively. This includes: i) institutional arrangements and readiness;
ii) occurrence of natural disasters; iii) the country‘s fragile political environment; and,
iv) collaboration with other development actors.

39.     Institutional arrangements and readiness. At the time of project appraisal, the
UCP/BMPAD had solid experience in project management and had already been
involved in the implementation/preparation of two other Bank-financed grants. The DPC,
on the other hand, had no experience with the Bank‘s procedures and modus operandi,
and demonstrated limited capacity. Recognizing the limitations of the DPC, the project
recruited a project coordinator, procurement specialist and financial management
specialist. In addition, a technical and administrative training program was developed to
enhance the DPC‘s capacity.

40.    The decision to split the implementing responsibilities between the UCP/BMPAD
and the UCP/DPC resulted in confusion about the roles and responsibilities of the two
agencies during the early stages of the project. Over time, adequate working
arrangements between the two UCPs were developed.




                                             10
41.     During the course of the implementation of the project, the UCP/BMPAD became
involved in four other Bank projects. As a result, the UCP/BMPAD became increasingly
overstretched. This contributed, inter alia, to inefficient execution of procurement
processes (see Section 2.4). In addition, it became evident that BMPAD faced difficulties
in performing technical audits of the work financed by the project to ensure it complied
with all the technical and fiduciary requirements and safeguards. This often resulted in
sub-standard design, tardy execution and numerous cost overruns. With the benefit of
hindsight, the project team should have considered contracting out the design and
supervision of all medium/large work to an external firm.

42.     The fact that the DPC did not become a General Directorate had a negative effect
on the agency‘s absorptive capacity. The staff and training program turned out to be a
necessary but not sufficient condition to bring the DPC up to speed. A major issue was
the fact that the processing of consultant contracts and payment authorizations was done
by the Ministry of Interior. This, in turn, resulted in delays in the implementation and low
disbursement rates―component 2 had only disbursed 21 percent of the funds allocated
by June 2008, six months before the original closing date. Supervision reports repeatedly
flagged this as an issue of concern. A further weakness was that it was difficult to
conduct field visits due to the limited resources available.

43.      Natural Disasters. While the occurrence of natural disaster hampered project
implementation, the project managed to respond to these events in a rapid and flexible
manner. In 2007, Tropical Storm Noel caused severe flooding resulting in significant loss
of life and damage to infrastructure. This led to an extension of the closing date and an
additional financing in the amount of US$7.4 million (see Section 1.7) to scale up
activities under components 1 and 3. At the same time, the event strengthened the
capacity of the newly-established local civil protection committees who played an
important role in the preparedness and response activities.

44.      One year later, in 2008, Hurricane Fay and Tropical Storms Gustav, Hanna and
Ike (FGHI) affected more than 865,000 people between August and September. These
events had severe impacts on the national economy: the Post-disaster Damage and Needs
Assessment (PDNA) estimated that the impact of FGHI amounted to 15 percent of gross
gross domestic product (GDP). Given the recently-approved additional financing, major
adjustments were not deemed necessary. However, these events did affect
implementation. The DPC UCP was mobilized in the DPC‘s response and coordination
activities as well as in the preparation of the PDNA. These engagements adversely
affected the already slow disbursement rates under component 2. However, at the same
time, many local committees further enhanced their capacity to respond.

45.     The 2008 hurricane season triggered demand for additional World Bank
assistance for disaster risk management (DRM). The Emergency Bridge and
Vulnerability Reduction Project (P114292) and the Emergency School Reconstruction
Project (P115261) were approved in FY2009. These projects were able to build on the
ERDMP by providing a more systematic approach to disaster risk mitigation, recovery
and reconstruction.

46.     On January 12, 2010 Haiti was hit by a catastrophic earthquake measuring 7.0 on
the Richter scale. The event caused the deaths of an estimated 220,000 people and
resulted in damages and losses of close to US$8 billion. The macroeconomic impact of
the earthquake has been estimated at 120 percent of annual GDP. In the aftermath of the
earthquake, the ERDMP was the only mechanism at the disposal of the government to
provide immediate technical and financial support to the DPC. As such, the project
proved to be an invaluable asset allowing the government of Haiti to play an active role
in the coordination of the humanitarian relief efforts and the recovery and reconstruction
process. Furthermore, the event resulted in a restructuring of the project. Changes
included the extension of the closing date; a reallocation among categories; and a revised
results framework (see Section 1.7).

47.     Fragile Political Environment. The political context―from project effectiveness
to closure―was characterized by continuous instability (see table 3). Despite this, the
GoH and the Bank were able to ensure that project funding and human resources were
never reallocated. That is not to say instability did not affect the implementation of the
project. During moments of political change, implementation slowed down due to delays
in the preparation of bidding documents, the signing of contracts and withdrawal requests.
In addition, political instability diminished the likelihood that the DPC would become a
General Directorate as attention was constantly diverted to other, more pressing issues.

48.    Collaboration with other Development Partners. The project supported strong
collaboration with other development partners supporting the disaster risk management
agenda in Haiti, in particular with UNDP, the Inter-american Development Bank (IDB),
the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), and the European Union (EU).
Close collaboration has ensured their efforts have been complementary. UNDP provided
technical assistance to the DPC for the implementation of the national plan for risk and

                                                12
disaster management, while the IDB focused on hydro-meteorological monitoring and
early warning systems, institutional reinforcement of the DPC and of the
hydrometeorological services, and the development of a public awareness program. The
OFDA and the EU provided emergency equipment and training.

49.     These partnerships were essential to the performance of the project, as it exploited
synergies among partners and avoided duplication of efforts. Moreover, the project‘s
convening role and close partnerships provided an important framework which is likely
to continue to guide multilateral engagement in this area.

50.      Despite the above listed implementation challenges, it is important to note that the
project performed well in relation to the World Bank's overall portfolio in the country.
First, it disbursed well. Second, it was flexible enough to respond to the various crises
faced by the country, even if these resulted in rapidly evolving priorities which became
difficult for the project management team to monitor and evaluate more robustly. Overall,
the project did not experience major delays. Where several World Bank projects achieved
less than expected over this period, this project was restructured and implementation
arrangements were adjusted to fit the evolving situation and remained active and engaged
in whatever was the most time sensitive issue at any given moment. Several other
projects in the portfolio were unable to adapt as flexibly. Lessons learned from this
project with regard to flexibility and implementation arrangements were used in the
design of new projects after the 2010 earthquake. Project staff were trusted by the GoH
and called upon in critical moments including after the earthquake to help restore
information flows and support the overall emergency response at the level of the Prime
Minister's office.

Further Action Taken

51.      Midterm Review (MTR). The MTR of the project was conducted on January 22-
26, 2007. The review established that the project was on track to achieve its development
objectives and no restructuring was necessary. The key agreements reached were: i)
institutional support should clarify the role and responsibilities of the different
levels―community, municipal, departmental and central―involved in the disaster
management system; ii) identifying and implementing activities geared towards building
up preparedness for the next hurricane season. This included the undertaking of
simulation exercises and the launching of the 2007 hurricane season public-awareness
campaign; and, iii) to increase the project‘s visibility and impact, it was also agreed that
all small emergency works and rehabilitation works under component 1 and at least 15-
20 sub-projects at the community level under component 3 would be completed prior to
the onset of the upcoming hurricane season.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design




                                             13
52.     At the time of design, the design of M&E was weak. The project did not include a
full-fledged results framework and the quality of the key outcome indicators was
moderately satisfactory. First, baselines were not defined and targets were not established
against which progress could be measured. Second, some PDO outcome indicators were
more outputs. Third, the key indicators were not supported by intermediate outcome
indicators. To be fair, the evaluation of the M&E design needs to take into account the
common practice for emergency projects existing at the time―projects processed under
OP/BP 8.50 were not required to provide a comprehensive M&E framework.

53.     During the course of implementation, the project team made an effort to
strengthen the RF by introducing intermediate outcome indicators and including baseline
and target values. The intermediate outcome indicators were officially introduced in the
2008 additonal financing. It is important to note that most of the intermediate indicators
were already included in the operational manual and the implementation status reports
(ISRs). The inclusion of intermediate indicators in the ISRs was a recently adopted Bank
requirement to improve the internal reporting system. Despite these efforts, the M&E
design remained relatively weak. Most importantly, the PDO indicators still remained too
focused on outputs instead of outcomes.

M&E implementation and utilization

54.     Monitoring was done through i) progress reports; and, ii) active supervision/field
trips. The progress reports were produced by the UCP/DPC and sent to the Bank every
six months. The reports included: (i) a brief description of the project‘s objectives; (ii)
progress under the three components, procurement, and the unaudited interim financial
management reports; and, (iv) priority actions. In addition, through active
supervision/field visits, the values of the indicators were recorded every six months in the
ISRs. These reports show that the PDO indicators were not monitored consistently: only
one of the three PDO outcome indicators was monitored during the entire implementation
period.

55.     The operationalization of the results framework was the weakest part of the M&E.
While the project team focused on strengthening the formulation of the indicators, little
attention was given to effectively operationalize these indicators. The project team did
not develop M&E tools which would have allowed identifying bottlenecks, addressing
issues of non-compliance, and undertaking corrective measures during implementation. It
is not clear how the project team used the collected date to inform decision-making. The
project could have benefitted from the establishment of a Management Information
System (MIS).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental safeguards

56.    Two possible areas that could generate environmental impacts were identified:
natural habitats and involuntary resettlement. At the same time, the ERDMP was

                                            14
classified as an Environmental Category ―B‖ project, anticipating no adverse long-term
impacts on human populations or environmentally important areas.
57.     Due to the emergency nature of this project, it was agreed that the project was
relieved from OP 4.01 requirements during preparation (i.e. the Environmental
Assessment (EA) report did not have to be produced before appraisal). Adequate
justifications was included in the loan document.
58.      During the implementation of the project, there were no reports on adverse
impacts on the environment and field visits to numerous work sites did not raise any flags.
However, proper documentation on the compliance with environmental safeguards was
lacking―the required completion of the environmental impact-assessment checklist for
all civil works had not been systematically applied..
Financial management and disbursement

59.     The client was required to submit unaudited interim financial-management reports
every six months and conduct a financial audit of the project accounts every fiscal year.
During the course of project implementation, the project team conducted three financial
management specific missions. In addition to these missions, the project team conducted
regular supervision missions that monitored the client‘s compliance with the project‘s
financial management and disbursement requirements as stipulated in the Financing
Agreement and Disbursement Letter.

60.     As agreed in the Financing Agreement, annual financial audits of the project were
completed and submitted to the Bank every year. Every audit resulted in an ―unqualified‖
opinion of the project‘s financial management. While the audit firm raised a number of
issues, they were dealt with in a timely fashion through the preparation and execution of
agreed upon post-audit action plans that addressed the Bank‘s recommendations. Every
audit was submitted on time except for the audit covering FY2009. The delay associated
with the submission of this audit was due to the January 12, 2010 earthquake. The Bank
agreed to extend the submission deadline for the FY2009 audit.
Procurement

61.     The project‘s procurement processes were subject to prior review. Initially, the
procurement of goods, services and works proved challenging―the Bank‘s policies and
procedures were not well understood by the client and the Bank had a limited
understanding of the national context (absorptive capacity of national private sector et al.).
The delivery of numerous procurement workshops in Haiti and the training of the
project‘s procurement specialists in Washington strengthened the client‘s capacity to
effectively prepare procurement packages and submit complete and acceptable evaluation
and selection reports. Furthermore, the development of an electronic filling and archive
system allowed for the fast and effective production of supporting documents as required
by the project team.
62.    The project‘s procurement plan was regularly updated and supported by
semestrial (six month) project activity plans that identified the activities and their

                                             15
respective procurement processes during the period in question. The preparation of said
activity plans allowed for the project to successfully anticipate upcoming procurement
processes and in doing so avoided significant delays associated with the preparation and
clearance of packages. While the semestrial activity plans and updated procurement plans
allowed for the effective preparation and procuring of services, goods and works, their
usefulness as contract management tools was limited.
63.    Poor contract management was the most significant issue faced by the project.
Too often the project team had to seek exceptions from LCSPT for no-cost closing date
extension for contracts that had expired. Furthermore, due to the limited technical
supervision of works (see Section 2.2), change orders were often submitted at the last
minute often without the required supporting documentation. More effective contract-
management support is required in order to empower the UCPs with the requisite tools
required to effectively manage projects on behalf of the client.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

64.     At project closing, all the 76 Communal Civil Protection Committees established
have been officially recognized by the Civil Protection Directorate of the Ministry of
Interior. The UCP/DPC is closely monitoring the completion of the Communal
Emergency Operation Centers and the delivery of the equipment. The UCP of the
BMPAD is closely monitoring the completion of the rehabilitation works.

65.     A new IDA grant (Disaster Risk Management and Reconstruction Project –
P126346 | US$60 million equivalent) approved by the Board on December 1, 2011 and
effective as of April 3, 2012 will focus on consolidating gains in the area of local risk
management and institutional strengthening, allowing for a smooth transition and
ensuring continued support to the existing Communal Civil Protection Committees. The
project will also support the establishment of new CCPCs with the objective of covering
all 144 communes in the country. The UCP/DPC will be responsible for continuing the
implementation of this new IDA operation.

66.     Concurrently, the Bank is strengthening the national policy dialogue to advocate
for a stronger DPC and to support the reform of the National Disaster Risk Management
System, while exploring ways to integrate DRM in the upcoming DPO.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

67.     As previously noted, at the time of design the PDO was relevant and consistent
with the key development priorities Haiti―as evidenced by the GoH‘s development
framework and the Bank‘s transitional strategy (See Section 1.1). Various disasters,
which occurred during project implementation, ensured DRM remained a high priority on
Haiti‘s development agenda (See Section 2.1 and 2.2). In summary, the objectives of the
project were highly relevant to the situation in Haiti at the time, and remained so during
the entire life of the project.

                                           16
68.     Although the project was prepared as an emergency project, the project design did
not only focus on reconstruction and rehabilitation. The three components aimed to
balance structural (Component 1 and 3) and non-structural (Component 2 and 3)
mitigation interventions to address the country‘s high vulnerability to natural disasters.
Building on this integrated approach, the project managed to create the enabling
environment for stronger donor involvement and coordination among key stakeholders
(See Section 2.2).

69.     Over time, the project evolved into the hub for the Bank‘s DRM activities in Haiti.
DRM-related projects approved during the implementation of this project include the
Emergency Bridge and Vulnerability Reduction Project (P114292), the Emergency
School Reconstruction Project (P115261), and the Infrastructure and Institutions
Emergency Recovery Project (P120895). Furthermore, the project provided the GoH with
a flexible instrument to respond rapidly to the disasters which affected the country during
implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Details on the achievement of
outputs are in Annex 2)

70.    Project objectives were partly or completely achieved as follows:

71.     Component 1 – Support the rehabilitation of the areas affected by the recent
adverse natural disasters. The outcome indicator for this objective was a satisfactory
planning and completion of a rehabilitation scheme for affected settlements in the regions
of Fonds Verrettes and those affected by tropical storms Dean and Noel. The outcome
indicator for this objective had mixed results. On one hand, 35 percent of the funds were
allocated to the rehabilitation of Fonds Verrettes, as originally planned, through an
integrated approach that led to satisfactory planning and completion of the work, which
included road rehabilitation, the construction of water tanks and establishment of tree
nurseries.

72.     On the other hand, 48 percent of the funds were allocated to a long list of
rehabilitation and mitigation works, such as the construction of close to 9,000 cubic
meters of gabion walls and embankments to provide flood prevention and the
rehabilitation of four national schools destroyed by Tropical Storm Noel. At the time of
evaluation, some works remained uncompleted and some structures had already been
destroyed by flooding events, which implies a poor planning and implementation process.

73.     The remaining funds were allocated to the building of three major emergency
operation centers/emergency shelters in high risk areas. One of these emergency
operation centers is already fully functional and has been tested during a simulation
exercise. It is worth noting that over the past 10 years, while billions of dollars have been
spent in humanitarian assistance, this project is the only one that supported the building
of emergency operations centers and shelters in high risk areas.



                                             17
74.      Component 2 – Strengthen the country's capacity to manage natural disaster
risks and better respond to emergencies resulting from adverse natural events. Under
this component, the National Emergency Response Plan was updated and 18 emergency
operation centers were built and equipped at the communal level, providing adequate
facilities for the CCPCs to operate in good conditions. The emergency response capacity
was tested through various national disaster simulation exercises and also during the 2011
hurricane season, confirming that DPC‘s ability to mobilize and to disseminate warnings
has improved. It should be noted that Component 2 greatly contributed to the success of
Component 3 in strengthening the disaster-preparedness capacity at the local level, as
part of the overall country capacity.

75.    Only two thematic committees (Public Awareness and Reduction, and Building
Norms) of the three envisaged are operational. The Public Awareness and Reduction
Committee played a key role in mobilizing resources and coordinating the efforts of
many partners in launching disaster risk-awareness campaigns in Haiti. The Building
Norms Committee was successful in coordinating the development of new prescriptive
construction standards based on wind speed and seismic classification. This new ―code‖
proved to be extremely useful and very timely in the post-earthquake period and led to
the adoption of post-earthquake reconstruction guidelines.

76.     The project also developed, inter alia, a feasibility study for a national emergency
communication system and seismic resistant building norms and standards. However,
despite all the training activities and studies, the management, administrative and
technical capacity of DPC remains weak. The DPC was not elevated to a General
Directorate (which was outside of the control of the project) and does not have adequate
staffing. Its coordination capacity has improved, but is not yet at a satisfactory level. The
SPGRD continues to have a very low profile.

77.     Component 3 – Reducing the vulnerability of communities through risk
identification and risk mitigation activities. This objective has been fully achieved,
with 76 CCPCs established and functional, covering more than half of the 144
municipalities, and 130 small disaster mitigation works successfully implemented, based
on community-based disaster risk assessment.

78.      Although no formal survey was conducted at the end of the project, 17
committees were visited in five provinces, representing 22 percent of all committees
established and/or strengthened by the project activities. These field visits have
confirmed that: (i) all the committees interviewed have an emergency response plan and
have organized preventive evacuations of population during the past 3-4 years (ranging
from 50 to 500 families at a time); (ii) all the committees have reported to the provincial
level on the damages caused by disaster events; this occurred in a timely manner which
facilitated the delivery of humanitarian assistance; and, (iii) all the committees
interviewed have reported that, in one way or another, their vulnerability to flooding has
been reduced thanks to the small mitigation works. It should also be noted that many
committees played a crucial role in receiving and assisting displaced people from the
capital after the January 2010 earthquake, and have facilitated the delivery of
humanitarian assistance from the international community.

                                             18
79.     Without a proper baseline, it is of course difficult to measure the progress made in
preparing local communities to respond to disasters. Nevertheless, the review of several
disaster assessments and post-disaster humanitarian annual reports3 show a positive trend
in the role played by the CCPC in disaster preparedness and emergency response. This
trend was confirmed in our discussions with international partners. There is no scientific
evidence that the level of risk was reduced thanks to the small mitigation works, yet the
participatory planning and implementation of those works have increased the risk-
awareness level of the communities and strengthened the credibility of the CCPCs.

80.     The following chart summarizes the rating by components and adjusted for
financial weight of each component:

3.3 Efficiency

81.    At project close, at the end of December 2011, all activities had been completed,
and over its lifetime, the project disbursed close to 100%.

82.     No economic or financial analysis was carried out after project completion.
However, there are indications of positive economic efficiency with respect to mitigation
investments, with per capita investment by direct beneficiary about US$7.774 – relatively
low in light of the potential savings in loss of life and property.

83.      Local risk mitigation activities under Component 3 focused on activities with high
visibility and impact, utilizing local labor and materials when available to provide for the

quickest and most resilient economic and social recovery available within the financing
limitations of the project. They were selected through a participatory process, and on a
community-based disaster risk assessment, designed to ensure that the selected chosen
activities help reduce extensive losses caused by adverse natural events by maximizing
the number of beneficiaries and the value of the social and economic assets protected.
Moreover, community driven local risk management activities benefited from their
demand driven and community led nature, which permitted an efficient and effective
allocation of limited resources.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.     The project‘s overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. First the PDO
remained highly relevant throughout the entire life of the project. Second, the project
significantly contributed to expand the network of CCPCs and to reduce the vulnerability
of communities to flooding through the 130 small disaster mitigation works. It
strengthened the disaster response capacity by building and equipping 21 Emergency
Operation Centers and by testing the response capacity through simulation exercises.
Third, the project had positive economic efficiency with respect to mitigation investments,
with per capita investment by direct beneficiary relatively low in light of the potential
savings in loss of life and property.

85.     This ICR nevertheless, rates the project as Moderately Satisfactory, as the project
did not succeed in significantly strengthening the management, administrative and
technical capacity of DPC. This was in large part the result of insufficient budget and
staffing. In addition, shortcomings were identified in the planning and completion of the
rehabilitation works.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

86.     In terms of social development, the project broke new ground in creating a strong
and vivid network of civil protection committees and in strengthening social cohesion in
particularly exposed and vulnerable communities. The ICR mission visited one third of
the 76 committees established by the project and concluded that the CCPCs were the first
responders to disaster situations in their communities and had established themselves as
very strong community–based organizations.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

87.    The impact on the longer-term capacity of the DPC is expected to be limited and
although this indicator was dropped in the course of the project, no new legal framework
was approved during the life of the project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

88.    As indicated earlier, this project is the first significant disaster-mitigation
operation in Haiti and it created conditions to attract more donor interest and funding to
support the National Disaster Risk Management System. Shortly after the launch of
ERDMP, the EU and the IDB respectively approved the Local Risk Management Project
(Euro 6M) and the National Early Warning System Project ($US 7M). The UCP/DPC
offered ―physical‖ space to accommodate the project implementation units of the EU and
UNDP projects and therefore created the conditions for improved donor coordination and
alignment.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

89.    Key risks were identified and associated risk-mitigating measures were proposed in
the Technical Annex. The ICR rates the risk to development outcomes as high due to the
following:

90.     The sustainability of the CCPCs is of concern. Most importantly, the absence of a
legal status and an annual budget allocation from the GoH calls into question the ability
of the CCPCs to continue to provide emergency preparedness and response services at
the local level. Like the CCPCs, the members of the CCPCs do not have a legal status. As
volunteers, they are not entitled to benefits, insurance, or reimbursement for expenses. In
this context, it seems unlikely that all the CCPCs will remain active once the ongoing
DRM activities of development partners come to an end.

91.     There are also risks to the sustainability of the works created under the project.
These works are threatened by the shortcomings in the identification, design and
technical supervision of the works. In the context of high exposure and extreme
vulnerability to natural hazards, these works may not be able to withstand extreme
events.5

92.     Beyond the repeated emergencies that have taken place in Haiti over the course of
the project, the Bank's overall portfolio in Haiti has been and continues to be affected by
Haiti's overall institutional and governance fragility. Political instability as illustrated by
frequent changes in government and long periods of uncertainty between them, has not
been conducive to consistency in policy decision making. Although the Government
recognizes the importance of DRM and of reducing Haiti's vulnerability to disasters


5
  For example, the National DPC Office rehabilitated under the project was heavily damaged by the
January 2010 earthquake and a bridge built in the South East Department was destroyed by an outburst of
the river.

                                                  21
through prevention, preparation and the building of resilience, the decisions needed to
institutionalize a response to these concerns were not taken by Government during the
life of the project. These included the development of a legal framework for the National
Disaster Risk Management System and the proper provision of authority, resources and
staffing to the DPC, by elevating it to a General Directorate.

93.      The continued lack of financial sustainability and the weak institutional capacity
of the DPC could jeopardize the outcomes of the project, should donor financing or
support be interrupted. Similar patterns were observed in other projects in the portfolio
over the same time frame. An review of possible capacity building approaches in the
Haitian Context is also being undertaken in collaboration with the Global Expert Team
on Fragile States and will utilize worldwide lessons and discussions with the Government
of Haiti to help improve the effectiveness of WB capacity strengthening efforts in the
country. It should be underlined that a new DRM operation focused on building a
constituency for DRM among stakeholders and aimed at further strengthening
institutional capacity is ongoing. This operation builds on the project evaluated under this
ICR.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

94.      The project was prepared in the aftermath of a political conflict and two major
flood events. As previously discussed in Section 1.1, the project was fully aligned with
priorities highlighted in the ICF and the Bank‘s TSS. The focus and scope of the project
built on close consultations with the GoH and other donors active in Haiti. As the first
IDA project following the arrears clearance, the preparation of the project could not draw
on lessons from recent operations in the country. In addition, best global practices in
DRM were not yet available to guide the project design.

95.     The team achieved two important outcomes in preparing the project. First, the
team was able to take advantage of the window of opportunity presented by the post-
disaster situation to build a constituency for DRM and introduce the first Bank DRM
project in Haiti. Second, the team‘s design managed to move beyond first generation
design for emergency projects which focused mostly on reconstruction and rehabilitation,
to include, interventions aimed at strengthening community engagement and capacity to
be prepared for and respond to disasters.

96.     The project exhibited high relevance to the needs of the country and provided
tools to respond to the immediate and long term vulnerability of Haitians. A deeper
analysis of the fragile institutional context and low capacity in Haiti could have helped in
better assessing political, capacity and implementation risks at the level of project design.

                                             22
However, it is unlikely that mitigation measures could have been implemented to address
these very large challenges in Haiti‘s development landscape. It was foreseen that an
operational M&E framework to guide project implementation be developed in early
implementation.

97.     What the project lacked in prior analysis, was offset by the speed of preparation
which enabled the Bank to truly respond to the country‘s needs. In light of the fact that
this was the first IDA project prepared since 1997, that it was processed on a fast-track
basis in four months to respond to the existing emergency and that there were no
requirements at the time for emergency operations to include an M&E framework,
project design was satisfactory.

98.     Based onthe above, Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated
satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.     The Bank undertook regular supervision missions during project
implementation―on average two missions a year until task management moved from
headquarters to the field for the latter part of the project. The close supervision and day-
to-day support by the field-based team allowed for effective implementation and
disbursement. Bottlenecks and challenges were flagged and addressed in a timely
manner. For example, the project team provided training in Bank procedures which, in
turn, proved instrumental for building the necessary capacity to implement the project.

100. Over time, the project benefited from the second highest disbursement rates
among investment operations in Haiti and adequate fiduciary and procurement
performance. It is important to note that the project task team leader (TTL) was changed
three times during the project life cycle. However, this did not adversely affect the
project‘s supervision efficiency or implementation. The first TTL remained involved as
the Regional Coordinator for DRM in LCR and the third TTL had already been part of
the team since 2005.

101. However, there was also a significant weakness in supervision. Although OP/BP
8.50 did not require a results and M&E framework to be put in place at the time of
preparation, there was ample time during implementation to set PDO outcome indicators,
a baseline and targets to monitor outcomes. However, the project team did not put in
place an appropriate M&E structure during implementation making it difficult to measure
progress and outcomes.

102. In addition, the Bank‘s supervision activities were significantly disrupted by the
2010 earthquake that killed an estimated 220,000 and displaced over 1.5 million. The
event caused the Bank team to shift from typical project supervision to a broad
engagement to support recovery and rehabilitation efforts by providing important
technical and institutional support to the weakened GoH. The implementation team
                                            23
showed strong flexibility in supporting recovery and rehabilitation efforts but supervision
of the project and its long term goals was affected by the emergency In addition to the
personal loss of friends and colleagues and an acute humanitarian crisis throughout the
country, the Bank‘s office was destroyed and a new location was not found until March
21, 2010 – 10 weeks after the event. These exceptional circumstances made monitoring
and supervision of the project logistically challenging. As a result, the team focused
primarely on ensuring that project implementation continued as well as possible in light
of the intense pressure on the project team in the aftermath of the earthquake.

103.   Based on the above, Bank supervision is assessed as moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

104. The overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory, taking into
account the above ratings on Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision, balanced by a
moderately satisfactory Project Outcome rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

105. The GoH, specifically the Ministry of Interior and Territorial Collectivities,
showed passive interest in the project. During the design phase, the project team in
discussion with the client identified that the evolution of the DPC to that of a Directorate
General (with budgetary and planning autonomy) would prove critical to the success of
the project, specifically as it pertained to the institutional strengthening and capacity
building initiatives. For largely political reasons, the GoH chose not to pursue this course,
instead maintain the DPC at the level of Directorate. In doing so, the DPC was not able to
exert control over its programming, budget or strategic direction.

106. Further contributing to the Moderately Unsatisfactory rating was the failure of the
GoH to implement the recommendations of the Institutional Analysis of the DPC that
called for specific courses of action in the short, medium and long-term. The Institutional
Analysis was a comprehensive analytical piece that received the endorsement of the DPC
and its technical and financial partners. As a result of the GoH decision not to implement
the recommendations of the Institutional Analysis, the system did not benefit from a
complete and qualified cadre of technical and administrative civil servants to effectively
fulfill the DPC‘s mandate.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory


                                             24
107. The DPC was given the overall responsibility for the implementation of the
project, through an implementing unit (UCP/DPC – Unité de Coordination de Projet).
However, the agency shared the day-to-day implementation with the BMPAD. Overall,
the Implementing Agencies performance is rated as satisfactory. They were able to
implement the project in a very challenging environment, delivering the majority of the
expected outputs, with a disbursement rate of almost 100 percent.

108. Recognizing that the DPC had limited knowledge of Bank procedures and
guidelines, the UCP ensured that the DPC‘s capacity was strengthened to the level
needed for efficient implementation of the project. As a result, the DPC was able to
display strong ownership of and commitment to the project. The UCP/DPC capacity was
put under heavy pressure after the 2008 hurricanes and the 2010 earthquake, which
caused an unprecedented level of damage. Nonetheless, the UCP/DPC was able to
respond to increasing demands and went beyond expectations in supporting the
leadership of DPC.

109. The BMPAD was responsible for components 1 and 3. Since both component 1
and 3 entailed the rehabilitation and construction of works, close technical supervision
was required during the entire project cycle - from identification to implementation. Field
visits suggest that the project could have benefitted from closer supervision from
qualified structural/civil engineers. As an agency of the Ministry of Finance, the BMPAD
had limited expertise to ensure that the works would be hazard-resistant.

110. The BMPAD was also responsible for the supervision of the four NGOs
contracted to implement risk mitigation activities for local communities under
component 3. The mid-term review found that the presence of the NGOs in the field and
their knowledge of the local communities contributed to the development of more
participatory approaches to disaster response and preparedness. That said, given the wide
geographical scope and the involvement of four different NGOs, better M&E could have
ensured a more coherent and harmonized implementation of the activities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

111. The two Implementing Agencies have performed satisfactory, in a very
challenging environment, marked by several disaster events and political instability.
However, considering that the Government‘s performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory, the overall borrower‘s performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

112. Building on the project experience, three types of lessons can be identified:
general, project specific and strategic.




                                            25
Strategic

113. Although the high risk of natural disasters requires a continued high level of
preparedness, it is important to develop effective long-term preventive measures. It
has been noted that there is a strong focus on public awareness and
preparedness/response. While it is important to give immediate attention to the short-term
risks, there is a need for more investment in long-term disaster prevention and mitigation.
In this context, the country needs a legal DRM framework and a commitment of the
government to dedicate resources to reduce vulnerability and risks in the long term.

General

114. Early establishment of a baseline is important to measure progress and
impact. The baseline and outcome indicators of this project were not well defined. While
the results framework suggests there were no committees at appraisal, the technical annex
mentions that about 50 committees existed in one form or another in the 133 communes.
Interviews with the local committees confirm that in some cases there was already a
committee in place, although a solid structure was still lacking.

115. Measurement of impact related to institutional strengthening and the
reduction of vulnerability is a challenge. The objectives, indicators and outcomes of
this project made the quantitative measurement of the impact complicated. Similar
projects would benefit from a well-prepared results framework with realistic and
measurable indicators.

116. Collaborative partnerships are essential for sustainability of the project. It
has been observed that the project has created the conditions on which other development
partners could build. A common approach and continued dialogue have helped to avoid
duplication as well as a disconnect between partners‘ interventions. Moreover,
coordination has facilitated early identification of problems and capitalization on lessons
learned.

Project Specific

117. Effective strategic communication is critical to promote achievements. The
committees established under this project have achieved a plethora of successes (i.e.
limiting loss of life through the dissemination of early warnings and preventative
evacuations during various hurricanes as well as the quick response to the 2010
earthquake and cholera epidemic), but this has not been widely disseminated to the
general public. Projects of similar nature need to ensure there is a communications
strategy in place and resources available to ensure that local committees gain visibility.
This will bolster the credibility and legitimacy of the committees as key actors in the
country‘s disaster risk-management system.

118. Improved information management is important to ensure consolidation of
gains. While the committees have been involved in a wide variety of activities, ranging

                                            26
from preparation to immediate relief, it has been a great challenge to systematically
collect and archive information on their activities. This has complicated the flow of
information from local to the departmental/central level. In order to facilitate better
coordination and planning, it will be essential to enhance information management at the
local level.

119. There is a strong need to move towards a more integrated approach. The
project has followed the Community Driven Development (CDD) approach to implement
small-scale risk-reduction works on the local level. While these works have provided
credibility to the committees, the lack of coordinated planning and maintenance remains
a concern for the sustainability of the works. Furthermore, it is important to note that
long-term risk reduction cannot be achieved through exclusive attention to structural
mitigation. Rather, complementary efforts―structural and non-structural mitigation
measures―are needed to ensure risks are reduced. To this end, it is critical to explore a
more integrated approach.

120. An implementing agency with relevant technical expertise is essential. In
addition to the issue of lack of maintenance of the rehabilitation and small-scale risk-
reduction works, there have been cases where infrastructure has not been completed
(either contracts have already been closed or the expected resources of the State never
materialized). In this context, it has become apparent that PL-480/BMPAD did not
always have the expertise to ensure adequate supervision of the design and
implementation of the works. The Ministry of Public Works may have been a better
counterpart.

121. Strong ownership and leadership of the municipal government as well as the
inclusion of civil society is critical for successful performance of local committees. It
has been observed that the committees which include members from civil society are the
highest performing and most dynamic committees. Moreover, strong leadership by
municipal governments has proved to be even more essential. In the communes where the
mayor feels a strong sense of ownership of the committee, committees have been
engaged in a higher number and wider variety of activities. Over time, these projects have
also been able to actively engage with other development actors.

122. A large pool of trainers will help ensure the effectiveness of the committees. It
has become apparent that in some communes the implementing NGOs faced difficulties
meeting the need of the committees to strengthen their capacity through training,
particularly those which were developing at a fast pace. One of the reasons was the lack
of certified trainers.

123. Risk maps need to be considered as tools, not products. It has become clear
that the committees do not use the risk maps as a tool. In order to prevent the maps being
considered simply as products, it is important to provide follow-up training and include
these maps in simulation exercises. Moreover, risk maps can become more relevant when
not only the community‘s understanding of the risks is visualized, but scientific analysis



                                           27
has been applied as well. Moving forward, it is also important to ensure the maps are
digitalized.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

124. The ICR report was shared and discussed with the UCP/DPC (Direction de la
Protection Civile) who accepts the rating of moderately satisfactory for the outcome and
agrees with the finding of the ICR. However, UCP/DPC pointed out that the Project
managed to achieve much beyond the original objectives, including essential support to
the GoH in the immediate aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Unfortunately, the PDO was
not modified during the implementation of the Project to capture the additional support
which would have allowed a better rating,

125. The GoH also agrees that lack of reforms needed to elevate the institutional status
of the DPC had a negative impact on the implementation of the Project. The GoH will
reevaluate the needs of the DPC and address the staffing issue.

126. The lessons learned identified in the draft ICR report are endorsed by UCP/DPC
who is already taking follow-up actions to apply those in the new Disaster Risk
Management and Reconstruction Project.

             Unoffical Translation of Borrower’s Comments on Draft ICR

While the GoH accepts the rating of moderately satisfactory for the outcome, it is
important to point out that the Project managed to achieve much beyond the original
objectives. This includes essential support to the GoH in the immediate aftermath of the
2010 earthquake. As such, the GoH believes that the objectives should have been
modified during the implementation of the Project to capture the additional support. This
would have allowed the outcomes to be rated as satisfactory.

The draft ICR mentions the lack of an integrated approach and (indirectly) the limited
impact of the rehabilitation works. While the GoH does not disagree with these
observations, it needs to be emphasized that it was the decision of the World Bank to
limit the maximum amount available for the rehabilitation works to US$200K. This
decision did not allow the Project to replicate the integrated approach used in Fond
Verrettes, which is highlighted as a success in the draft ICR.

The draft ICR mentions the GoH only showed a passive interest in the Project,
particularly in supporting the reforms needed to elevate the institutional status of the DPC.
In this context, we note that the Project did not come with any conditions related to this
matter. That said, we understand that the lack of qualified staff had a negative impact on
the implementation of the Project. The GoH will reevaluate the needs of the DPC and
address the staffing issue.

The GoH greatly appreciates the lessons learned identified in the draft ICR. These need
to be applied in the new Project – the Disaster Risk Management and Reconstruction
Project. Particularly, the establishment of baselines and the use of an integrated approach
are critical.

                         Rapport de fin de projet
                                  RESUME EXECUTIF

Le Projet d‘Urgence et de Gestion des Risques et Désastres (PUGRD), a été préparé suite
à la saison cyclonique 2004 particulièrement catastrophique, tuant plus de 4,000
personnes et affectant une population de prêt de 300,000 personnes dans les départements
du Sud, Ouest, Nord et Artibonite. Ces événements ont mis en évidence le niveau élevé
de vulnérabilité du pays en étroite relation avec la précarité des conditions socio-
économiques, la faiblesse des infrastructures, la dégradation accrue de l‘environnement,
et des problèmes de gouvernance.
Les Objectifs de Développement du Projet sont :
       -   Aider à la réhabilitation des zones affectées par les récentes catastrophes
           naturelles;
       -   Renforcer les capacités en vue de la gestion des risques et de l‘amélioration
           des interventions en cas de catastrophe naturelle;
       -   Réduire la vulnérabilité des communautés au moyen des activités de réduction
           et d‘atténuation des risques.
Le Projet est organisé autour de trois composantes. La composante 1 (phase 1 : US$2.5
millions – Phase 2 : US$ 3.5 millions) concerne la réhabilitation des régions touchées par
les catastrophes naturelles de 2004 et 2005 puis de désastres plus récents tout au long de
son évolution ; la composante 2 (US$3.5 millions) vise un appui au renforcement de la
DPC et du SPGRD ; et la composante 3 (phase 1 : US$5.5 millions – Phase 2 : US$3.5
millions) est focalisée sur la gestion locale des risques.
La mise en œuvre de ce projet a été assurée par la Direction de la Protection Civile à
travers son UCP et le Bureau de Gestion Pl-480/Titre III qui sera à partir de décembre
2007 dénommé Bureau de monétisation pour les programmes d‘aides au développement
jouant le rôle de Maître d‘Ouvrage Délégué pour les composantes 1 et 3.
Le Projet d‘Urgence et de Gestion des Risques et des Désastres débuta effectivement en
juin 2005 et devait se terminer dans sa version originelle en Juin 2008. Le montant de
l‘Accord de Don était alors d‘US$12 million. Suite aux dégâts enregistrées lors du
passage de la tempête tropicale Noël en 2007, un don additionnel à l‘Etat Haïtien de
                                           49
US$ 7,4 million a porté à US$19,4 million l‘enveloppe totale du Projet. La date de
finalisation a été alors fixée au 31 décembre 2010. Les désastres enregistrés en 2008 et
2010 notamment ont retardée la réalisation des activités du projet. La date de finalisation
a été reportée, sans apport de fonds additionnels, au 31 juillet 2011 puis au 31 décembre
de la même année.
Le rapport final présente les principaux résultats obtenus ainsi que les leçons apprises
durant sa mise en œuvre et des recommandations pouvant contribuer à améliorer
l‘approche des projets et programmes du système national de gestion des risques et des
désastres dans le futur.


Les principales réalisations se présentent ainsi :
      Vingt-deux sous-projets exécutés dans le cadre de la composante et couvrant
       différents types : mitigation (54%), réhabilitation (27%) et aménagement
       d‘infrastructures d‘appui à la gestion de crise - Abris provisoires (18%). Par
       ailleurs, les départements de la Grande Anse et des Nippes ont été les principaux
       bénéficiaires avec un peu plus de 50% de ces sous-projets. La commune de
       Fonds-Verrettes a pour sa part bénéficié d‘une allocation de plus d‘un million de
       dollars pour des interventions variées mais poursuivant un but unique.
      Appui apporté par le Projet, à travers sa composante 2, à la DPC et au SNGRD.
       Ceci a concerné principallement (liste non exhaustive):
          Les travaux d‘aménagement de l‘Ancien local de l‘OPDES qui jusqu‘au
           séisme du 12 janvier a servi de bureau de coordination des Projets d‘appui au
           SNGRD et d‘espace de travail pour la DPC (réunion, formation…) ;
          L‘analyse institutionnelle de la DPC et du SPGRD ;
          La création ou réactivation de trois (3) comités thématiques ;
          La réalisation d‘études techniques : Communication d‘urgence, Normes et
           Code de construction ;
          La mise à niveau du Plan National d‘Intervention ;
          La réalisation d‘exercices de simulation nationale et le développement d‘un
           Manuel National de référence pour les exercices de simulation ;
          Le Dotation de véhicules à la DPC, au niveau national et départemental
          L‘aménagement et équipements des COU (1 départemental et 18 communaux
           – en plus de l‘appui en terme de réhabilitation à 1 COU),
          La formation de deux Equipes départementales d‘intervention rapide ;
          Les appuis directs et ponctuels sous forme d‘assistance technique aux activités
           de la DPC, notamment dans la gestion des urgences.




                                              50
   Dans le cadre du renforcement de la gestion locale du risque (composante 3), 76
    comités communaux de protection (CCPC) créés ou réactivés, 76 cartes de risque
    communautaires ont été élaborées et 130 petits projets de mitigation ont été
    exécutés.


Le projet tout au long de son existence a du faire face à différentes contraintes.
Certaines activités prévues dans le document initial et qui ne pouvaient pas être
réalisées ont dû être abandonnées et les fonds réalloués. Au titre de ces contraintes,
mentionnons :
   L‘impact négatif des nombreux désastres qui sont survenu successivement en
    2007 (Cyclone Dean, Pluies d‘octobre et tempête tropicale Noël), en 2008 (TT
    Fay et Hanna et cyclone Gustave et Ike) et le séisme du 12 janvier 2010 ;
   Les différents soubresauts au niveau politique qui ont contribué à retarder le
    déroulement des activités en particulier au niveau central ;
   L‘élection des nouveaux Maires et l‘intégration difficile dans bon nombre de cas
    de ces derniers en tant que Coordonateur du CCPC ;
   Les lacunes du système en ce qui concerne la validation des CCPC et la
    légalisation de ces entités ;
   Le manque de capacité des CDGRD dans l‘encadrement des CCPC ;
   Une dernière contrainte reste l‘insuffisance de vis-à-vis à la DPC pour le transfert
    de connaissance.


L‘absence d‘une ligne de base au démarrage des activités du Projet et par voie de
conséquence d‘indicateurs spécifiques a représenté une contrainte au suivi du projet
et l‘évaluation de son impact. Néanmoins, l‘analyse à postériori montre un apport
substantiel du Projet dans le renforcement du Système National de Gestion des
Risques et des Désastres et la réduction de la vulnérabilité des communautés
desservies par le Projet.
Le renforcement de l‘institutionnalisation de la Protection Civile à travers la
couverture complète des 76 communes des cinq départements du Projet aura permis
une extension à plus de 60% du réseau des CCPC. L‘engagement de ces CCPC dans
la diffusion de l‘alerte, l‘évacuation des populations et l‘information de la population
en générale contribue grandement à une meilleure gestion des urgences et a une
réduction significative du nombre de morts en cas de désastres.
Le projet aura également contribué à réduire les risques d‘inondations dans plusieurs
des communes desservies à partir des travaux de mitigation structurelle réalisés au
niveau de ces communes dans le cadre de la composante 1 et des Petits projets de
mitigation de la composante 3. Signalons, en outre, que cette capacité à identifier et à
conduire ce type de projets développée par les CCPC dans le cadre du Projet est
actuellement mis à contribution dans le cadre d‘activités similaires avec d‘autres
partenaires.

                                        51
La pérennisation de ces comités de protection civile reste actuellement une priorité.
Des considérations seraient ainsi nécessaires en ce qui concerne la composition de ces
CCPC (Cadres étatiques souvent absents vs membres de la société civile très actifs),
l‘intégration des nouveaux acteurs (brigadiers du PER-SNGRD/UE), la
reconnaissance officielle et l‘octroi de moyens financiers à ces entités.
