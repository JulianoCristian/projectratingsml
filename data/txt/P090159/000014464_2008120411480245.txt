time, the Association shall have notified the Recipient of its intention to suspend in whole 
or in part the right of the Recipient to make withdrawals from the Grant Account 
pursuant to Section 6.02 of the General Conditions.  Upon such notification, the

Special Accounts may be made and what procedures should be followed for making such 
deposits, and shall notify the Recipient of its determination.

any of the Special Accounts shall be made until the Recipient has provided such evidence 
or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
