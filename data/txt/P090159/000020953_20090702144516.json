Satisfactory planning and completion\n            of a rehabilitation scheme for affected settlements are key\n            outcome indicators; 2) to strengthen the country's\n            capacity to manage natural disaster risks and better respond\n            to emergencies resulting from adverse natural events. The\n            key outcomes for the capacity established within the DPC\n            includes: (i) a validated legal framework;(ii) stronger\n            management systems; (iii) improved technical capacity; and\n            (iv) an operational, validated National Response Plan; 3) to\n            reduce the vulnerability of communities through risk\n            identification and mapping, and risk mitigation activities\n            at the local level.. The potential negative environmental\n            impacts overall under the Project can be: a) The survival\n            strategies and the environment in rural Haiti are often\n            complex, unpredictable and fragile; b) Some alternative\n            lifestyles and better marketing of agricultural products\n            (including livestock), resulting in improved well-being,\n            could lead to greater demand on natural resources or\n            environmental degradation; c) The introduction of investment\n            in targeted areas may attract immigrants which would\n            increase the pressure on existing resources and could lead\n            to conflicts within the population; d) The introduction of\n            alien plant species could affect the evolution of the\n            biodiversity of the country; e) Deterioration of the\n            landscape or movement of land through drainage works, soil\n            conservation and road; and f) The procurement of materials\n            for construction projects may affect the state of natural\n            resources in certain areas."}, "docdt": "2008-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
