These\n            objectives are consistent with one of the focal points of\n            the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) that outlines\n            IDA'S strategy for Haiti over the next 24 months (FY05\n            and FY06). The TSS explicitly incorporates the activities\n            already submitted to the LICUS Trust Fund, including the\n            proposed disaster reconstruction and mitigation initiatives.\n            The TSS, being presented to the Board together with this\n            proposed operation, also includes in the lending program the\n            proposed Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project\n            for US$12 million equivalent. The objectives are also\n            consistent with the overall priorities on environmental\n            management within the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF).\n            The longer term objectives of the Environment Thematic\n            Group, in which IDA is an active participant, include the\n            development of sustainable strategies to reverse resource\n            degradation by introducing sustainable watershed management,\n            reforestation and measures to reduce the impact of climatic hazards."}, "docdt": "2004-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
