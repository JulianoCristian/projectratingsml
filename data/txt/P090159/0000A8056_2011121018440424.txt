                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In response to concerns raised by the project team during the last supervision mission (September 2011), a follow up Financial Management supervision mission was organized in
                         October 2011. The purpose of the mission was to (i) assess the financial management and internal controls of the project; (ii) assess the financial performance of the project; (iii) to
                         make recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the internal control system and to increase the financial performance of the project; and (iv) to review the status of the
                         implementation of the recommendations of the FY10 Audit Report.

                         Based on the results of the FM supervision mission, it was agreed that the overall financial management of the project would be rated as moderately satisfactory. The Recipient has
                         agreed to develop and implement an action plan to address the mission's recommendations..
