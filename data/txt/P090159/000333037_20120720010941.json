as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the baseline and outcome indicators of this project were not\n            well defined. While the results framework suggests there\n            were no committees at appraisal, the technical annex\n            mentions that about 50 committees existed in one form or\n            another in the 133 communes. Interviews with the local\n            committees confirm that in some cases there was already a\n            committee in place, although a solid structure was still\n            lacking. The objectives, indicators and outcomes of this\n            project made the quantitative measurement of the impact\n            complicated. Similar projects will benefit from a\n            well-prepared results framework with realistic and\n            measurable indicators. It has been observed that the\n            committees which include members from civil society are the\n            highest performing and most dynamic committees. Moreover,\n            strong leadership by municipal governments has proved to be\n            even more essential. In the communes where the mayor feels a\n            strong sense of ownership of the committee, committees have\n            been engaged in a higher number and wider variety of\n            activities. Over time, these projects have also been able to\n            actively engage with other development actors."}, "docdt": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
