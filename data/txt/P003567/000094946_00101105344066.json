Overall World Bank\n            performance during project preparation and supervision was\n            satisfactory. Likewise, Borrower performance was considered\n            satisfactory overall in that despite the implementation\n            difficulties and issues during the early phase, the project\n            succeeded in achieving its objectives. The following lessons\n            proved valuable: Strong ownership and active participation\n            of local stakeholders assures the success of the project. A\n            strong central implementing agency characterized by\n            dedicated and decisive leadership is needed to guide and\n            coordinate provincial implementation and ensure timely\n            execution of project activities. A clearly articulated\n            communication should also be in place to ensure an effective\n            two-way information flow, from and to the center, the\n            province, and the project institutions. Institutional\n            capacity to manage a large and complex project should be\n            assessed at appraisal. Action plans for the first year\n            should be one of the requirements for negotiations. Agencies\n            should receive adequate training and guidance and be\n            familiar with operational procedures and principles\n            including project management, disbursement, monitoring and\n            evaluation, and project reporting. Other areas needing\n            priority attention are procurement planning, monitoring and\n            evaluation, supporting a commitment to research, and using\n            well-designed and implemented innovations to impact\n            education policymaking."}, "docdt": "2000-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
