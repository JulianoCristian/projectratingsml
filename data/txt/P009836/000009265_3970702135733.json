Project\n            will increase the domestic availability of polymers\n            (petrochemicals used in the manufacture of final plastic\n            products) in order to help satisfy the large growth in\n            demand for plastic products expected in India. It forms an\n            integral part of the Government's plans for optimal\n            utilization of India's natural gas resources. The\n            project provides for the establishment of a gas-based\n            petrochemical manufacturing facility near Bombay. The\n            facility will consist of process plants for ethylene and\n            polymer production. It will also include facilities for\n            power generation, water supply, feedstock supply, road and\n            rail transport, fire and security systems, and an employee\n            township. The project will also provide US$90 million to GOI\n            to help finance the import of polymers needed to develop the\n            market in India prior to plant commissioning."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
