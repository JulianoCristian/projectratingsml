Environmental impacts are likely to involve soil\n            erosion, and loss of flora, and fauna at borrow pits; soil,\n            and water pollution at construction sites; and, degradation\n            due to improper latrines, and water points site selection.\n            It is proposed that the position of an Environmental Desk\n            Officer be created in participating states, to asses, and\n            build environmental capacity, while communities will be\n            responsible for the environmental screening of schools'\n            rehabilitation, through the use of screening lists; guidance\n            on environmental categories; use of environmental\n            guidelines, and checklists to identify, and prepare\n            mitigation measures; and, procedures for rehabilitation\n            proposals requiring environmental assessment. Mitigation\n            measures are as follows. Appropriate sanitation technology\n            will be selected for the provision, and maintenance of\n            latrines, as well as for the location of water points, while\n            water quality testing will be conducted by the State\n            Ministry of Works and Housing. Daily cleaning, and control\n            at construction sites will be enforced, including provision\n            of adequate waste disposal services, which includes disposal\n            of chemicals, and hazardous materials at specific sites,\n            dust control, and regular drainage clean-up. Re-vegetation\n            practices, and physical stabilization should contain soil\n            degradation, while aquifer studies will be conducted to\n            prevent water contamination, wildlife disturbance, and loss\n            of vegetation."}, "docdt": "2002-07-22T00:00:00Z"}
