However, some subprojects may\n            require land acquisition and resettlement activities,\n            leading to loss of productive assets, and production, thus\n            requiring compensation. In accordance with the\n            country's legal framework, and the Bank's\n            operational directive on involuntary resettlement, this\n            resettlement policy framework provides the measures to\n            minimize adverse impacts as follows. Project affected people\n            (PAP) will be eligible for compensation due to: a) loss of\n            agricultural land, through the provision of land-for-land\n            compensation of equal productive capacity; however, if PAP\n            so wishes, cash compensation at full replacement cost will\n            be available, provided the portion of land lost represents\n            20 percent or less of the total area of landholding. Loss of\n            standing crops, including labor invested in planted crops,\n            and fruit or industrial trees, will be compensated at market\n            prices. Land temporarily lost due to construction works,\n            will be compensated for income losses, standing crops, and\n            for the cost of soil restoration, and damaged\n            infrastructure; b) residential land, and structures will be\n            compensated at replacement costs of equivalent size, and,\n            cash compensation will reflect the full replacement cost of\n            structures without depreciation. Land/structures partially\n            affected, where remaining residential land will not be\n            sufficient for rebuilding, compensation will be at full\n            replacement cost without depreciation. Tenants will be\n            compensated with a six month rental fee cash grant, at\n            prevailing market rates, assisted with alternative\n            accommodations; c) Business losses will be compensated\n            through alternative business sites, or cash compensations\n            for lost business structures, and income losses during the\n            transition period."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
