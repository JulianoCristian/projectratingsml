Government of Nigeria implement a program\n            to achieve universal basic education (UBE), by increasing\n            the capacity of states, and local governments to manage, and\n            implement it effectively. During project preparation, each\n            state would have prepared an overall UBE plan for the next\n            five years, based on data analysis, and existing conditions,\n            developing an implementation strategy. Under the first\n            component, Bank assistance will be requested for: 1)\n            institutional strengthening, including support for the\n            Education Management Information System (EMIS) development;\n            2) increasing the quality of schools, which includes\n            upgrading of physical infrastructure, teacher training, and\n            learning materials; and, 3) increasing access to education,\n            specially through incentives, and strengthening of community\n            schools. The second component will focus on financing\n            activities at the Federal level, namely the effective\n            implementation of the UBE program, which requires\n            considerable strengthening of the capacity of key federal\n            institutions, responsible of policy development, and\n            training of education planners, managers, and policy makers\n            at all levels of the educational system. Capacity\n            development activities include the areas of interaction\n            between HIV/AIDS and education; institutional strengthening\n            of the National Institute for Education Planning;\n            collection, and analysis of education statistics; and,\n            reform of the Inspectorate, among others."}, "docdt": "2002-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
