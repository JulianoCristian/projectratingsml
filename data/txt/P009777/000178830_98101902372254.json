Training and Visit\n            System of extension, which is based on frequent in-service\n            training of extension workers and regular, scheduled visits\n            by extension workers to farmers' fields. The T&V\n            System has already been introduced in 15 of the State's\n            districts under an earlier IDA-supported project. The\n            project faces no special risks, although realization of the\n            expected benefits will depend heavily on the State\n            Government's ability to effectively manage the\n            reorganized extension system, maintaining a single line of\n            command from extension headquarters to the field-level workers."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
