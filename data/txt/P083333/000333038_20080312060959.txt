2 - THE EMERGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL MULTISECTOR PROJECT
     (EMRP)

2.1 - EMRP'S OBJECTIVES

EMRP's main objective is to help lay the foundations for the long-term reconstruction of the State
Administration of the Angolan Republic, following the next specific aims:

      a) Increase the agricultural income and food security in the provinces most affected by the
         conflicts;

      b) Improve the access to education and essential healthcare in the provinces most affected by
         the conflicts;

      c) Repair and rehabilitate critical infrastructures;

      d) Strengthen the institutional power at all levels to formulate, prepare, establish and manage
         the development of programmes in both medium and long term periods.

The EMRP aims to aid the regeneration of the transport network and improvement of the conditions
of the public services. It is intended to prevent the deterioration of health and the loss of life through
healthcare and other basic services by rehabilitating the services of water supply and improving
public health in cities. It will also help reduce poverty in both rural and urban areas by encouraging
agricultural production and reducing time and costs associated with food transportation from
producers to the market.

EMRP will assist Angola in achieving legal and regulation improvements as well as more efficient
institutions for a better govern. Lastly, it will lay the foundations of mid and long term institutional
and political reforms needed in Angola.

3 - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR THE REPUBLIC OF
     ANGOLA AND PROVINCES ENVOLVED IN EMPR

3.1 - INTRODUCTION

This chapter is intended to provide a description of the environmental picture, considering its
biophysical component, air quality and social, economic and cultural aspects of the Republic of
Angola and provinces of EMPR sub-projects.

Factors that may, directly or indirectly, be affected by EMRP will be subject to a more detailed
study.

3.2 - GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION

Angola is situated along the western coast of Africa, between equator and the tropic of Capricorn,
being bordered by the Republic of Congo (Brazaville) and Congo (Kinshasa) in the North, by
Zambia in the East, by Namibia in the South and by the Atlantic Ocean in the West (Figure 3.1).

We can find the province of Cabinda in the north banks of Zaire, in a region separated from this
river by a strip of Congolese territory (Kinshasa).

The total area of Angola is 1,246,700 km2, which represents 4% of Africa and about half of Western
Europe. The land boundaries measure up to 4,837 km and the sea boundary is 1,650 km long.

3.3 - CLIMATE

The Angolan climate is influenced by several parameters such as latitude, longitude, orography,
closeness to the ocean and the cold sea stream of Benguela.

Considering the cumulative effect of these parameters, the climate in the northern coast is wet and
warm and, heading south, tropical coastal with high air humidity. Going inland, the distance to the
sea and altitude bring increased precipitation and lower temperatures.

In general, all Angolan territory experiences two seasons: a fresh dry season, from July to the end of
September, and a hot rainy season, from October to March.

The annual average temperatures are higher in the North and they become lower as we approach the
southern and inland regions. The highest average annual temperature varies from 25º C to 27º C (in
Congo basin region) and the lowest varies from 15º C to 20º C (in the plateau along the Namibe
desert).

The main pressure centres that influence the climate in Angola are: the almost permanent
subtropical anticyclone of the Atlantic Ocean, the African continent's anticyclone and the equatorial
depressionary valley.

From September to January, it is clear that the equatorial depressionary valley moves South and,
from January to May it moves North, dragging the unstable equatorial air, with strong convergence
to lower levels, to Angola. It can be said that precipitation is also influenced by local factors, like
the Huíla and the Huambo plateaus, in which case orographic features are stronger than general
conditions.

Between May and August climate suffers a stronger influence from the African continent's
anticyclone, which transports the dry and stable continental air, with temperature inversions in
lower layers, over Angolan territory.

In Angola's coastal areas, the South Atlantic anticyclone is more intense, bringing the remaining
tropical air to these regions during the dry season. Although it is weakened, this effect also takes
place during the rainy season causing irregular precipitation.

The west average components reach a long vertical extension (over 6 km) in December, January
and February and an intensity maximum in February, according to some published data on dynamic
climatology in meridional Africa, with reference to stations in Luanda, Lobito, Malange and
Huambo. During this period, inland regions experience heavy rains and in coastal areas west of
16º E precipitation is rare, originating long droughts.

The heavy rains in coastal areas that occur between March and April are originated by the eastern
flux, which brings the remaining equatorial air from the plateau to coastal areas.

3.4 - OROGRAPHY

The orography of Angola shows a set of peculiar and perfectly defined features, determining four
different zones:

      · the littoral strip, a lowland, with altitudes between 0 and 400 meters, that narrows gently
        from North to South until near parallel 13º, to enlarge again;

      · the sub high plain zone, between 400 and 1,000 meters, which develops along the
        preceding one, but that in the North turns inland, occupying a great part of Zaire basin in
        Angolan territory, also very narrow between parallels 10º and 13º;

      · the first high plain zone, which occupies the majority of the territory with a gentle slope
        from the centre of Angola towards South, East and Northeast;

18307md_ing_a.doc                                                                                           17/145

                      Environmental and Social Management Process Report
                      Volume 2 ­ Environmental and Social Diagnosis and Institutional and Legal Framework




      · the second high plain zone, the real heart of the territory although occupying the western
        half of it, with altitudes about 1,500 meters, in which the peaks of certain mountains reach
        2,600 meters.

The hydrographical network is a direct result of the previously mentioned landforms. All great
Angolan rivers, such as the Cuanza, the Cunene and the Cubango, emerge from the second high
plain zone, which can be called the great hydrographical centre.

All western strip from Zaire to Cunene is a drainage zone at the final stretch of the rivers that, being
born in the high plains, run parallel to each other from East to West towards the ocean, with high
slope stretches, including rapids and waterfalls, before they reach the coast.

So, the Angolan terrain can be divided, according to the type of development, the specific
characteristics of geological, structure and neo-tectonic constitution and the nature of exogenous
processes, into two zones:

      · the central massif;

      · the littoral depression.

3.4.1 - Continental "Massif" Landforms

Considering its features, the national territory is divided into two parts: western and eastern. The
eastern part is dominated by accumulation landforms while the eastern part mainly forms
denudation terrain with intense erosion processes still happening nowadays.

The western part of Angola comprises the Central Plateau with stair-form landscapes, the
Maiombe denudation plains, the Cuanza­Longa plains, the Zenza­Loge plateau, the coastal
plain and the Namibe accumulation plain.

The positive morphological structures are associated to the shields of Angola and Maiombe,
whereas negatives are connected with the Perioceanic Depression and the northwestern part of the
Congo depression.

The Central Plateau, with the stair-form landscapes, settled over Archaic and precocious
Proterozoic rock formations from the Angolan shields whose levels reach 3000 m. The plateau is
limited in the West by the "great escarp" and the denudation plains zone that forms steps which fall
down to the coastal plain. High above the "Great Escarp", the plateau declines to East and
Southeast, shaping the denudation plains. The western part of the plateau reveals "in mesa"
structured mountains. In the interfluves and "in mesa" mountain bases lateriticial cuirassses have
developed. The river valleys present different shapes. In the "great escarp" zone, they are deeply fit

in,                                                                                                         reaching
600­700 depths. In southern Angola, the Humpata plateau massif, with levels that reach 2,300 m, is
the alongment of the Central Plateau. In the West, the referred massif is limited by the "Great
Escarp", while in the East it gradually turns into the accumulation plains. In the South, the massif is
entailed in river Curoca's valley plateau, with depths of 200­240 m.

The formation of denudation plains of Maiombe occurred over metamorfic and magmatic rocks
from the Maiombe shield. They rise softly from the littoral strip towards East and Southeast, their
absolute levels varying between 0 and 1000 m in the medium stretch of rivers Dange and Zenza,
being the depth of dissecation of the plains from 20 to 100 m. Plains of Maiombe are separated
from the Central Plateau by a step of the Cuanza horst, which direction is latitudinal.

The plains of the upper stretches of Cuanza­Longa are connected to the east extremes of the Angola
and Maiombe shields, being crossed by large river valleys which pass softly to interfluvia. In the
northern part of Maiombe shield, plains are limited by a degree 500 m high.

The Zenza­Loge "plateau" is constituted by deposits of the Super Group of Western Congo. The
lined sub-meridional orientation of all the landforms outstands as a specific characteristic of the
"plateau". The interfluvia have hills in the form of steps with altitudes from 300 to 400 m. South
and Southeast of the "plateau", absolute levels reach 1500 m. The orientation of "cordilheiras" and
of the lowlands between them matches with the direction of "dobramentos". Locally, the bottom of
the valleys shows residual testimony of denudation with altitudes of 250­300 m.

The negative morfostructure of the northwest part of Congo depression includes the plain of
Cuango, strongly dissecated, with the Cassanje depression. The plain of Cuango was formed over
the continental sub-horizontal deposits of late Mesozoic and Cenozoic. At its centre the Cassanje
depression can be found, resulting from tectonic movement and erosion phenomena. The higher
absolute levels (from 1200 to 1300 m) occur in the south-eastern and eastern parts of the plain.
Locally, their landforms show blocs and "cordilheiras" not much developed. The river valleys have
a "V" shaped transversal cut, their depth being 100 to 150 m. Hydrographic network is recticulate.
The depression of Cassanje formed over the sub-horizontal deposits with "mantos lávicos" from the
late Paleozoic-Mesozoic and follows from Southeast to Northwest during about 300 km and has
about 100 km width. The bottom of the depression has two levels (from 800 to 1,000 m and from
600 to 700 m), separated by steps with altitudes varying from some tens to 100 m. River valleys
have smooth hills.

The coastal plain, with soft landforms, formed over the meso­cenozoic marine deposits of the
Perioceanic Depression. Its width is no more than 15­30 km, as a rough rule. At the vicinity of the
mouth of rivers Zaire and Cuanza, that plain enlarges from 100 to 300 km, constituting the coastal

18307md_ing_a.doc                                                                                             19/145

basins with the same name. At the Cuanza basin coastline is crossed by lakes that fulfil tectonic
flaws with several orientations. The "morros" and "cordilheiras" that emerge from the plain are
formed in the emergent spots of cohesion rocks that resist to erosion processes. Depressions in arch
that appear on the landforms are probably structures of salt domes. Along the coastline there exists
a degree of abrasion with altitude from 20 to 50 m. At the proximity of the mouth of many rivers
there are beaches, accumulation terraces, islands and sandbars with several meters of altitude.
Abrasion terraces with altitudes from 145 to 175 m can be found at the South of Angola. The slopes
of the valleys are, in general, not very steep, while in the zone with steps formed by abrasion there
are gorges with waterfalls. Suspended valleys can be seen. The landforms in the coastal plain were
formed due to air denudation. Namibe plain is located at the south-eastern extreme of Angola,
North to the mouth of river Cunene and is constituted by modern eolic sands from alluvia. Their
altitude increases gradually eastwards, until 200 m. This plain formation results from re-deposition
of alluvia from river Cunene.

Landforms at the eastern part of Angola are represented by accumulation plains of the upper
stretches of rivers Zambeze, Macondo, Cunene and Maninga, the Cameia­Lumbate depression, the
Lunda "plateau" and, at the extreme east, by the elevation of High Zambeze.

The elevation of High Zambeze, formed over the precambric deposits. Their landforms result from
erosion and accumulation phenomena. The absolute levels of elevation, increasing to Northeast are
1000 to 1200 m, the dissecation depth being several tens of meters. The orientation of the main
landforms coincides with the NE direction of the "dobramentos".

The accumulation plain of the upper course of rivers Macondo e Maninga, located at Southeast of
the elevation of High Zambeze, is constituted by deposits of the Macondo formation. Landforms are
represented by a "plateau" with absolute levels from 1200 m at Southeast to 1500 m at Northeast.
The dissecation depth is of several tens of meters.

The proluvio­alluvia plain from Lunda "plateau" was formed over the Cassai shield. It is
constituted by the "red sands" formation of the Kalahari Group. Their absolute levels are 1,400­
1,600 m in the south part of the "plateau", diminishing softly northwards. The majority of river
valleys are of southern orientation and narrow, with terraces of lowlands with 10, 20 and 40 m of
altitude, meanders and rapids being very often signalized. The south-western part of the plain
belongs to the Okawango morfostructure. Here maximum levels of 1000 m exist, the valleys of the
rivers being fit in until a depth of 100 to 150 m. In the valleys neotectonic degrees can be found, the
cross section of them being "U" shape. At the south extreme of the plain there are depressions
resulting from denudation and deflaction, of latitudinal orientation, closed and opened, forming
labyrinths. Reception lakes can be found in many lowlands.

The Okawango depression structure includes plains made of sand and clay of the Plistocene­
­Holocenic age. They are situated in the Cameia-Lumbate depression (the interfluvia of rivers
Zambeze and Cassai), originated by tectonic and erosion actions, as well as in the right margin of
river Cubango and in the basin of river Cunene. The Cameia­Lumbate depression extends to
Southeast for 200 km, its width being 180 km. The absolute levels are 1100 a 1,400 m. In all its
periphery the depression is limited by steps with 50­60 m of altitude. It is crossed by a dense
hydrographic network. The plain located in the right bank of river Cubango is morphologically
identical to the above described. At the southwest extreme of the landforms of Okavango there is
the plain of river Cunene. On the plan, it reminds a strangulation opening to the South. The
extension of the plain for North to South is 200 km, being 160 km its width along the Angolan
border. At the northwestern part of the plain drainage is oriented to river Cunene, while in the
south-eastern part water drains towards the reception lake called Etosha (located in Namibia).

In modern times a part of the upper part of Cunene was captured by a river which had its mouth in
the Atlantic Ocean. During the floods all the plain was covered with water. At the surface of the
plain there are the following landform "mesofomas": "Mufitos", "Ecangos", "Mulolas" (local
designations). "Mufitos" are elevations covered by sandy deposits, with trees and bushes;
"Ecangos" are assimetric or oval depressions with surface clay layers covered by salt pellicules;
"Chanas" are alongated lowlands with up to 500 m wide, sometimes with clay surface layers;
"Mulolas" are narrow beds of temporary watercourses, usually sandy.

At the landforms of the oceanic depression there are the continental platform, the continental
embankment and the bottom of the ocean. The continental platform is a sloped plain resulting from
abrasion and accumulation processes, 8­10 e 70 km wide (near the mouth of river Zaire). It is the
extension of the continental coastal plain, constituted by Meso­Cenozoic sediments, the ancient
platform being distinct of the modern one. The average depth of the continental platform is 100 to
150 m.

The continental embankment separates the continental platform of the bottom of the ocean through
a step with about 550 m of altitude, reaching 850 m near Cabo de Santa Maria. The highest point in
the scarp is near the mouth of rivers Coporolo, Catara, São Nicolau and Mutabo. The bottom of the
ocean presents as a plain with soft slope at the basis of the continental embankment. Areas adjacent
to the continental embankment have a structure like a stair. The maximum depth of the sea bottom
is 4,500 m.

3.5 - GEOLOGY

This chapter presents a summary of some considerations about the succession of geological events
(Figure 3.4) that developed during the great tectonic cycles and that correspond to the evolution of
the earth crust of the territory of Angola within the African platform.

At the early Arcaic cycle (3500­3000 m.y.) the metamorphic and ultrametamorphic structures were
formed, represented mainly by several ortognaisses, anfibolites, leptites, quartzites, xists and
charnoquites, enderbites, tonalites, plagiogranites and associated tites. It is assumed that at the
beginning of the cycle under consideration occurred the installation of rocks of the ofiolitic series in
conditions of the primitive crust (protocrust). Rocks of the ofiolitic series, later transformed into
sequences of bipiroxenic and hiperstenic gnaisses with bodies of anfibolites, metagabres and
granulites, were preserved only in the southeast part of the Maiombe shield and in the northern part
of the Angola shield. Probably of ofiolitic association are the gabro­noritic intrusions of the recent
Arcaic from the Maiombe, Cassai and Angola shields. Immediately after the installation of rocks of
the ofiolitic series, it started the formation of the primitive vulcano­sedimentary shelter, which
served as substrate, in conditions of metamorfism, to different gnaisses as well as to anfibolites and
quartzites. At the end of the cycle, as a result of the tectonic accumulation, regional metamorfism
(granulitic and    anfibolic facies) and granitization, the structuration of the lower part of the
protometamorfic layer occurred; representated by several gnaisses (horneblendic, hiperstenic, with
high contents of Al2O3 and others), leptites, quartzites, anfibolites, as well as granitoids which
composition was mainly diorito­gabrodioritic.

The Late Arcaic cycle (3000­2600 m.y.) was characterized by the continuation of the
differentiation of the earth crust, several isolated structural zones having been formed, on which
terrigeno­carbonated deposits were accumulated. The launching of processes of metamorfism and
granitization leaded to the selective fusion, originating granitoid rocks of the tonalitico­
plagiogranitic series. The generation of granitoids occurred essentially, from the rocks of the
Inferior Arcaic, increasing its alcalinity due to the penetration of natrium at the deepest levels.
Phenomena of granitization promoted also the formation of granitic domes in great positive
structures. Belts of green rocks are characteristic of the Late Arcaic. The pieces of structures of this
kind are preserved in the interdomme zones of Maiombe shield. The formation of similar structures
must also have taken place in other shields of the Angolan territory, which testifies are the
anfibolites, diabasics foliated porfirites and xists derived from effusive acid rocks, that can be found
in the cuts of Higher Arcaic.

At the beginning of the Early Proterozoic cycle (2600 to 1600 m.y.), at the green rocks "troughs"
(Lufico­Cabinda and Cassinga zones), there was intense vulcanism of the andesitic­basaltic type,
substituted after some time by vulcanism of riolitic­dacitic type. The presence of espilites at the
vulcanites cuts shows vulcanism of the submarine type, while the presence of tufs shows the
blasting character of the eruptions. In the vulcano­sedimentary rocks of the "troughs" of green
rocks there are iron jazides and copper occurrences (Cassinga zone, Jamba group). Into the
interdomme and linear depressions of the regional "arqueamentos" (zones of Oendolongo, Lunda,
Alto Zambeze), terrigenous sedimentary sequences were formed of small depth. In the contact areas
of the regional "arqueamentos" with the "troughs" of green rocks (south and southeastern sectors of
the Oendolongo zone), volcanic activity occurred resulting into espelites, dactites, riolites,
albitofires.

At the later stage of Early Proterozoic, phenomena of tectogenesis and of granite formation
developed in the depressions and green rocks "troughs" as well as in regional "arqueamentos". The
orogenic activation resulted into a set of granitic intrusions, transforming the pre­existing crust into
continental crust. The installation of the gabro­anortositic intrusions and of associated granites type
rapaquivi shows maturity of the crust. The Early Proterozoic cycle lead to the formation of
vulcano­plutonic structures in continental conditions.

At the Late Proterozoic cycle (1650 a 520 m.y.), formation of the coverage of the precambric
platform started. At the "aulacógeno" of Western Congo, in conditions of an epicontinental sea,
impressive terrigeno e terrigeno­carbonated sequences of the                          Western Congo Supergroup were
deposited. The main areas of denudation can be found at the eastern, western and southern sectors
of the sedimentation basin. At the Early Rifean, in conditions of shallow waters, terrigeno­clay
sequences of the Terreiro group were mainly deposited. During Middle to Late Rifean, a slow
subsidence started which originated the accumulation of terrigeno­carbonated deposits with
estromatolitic lime of Alto­Chiloango e Xist­Lime Groups. At Late Rifean ­ Vendian a
sedimentary elevation started to be formed, at the central part of the sedimentation basin, in which
gross sediments started to settle into the M'Bridge formation. At the remaining basin reddish and
gross deposits of terrigeno­lime nature accumulated, in orogenic conditions, at the M'Pioka and
Inkisi formations.

Within the limits of the Congo plate, during Early Rifean­Vendian, the reddish clay­detritic
deposits started to be formed (zone of Lucala, Xisto­Gressous Group). Middle Rifean give origin
to the terrigeno­carbonateed formations (zone of High Zambeze, Macondo Group). At the
Okavango plate, during Middle Rifean, the reddish continental deposits formed, containing
probably vulcanoclastic rocks (Humpata formation).

During Middle to Late Rifean, carbonatic deposits began to be formed, in conditions of an
epicontinental sea (Chela Group, Leba Formation). The final stage of Late Proterozoic was
characterised by the development of "dobramentos" and faults of the "aulacógeno" of Western
Congo, as well as metamorfism of facies of green xists in some areas of the Congo plate. The
structuration of faults of NE direction was accompanied by hidrothermal phenomena with
mineralization of polimetalic copper. The activation period was responsible for the intrusions that
penetrate into the consolitated and folded structures, resulting in the gabro­dioritic sienitic massifs,
of alcaline and hiperalcaline granites, "mantos" and doleritic diques.

At the Late Paleozoic cycle (350­230 m.y.) the coverage of the platform went on. Into the
depressions of Low Cunene, Lunda and in the graben of Cassanje, reddish terrigenous continental
sediments were deposited (Lutoe Group, Ecca and the lower part of Cassanje Group).

At the Meso­Cenozoic cycle (230 m.y.) the coverage of the platform continued, in the inside of the
continent as well as in its passive boundary. At the Precocious Triassic­ Jurassic, on the plates of
Congo and Okawango, clay­sandy deposits accumulated, in conditions of epicontinental or
continental basins of shallow water (zones of High Zambeze, Cassanje and Dirico), as well as, very
rarely, carbonaceous ones, finalising with lava of medium to basic composition conditioned by the
activation of the platform (Higher Stromberg Group). At the Late Jurassic ­ Cretacic wide
depressions were filled by heavy continental sequences that superimpose on the Karroo Supergroup
(formations Continental Intercalar, Kwango and Calonda).

The beginning of the formation of the Perioceanic Depression must be dated at the Jurassic. Here,
initially, great depressions in graben were created in zones of deep faults in which gross polimictic
continental sediments of the High Jurassic and of the Inferior Cretacic were deposited (formations
Maculungo, Cuvo, Lucula). In the zone of Cuanza, sedimentation was accompanied by vulcanic
activity (complex of Jamba­Calunga). At the end of this period, probably in the barremian time, the
continental conditions changed to marine conditions, starting the deposition of the terrigeno­
carbonated sequences (formation Bucomazi and the upper part of formation Cuvo).

At the Apcian and Albian, in wide zones of the present terrestrial surface and of the continental
platform were deposited evaporitic and salty carbonated sequences (formations Mavuma, Infra­
­Binga, Binga and Tuenza). At the Late Cretacic started the deposition of terrigeno­carbonated
rocks in conditions of na open and calid sea (formations Pinda, Cabo Iedo, Vermelha, Itombe,
N´Golome, Teba). In the Late Cretacic­Early Paleogenic started the formation of salty dommes and
deep depressions.

At the Early Maestrichtian­Paleogenic, the conditions changed from transgressive to regressive, the
last ones showing mainly after the end of the Eocenic, at the basin of Cabinda­Congo (formation

18307md_ing_a.doc                                                                                            25/145

Malembo) and at the Oligocenic, at the zone of the basin of Cuanza (formation Quifangondo). The
terrigeno­carbonated sedimentation became essentialy terrigenous. An intense subsidence of the
depressions continued, in which deep (until 3,000 m) terrigenous sequences deposited (clay, sand,
limestone). On some sequences cenozoic turbidites were formed.

At the Mesozoic­Cenozoic, continental conditions dominated largely at the continental part of the
territory of the country. At the Late Jurassic­ Early Cretacic, the depression of Okavango was filled
by reddish terrigenous deposits of the Intercalar Continental Formation. At the Late Cretacic, in
alluvionar, alluvio­lakelike and lakelike conditions, the terrigenous sequences of formations
Kwango and Calonda deposited on the Congo depression. The presence of carbonated material at
the deposits of the formation Calonda probably testifies an ingression not very deep of the
epicontinental basin of Zaire. The transition from the Early to Late Cretacic was characterised by
the                                                                                                           tectono­
­magmatic activation of the African platform which conditionated the wide installation of
quimberlitic bodies, of alkaline ultrabasic rocks and carbonatites. These rocks are mainly located
within the area of the transcontinental structure of Lucapa. It must be pointed out that, at the centre
and at the eastern sector of Lucapa, the quimberlitic bodies are dominant and at the western sector
and the centre are located massifs of alcaline rocks, alcaline ultrabasic rocks and carbonatites. At
the zone of the deep Perioceanic fault intrusive and effusive rocks of basic and acid composition
were born at the Cretacic­Paleogenic.

From the Paleogenic until nowadays the irregular risings of several parts of the territory went on
shaping the present landforms. At the Paleocenic­Eocenic, in conditions of hot weather, alteration
lateriticial cuirasses formed at several levels of the plains of the Late Cretacic. At the Eocenic­Neo-
cenic, in wide plains of erosion belonging to the plains of the East of Angola, in conditions of arid
climate, reddish deposits of the Kalahari Group began to settle. At that time the present
hydrographic network started to be structured, its formation being completed at the Pliocenic. From
the end of the Neogenic until nowadays, in conditions of wet climate, landforms related to erosion
and accumulation go on developing.

3.6 - SOILS

According to MINAU (2006), there is a great diversity of soils in Angola. Because of their
agricultural importance, the following soils have great representativity (Figure 3.5):

       · Psammitic from humid and sub-humid regions;

       · Ferralitic;

       · Arid psammitic;

     PSAMMITIC SOILS FROM HUMID AND SUB-HUMID REGIONS


      These soils cover most of the area of Moxico, a Lunda zone and the northern part of Kuando
      Kubango to the proximities of Mavinga. There are also some spots in the regions of Uíge
      and Zaire, in the provinces of Huíla, Kuando­Lubango and Kubando and in Lunda,
      associated with ferrlitic soils.


     FERRALITIC SOILS


      These soils are situated in the Central Plateau of Angola, from the north of Malange to the
      south of Huambo, covering the provinces of Huambo and Bié, east of South Kuanza and a
      portion that comprises Quilengues and Lubango. In the provinces of Lunda they emerge

        associated with psammic and in Uíge and Zaire they are linked with fersialitic and
        paraferralitic soils.


      ARIDIC PSAMMITIC


        These soils appear in the southern strip of the Kuando Kubango province, from Mavinga to
        the Namibian borders. In some regions of Huíla, they are mixed with aridic non-psammic
        soils. They also emerge in Luanda and Muxima.

      PARA-FERRALITIC


        These soils appear in association with other types of soils, in the provinces of North and
        South Kwanzas, east of Malange and west of Lunda, Uíge, Zaire, Kuando Kubango and
        Southwestern Angola.


      FERSIALITIC


        These soils always appear in association with other soils and are located in North Cabinda,
        Uíge, Zaire, East of Malange, North Kwanza and Ambrizete and Caxito.

According to (Diniz, 1998) the arenosoils cover over 57% of Angolan territory and the ferrasoils
occupy about 22%, as a consequence, infertile soils are largely dominant.

There are still some obstacles to agricultural production because, with the exception of some spots
of alluvial soils, in river valleys and alluvial plains as well as some fractioning clays, along the
coast and in the southwest part of the country there are soils, from arid and semi-arid regions, which
have small thickness and a low humidity content (leptosoils) or even too alkaline (calcisoils,
gessoils and solonetz).

It is estimated that about 10% of Angolan soils have high agricultural potential, according to
(IUCN, 1992). The luvisoils, situated by the rivers, where alluvium is accumulated, are generally
high in organic composts and mineral elements, the cambisoils, nitosoils and lixisoils that are to be
found near the north-south transition belt, where the steep terrain prevents the development of
eroded soils, in areas above basic rocks north of Malange.

The soils are poor in one or more essential nutrients to vegetal nutrition, and therefore, need
correction. Nutrient loss due to water dragging from rains, watering erosion and plants' needs make
the soils poorer during large periods, which has an impact over agricultural production.

According to MINAU (2006) the FAO holds soil deterioration, deflorestation and agriculture as the
main causes of the deterioration of Angolan soil.

In MINAU (2006) the cultivation without nutrient renovation and fertilizers, frequent burns, and
consequent exposure to wind and rain are factors that contribute to soil deterioration in Angola.

3.7 - SURFACE WATER

3.7.1 - Main Hydrographic Basins

For a better understanding and framing of the hydrological and hydrogeological aspects to be
studied, it is convenient to make a short analysis of the general characteristics of the basins in their
varied features.


     BASIN OF BENGO


       The hydrographic basin of river Rio Bengo has a total area of about 11,100 km2, develops
       dominantly East­West and has its mouth at about 45 km to the North of Luanda. Its higher
       stretches include successive rapids and the lower stretch has a very low slope, originating
       many lakes in their margins which work as basins for flow regularisation. Rainfall decreases
       gradually from upstream to downstream, where it is very low and variable.


     BASIN OF CUANZA


       Its total hydrographic basin has about 155,000 km2, two thirds of which relate to the sub-
       plains region. In more than half of its course the river keeps at high levels, running towards
       North or Northwest; near Malange it turns westwards. Afterwards, during approximately
       160 km, it goes down from the level 1000 m until levels close to the sea level. Its lower
       stretch runs from Cambambe downstream, with wide floodplains and large lakes at the
       margins. The geomorphologic characteristics of its upper stretch make its flow very
       beneficial for moderating the flow regime. Rainfall variation is similar to that of the basin of
       Bengo, being high upstream and decreasing slowly downstream.


     BASIN OF QUEVE


       With a total basin of about 23,000 km2, river Queve is born in the central highlands zone and
       presents the same characteristics as river Cuanza: an initial stretch not very steep, an
       intermediate stretch with a high slope and a final plane stretch until the ocean. The rainfall
       variation follows a pattern also very similar to that of river Cuanza.


      BASIN OF CUBANGO


        Cubango is one of the three large international rivers at the South of Angola. It is born in
       the Bié highlands, near 1,800 m of altitude, runs more or less from North to South until it

18307md_ing_a.doc                                                                                           30/145

                    Environmental and Social Management Process Report
                    Volume 2 ­ Environmental and Social Diagnosis and Institutional and Legal Framework




      reaches African Southwest where it turns eastwards and acts as a border; when it leaves the
      Angolan territory it crosses the "Caprivi Strip" and looses in a wide swamp ­ "Okavango
      Swamps". The total area of the basin in Angola is 148,860 km2 and its longitudinal profile
      does not show any relevant singularities. Rainfall decrease softly southwards following the
      climatic variation which passes from wet in the North to semi-arid at the south extreme.

      The area of its hydrographic basin in Angola is equal to Cuito and Cubango itself. Cubango
      runs near the western edge of the basin and receives all its tributaries at the left bank, always
      oriented from North to South, their courses being parallel and at a short distance from each
      other. This characteristic alters when Cubango enters widely into the sedimentary zone in
      the South. Cuito, although being more branched upstream, has no more important tributaries
      downstream river Longa, at its right bank. Orography and geology influence strongly the
      physiography of several watercourses. While all the rivers to West of the Cuebe present
      rocky beds, important slopes and are stable, rivers to the East tend to have meanders, are
      unstable and with very small slopes. More specifically, river Cubango, running on a rocky
      bed until river Caiundo, is more stable downstream; only at the international stretch, more
      exactly after Sambio, starts to follow a meander pattern, with floodplains wider and wider
      and even with lakes at the margins. Notwithstanding rainfall pattern, excepting some small
      tributaries in the south zone, all watercourses in this basin have permanent flows, those
      located at the sedimentary formations having a remarkable regularity of flows.

      Vegetation distribution is more or less uniform in the whole basin, varying from the savanna
      type to the forest more or less closed. This one is located at the upper part where, due to the
      higher rainfall, flora is quite rich and varied and trees have bigger size. Savanna develops in
      a restricted area along river Cuio and some of its tributaries. In the southern zones of this
      basin, spots of vegetation including bushes can be found among the scattered trees.


     BASIN OF CUNENE


      The basin of Cunene covers a total area of 106,500 km2. The river is born in the high plains
      and runs more or less from North to South until it reaches the region of Namibia in Ruacaná.
      Here it turns westwards to the ocean and acts as a border, After en initial stretch until Matala
      relatively steep, the river crosses a plane with wide floodplains until a little upstream of
      Ruacaná, where, in successive rapids and waterfalls, goes down from levels of 1090 m until
      near the sea level. At its final stretch, near the mouth, the river crosses the Namibe desert.
      After two heavy rainy centres, one at the north extreme, the other at Northwest, it follows a
      gradual decrease of rainfall to South and West.

       The hydrographic basin of river Cunene is covered by sediments of the Kalahari, being
       characterised by great scarcity of permanent surface water, excepting the water accumulated
       during the rainy season in some natural depressions or in excavated deposits, where it
       remains available during variable time periods.

The hydrological and hydrogeological phenomena are characterised for being extremely variable,
both in space and in time, their interpretation and study so requiring the collection of the biggest
possible number of elements for the whole relevant area and for a period as long as possible.

To analyse these phenomena certain time intervals must be considered according to the specific
studies to be carried out. However, the majority of the hydrological phenomena                           are interrelated in
a chain form, which means that some phenomena result from others, preventing to take them
isolated.

However, because periodicity requires division of time, it may be logical to fix the hydrological
year according to the climatic conditions of the region under study, being usual to consider its
beginning at the time the surface and underground water reserves in the hydrographic basins are at
their minimum. The hydrological year will be defined between the end of two consecutive dry
seasons and so it is reasonable to conclude that, in fact, besides its beginning being variable from
region to region, it will also be variable from year to year in the same region. However, the need to
elaborate, process and compare hydrological elements leads to the consideration of a fixed date for
its beginning for each region. Also by practical reasons the hydrological year shall start at the first
day of a chosen month, as above referred to, in order that the water reserves are the minimum,
which means practically the end of the dry season, which in Angola is usually between September
and November.

3.7.1.1 - Main watercouses

The Zaire river (located in the northern and north-eastern regions, with mouth in the Atlantic
Ocean) and the Zambeze river (located in the eastern and south-eastern regions, with mouth in the
Indian Ocean) are the main water lines of the PRA; together with the Kunene and Kubango rivers
(in the southern part of the countries, with mouth in the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean,
respectively) they form the great international rivers of Angola.

The central plateau is crossed by main fluvial systems that run south ­ Kunene and Kubango ­ or
West, towards the coast ­ Qwanza. Along the coast, some small rivers have developed and are of
great importance to the subsistence of the local communities.

The hydrographical basins of the Zaire and Zambeze rivers include several wetlands, namely
springs in High Kwanza (Luena), swamps and lakes in High and Mid Kwanza and springs and
swamps in Zambeze. There are also large swampy areas along the Cuando river, the Cubango river
and several sections of the Zaire river and humid areas in the central plateau (north of Huambo­
­Kuito) and in the SE region.

The terminal sections of the Zaire and the Kwanza rivers, in a extension of several dozens of
kilometres, that includes strips of mangroves ­ which occupy about 240 km2 of the country's
coastal areas (MINUA, 2002) ­ and are extremely important to the settlement of several aquatic
species (specifically crustacean, fish, shellfish) and margin stabilization.

Especially in the south and southeast of the country, the driest parts, the water lines are irregular
and depend on the wet season's rains, originating sandbanks in the mouth in some cases.

The hydrographical network of the Kubango river forms the Okavango delta, with great economic
and ecological significance, and the Kunene river, which crosses an half-arid zone, is the only
permanent water line in the north-western limit of Namibia.

3.7.1.2 - Water Resourcess

Angola is a country of high hydric resources potential, with an estimated annual superficial flow of
140 million of m3, that is, 140 km3/year (MINUA, 2004).

The hydrographical basins of the Zaire and Zambeze rivers, develop in high rainfall areas more than
50% of their flows depend of rains that take place in upstream countries (MINUA, 2006).

3.7.2 - Underground Water

The subterranean hydric resources in Angola are subjacent to several groups of aquifers, in the coast
(with an average depth between 5 and 30 m), in the central plateau region (with an average depth
between 10 and 30 m) and in the half-arid zones of the Kunene (with an average depth of 300 m or
more). There are also diverse mineral water springs but information on this subject is scarce.

The annual availabilities of subterranean waters are estimated to be of 58 km3/years
(FAO / Aquastat, 1995).

3.7.3 - Water Use

Despite of the high hydric resources potential available in Angola, they are still exploited below
their potential.

3.7.3.2 - Water Supply to Population

This type of infrastructure is estimated to cover about 50 or 60% of the population, according to
different sources, with almost 60% of water-supplied population living in the city of Luanda
(MINEA, 2004).

The majority of urban population is not served by the national network but by water tanks, whose
water is not treated or is obtained in polluted sources, near patent concrete cesspits or absorbing
wells (MINUA, 2006).

For water supply, in cities and inland suburban and rural areas, population turns to underground
water sources, more than a million wells scattered by all provinces (MINEA); in the southern
provinces, the driest ones, even accumulated rainwater is used, also to water the cattle.

3.7.3.3 -   Fluvial Fishing

The country is rich in freshwater fish (with some endemic species), mainly in the regions of the
Zaire, the Zambeze and the Kunene (especially in the western zone of the basin) and the Kubango­
Okawango rivers.

The highest priced species are the small fish such as the "cacusso", the "bagre" and the "cabuenha",
which can be found in the irregular floodable areas of High Kwanza.

Although captures have strongly decreased after the country's independence, fishing in inland
waters are still essential to population nutrition.

3.7.4 - Water Pollution

3.7.4.1 - Human Occupation

Due to war and emigration and immigration phenomena, the last decades have seen major
significant changes to population distribution numbers in the country, and therefore, there is a great
disparity between statistics.

In 1975, about 80% of the population lived in rural areas and about 90% lived in the western "half"
of the territory, with Luanda counting about 500,000 inhabitants; at the beginning of the 90's
decade, 60% of the estimated total population of 10.7 million inhabitants lived in rural areas.
During that decade, though, there were strong population migrations from inland to coastal areas
(mainly to Luanda, Benguela and Bengo). As a result, some sources estimate that out of a total of
16.5 million inhabitants, about 4 million live in Luanda (24.2% of the total).

Besides, in main cities, urban wastewater systems are obsolete or down due to the lack of
maintenance, and consequently important untreated sewage discharges take place in urban areas.

3.7.4.2 - Cattle Breeding Activity

Besides heads of other species, statistics from 2005 count about 4 million bovine heads and 2.5
million of swine heads in the entire country (MINADER, 2005).

The bovine cattle is mainly scattered by the provinces of Huíla (with 1,380,000) and Cunene (with
1.345,000) ­ which form about 2/3 of the country's totals ­ as well as by the provinces of Namibe
(with 402,500), Benguela (with 310,780), Kuando Kubando (with 295,550) and South Kwanza
(with 115,000).

Swine are mainly scattered by the provinces of Huambo (with 597, 000) and Benguela (with
332 ,400) ­ that represent 40% of country's total heads ­ followed by the provinces of Huíla and
Cunene (with 246,100 each), Bié (with 245,600), South Kwanza (with 197,200), Kuando Kubango
(with 157,500) and Malanje (with 150,400).

3.7.4.3 - Agricultural Activities

Commercial agriculture is scattered by the provinces of Cabinda and Luanda, in the coastal north,
and by the provinces of Namibe, Huíla, Benguela and Huambo, in the south-western part of the
country. In the latter provinces, large irrigated zones can be found.

The type of used fertiliser varies from place to place: in the north-eastern "half" of the country ­
except Malange and North Qwanza ­ green manures are predominantly used, in the south-western
"half", dung is more used and in the provinces of Luanda and South Qwanza organic compost is
used by the majority.

The low incidence of diseases and/or plagues indicates that the numbers concerning the use of
fitopharmaceutical products are irrelevant.

3.7.4.4 - Recreational Activities

Because of the presence of hostile animals (such as crocodiles), the water lines in Angola are not
suitable to this kind of activity.

3.7.4.5 - Other Activities

The oil industry is one of the responsible for water pollution ­ namely through polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons ­ through either dragging oil spills to surface waters or infiltrating into
undergroundwaters or aquifer contamination where tanks were burned during the hostilities. The
true intensity and extension of the pollution is yet unknown.

The inadequate management of solid waste in residential zones, especially in larger cities like
Luanda and their suburbs, is another source of water pollution ­ with high risks to public health and
to the environment - because of either inadequate behaviour of the population or insufficient human
and material resources, unrestrained urbanization and transportation network difficulties or even
dumping sites (in case of Luanda, followed by open air burnings and dumping waste in soils
without protective covering or, in case of the provinces of Cabinda and Benguela, waste is dumped
in swampy areas). In addition, the management of hospital wastes, especially dangerous wastes, is
poor.

The car vehicles circulation, which has registered a significant increase over the last years, can also
be an important source of deterioration of hydric masses near densely populated urban areas
(namely materials in suspension, organic composts and several heavy metals).

3.8 - ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS

The great diversity of biomes and ecosystems one can find in Angola is unique among African
countries. The word BIOME concerns an extended biogeographic region that is defined by the
genetic composition and the origin of plants and animals as well as physiognomic, climateric and
edaphic factors.

A biome consists in several ECOSYSTEMS. The word ecosystem refers to a particular community
of animals and plants, associated with their physical environment.

The in-depth study of Angolan ecosystems is still inexistent, and therefore, this document follows
the classification by Brian Huntley (1992), that is based on brief references found in Angola's
biogeographic characteristics studies (Chapin 1932, Traylor 1963, Barbosa 1970, Huntley 1974,
White 1983).

According to Huntley (1974) and White (1983), who, among the "regional endemic centres", offer
the best synthesis of the biological characteristics of Angola, the main regions and percentages in
the national territory are:

      · Guineo­congolese         10,7% (Forest, wild jungle, savannas of high grass)

      · Zambeziac                86,2% (Woods, savannas, meadows e wild jungle)

      · Afromontain                0,5% (Forests, savannas and meadows)

      · Karoo-Namibe               2,6% (Desert, bushes, savannas, woods, wild jungle)

3.8.1 - Areas of Ecological Interest

The large extension of the national territory, the low population density and the great diversity of
biomes and ecosystems are all factors that would allow Angola to possess a significant protected
areas' network. However, this does not happen, mainly due to its colonial history. It has never been
a concern of the Portuguese Government to environmentally preserve its colonial territories, which
were merely regarded as a source of raw materials, to be soon exploited. Only a small group of
Angolan inhabitants was determined to fight for the environmental protection of their territory. The
creation of environmentally protected areas happened as a result of the international public opinion,
which pressed colonially occupied territories to create environmental protection areas


18307md_ing_a.doc                                                                                            37/145

There are officially six National Parks, an Integral Natural Reserve, a Partial Reserve and a
Regional Park, which express an initial rating that needs alterations:

      · Iona National Park ......................................................................................   15,920 km2

      · Cameia National Park...................................................................................     14,000 km2

      · Quiçama National Park.................................................................................      9,960 km2

      · Luando Integral National Reserve................................................................            8,280 km2

      · Bicuari National Park...................................................................................    7,900 km2

      · Mupa National Park......................................................................................    6,600 km2

      · Namibe Partial Reserve................................................................................      4,680 km2

      · Cangandala National Park............................................................................          600 km2

      · Chimalavera Regional Park..........................................................................          160 km2

Since 1975, a redefinition of these protection areas, together with the creation of new ones, have
been recommended, as a means of preserving samples of several biomes and ecosystems within the
national territory. These proposals include areas of sightseeing interest, natural monuments, swamps
and mangroves.

3.8.2 - Fauna

The diversity of Angolan fauna was subject to more studies than its botanical resources, especially
the vertebrate animals. The rich bird fauna was categorised by Traylor (1963) and complemented by
Dean (1988), but the most comprehensive study was done by Pinto (1983).

The fish species in the numerous Angolan rivers were partially categorised by Max Pohl (1967),
but, until today, no other studies have been made on that subject.

The reptiles and the amphibians need further field research.

The Angolan mammals have been in fact the most studied animals in field. Of all of them, the
Palanca Real was by far the one studied in more detail, by a two-year project in Luando
(1969/1970).

Studies on taxonomy and species' distribution synthesis were publicised by Crawford Cabral
(1988).

From 1971 to 1975, a comprehensive status report of 80 species of mammals was made by the
ecologist Brian Huntley. Those days, few areas had plenty of animals, but protected areas were
experiencing a great development. Since 1975, most animals, even these ones, have been decimated

18307md_ing_a.doc                                                                                                       38/145

by unrestrained hunts. The killing of elephants, rhinos, gungas, brown palancas, guelengues,
"cabras de leque", zebras, small antelopes and many other species took place in protected areas, due
to the lack of conservation services, whose workers were forced to leave because of the lack of
safety and means of survival.

Only small species with no nutritional or cinegetic value survived, and took advantage of the
abandoned agricultural fields and mines.

3.8.3 - Flora

The most common physiognomic type of vegetation in Angola is represented by the "Miombo"
woods, which cover about 50% of the country. They are mostly associated with the sandy regions of
the Kalahari and the entire inland plateau.

In semi-arid regions and on those from the provinces of Cuando Cubango, Cunene and Huíla
covered by sand, there are vast areas of woods and wild jungle, which consist in Pterocarpus
angolensis, Albízia spp., and Burkea africana. In the drier and rocky regions of the western Cunene
and the eastern Namibe the composition is of Comiphora spp., Terminalia spp., Colophospermum
spp., Boscia spp. and Combretum spp., with a layer of annual graminea.

The meadows can be found in small altitude areas of the inland plateau, in the provinces of
Huambo, Bié, South Kwanza and Huíla, associated with scarcely drained soils. The most common
plant species are the Parinari spp., Protea spp., Myrsine spp., Dissotis spp., Phillipia spp. and the
Loudetia spp.

In the eastern region of Moxico there is a large area of little scarcely meadows, with dozens of
kilometres, that follow water lines, where the Loudetia simplex, Trystachia spp., and the Eragrostis
spp. can be found.

In the north-eastern regions of the Lundas, the meadows are located in the higher spots and forests
occupy the places by the rivers.

The wild jungle bushes are common all over the country. In coastal areas, they occur associated
with savannas and Adansonia spp. and Sterculia spp. woods. In these xerophytes' formations we
can also find Strychos spp., Combretum spp. and Dichrostachys spp.

In arid and semi-arid regions of the Southwest of Angola the Acacia spp., Colophospermum spp.,
Terminalia spp., Boscia spp. and the Dichrostachys spp. emerge.

Although relatively small, the areas of marshy vegetation have a crucial ecological importance.
They appear in alluvium plains of the largest rivers in Angola, such as Kwanza, Kuando, Kubango
and Cunene. Along the coast, in rivers' estuaries facing the Atlantic, mangrove fields appear.

3.9 - AIR QUALITY

3.9.1 - Introduction

Air pollution is one of the most serious issues in the global scheme, and is the result of the presence
in the air of undesirable substances in such concentrations that can cause damaging effects,
concerning the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer.

Although the composition of the atmosphere can be altered by natural causes (such as smoke, ashes
and gases expelled by volcanoes or forest fires, for instance), it cannot be denied that human
activities, especially the combustion of fossil fuels, the increasingly high usage of motorised
vehicles and the urban development, have been the main polluters, by releasing tiny particles of CO,
CO2, SO2, NOX, among others, into the atmosphere.

The consequences of air pollution, from toxicological to economic, are numerous and various.
Materials, plants, animals and people altogether can be, directly or indirectly, harmed by the
contaminators.

3.9.2 - Air Quality in Angola

According to MINUA (2006), the main centres of economic attractiveness are starting to present
indicators of productive dynamism, and therefore, population density, and most times, high
pollution levels, as a consequence of the growing number of motorised vehicles and industrial
sources.

At the same time, there are other focuses of polluting particles' emission, mainly as a consequence
of combustion of solid waste, power generators and oil production.

It is estimated that carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are the most polluting gases. Among
the gases with the most severe effects on human health are the nitrogen oxides (NOx), the carbon
monoxide (CO), the sulphur dioxide (SO2) and small dimension particles in suspension (PM10).

The emission of Particles in Suspension is connected with non-macadamised roads, desert terrains,
long dry seasons, circulating vehicles and industries without gas emission regulations.

Other equally important polluters in Angola are, because it is an oil producing country, aromatic
polycyclic hydrocarbons, existing mainly in areas with oil plants and refineries.

Several investigations by the World Health Organisation, the United Nations Environmental
Programme and the World Bank, demonstrated that these polluters may have a damaging effect on
health, mainly by causing breathing diseases, who affect mostly urban population.

In order to assess the air quality in Angola, is necessary to implement an air quality monitoring
plan, with measurement stations strategically placed throughout the country, so as to establish
criteria and limits to maximum, average and minimum concentration levels that the different
polluter can reach in the atmosphere and to human activities in a specific place, and, based on this
data, promote the territorial management and planning.

3.9.3 - Description of Main Air Pollution Sources in Angola

Although Angola does not have an air quality monitoring network, it can be assumed that gas
emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels are dominant, due to:

      · Circulating vehicles;

      · Power supply generators;

      · Oil production torches, and

      · Forest burnings.

From the sources mentioned above, the motorised vehicles, predominantly in large urban centres,
are responsible for most of carbon monoxide and volatile organic composts emissions into the
atmosphere, once they have grown in numbers over the last few years, for both personal and
commercial uses. The emission of particles and dust (PM10), which is directly linked to these
sources, has also increased, especially in scenarios where roads are in poor condition.

In addition, the massive occupation of residential areas near main communication routes and urban
centre connections exposes great part of the population to these polluters.

Other source of air pollution is the use of electrical generators, particularly in large residential areas,
where there is no connection to the electrical power network or the existing supply is irregular. The
industry uses this power source as well, in order to meet production deadlines. Not only is air
pollution a direct consequence of this behaviour, but also noise levels, which are raised by
generators.

Like generators, the combustion of fossil fuels occurs in oil production centres, which are
responsible for greenhouse effect gases in about 60 plants. Presently, the Angolan Government is
investing in the reduction of gases emission.

Finally, biomass combustions occur mainly during the dry season, as a means of obtaining coal for
cooking, producing heat and for agricultural and cattle raising purposes.

The biomass combustion results in the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx),
nitrous oxide (N2O), methane, non-methanic hydrocarbons (CH4) and particles, besides carbon
dioxide (CO2).

3.10 - NOISE

3.10.1 - General Comments

Noise can be seen as one of the main factors that influence the environment and contribute to the
living standards. The problems associated with noise are often the result of irresponsible uses of
common areas or adjacent zones. The key to effectively solve these problems is an integrated
approach, highly articulated with territorial planning and public space management.

Pollution is considered to be one of the most severe forms of harm to both men and environment.
According to WHO ­ World Health Organization, the human ears should not experience audio
stimuli louder than 65 dB (A). Surpassing this limit may increase the risk of developing:

      · Insomnia (sleeping problems);

      · Depression;

      · Hearing loss;

      · Aggressiveness;

      · Concentration or attention loss;

      · Memory loss;

      · Headaches;

      · High blood pressure;

      · Fatigue;

      · Gastritis e ulcers;

      · Drop in working or learning efficiency;

      · Deafness (if exposed to extremely loud noises).

The longer the exposure to loud noises lasts and/or the higher the sound pressure is, the higher will
be the risks to human health. The hearing loss, one of the most common effects of noise overload,
can be caused by several activities in one's daily routine.

This situation can be avoided by existing sound proof technologies, which involve the development
of specific products, resources to recognise and analyse noise sources, simulation programmes to
help predict the results of a noise reduction and noiseless equipment.

Considering the environmental impacts caused by the alteration of referential acoustic patterns, they
must be considered dangerous only when they affect the living standards of the population. In other
words, when the establishment of a new source is felt by a sensitive receptor.

In general, when establishing a new sound source, it may be required that not only preventive
measures are implemented and an adequate location considered, but also corrective policies about
different forms of insonorization executed. As a result, a balanced sound environment is preserved
by defining noise pollution limits.

3.10.2 - Description of Referential Acoustic Patterns

While working on the Relatório do Estado Geral do Ambiente (MINUA ­ 2006), some acoustic
studies took place in Luanda and Cabinda. These were intended to illustrate the referential acoustic
patterns in specific areas, such as residential, industrial, commercial and intense car traffic zones.

The acoustic studies focused on two referential periods; a day-time period from 06.00 a.m. to
06.00 p.m. and a night-time period from 06.00 p.m. to 06.00 a.m.

When analysing the acoustic studies was observed that LAeq (level of permanent equivalent sound
pressure, discussed in A ­ ISO 1996­1:1982) levels in commercial areas and in zones near main
highways were over 70 d (A), during day-time.

In residential areas, during day-time, the LAeq reached 50 dB(A), approximately.

The night-time observations witnessed a significant decrease in LAeq levels in commercial areas and
in zones near main highways. Generally, measurements revealed levels that varied from 30 dB(A)
to 50 dB(A).

Although the previously mentioned studies refer to a tiny proportion of the real referential acoustic
pattern, it is possible to assess the general quality of the sound environment in two main
components ­ community or neighbourhood's noises, which are due to community's multiple daily
activities, and noises from other sources, like industries and transportation infrastructures. As an
example, Graph 1 shows common LAeq referential values in different situations under the influence
of different sources.

                     Volume 2 ­ Environmental and Social Diagnosis and Institutional and Legal Framework




The quality of sound environment is reflected in rural areas, where few noises are originated by
large focus of urban activity and transportation infrastructures.

Still according to the Relatório do Estado Geral do Ambiente (MINUA ­ 2006), to analyse the
population's complaints about noise pollution, some interviews have been made not only in Luanda
but also in some other provinces.

From all the interviews, the main complaints were connected with the loud noise generated by air
and car traffic, as well as by commercial areas. In general, people enquired expressed their concern
about the quality of their living standards and the environment they live in. A significant proportion
of those surveyed are not bothered as they are unaware of the actual danger it represents to their
health. This is the reason why civic activities for environmental education should be encouraged: to
teach population how to deal with noise pollution issues.

The little available data subject to analyses reflects the increase of noise pollution in Angola that
has been taking place for the last few years.

3.10.3 - Legal Background

Angola does not have defined regulations in terms of noise pollution. Nevertheless, the Lei de
Bases do Ambiente mentions the establishment of environmental quality patterns in urban and non-
urban areas considering noise pollution.

The only existing legal restrictions in Angola are established by the Convenção sobre Aviação Civil
Internacional, which produced the Norma de Certificação do Ruído de Aeronaves. The aeronautical
entity responsible for the respect for of national legislation and international agreements is the
Instituto Nacional da Aviação Civil (INAVIC).

Angolan airports are usually located near residential areas and main transportation routes.

The number of flights and vehicles has been growing permanently, in tune with the current
economic development. The increased number of vehicles is the main reason why intense traffic
and traffic jams have become more frequent. The abundant works, together with the use of power
generators, have made the noise problems far more difficult to solve.

Finding the solution to some noise problems requires effective legal regulations that not only punish
the polluters but also educate the population, showing how dangerous noise can be to the
population's health.

3.11 - SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS

3.11.1 - Demographics

Finding reliable information on Angolan demographics is a difficult task since the different sources
never agree on total population or on its geographical distribution.

The last population census in Angola dates back to 1970, when inhabitants were estimated to be
about 5.6 million, associated with a population density of 4.5 inhabitants per square kilometre. The
results were regarded with apprehension and there was widespread criticism of the methods
employed and the limitations caused by the conflicts in several regions of the country.

In 1975, when Angola became independent, the population was estimated in few more than 6
millions, about 80% of which lived in rural areas. Luanda must have been populated by close to
500 thousand inhabitants and only two other cities exceeded 100 thousand inhabitants (Huambo and
Lobito). The huge spatial unbalance was expressed by the fact that 90% of the population lived west
of a meridian in the longitude of Camacupa (where the geodesic centre of Angola is located),
revealing a virtually uninhabited eastern region.

From then on, Angolan demographics have suffered significant alterations, namely:

      · Hundreds of thousand people leaving the country (Portuguese in their overwhelming
        majority) to countries like Portugal, South Africa, Brazil and Zaire (now Democratic
        Republic of Congo) among others;

      · Angolans returning to their home country after years in bordering countries, mainly Zaire;

      · Rural population migrating to cities to look for safety and better living standard.

In the beginning of the 90's decade, a period of peace when the first elections took place, Angolan
population was estimated to be around 10.7 millions (Monografia de Angola, 2001), about 60% of
which lived in rural areas.

According to the Monografia above, the demographic growth rate during the 90's decade must have
been 3.8% and population reached 14.6 millions in 2000, with 52.1% of young people aged less
than 17.

Throughout that decade, due to the increasingly high intensity of the conflicts, a massive migration
of people from inland to coastal areas took place, with Luanda, Benguela and Bengo being the cities
that, proportionally, hosted more population, and therefore, raised the percentage of urban
population.

least 4 millions. From consulting other sources, such the Ministério da Agricultura e Desenvolvi-

Governos Provinciais, identical situations happen. UNICEF, for instance, states the existence of
18,175,692 Angolans in 2006. All sources are aware that data should not be considered trustworthy.

Considering this situation, it is difficult to comment on other indicators. All things considered, it
can be said that the current growth rate must be around 3%, population aged less than 18
corresponds to 56%, women perhaps represent 51% of total population and that there is a balance
between the number of rural inhabitants and of those living in urban centres and their suburbs.

3.11.2 - Economic Activities

Angola has been experiencing a great economic growth in the last few years due to the cumulative
effect of three factors:

      · Dividends of peace;

      · Increase of production and oil prices in the global market;

      · Better performance of the non-oil sectors of economy.

The end of the war allowed the free circulation of goods and people, the rehabilitation of economic
and social infrastructures and the restoration of hope and trust among Angolan people.

The oil sector is still largely dominant, having reached a total production of over 515 millions of
barrels, with an average daily production of 1.4 millions of barrels sold for more than 45 dollars per
barrel, estimated as a forecast for 2006. Oil represents 57.1% of Growth National Product (GNP)
and more than 80% of fiscal revenues2.

Although the oil sector is still a sheer weight in economy, the recovery of the non-oil sector is a fact
vindicated by a permanent increase in diamonds extraction (with an average annual growth rate of
12.4%), while agriculture, fishing, transformer industry, power, water, construction and services are
growing at a global average annual rate of 10.1%.

The GNP in 2006 reached almost 41 thousand million dollars, which corresponds to an increase of
18.6% (against 20.6% in 2005). The GNP per capita, a synthetical indicator of the population living
standard, was 2,565.2 dollars in the same period (against 1,984.8 in 2005 and 1,265 in 2004).

Even though there is a strong discrepancy in the distribution of national wealth, it is legitimate to
believe that the poverty index (68% in 2000 as in the last Inquérito às Despesas e Receitas
Familiares) has decreased, mainly because better economy and increased investments reduced

unemployment. According to Balanço do Programa Geral do Governo de 2006, the unemployment
rate can have been reduced to 25.2% (29.2% in 2005) and the real growth of average income of
Angolans reached 15.3% (17% in 2005) considering a demographical growth rate of 2.9%.

Other indicators of Angola's present economic situation may justify or be a result of the economic
growth. Public investment in 2006 was estimated to be 1.5 million dollars (a 76.5% increase as in
2005 it reached 850 million); private investment was of 11.4 thousand million dollars; the
cumulative inflation rate in December 2006 was of 12% (16% in 2005); bank credit to the private
sector increased 102%, approximately. The implementation of the Programa de Investimentos
Públicos                                                                                                              ­
­ from which the social sectors benefited in 28.3% ­ resulted in an improvement of population
welfare, with emphasis to Housing, Community Services, Health and Education and allows the
creation of structural conditions to the recovery of non-mineral production.

Nevertheless, this optimistic overview should not exclude a careful critical analysis of agriculture,
the economic activity that uses most workforce. In fact, the contribution of the agricultural sector to
GNP is measured essentially from family production; which is obviously dominant in terms of total
production, however, it is still informal, making the calculation of its indicators based in statistics,
which may include large errors.

The best example is in the considered number of family farmers ­ about 2.2 millions ­ that is hard
to accept if we consider the existence of 16 millions of Angolans and a relative balance between
urban and rural population3. Since the agricultural production estimates are based on statistics than
contain massive errors, it is legitimate to question overall production. Besides that, the investment
in family agricultural production ­ in both extension and investment ­ is still minimal and not as
lucrative as investments in other agricultural activities, such as irrigated fields or large plantations
created by public-private partnerships, which offer a much more positive response4.




3  If there were 2.2 millions of family farmers and an actual balance between urban and rural population, Angola
   would currently count close to 22 millions of inhabitants of which 11 lived in the countryside (considering that each
   family consists in a group of 5 people, which is believed to be a conservative number due to war orphans that must
   have been integrated in families), numbers that exceed those of known statistics.
4  According to Balanço do Programa do Governo, 6% of the Programas de Investimentos Públicos (71 million
   dollars) in agriculture to 2006 was used in irrigated perimeters that do not help family farmers. The Programa de
   Extensão Rural, which is oriented towards the needs of these farmers, was only granted 30 million dollars in 2005
   and 2006.

3.11.3 - The Attractiveness of Urban Areas and the Exodus of Rural Population

The attractiveness of urban areas over rural population makes 2007 the first time in History when
urban inhabitants outnumber rural ones. This is also reflected in Angolan demographics. This
situation is made worse by political and cultural reasons, which lead to undervalued wild areas. This
can be noticed, for example, by the lack of State institutions in small peoples, the territorial units in
which communes were divided since 1975.

There are several reasons that explain the abandonment of rural areas for the last 30 years:

      · The war, particularly during the 90's decade, when the conflict assumed greater proportions
        because cities, with a few exceptions, were a safer shelter;

      · The search for employment or other ways to earn a living or even other opportunities that
        cities, and especially Luanda, offered, despite their poor industrial development;

      · The chance for needy people to get in contact with social services. Even though these are
        inefficient, in rural areas they are nonexistent;

      · Peace since, paradoxically, the post-war allowed many people in rural areas to finally reach
        cities ­ which explains the population growth in Luanda, since 2002.

This attractiveness of cities in Angola has dramatic consequences. To begin with, whereas, until
1975, the proportion between rural and urban population was of 4 : 1; four farmers to one
consumer, nowadays this relation is possibly of one producer to one consumer. In developed
countries, this was made up for by industrialization and an increase in agricultural productivity. In
Angola, none of this happened. The second consequence is due to the first and is connected with the
creation of an army of unemployed that looks for job in informal trade or turns to crime. The third
consequence is related to the explosive urban expansion, without proper planning or basic
infrastructures, which increases pressure over the existing ones, and therefore, contributes to their
deterioration.

3.11.4 - Population Health Status

The population health status in Angola is determined by several conjunctural factors.

The social and medical indicators in Angola, presented in Table 3.6, show a life expectancy of
42.4 years for men and 44.5 years for women. Only 24% of childbirths are assisted by health
professionals, the maternal mortality rate is one of the highest in the world, 1850 per 100,000 live
newborns and the child mortality rate is of 195 per 1,000 live newborns.

Social indicators, such as malnutrition, water and wastewater services access and life expectancy
fell drastically during the war and their levels are still worrying.

3.11.4.1 - The nutritional situation

The nutritional situation has always been associated with the lack of stability and national economy.
After 2002, the nutritional situation has met some improvements. Most of dislocated families, who
lived of humanitarian help, have returned to their homes and started producing for their own
subsistence.

Although data concerning family consumerism is inexistent, it can be said that the return of part of
the population to agricultural production regions has been increasing the available food. Even
though there are still some restricting factors, the rise of agricultural production has registered a
positive evolution in the 2002­2004 period.

In 2001, the impact of global chronic malnutrition among children under 5 years old was of 45%.
This indicator is of a structural kind and expresses the long periods of starvation these children
experienced, during their upbringing.

3.11.4.2 - Water supply and wastewater services

The lack of investment to improve general access to drinking water and wastewater services has had
a negative effect on the population health, especially on the rise of contagious diseases.

Table 3.8 shows the distribution of drinking water and wastewater services accessibility by the
population. Even though the percentage of supplied population has slightly increased, this has not
been manifested by a decrease in contagious diseases propagation rates.

According to the Ministério da Energia e Águas e do Ambiente e Urbanismo, in 2002 and 2003,
these indicators were respectively 62% and 68.5% for water supply access and 59% and 78%
concerning proper wastewater services access.

3.11.4.3 - Morbidity

The Angolan noso­epidemiological table is dominated by the presence of infectious and parasitic
diseases, 80% of which are considered contagious. Out of these, three represent over 90% of all
diseases: malaria, acute breathing diseases and acute diarrhoeal diseases..

Malaria is the first cause of disease and, most times, represents over 80% of all cases of contagious
diseases (Table 3.8).

The HIV / AIDS is currently the most serious pandemic. The real dimension of this disease in
Angola is not properly determined due to the poor epidemiological vigilance and the lack of means
of diagnosis. The few known cases are merely notified in the different hospital centres.

Concerning the transmission means, the Figure 3.7 shows the following distribution:

Based on the results of multiple clinical reports and case notification sheets, the main means of
transmission in Angola is, as in other Sub-Saharan Africa countries, heterosexual relations (51.5%).
This situation can be explained by the common sexual relations with multiple partners and by the
inconsistent use of contraceptives during occasional relations.

The ratio between men and women is approximately the same, which confirms the data from
clinical reports and case notification sheets, where the majority of reported cases are infected
through heterosexual relations. The second way of transmission results from the usage of non­
sterilised equipment (16%), which is presumably because of the insufficient respect for biosecurity
rules in health services.

An equally important way of transmission is still blood transfusion, responsible for 15% of the
registered cases. This high infection rate is linked with the limited safety policies in transfusions
that are only respected in capitals of province.

The HIV / AIDS prevalence rate, estimated to be 4.1% in 2003, is relatively low when compared
with the dramatic figures in Austral Africa, the world's subregion that is most affected by this
epidemic.

An enquiry from 2004, based on tests to 12,000 women who attended pre-natal appointments in the
18 provinces of the country revealed that only 2.8% were infected, which leads to a total rate of 5%
HIV infected (Figure 3.8).

    Predominance of HIV Infected Pregnant Women Attended in Pre-natal Appointments

The low HIV prevalence rate is an opportunity to launch an effective programme to control this
pandemic.

The Plano Nacional do Combate ao HIV / SIDA made, in January 2004, an important move in the
fight against HIV / AIDS. The 5-year strategic plan, which is worth 160 million dollars, counts on
the collaboration of the United Nations, focuses in prevention and reinforcement of institutional
capabilities to aid the infected population.

The main factors of the epidemic, in Angola, are:

      · The population mobility;

      · The low coverage of the National Health Service.



18307md_ing_a.doc                                                                                             56/145

                     Volume 2 ­ Environmental and Social Diagnosis and Institutional and Legal Framework




     POPULATION MOBILITY


       The end of the hostilities, led to significant population migrations, both internally and
       through the borders with neighbouring countries, including the demobilised, the exiled and
       the refugees.

       In addition, the reopening of roads increased the number of lorry drivers who commute in
       the inter-provincial road network. This social group, due to the demands of its professional
       activity, spends significant time periods away from home, which increases chance for
       occasional sexual relations and multiple partners.


     LOW COVERAGE OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE


       Another important consequence of the three decades of war was the destruction of health
       services' infrastructures, reducing the total coverage of the services in nearly 50%.

       Concerning the number of doctors, estimates point out to a proportion of 5 doctors per
       100,000 inhabitants (UNDP, HDR, 2004). In 2003, the Instituto Nacional de Estatística and
       UNICEF estimated that pre-natal care covered 66% of the population and had an attendance
       under 40%. The same source states that about 45% of childbirths are assisted by health
       professionals in national health system structures.

       A determinant reason why health services access rates are so low and their quality so poor is
       the insufficient State funding for social expenses. The few available health funds are split
       into provincial state budget units and scattered by a large number of policies, programmes
       and subsectorial plans, without a master plan for the whole sector.

3.11.4.4 - Mortality

The mortality patterns resembles the morbidity pattern, where the epidemiological profile indicates
that malaria, acute breathing diseases and acute diarrhoeal diseases represent over 80% of death
causes among Angolan population.

The maternal mortality rate is one of the highest in the globe (1 850 per 100,000 childbirths).

Between the main maternal mortality causes we can find:

     · Low level of maternal education,

     · Low nutritional level;

     · High fertility;

18307md_ing_a.doc                                                                                           57/145

      · Short break between pregnancies;

      · Early pregnancies;

      · Little pre-natal care;

      · High percentage of domestic childbirths (institutional childbirths = 22.5%) due to
        geographical and economical reasons.

The Direct Causes of Obstetrical Death are the following:

      · Haemorrhages...............................................................................................            33%

      · Unsafe Abortions..........................................................................................             24%

      · Septicaemias.................................................................................................          17%

      · Toxaemias.....................................................................................................         14%

      · Uterine ruptures............................................................................................            9%

      · Others ...........................................................................................................      3%

According to UNICEF, Angola has the third highest children mortality rate, 250 deaths per 1,000
children, because of malaria, acute breathing diseases, acute diarrhoeal diseases, measles and
neonatal tetanus. Malnutrition is also an important factor, which is estimated to affect almost half of
the 7.4 millions of Angolan children.

The World Health Organisation advised, in 1984, that a Reproductive Health component should be
integrated in the Mother-Child-Health programme, in 70 centres in 8 capitals of province. In fact,
the number of centres has increased ever since.

A Plano Estratégico Nacional de Saúde Reprodutiva 2002­2007, whose goals are to invert the
currently high mother or child mortality rates, has been implemented. The institutional coverage of
childbirths is very low, with only 22.5% of childbirths that take place in Hospitals. The
overwhelming majority are performed by traditional midwifes. Concerning professionally assisted
childbirths, from 2001 and 2003, the estimated total number of childbirths experienced a small
reduction (24% and 22.5%, respectively. These numbers reveal a poor pre-natal coverage).

It is important to highlight that the available data comes from many different sources, such as the
Ministério da Reinserção Social, Defesa, Interior e Antigos Combatentes and the health sector itself.
It is estimated that there are about 70,000 carriers of physical disabilities. Out of 1,000 men, 28 are
carriers of physical disabilities, whereas out of 1,000 women, 19 are carriers of physical
deficiencies, a lower number to some extent.

The percentage of physically disabled population is slightly higher in rural areas than in urban
centres, 3.2% against 2.4%.

The majority of carriers of physical disabilities are soldiers, with amputations followed by
locomotion disabilities as the most representatives.

3.11.4.6 - Information and education about health conditions

The health education is an essential component of Primary Health Care, through disease prevention
and the promotion of a healthy behaviour and lifestyle. The population mobilization and awareness
relies on insufficient information.

3.11.4.7 - The health system

The health system in Angola comprises the Serviço Nacional de Saúde, under the orientation and
regulation of the Ministério da Saúde, which has a service network in all provinces, organised in
three attention levels; the primary level, with Health Posts, Health Centres and Municipal Hospitals;
the second level, with General Hospitals, that assures professional assistance; and the third level,
with Central Hospitals that offer a specialised medical assistance. There is, as well, a military
subsystem that consists in an Central Hospital and several Regional Hospitals (Figure 3.10 ).

                       Organisation Levels of the Serviço Nacional de Saúde

The structure of each level is the following:

      · The 1st level integrates approximately 228 municipal hospitals and referential health
        centres, 1,453 health posts and an indefinite amount of community promoters;

      · The 2nd level comprises 32 general hospitals, including provincial hospitals;

      · The 3rd level is formed by 8 specialised central hospitals.

The private sector holds a small but strong health services network that serves the workers in oil
and diamond extraction companies and their families and, at some extent, public administration
through contracts.

According to the Ministério da Saúde, Angola counts with about a total of 28,000 health
professionals, namely 1,458 doctors and 26,500 nurses unevenly distributed throughout the country.
The concentration is higher in coastal areas and in their capitals of province. In Luanda, 70% of
doctors and 30% of nurses can be found..

Besides this irregular distribution, the low salaries do not encourage the improvement of the quality
of the services and do nothing to prevent professionals from joining the private sector, a tendency
that has increased over the past years.

3.11.5 - Infrastructures

3.11.5.1 - Water and wastewater

According to Relatório de Desenvolvimento Humano de 2006 of the Programa das Nações Unidas
(PNUD), the Angolan average water consumption per capita is of 20­30 litres/day, whereas the
World Health Organization recommends at least 40 litres/day/person as the minimum limit.

Water and wastewater infrastructures, as well as others, find themselves in poor condition due to
war conflicts and lack of proper maintenance. Because of their colonial origin, these infrastructures
are mainly located in urban centres, serving only a small proportion of the population and have
stopped working for the reasons mentioned above.

The cities of Luanda, Lobito and Benguela have seen their systems improved by interventions that
increased the distribution volumes. The systems of Lubango and Namibe work on an irregular basis
due to repeated breakdowns and low production level. In the city of Malange, the water supply
system is undergoing rehabilitation as part of MPER. In the remaining capitals of province, there
are deteriorated systems that have experienced isolated interventions and do not guarantee a regular
water supply to the majority of the population.

In the city of Luanda, there are four water systems: Kifangondo I and II, through Bengo, and
Southeast Luanda and Casseque, both in Viana through Kwanza; as well as three treatment plants in
Kifangondo, Kikuxi and South Luanda.

In municipal cities, the intake and distribution infrastructures are more concerning issues, since
systems have rarely been rehabilitated, mainly as part of the Programa de Aumento e Melhoria de
Oferta de Serviços Sociais Básicos. In some other cases, systems have had support from NGO's.

In suburban and rural areas, the access to drinking water is minimal and happens essentially through
water spots (wells) and fountains, many of them installed with NGO's and UNICEF's support.
Table 3.12 provides a brief description of the situation.

According to these numbers, only 9.7 millions of Angolans have access to piped drinking water,
wells or fountains, which represents 60% of total population if we estimate it to be around 16




5  The average per capita was estimated by the Ministério da Energia e Águas, for an urban population of seven
   millions of inhabitants. These numbers are underestimated by the reasons mentioned in Section 3.8.1.

      · Rehabilitation of the water distribution system in Luanda, concerning the plateau and the
        industrial zone of Viana, the water treatment plant in Kifangondo, worth 20 millions of
        euros, initiated in 2006 and expected to be finished by the end of 2008 (afterwards, a phase
        II, costing 30 million dollars, will begin);

      · Partial Rehabilitation of the water supply system in Luanda (phase I), costing 44.7 million
        dollars, which is 64% completed and expected to be finished June 2007;

      · Piping renovation of 300 kilometres of conducts and construction of 300 fountains in
        several municips of Luanda.

In the end of June, the government approved a water supply programme to rural population that
consists in the rehabilitation of intake, reserve and distribution systems so as to provide municipal
centres, communes and, especially, schools and health centres with drinking water. In rural areas,
wells are to be built and rehabilitated.

Drainage is other serious problem of Angolan cities. In Luanda, the current system was installed
during the 40 and 50's decade and, as a result, is virtually obsolete, even concerning the materials,
which lack solidity, since they dated back to the 70's decade.

A master plan has been made to convert the two systems, pluvial and domestic, to preserve the main
flow lines, which are being misused, and to re-dimension, considering the existing and expanding
areas, in 20 to 30 years time.

Luanda has a new solid wastes collection system, based on public-private partnerships, coordinated
by ELISAL ­ EP, which is associated with seven private companies that are in charge of the
collection service in each of the nine municips.

3.11.5.2 - Electrical Power

The main electrical power production hydric centrals in Angola are presented in Table 3.13.

In addition, most of electrical power is produced by gas turbines, which exist in Luanda, Biópio,
Huambo and Cabinda.

In Luanda, there are the electrical power distribution subsystems of Cuca, Viana, Cazenga, Nova
Vida, Ngola Kiluanje, Congolenses, Mutamba, Golfe, Estrada de Catete and Zango.

       dam. When finished, it will aid the Malata Central in producing power to the southern
       regions of Angola;

     · The rehabilitation of Cambambe central that will also supply the cities of Benguela and
       Lobito;

     · The construction of the Kinfangondo­Mabubas (already completed), Cambambe­Viana­
       ­Cazenga and Viana­Luanda Sul­Cazenga (almost completed); Capanda­Lucala­N'Dala-
       tando and Lucala­Uíje transportation networks.

     · The conclusion of the Gabela­Lobito line, which will guarantee the connection between the
       North and Centre systems for the first time;

     · The repairs in the Gabela­Sumbe line and the Gabela­Porto Amboim connection;

     · The construction or rehabilitation of substations in Lucala, Malange, N'Dalatando, Caxito,
       Viana, Cazenga, South Luanda, Lobito and Benguela Construção

     · The rehabilitation of N'Dalatando, Namibe, Malange, Benguela/Lobito, Huambo and
       Cabinda distribution networks;

     · The rehabilitation of the power network of Luanda;

     · The rehabilitation of the Biópio Hydric Central's substation.

Only municipal centres are equipped with diesel centres, whose power varies from 150 to 1000 kW,
allowing only a poor power distribution to the population. Rare are the communes that have
generators and, in some, those small equipments serve only the residences of Communal

Administrators. In municipal centres and communes, as in cities, no power from private generators
is "sold" in urban centres, unlike what happens to water.

3.11.5.3 - Transportation

The most important transportation infrastructures are:

      (I) ROADS

       Angola had over eight thousand kilometres of macadamized roads in 1975, which suffered
       extreme deterioration for years of misuse and lack of maintenance measures. Since 2002, a
       road rehabilitation programme has, temporarily, rehabilitated, with programmes that last
       about three to five years, 40 to 50% of roads, concerning their paving and drainage. Near
       great influence areas, and mostly in the southern regions of the country, rehabilitation is
       intense and involves the extension of platform to 11 metres, 8 metres of roadway plus 3 of
       sidewalk (1.5 on each side). In those roads, rehabilitated bridges are still temporary and
       narrow and, with few exceptions, old drainage systems of water lines were kept.

       Beside these main roads, Angola has a secondary transportation road network with over
       30 thousand kilometres, under the responsibility of the Instituto Nacional de Estradas de
       Angola (INEA). The extension of other roads, under the responsibility of the Governo
       Provincial, is unknown. The transportation network is denser in the Central Plateau and
       almost inexistent in the East. A rehabilitation project of 748 km of roads is taking place in
       Bié and Malange, as part of EMPR.

       The ongoing rehabilitation works are:

       · Malange­Xá­Muteba route;

       · Kifangondo­Caxito­Uíje­Negage route;

       · Luanda­Porto Amboim route;

       · Sumbe­Gabela­Quibala­Wako Kungo route, with over 234 km of extension;

       · Onjiva­Humbe route;

       · Matala­Matala Connection route;

       · Lubango­Namibe route (completed);

       · Cacuso­Malange route;

       · Dondo­Munenga Connection route;

      · Dundo­Saurimo route;

      · Kifangondo­Catete route;

      · Lucala­Cacuso route;

      · Viana­Catete route;

      · Huambo­Caála route with 22 km (completed);

      · Lobito­Benguela route with 30 km (motorway);

      · Luanda­Viana routes with 10 km (express route);

      · Bridge over the Catumbela Lobito and Benguela;

      · Periferic motorway in Luanda (Benfica)­Viana­Cacuaco;

      · (Bifchquete­Massabi) Cabinda route;

      · Rehabilitation of the Cabinda­Cacongo route;

      · Maria Teresa­Dondo­N'Dalatando­Lucala route;

      · Benguela­Matala Connection route in Huíla.

      The Ministério das Obras Públicas has recently announced the rehabilitation of 114 bridges,
      with no specified type or location.

     (II) RAILROADS

      Angola has four railways.

      · Luanda Railway, from Luanda to Malange, with an extension of almost 400 kilometres
         and a connection between Zenza do Itombe and Dondo, which is being rehabilitated
         (already working between Luanda and Viana) and is expected to be completed in 2008,
         with an expected alteration to the initial Luanda­Dondo­Capanda­Malange alignment to
         avoid the hills near N'Dalatando;

      · Amboim Railway, from Porto Amboim to Gabela;

      · Benguela Railway, from Lobito to Luau, with connection to Zambia and the Democratic
         Republic of Congo, whose rehabilitation begun years ago but has faced some delays. Only
         on the lines between Lobito and Cubal (intermittently) and between Caála and Santa Iria
         (in Huambo) do train transport passengers and goods;

      · Moçamedes Railway, from Namibe to Menongue, although currently it only works until
         Matala.

     (III) SEA ROUTES

      The increasingly high traffic of merchandise (equipment, raw materials and consumption
      goods to meet the needs of construction and infrastructures' repairs) in Angolan main docks
      and the rise of consumerism levels have created serious problems in their capability. In the
      city of Luanda, a dry dock was constructed in Viana to minimise this problem, however,
      there are still great difficulties concerning cargo loading and custom houses' efficiency.

     (IV) AIR TRANSPORTATION

      Angola has three levels of infrastructures connected with air transportation: a primary level
      that comprises 18 main airports; a second level that counts over 20 aerodromes (such as
      Wako Kungo, Porto Amboim, Nzeto, Ambriz, Matala, Xangongo, Andulo and Bailundo)
      and a third level with close to 1200 airstrips.

      The airports that form the primary network are located in all capitals of province, except
      Bengo and North Kwanza, and in Lobito and Soyo. Two other airports (Negage and
      Catumbela) are military bases used for commercial companies in exceptional and temporary
      situations.

      The airports that form the primary network share the following characteristics: regular air
      passenger service; passenger terminals and other assistance services; paved runways;
      alternative power sources; firemen department; handling (airships, stairs and aerotowing
      cleaning and disinfection); customs house and customs police; ambulances; parking areas.
      Only the airport of Luanda has all these services, including the existence of a private
      handling operator (Ghassist). The remaining airports do not offer all the previously
      mentioned facilities. In general, inland airports do not meet the internationally established
      requirements.

      The physical conditions of runways are poor and some are ruined by age, intensive use by
      overloaded aircrafts and reduced or inexistence maintenance. This can be explained by war
      but also by poor planning and lack of strategic thinking that may come from colonial times,
      as all airports, including the airport of Luanda, lacks a master plan. The airports of Luanda
      and Cabinda are the only ones with illuminated runways. All the reasons mentioned above
      show how vulnerable these structures have become in terms of safety.

      In Angola, airport and air navigation services are assured by an entity alone (ENANA ­
      ­ Empresa Pública), in opposition to other countries, like South Africa, for instance.



18307md_ing_a.doc                                                                                           68/145

                     Environmental and Social Management Process Report
                     Volume 2 ­ Environmental and Social Diagnosis and Institutional and Legal Framework




        Angolan airports were relatively well equipped in terms of communication, having 27 NBB
        and 7 VOR on the beginning of the 80's decade. Nevertheless, war and its effects have
        caused some serious deterioration. Nowadays, only Luanda has a ILS (for automated
        landing), VOR and NDB. Seven airports are equipped with NDB: Lubango, Namibe,
        Huambo, Benguela, Saurimo, Soyo and Cabinda. Only Luanda and Cabinda have air
        controllers.

        However, future expectations are good; some projects plan to equip Angola with a good air
        navigation service system that is extensible to international flights, bringing EMANA
        significant profits: five VOR will be installed in Saurimo, Luena, Huambo, Cabinda and
        Namibe, to support the two great international corridors of air traffic; eight more VOR
        (including a new one for Luanda) and a remote monitoring system will be purchased; new
        HF and VHF Extended Range (via satellite) communication systems, which will allow the
        air controllers in Luanda to provide information and instructions to the entire national air
        space, without need for air controllers in other airports throughout the country. The purchase
        of a radar, to increase security and allow aircraft separation in the terminal, is under
        negotiations.

3.11.5.4 - Communications

Angola has a telephone network with 40 thousands clients (80% of which in Luanda), which is
represented in all capitals of province and over municipalities, via satellite, and provides telephone
and internet access. In the next years, this network is intended to cover more 600 locations (mainly
municipal and commune centres and other geostrategic locations).

A project concerning fibre optics telephone service ­ that involves wide band internet access and
television also ­ to connect all cities and most municipal centres across main road and railroad axis
has already begun and is expected to be completed by 2011. Currently, the fibre optics system is
already operating in Luanda, in Lubango­Namibe line and between Onjiva and Santa Clara
(Kunene).

Another project that will take place during the next couple of years is the installation of an
underwater cable ­ that will also allow the fibre optics system- between Cabinda and Namibe to
connect the coastal urban centres. This cable might be extended to reach Namibia, Congo-
Brazaville and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The mobile telephone network consists of two operators: UNITEL, which uses the GSM norm, has
about 2.5 million subscribers and covers all capitals of province and close to a third of

municipalities; and MOVICEL, with CDMA norm, provides 1.5 million subscribers in all capitals
of province and 25% of municipalities.

3.11.6 - Education

The educational system in Angola is characterized by a high demand for educational infrastructures,
in spite of the low literacy rates, which are due to the fact that most existing school facilities are
destroyed or deteriorated.

According to MINUA (2006), the Angolan population is incredibly young, with half of the
population aged less than 15 years old. Quoting the statistics of the Ministério da Educação,
population in pre-school age represented approximately 17% of the population and population in
school                                                                                                        age
(2­25 years old) about 43%.

The available data on the Angolan school system shows that literacy rates are very low, associated
with high school dropout rates (30%) and also high reprobation rates (30­35%). The illiteracy rate
is higher among female population, which has an impact over the educational level of children and
the general welfare of the family.

The United Nations' indicators have revealed an illiteracy rate of 58% in population aged more than
15 years old, in Angola.

The accessibility to the regular school system, which is the percentage of enrolled children in age of
attending classes (6­9 years old), is 56%. This rate is higher in coastal urban centres, where it
reaches 61%. Considering other age groups, this rate increases to 75%.

The percentage of adults that never attended classes is different in rural and urban areas. About 42%
of rural population have never studied while, in urban centres, this percentage is 24% (MINUA,
2006).

Concerning the access to education, there is a huge difference between poor families and rich
families, since only 35% of poor children attend classes in opposition to 77% in rich families.

It is estimated that 10% of the 300,000 children with special needs are integrated in the national
school system.

Concerning human resources and school equipments, it must be said that the academic and
pedagogical level of teachers is low and teachers and school facilities are insufficient.

The future is expected to bring the construction, rehabilitation and expansion of medium institutes
and second and third grades schools, in a total of 114 educational establishments, with emphasis in
the provinces of Huambo, Bié, South Lunda, Uíge, Malange, Bengo, North Lunda, Benguela and
Huíla, which aim to improve the educational system condition.


3.11.7 -  Cultural Heritage

The overestimation of etnolinguistic differences in Angola is virtually pointless. If it is true that the
national cultural unification is still happening, one cannot consider that the concept of nationhood
means or determines ­ as it should be otherwise ­ a cultural homogeneity. Despite all the crises and
conflicts that took place during the 20th century, Angola has still, in contrast to other African
countries, "a population that shares a rich cultural heritage and a common historical past", based in
the Bantu cultural substract of the majority of the population, the authority of Christian religions
(under many forms) and the struggle for independence6. The civil war itself can be considered an
identity aspect, since soldiers fighting for both factions were from all regions of the country, and
therefore, regarded themselves as part of several existing etnolinguistic groups. The geographical
mobility, the urbanization, the literacy and inter-ethnic marriages and fact relationships contribute
to a strong interaction between culturally different groups and to the growing increase of
importance of the Portuguese language as a means of communication and identity.

Even though each "ethnicity" does not have a definite pattern, one cannot ignore the motivating
power of ethnicity as a social consciousness and group identity phenomenon, without
compromising other identities, such as sub-groups, national or international. An Angolan can regard
himself as a member of the Ovimbundu community and, within that group, be identified as a
bailundo or a ndulo. Nevertheless, at the same time, they are proud of being African and integrating
that group, considering cultural ties, such as habits and customs, type of institutions and others, to
many other African nations. Ethnic consciousness, citizenship and national consciousness can, as
you can see, coexist.

The ethnical map of Angola by José Redinha dates back to the 60's decade and the author himself is
aware that facts should be carefully interpreted since some ethnical traits are not clear. There are
also some perpetrated misconceptions that contradict this consciousness. The Ovimbundu, for
instance, are often restricted to the Central Plateau, when they also live in Benguela, Huíla, Namibe
and, rarely, other provinces in the northern and eastern regions of the country, where they have been
looking for job and other opportunities for the last five or six decades. In some provinces like Bié,

South Kwanza or Uíje, for instance, not to mention Luanda, it is not possible to talk about ethnic
homogeneity.

The main Angolan cultural frame is represented by the peoples that claim themselves as belonging
to the Bantu tribes. That can be explained by the influence of different important civilizations over
the Angolan territory: the hunters and farmers from Central Africa's savannah, which are the
ancestors of today's Lunda, Cokwe, Lwena, Luvale, among other; the bovine herders from the
Great Lakes and sandy tropical or semi-desertic zones of Austral Africa, where Herero, Humbe and
Ambo, for example, can be found; and other peoples associated with Congo or Zaire's bassin
tropical forest cultures (where Bakongo are integrated)7.

Nowadays peoples are the result of migrations and interpenetrations, adoptions or absorptions of
languages, technologies, institutions and crops. The influence of Atlantic trade, colonization and
Christianisation have produced some changes but have also faced some fierce resistance still
present not only in today's social behaviour, but also in family organization, market and trade
structures, the way inherited goods determine individual's social and political status, in political
lobbies, ancestor cults and the search for social, economic, and even political advantages in the so-
called magical­religious power entities.

Centralized political structures, such as today's states or kingdoms, defied Portuguese colonialism
until the 19th century. Rarely did these social structures mean population's ethnic homogeneity. The
diffusion of techniques, work instruments, crops from other continents; the adoption of political
institutions and long distance trade emphasise the dynamism of these societies and contradict
commonly perpetrated ideas of isolation and primitivism.

Before the impact of colonisation, the Bantu in Angola were mainly farmers that grew cereals
and/or root vegetables, being the Herero and the Ovambo those who mainly herd cattle, which was
also done by the Nyaneka, the Ovimbundu and the Nganguela, who combined both agriculture and
animal husbandry in different proportions. Besides, specialized professionals or artisans working
with iron and copper or making baskets and cloths or producing beverages could also be found.

To sum up, the Ovimbundu can be said to have become famous for their trading skills, a popular
activity until the beginning of the 20th century, when the end of (slaves, ivory and rubber) caravans
and the Portuguese presence in the Central Plateau made these experienced traders turned to
agriculture, becoming market oriented farmers. The Bagongo, the Cokwe and some Mbundu sub-

-groups were also skilled traders (and, in some way, they still are); together with the Ovimvindu,
these groups have been influenced the most by the western patterns (through State, Church and
trade, which had a stronger influence) increasing their social mobility; the permanent contact with
the DRC, before and after its independence, contributed alongside the previously mentioned factors
to the increased social mobility of the Bakongo; the Cokwe and the Naganguela, on the other hand,
took little advantage of the social mobility mentioned above, and have the lowest literacy rates; that
is also seen in the situation of a few sheperds and agrosheperds (the Ovambo, the Herero and the
Nyaneka) who are considered to be very conservative and reluctant to accept western culture; the
Ovimbundu, the largest ethnolinguistic group in demographic terms, became, in the 50's decade,
the largest supplier of both willing and compulsory workforce to other regions of the country. This
happened due to the arrival of settlers to the Central Plateau, which occupied their lands, reducing
their capability to subsist alone; the Mubundu were the ones that registered the highest number of
mixed race births and the most influence of cultural areas, such as music, food and language, which
has happened due to their closeness to the centre of political power in Angola.

Another significant element of the cultural heritage is the land. Although the market's influences
and population density have caused some pressure over the notion of possession, turning
community (large extensions of less populated) land in individual or family land (where populated
density is higher, urban areas are nearer and there are permanent crops installed), the concept of
land as a gift from God or ancestors ­ a vision shared by common sense ­ is still largely dominant.
It is believed that community authorities have merely the purpose of managing it and passing it on
to the next generations. Though, it is natural to regard land as a production asset in regions where
western ideals and market have a determinant role.


3.11.8 -   Physical Heritage

Angola has 201 classified monuments and historic sites, from fortresses, public buildings, churches
and palaces to archaeological stations, ruins, streets, paintings and stone cravings. The
concentration is highest in Luanda (92), followed by Benguela (30), Bengo (12), Uíje (12) and
North Kwanza (10).


3.12 - MINED ZONES AND PRESUMABLY MINED ZONES

As a result of 27 years of Angolan civil war, the territory is highly contaminated with mines and
other explosive devices yet to be detonated.

Landmines in Angola represent a serious obstacle to every project. Several national (15) and
international (6) mine dismantling organisations and specialised organisations that provide technical
assistance and support to those injured by mines are dealing with this issue.

According to MINADER / FAO (2006), the Angolan territory presents the following distribution of
landmine fields (Figure 3.9).

The Angolan territory can be divided in three different zones concerning the number of existing
mine fields across the country: None, Few and Many. Table 3.14 shows the provinces under the
influence of EMRP that were rated as having Many Mined Zones.

For the seven provinces where EMRP's works will take place, Bié and Huambo are the ones that
present the highest risk, with the largest number of presumably mined zones, 360 and 324
respectively. The municipalities of Andulo and Kuito, both in the province of Bié, are the ones with
the highest number of presumably mined zones, 95 and 94 respectively.

The province Luanda presents a single presumably mined zone, in the municipality of Viana. There
is no available data about the province of Uíge.

According to the Relatório de Desenvolvimento Humano of the United Nations from 2002, it is
estimated that, during the war times, more than a million people have died, hundreds of thousands
have been physically injured and four millions have been forced to leave their home places.

Quoting (MINUA, 2005) "in most cases, there is no record of mining operations nor is their
location known with precision".

The unknown location of landmines has lead to repeated incidents. CNIDAH's numbers indicate
that 26 people have died and 70 were injured as a result of mines, in 2005.

This situation has severe effects over the living standards of the population at many levels, as it
reduces its freedom of circulation, and therefore, increases isolation and separation.

According to CNIDAH (2005) there are more than 4,589 mine fields with more than 142 types of
explosive devices.

During the year of 2005, the results of mine detection activities are expressed in Table 3.15.

Eastern          Presence of sandy covering formations (non consolidated deposits with high thickness, that usually
                 settle in a stratum of polymorphic "grés", attributed to the lower Tertiary), being the most recent
                 covering formed by aeolic sands, whose deposition took place in the Plistocenic). This group belongs
                 to the Kalahari Group, in their lower polymorphic "grés" and upper ocher sand formations.

South Central    Presence of the previously referred formations with an increase, in the South, of the sands of Kalahari
                 area.

HIDROGRAPHY

                It corresponds to a wide transition strip between the planaltic areas of larger altitude at west, and the
                extensive sandy surfaces of Kalahari in its eastern limit. The Kwanza river and their tributaries
                Cuquema and Luango that have a S-N orientation, drain to the south part of this surface of lower level,
North           relatively to the planaltic platforms that they involve, constituting therefore the Alto Kwanza. This
                plain falls soft and gradually to north, ranging from 1520 meters in the higher altitudes, to 1070 meters
                in the confluence of the Luando and Kwanza rivers. In the North part, no residual reliefs occur,
                corresponding to a perfect plain. An important characteristic concerns the extensive wet flood plain,
                designated locally by "anharas", that occur between Cuquema and Cuanza, and develop in a wide area.

                The Central Plateau is drained by the rivers that constitute the two great hydrographic basins of
                southern Angola, Cubango and Cunene, whose headstreams locate very close, at 1830 meters of
                altitude, close to Vila Nova. This morphologic surface is characterized by its typical wavy relief and
                wide horizons, in which the main rivers run in open deep valleys and often with rapids and rocky beds.
Southeast       The secondary rivers, of permanent flow circulate in wide and marshy valleys with meanders. In this
                planaltic morphologic unit plenty residual reliefs occur, whose tops reach the primitive surface
                altitudes.




                It corresponds to a transition area of the Central Plateau for Cuango Cubango, in other words, for the
                semi-arid areas of the south of the territory. This surface is part of the Cubango plain, one of the main
                rivers of the area that starts at the Central Plateau, and crosses it from north to south in its maxim
                extension, being completely involved in its hydrographic basin. The whole surface presents several
South           streams with N-S orientation. The main Cubango tributary is the river Cuchi, followed by Cutato,
                Ganguelas and Cuebe. The whole plain is drained by a dense and tight hydrographic net, forming open
                and deep valleys with separate parallel streams, south oriented.




ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS

Areas of ecological interest        A proposal for the creation, in partnership with the Province of Huambo, of the
                                    Natural Regional Park of Cutato exists.

Fauna                               Currently, no great populations of wild animals (great antelopes, elephants, predators
                                    and crocodiles) that were formerly abundant in the area exist, due to the wild hunt,
                                    habitat destruction and human occupation. More studies are needed.

Flora                               A great variety of vegetation cover types exists, due to the existence of several
                                    biomes, constituted by "panda forest" in well drained soils and by savannas along the
                                    watercourses in the poor drained areas and by marshy grasslands in the flooded areas

                                    The dominant species are Brachystegia sp., Julbernardia paniculata, Isoberlinia
                                    angolensis, Monotes caloneurus Parnari curatellifolia, Pericopsis angolensis and
                                    Pterocarpus angolensis ("panda forest"); Loudetia spp, Ctenium, Trystachia,
                                    Eragrostis, Digitaria Heteropogon, Rhynchelytrum, Syzygium guineense, Parinari

PROVINCE OF HUAMBO


GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION

The province of Huambo is limited at northeast by Kuanza Sul and Benguela, at south by Huila and
at East by Bie. Huambo occupies an area of 34,271 km2, representing about 2.7% of the angolan
territory total area.

CLIMATE

Tropical, with alternating wet     ·    Precipitation between 1100 (S-SW) and 1400 mm (top planaltic center-west)
and dry seasons
                                   ·    Average annual temperature of 19 to 20ºC

                                   ·    Average annual relative humidity 60 to 70%

                                   ·    Classification of Thornthwaite: Mesotermic, humid climate (B1 and B2)


GEOLOGY

East-Northeast  Presence of the Compound of Base formations, in the E-NE and in the eruptive granitic in the
                remaining W-SW (constituted by crystaline rocks of the Arcaic and of the lower Proterozoic).
                The oldest formations that are included in the Compound of Base, correspond to metamorphic rocks or
                rocks eith some level of metamorphization (the granite-gneisses,the ortogneisses,the granites,
                granodiorites, the quartzites and other quartziticrocks are the most abundant materials). These
                formations are only marked in the valleys or in the scarp surfaces, and not considered as outcrops. The
                great rocky monoliths, that form important rocky ridges that can reach the 2000 metres of altitude, are
                constituted by metassedimentar rocks of the quartzites and quartzitic schist types .

West            The mid western side stretches towards the south of Kwanza, and it is composed by a complex of
                eruptives rocks (mainly granites, granodiorites and quartzites).
                On the south side of the Benguela Railway, the most frequent outcrops are the quartzites side by side
                with the granite, while in the north of the railway, the granites are more abundant.


HYDROGRAPHY

                          The Planalto Central morphology includes two plain surfaces divided by a steep slope. The
                          older morphologic unit corresponds to the high plateaus, that show a plain or wavy relief,

                            with altitudes ranging from 1750 to 1800 metres. The rocky substratum is, in the majority
                            of the cases, gnaissoid and it is covered in some parts by thin sand layers. In this plain area,
                            quartzite rocks outcrops hardly occur until 2000 metres of altitude. The large rivers have
                            their origin in those top surfaces, frequently called "anharas". In the north part occur the
                            Queve, Cutato, Cunhinga and Cunje rivers (the former three rivers are tributaries of the
                            Kwanza river), and in the opposite part two, important hydrographic basins of Angola
                            occur, the Cubango and the Cunene hydrographic basins, whose headquarters are located at
                            1830 metres of altitude, close to Vila Nova.

ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS

Areas of Ecological Interest       A proposal for the creation, in partnership with Bié, of the Parque Regional Natural
                                   do Cuato (Cutato Natural Regional Park) exists.
                                   Additionally, a proposal for the establishment of the Reserva Natural Integral do
                                   Monte do Môco (Monte do Môco Integral Natural Reserve) exists.

Fauna                              The fauna of the province was negatively affected by hunt, habitat destruction and
                                   pesticide use for plague control. It is foreseen some level of rehabilitation, namely of
                                   small antelopes and predators, but more studies are needed.

Flora                              The vegetation cover includes forests, at the higher altitude sites (mata de panda) and
                                   savannas along the rivers. Currently, almost all woody vegetation is destroyed, in
                                   some cases replaced by exotic species, such as eucalyptus, resin trees and several
                                   fruit trees.
                                   The dominant species are: Brachystegia sp., Julbernardia paniculata, Isoberlinia

PROVINCE OF KWANZA NORTE


GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION

The province of Kwanza Norte is located in the northeast zone of Angola, and is limited at north by
Uige, at east by Bengo, at south by Kuanza Sul and at south by Malange.

Kwanza Norte has approximately 19,307 km2, corresponding to about 1.5% of the angolan territory
total area.

CLIMATE

Tropical hot and humid                                       ·    Precipitation between 900 (west) and 1500 mm (interior)

GEOLOGY

Presence of the formations of the Compound of Base of the Archaic and of lower Proterozoic that
occur in the bordering strip of the West and South sides, where the rocks of the Solid Old surface
continually outcrop, and on the sedimentary formations of upper Proterozoic that have large
representation, covering again the Compound of Base in almost the total extension of the area. The
formations of the Compound of Base are mainly constituted by gneiss, granite-gneiss rocks and less
frequently by muscovitic schists, anfibolites, calcareous schists and micacic schists, originated by
the intense metamorphism that occurred on the primitive sedimentary rocks when important
orogenies took place in the lower and upper Archaic.

The upper proterozoic rocks are distributed by four groups.

The inferior level, designated by Earthy Group (old Sansíkwa), occupies a central strip in the area,

with N-S orientation, producing a quite expressive relief with altered or strongly wavy forms it is
constituted by arkoses in the base, followed by arkosic schists, quartzitic schists and quartzites.
Almost in the top, an important formation exists composed by limestones, quartzitos and cherts, that
end in thick strata of loamy and quartzitics schists.

The Alto Chiloango and Schist-limestone groups and are less expressive, and the "Xisto-Gresoso"
are found in the remaining south area of this zone. It is represented by a formation of limestone
conglomerate and of cherte in a calcarenite matrix, over several materials of great thickness, more
or less stratified, mainly loamy schists, arkoses and silts, more or less mica and feldspates and with
red coloration.

ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS

Areas of Ecological Interest       Currently, no natural protection areas exist, although forest reservations have already
                                   existed.
                                   In spite of the high biodiversity, no proposals exist for the establishment of natural
                                   protect areas and,more studies are needed.

Fauna                              Few information exist on the fauna of the province but due to the steep relief the
                                   species silvatic have larger defense, so is probable that reasonable populations of
                                   great mammals, primates and a very rich avifauna still remain.

Flora                              Unlike the fauna of the area, the flora is well studied.
                                   The vegetation cover is constituted by a dense forest and humid semi-deciduous and
                                   savanna, with bushes or little bushes (almost the totality of the province).

                                   The dominant species are: Albizia gummifera, A. Glaberrim, A. Ferrugínea, Celtis
                                   zenkeri, C. prantlii, Ficus mucuso, F. exasperata, high Chlorophora, Pteleopsis
                                   díptera, Pterocarpus tinctorius (dense humid caducifólia florest); Hyparrhenia sp,
                                   Andropogon sp, acid Hymenocardia, Nauclea latifolia, Annona arenaria (savanna of
                                   the guinean type).

INFRA-STRUCTURES

Water and sanitation     The existent equipment is currently obsolete in most urban areas.

Electrical energy        The existent equipment is obsolete in all of the urbanized areas. The hydroelectric plant of
                         Cambambe (for energy supply in the province) was rehabilitated however the transport and
                         distribution systems they are degraded or inoperative.

Comunications             Roads: the roads are degraded, needing urgent intervention. National road to Malange is to be
                         paved (still lacking about 60 km from close of N'Dalatando to Lucala). The Lucala-Camabatela
                         section was partly landfilled, but it is still degraded. All the remaining ones are degraded.
                         Aerial: N'Dalatando airport (inactive) and degraded unpaved tracks (remaining municipal
                         districts).

PROVINCE OF LUANDA


GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION

Luanda is the capital of the Republic of Angola, is limited at west by the Atlantic ocean and at East
by Bengo. It is the smallest province with about 2418 km2.

CLIMATE

Tropical dry                                                 Precipitation between 350 (coast) and 700 mm (interior)

GEOLOGY

Two great geological units exist: one includes the rock and crystalline formations of the "Maciço
Antigo" (lower Archaic and Proterozoic) and the other, includes the sedimentary group.

Near Ambriz, the rock and crystalline formations follow the maritime coastline, becoming wider
towards southeast through Caxito, until Dondo. The majority of the formations show a high level of
metamorphism, being included in the "Compexo de Base", and the gneiss, paragneiss, migmatite,
micaschist and the granite-gneiss are the most abundant rock materials.

The majority of the studied area is included in the Kwanza river basin, in which lower Cretacic to
Holocenic deposits outcrop, being the Cretacic deposits included in the interior strip of the basin, in
contact with the "Complexo Rochoso Cristalino" and the Holocenic deposits are included in the
coastal strip.

The lower Cretacic rocks are in general composed by "grés" or conglomeratic "grés", with
calcareous interseam, specially dolimitic calcareous or calcareous marls layers.

The upper Cretacic is widely represented in the Kwanza river basin. The marls deposits and ochre
and red gypsiferous marls with calcareous interseams are the most abundant rock formations.

The Eocenic deposits outcrop in a wide strip that extends from the Kwanza river to the Dande river
mouth. The medium and upper Eocenic are the most represented, composed by calcareous marls.
The medium part of the sedimentary basin is composed by Oligo-Miocenic rock materials, being
the marls the most abundant, specially the clayed ondes with gypsiferous interseams with a brown
or grey to blue color and calcareous marls, that outcrop in wide extensions.

The upper stages of the Miocenic, represented by an alternation of sand and marls calcareous layers,
outcrop in several locations. The formation shows at the top a stratified horizontal stratum of shell
limestone, visible in the base of the scarp that separate the recent formations.

The Pleistocenic sand cover formations "Areias Vermelhas dos Musseques", with great amounts of
quartzitic materials that covered the first peneplain of the Oligo-Miocenic, have large representation
between the Kwanza and Bengo rivers, form the Luanda plateau.

The Holocenic deposits have wide representation in the valleys of the most important rivers, such as
Kwanza, Bengo and Dande, in correspondence with the Kwanza sedimentary basin. Along the
coast, narrow strips of coastal deposits exist, that become wider in the rivers of the mouth of the
rivers.

HYDROGRAPHY

                                           The main rivers that drain sediments to the coast, Dande, Bengo and Kwanza,
                                           have wide and levelled base valleys, flowing trough alluvial plains, that close
                                           to the mouth of river, form wide wetland areas and big lagoons, that play an
                                           important role in the regulation of the flow rate. Some narrowing on the
Bacia sedimentar do rio Kwanza             river's mouth makes impossible exit of the waters, caused by the action and
                                           orientation of the cold Benguela's current that also cause the formations of
                                           sand flats.

                                           The main rivers cross part of the coast peneplain, form large valleys, but do
                                           not form accentuated slopes. They are residual relieves in the southeast limit

Complexo de Base                           and in some areas of the interior outlying limit, as a result of gradual move
                                           back of the sharp surfaces and progression of the inferior peneplain towards in
                                           east. The hydrographic net is relatively dense, but just the main rivers that
                                           have origin in the valleys of the interior, and flow directly to the sea, have
                                           permanent flows.




ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS

Areas of ecological interest        The "Reserva Integral do Ilhéu dos Pássaros" (Ilhéu dos Pássaros Integral Reserve),
                                    located in the Mussulo Bay, require further protection actions.

Fauna                           The fauna was strongly affected by the hunt and habitat destruction, remaining few
                                animals, such as herbivores as predators, but it is still possible to find large
                                population of birds (mainly in the forest galleries along the rivers), reptiles
                                (crocodiles) and mammals (manatees, gulungos).

Flora                           As for the fauna, the primitive vegetation cover of Luanda is completely altered, by
                                human pressure.
                                Currently, is possible to identify distinctive vegetation covers: in the "musseques",
                                grass formations with bushes and trees; in the "catetes", sempervirent forest and
                                marshy grasslands.

                                The dominant species are: Eragrostis superba, Schizachyrium semiberbe, and
                                Digitaria milangiana with bushes, with dominant species of Combretum camporum,
                                Strychus floribunda, Boscia vicus, Carissa edulis and above this stratum the
                                Euphorbia conspicuous ("musseques") and Cyperus papyrus, Echinocloa sp and
                                Tipha capensis (marshy grasslands of the "catetes").

INFRA-STRUCTURES

Water and sanitation    There are three water supply systems (Kifangondo I, Kifangondo II and the system of Kikuxi)
                        and the respective treatment stations.
                        About 25 holes implanted by ONGs exist in several municipal districts that are managed by the
                        local communities.
                        They are several investments in the water supply sector and it is foreseen that until 2008 about
                        60% of the population would have access to drinking water.
                        The Luanda sanitation system was installed in 1940-1950 and is it totally obsolete.
                        The new director plan provide the rehabilitation of the storm water and waste water systems,
                        the rehabilitation and preservation of the main drainage systems and its new structural design
                        for a 20-30 year-old perspective.
                        The operation and maintenance of the reception systems, treatment, supply and distribution of
                        water in regime of public service, as well as the accomplishment of studies and projects is
                        under the responsibility of the Public Company of Waters of Luanda (EPAL-EP).

Eletrical energy        The electricity in Luanda is supplied by the hydroelectric plants of Capanda, Cambambe and
                        Mabubas, that are insufficient for the demand, mainly Capanda, due to transport and
                        distribution problems.
                        It also exist a gas turbine, and thousands of generators that work as alternative sources in most
                        of the companies, services and in a lot of houses.
                        The distribution systems are located in Cuca, Viana, Cazenga, Nova Vida, Ngola Kiluanje,
                        Congolenses, Mutamba, Golfe, Catete and Zango.
                        The operation, maintenance and administration of the electrical energy distribution in Luanda
                        are under the responsibility of the "Empresa de Distribuição de Electricidade de Luanda"
                        (EDEL-EP).

OROGRAPHY

The Province of Malange, inserted at the plateau of Angola, presents three great different areas: the
Drop of Cassange, that occupies the whole Northeast; the Plateau of Malange that occupies the area
to north of the river Cuanza to the scarp that limits the Drop of Cassange and to This and South of
the province the High Kwanza.

The Drop of Cassange occupies the whole Northeast of the Province, growing second a wide strip

in the sense NW-IF, forming an extensive peneplanitude, quite lowered in relation to the whole
surface older planáltica than it surrounds her, getting the dividing scarp to present medium
unevenness of the order of the 300/400 meters.

The Plateau of Malange becomes complete in an immense peneplanitude, that grows starting from
the river Kwanza and he/she extends for North, tends continuity for besides the limits of the
Province, in the call plateau of Camabatela, where the quotas went rising reach its maximum values
of 1 300-1 400 meters.

High Cuanza, corresponds to an immense defined peneplanitude for the river Kwanza and for
his/her great tributary the river Luando, of soft relief, where they mark per times extensive low
plains. The peneplanitude dropped smoothly for north, oscillating the altitude to the turn of 1520 m
in the south end, for 1070 meters in the confluence of Luando with the Kwanza.

GEOLOGY

Lower Cassan- The surface depression of Cassange is cut in crystalline and sedimentary rocks of the Archaic and
ge             Lower Proterozoíco, and mainly in more recent sedimentary formations largely attributed to
               Supergrupo Karroo. Powerful sandy sediments of the Tertiary and of the Quaternary they covered
               again the oldest formations in several places, mainly in the north part.
               Rocks of the crystalline punch, belonging to the Compound of Base, surface in it is worth of the river
               Cuango giving origin the frequent ones fast, being of the type gnaisses, granites and anfibolitos.
               Of upper Proterozoíco they are only represented two groups of Westerner Congo Supergroup, the
               group Schist-limestone and Schist-Gresoso. They are better acted, mainly to west and northwest,
               constituting in that area great part of the scarp surface, that is cut there abruptly. The residual reliefs
               that they rise of the peneplanitude are formed by these formations that begin for a conglomerate and it
               finishes in powerful strata of grés arcosico, usually of color very reddish in characteristic.
               However, a great part of the surface that constitutes the Drop of Cassange is dominated by formations
               of Karroo, of superior Permico-Jurassic age. Here they are represented the Grupos Lutôe and
               Cassange. The first is distributed along the valleys of the rivers Lui, Lutôe and it Bleats, being in the
               base constituted by a tilito, to which layers are proceeded schist-gresosas and in the top loamy schists.
               The Grupo Cassange constitutes the most extensive formations and where it largely meets slice the
               imposing scarp, being of nature gresosa, xistosa or even cleyed . Its colour is a reddish charecteristic
               and the quite varied mineralogical constitution, being the grés micaceos, loamy grés, grés quartzíferos
               and the grés with calcareous cement, the more frequent rock types.
               Of continental Cretacico, in the Drop of Cassange the formation is represented by Calonda, correlated
               with the formation Kwango, that presents in the base a conglomerate the one that fine grés of purplish
               coloration are proceeded, with argilitos collations and of conglomerate. The largest representation of
               this complex gresoso-conglomeratic is verified to northeast and north, constituting the line of scarps of
               Brito Godins-Cuale-Carioca, as well as the abrupt hillsides that define its worth of the valley, in the
               area of Marimba.
               To Calonda the formations of grés polimorfos of the inferior and medium (Kalahari inferior) Tertiary
               are followed that were covered largely for extensive mantles of sands eolics of superior Kalahari,
               whose deposition would have verified in Pliocénico. Such formations, in the drop of Cassange are very
               well acted to North and Northwest.

Plateau    of There are rocks of the Compound of Base along a central strip AND-W, involving to occident great
Malange        part of the basin of the river Lucala, of metamorphic nature, mainly gnaisses, migmatitos and granite-
               gnaisses, with abundant veins of quartz. The largest representation falls to the old sedimentary
               formations, attributed to superior Proterozoíco, corresponding to the Group Schist-Gresoso, more

                recent formations of Congo Westerner Supergrupo, constituted by grés and conglomerate of colors red
                or rosy and still for arcoses, grauvaques, loamy schists and schists siltosos. The grés are the rocky
                materials that occupy more extensive areas.
                In the northeast song of this area, they ponder several covered surfaces for rude deposits no
                consolidated of sands of Kalahari (superior Tertiary and of Plistocénico) that occupy great extension,

                the scarp of the Drop of Cassange.

High Kwanza     And they are the formations of the Compound of Base that happen in the western bordering strip N-S.,
                constituted by gnaisses and granite-gnaisses. Already in the north part, of superior Proterozoíco,
                belonging to the Group Schist-Gresoso of Congo Ocidental they happen consolidated sedimentary
                rocks, no or little metamorfisadas, constituted by grauvaques, loamy schists and rude arcoses of purple
                characteristic coloration. As covering formations, consolidated or no, occupying extensive areas to
                north and in the periphery E_SE of the area, rocks that they are included in Supergrupo Karroo that are
                prolonged for the Drop of Cassange, happen and that constitute the group Cassange.
                In the strip East the covering formations that later have continuity for the interior of the country, they
                are constituted by the formations of Kalahari, in the base designated by the subgroup of the "grés
                polimorphics" and in the top for the "sands ochers."




HIDROGRAPHY

                        The peneplanítude depressionaria of Cassange can be subdivided in two levels. The first that
                        he/she grows for besides the base of the great scarp, it is truly a foot surface, of quotas
                        understood among the 800-1000 meters, of very wavy relief, alternating per times with softer
                        areas. It is the dissected part of the Drop of Cassange, that the rivers cross fast, defining
                        numerous interflúvios. The other surface is followed that of the foot, occupying among 600-
Lower Cassange          700 m. In this the relief is much softer and in her they become complete the courses medium
                        and lower of the important rivers that they cross (Uamba, Lean, Luanda and Lui) her,
                        constituting extensive leveled areas. Such vast aplanação seems to constitute an extensive
                        penetration of the peneplanítude pliocenica that progressed for south due to the erosion
                        remontante of the central part of Congo provoked by the nets hydrografics of the Lui.

                        Under the physiographic point of view the Plateau of Malange becomes complete in an
                        immense peneplanitude, that grows starting from the river Cuanza and it extends for north,
                        tends continuity for besides the limits of the Province, in the call plateau of Camabatela,
                        where the quotas went rising reaching its maximum values of 1300-1400 meters. This surface
Plateau of Malange      seems to constitute the older regional levelling, above which any indicative relief forms of the
                        existence of other primitive surfaces of erosion are not observed. To East and northeast, the
                        plateau is interrupted abruptly by an important scarp that, at inferior level it marks the limit of
                        the Drop of Cassange.
                        In the western part, it is another great geomorfologic unit, separated from the surface superior
                        plains also for a scarp that in some places have unevenness of the order from the 100 to 150
                        meters. The rivers when transposing it originally falls spectaculary, as the one of the river
                        Lucala, in Kalandula, or they win it through successive fast and waterfalls, as it happens to
                        the river Lutete.
                        With exception of the northeast part, that it drains to Zaire, the whole area is included in the
                        Basin of the river Cuanza, with an important one tax, the river Lucala, that plays an important
                        paper in the model of the landscape. Like this, for amount of the falls of Kalandula, the whole
                        hydrographic net, is of permanent flow, circulating the rivers very slowly in bottoms of it is
                        worth of marshy base, forming intrigues, and where a lot of times beds are not defined. At
                        that time of the rains, the low ones marginal they are easily flooded, staying like this for long
                        periods.
                        In the morphologic unit of inferior level, the hydrographic net is dense, but only the rivers
                        that have origin in the highest levelling are of permanent flow. All the others are of temporary

                         marginal along their courses.

                         It corresponds to an immense defined peneplanitude for the river Cuanza and for its great
                         tributary the river Luando, of soft relief, where they mark per times extensive low plains,
                         designated by "anharas", that during the time of the rains flood in almost all his/her extension.
                         The peneplanítude dropped smoothly for north, oscillating the altitude to the turn of 1520 m
                         in the south end, for 1070 meters in the confluence of Luando with Cuanza. In all its vastness
                         no there is to sign the occurrence of residual reliefs.
                         The hydrographic net is quite dense and of permanent flow, belonging in it totality to the
High Kwanza              basin of the river Cuanza. The rivers define are worth very open, with hillsides of soft slopes
                         and very wide base levels, through where the waters circulate slowly, frequently in beds badly
                         defined forming intrigues.
                         Another important geomorfolic unit concerns the extensive plains algae or "anharas", that
                         they happen in the south part, among the river Cuquema and Cuanza, more expressively to
                         northeast, in the drops of Songo.



ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS

Areas of Ecological Interest       Due to the great biomas diversity and ecosystems, Malange is one of the areas with
                                   larger interest in ecological preservation.
                                   It exists in the province the National Park of Cangandala and the Integral Nature
                                   reserve of Luando. However there is already a lot and it intends the alteration of the
                                   statute of these two protection areas, passing the Reservation of Luando to the
                                   category of National Park and the Park of Cangandala to the condition of Regional
                                   Park.
                                   In spite of advisable any proposal doesn't exist for a protection area for the Drop of
                                   Cassange.

Wildlife                           It exists a high biodiversity, result of the existence of several biomas and
                                   ecossystems, however the wildlife was afectada negatively for the hunt.
                                   There is a great concern relatively to the preservation of the Black Gigantical
                                   Palanca, Hippotragus níger variani, species endemica of Angola and only present in
                                   this area.

Forestry                           Malange presents a high diversity florística.

                                   The dominant species are: In the Drop of Cassange,open forest of Brachystegia
                                   longifolia,    Daniellia    alsteeniana,      Marquesia       macrura,  Berlinia giorggi and

Water                    the rehabilitation project exists for construction of a new reception system, treatment and
and sanitation           distribution of water financed by the World Bank, that foresees the installation of 41 km of
                         distribution net
                         All of the systems of water supply and sanitation of the other urban centers and populations
                         find been paralyzed.
                         Only in the municipal district of Malange they can be found 7.000 shallow wells that feed off
                         the freatic sheet , open by initiative of the populations, but without the conditions of demanded
                         protection..

Electrical Energy        The headquarters of Capanda supplies the city of Malange and of Cacuso and in the remaining
                         municipal districts small generators exist about 90 KVA of potency.

Road transit             Road: the net of stays of Malange is constituted by 352 km asphalted, 1073 km of beaten earth
                         and 647 km of trails and pathways.

PROVINCE OF MOXICO


GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION

The province of Moxico is located at the interior east of Angola, being limited at Northeast by Lunda Sul, at

East by Bié, at South by Kuando Kubango and at East by the Republic of Congo and Zambia. Moxico has an
area of 210 051 km2, that corresponds to about 16,8% of the Angolan territory total area.

GEOLOGY

The rocky formations of the Solid Old are broadly dominant in the Alto Zambeze. Therefore the
Compound of Base (Archaic and Proterozoíco inferior), constituted by intensely metamorfized
rocks occupy extensive surfaces forming the plain of the Zambeze, being partly covered by sandy
deposits of the Kalahari. All of the rocky formations of the Compound of Base surface outcrop
beyond the mountainous scarp that delimits the solid of Calunda.

The upper Proterozoic is widely represented in the Alto Zambeze, constituting the Macondo's group
formations, that could be correlated with the Congo Western Supergroup, that occupy wide
surfaces, and extends beyond the South border. The dominant rocks of this group are several color
schists, limestones and finally mica argilites, reaching a total thickness of 300-500 m.

The non consolidated continental deposits are broadly represented in the lower plains, that covered
vast surfaces of the Angolan eastern region and in the Alto Zambeze, such coverings affect the
gneiss formations, in the north and northeast, and the Macondo group, in the south.

Additionally, notable outcrop of rocks of the Karroo exists, from the Stromberg Group, that
constitutes the most relevant relief of the Alto Zambeze solid. It can be subdivided in two subunits:
The lower Stromberg, constituted by earthy deposits and upper Stromberg, constituted by
vulcanites. This last formation occupies an extension of 170 km length by 25 km of width in the
upper streams of the Macondo and Lufuige rivers, with some outcrops in the left margin of the
Zambeze river. The rocks occur under the form of layers, sills and extrusive bodies, are represented
by basalts, trachytes, dolerites and diabases.

The second important unit is the "Anharas do Moxico" that corresponds to impressive extension
surfaces, constituted by vast plains of "herbosa" vegetation cover that become flooded during
longer or shorter periods, annually. This unit extends for about 200 kilometres with N-S orientation
and in equal extension in the orientation E-W, being crossed by some important rivers, but without
introducing any outstanding alteration in the landscape.

HYDROGRAPHY

The hydrographic net of the area is totally included in the Zambeze river basin that has its headquarters in

Zambia, and enters in the Angolan territory at 1163 m of altitude and through 300 km. It leaves to South to

1050 m of altitude, revealing the softness of the relief of the plain where it circulates, with wavy or almost

plain surfaces, largely covered by a thick sandy layer. The river has several meanders, receiving in its right

margin the tributaries Chifumage, Luena and Lumbala and it drains the area of the Alto Zambeze through a

dense hydrographic net, of permanent flow. Luizalo is, after de Zambeze, the most important river in the

area, flowing from east to west, almost without defining a valley and then, after the cascades, flow in a deep

valley downstream, to the Zambeze plain.

ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS

Areas of ecological Interest        In Moxico the Cameia National Park exists, which is one of the most important

GEOLOGY

                 Vast representation of the consolidated sedimentary rocks of the upper Proterozoic, covering the

Dembos- Uíge     Complex of Base formations in almost the whole extension. These are essentially sedimentary rocks,
                 which make up the Western Congo Supergroup, being represented in the area the four groups that
                 composed it ("Alto Chiloango", "Xisto-Calcário" and "Xisto-Gresoso" groups).

                 Existence of two rocky formations: old sedimentary Proterozoic formations (western part of the area),

                 Dominance of sedimentary covering formations .The sedimentary rocks belonging to the Kwango
                 formation are largely dominant, which settle over the Karroo Supergroup formations (at south and
                 southeast) and on the Western Congo rocks (at north and northeast).

                 until the lower Pliocenic, are above the Kwango formation materials.




HYDROGRAPHY

                This area is almost totally included in the hydrographic basins of three important rivers of the north of
                the country: Loge, Dande and Zenza. These rivers flow towards west, and form very defined open
                valleys, causing strong erosive events.
Dembos-Uíge
                The northeast and north strip of the area drains to the M'Bridge river, by its tributary, Lucunga and
                other tributaries that flow towards northeast. The south region is drained by the Lucala river, which
                belongs to the Kwanza river basin.

                In the southeast part of this area, a surface that drains to the Cuanza river, integrated in the Lucala river
                basin develops, presenting smooth slopes, with very open valleys and wide marshy bases. In the north
                part, included in the Zaire river basin, the hydrographic net, as it flows downstream forms very open
                and defined valleys. The rivers have a great flow of water with linear courses and with sharp slopes in
Planalto   do   the end of the valley, as seen for the Cuilo river hydrographic basin, a Kwango river tributary.
Congo           A small part of the zone, which is integrated in the Canda plateau (1000 m), drains to the M'Bridge
                river, until the Atlantic Ocean.

                The main hydrographic net, that divide the great streams is tight and of permanent flow, and it is whole

Bacia      do   integrated in the Kwango river basin, tributary of the Zaire river. The main rivers flow in the S-N

Cuango          direction, but successive captations in the north limit have diverted their courses towards east, causing
                them to drain directly for the Kwango river basin. The same can be seen in the Zadi river, a direct
                tributary of the Zaire, that is almost being diverted for the Kwango hydrographic net, via the Cuco
                river.




ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS

Areas of Ecological Interest        There is a proposal for the creation of the Reserva Natural Integral do Cuango.

Fauna                           The fauna is rich in great mammals that show a high extinction risk, such as the
                                elephant of the forest Laxodonta africana cyclotis.
                                The population of primates is significant however, as their meat is very appreciated
                                by the local populations, they experience a high extinction risk.

Flora                           Dense and humid forest and semi-deciduous with some woody species of 20 to 30 m
                                height (Cuango river area); dense forest sempervirent formations (river margins);
                                open savanna and savanna with trees of 15 of 20 m height (Planalto do Congo); and

5 - ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION IN ANGOLA

Relevant legislation on environment has been published since the end of the 90´s. Special
references have to be made to the approval ­ in 1998 ­ of the Framework Law for Environment and
to the ratification/approval of several Multilateral Agreements on Environment.

In the definition of the Development Objectives for the Millenium, presented in 2003 by the
Government of Angola, two main objectives were proposed within the goal of "Providing
Environmental Sustainability":

      · Integrate the principles of the sustainable environment into the national policies and
        programmes and stop the loss of natural resources;

      · Reduce to half, until 2015, the percentage of people who have no sustainable access to
        drinking water.

The legislative efforts during the last years were directed mainly towards the integration of
environment into the policies of the several activity sectors.


5.1 - MULTILATERAL AGREEMENTS ON ENVIRONMENT

      CONVENTION RELATED TO FIGHTING AGAINST DESERTIFICATION


        Angola subscribed this Convention in 1997 and is preparing its National Programme.

        The main objective of this Convention is fighting desertification and/or mitigating drought
        effects. Each country affected by desertification or drought must then prepare National
        Programmes over Fighting Against Desertification. This Convention includes procedures
        about the utilisation of soils and forest and water resources and enhances the rights of local
        communities as a way to achieve land protection.


      CONVENTION FOR BIODIVERSITY


        Angola ratified this Convention in 1998 and approved its National Strategy and Action Plan
        for Biodiversity.

        This Convention makes the States responsible for the conservation of their biodiversity and
        for the use of their biological resources and establishes rights and duties concerning the
        protection of that biodiversity.

     PROTOCOL FOR BIOLOGICAL SAFETY


      Angola ratified this Protocol in 2002 and is working on the definition of the respective
      national framework.

      This Protocol intends to be a contribution to provide an adequate level of protection in what
      relates to safe transfer, handling and use of modified living organisms.

      In 2004 the Government of Angola approved Decree n.er 92/2004, dated 14th December,
      founded on the Cartagena Protocol for Biological Safety, which defines the control measures
      concerning import, entry, use and eventual production of genetically modified organisms in
      the national territory.


     INTERNATIONAL TREATY FOR THE FITOGENETIC RESOURCES FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE


      The purpose of this Treaty is the conservation and the sustainable use of genetic resources
      for food and agriculture, towards a sustainable agriculture and food safety. This Treaty was
      ratified by Angola in 2006 and engages its subscribers into the                          promotion of an integrated
      approach of the research, conservation and sustainable use of fitogenetic resources for food
      and agriculture, as well as into a fair and equal share of the benefits resulting from the use of
      those resources.

      The Treaty emphasizes the importance of the definition of fair agricultural policies, of the
      reinforcement of the research to increase and preserve biodiversity, as well as of the
      amplification of the genetic basis of the crops to be made available to farmers and when
      possible of the promotion of a more intensive use of cultures, varieties and species under-
      used, local and adapted to local conditions.

      rights and duties of citizens and identifies obligations, infractions and penalties, including an
      annex with relevant definitions.

      Some outstanding aspects must be emphasized:

      · General principles (Article 3): (a) the citizens right to live in an healthy environment and
        to benefit from the rational use of natural resources of the country, (b) the respect for the
        wellbeing of the population, for the protection, preservation and conservation of the

      The principle of prevention must be emphasized, according to which all actions and
      interventions with immediate or long term effects over the environment must be considered
      previously in order to eliminate or minimize their eventual harmful effects.

      Considering its wide scope, the following objectives must be emphasized (Article 5):


      ·  To reach completely a sustainable development in all aspects of national life;

      · To balance the satisfaction of the basic needs of citizens with the capacity of response
        from nature;

      ·  To guarantee the minimum environmental impact of the actions required by the
        development of the country through a correct territory management and application of
        adequate techniques and technologies;

      · To promote the enforcement of environmental quality regulations in all the productive
        sectors and in services sector, based on international regulations compatible with the
        reality of the country.

      This diploma states the explicit obligations of the Government namely in what refers to:

      · Publication of the regulations required by the application of the National Programme for
        Environmental Management (n.er 1 of Article 11) and of the legislation regarding pollution
        control, as well as emission, storage, transport, import and management of gaseous, liquid
        or solid pollutants (n.er 2 of Article 19);

      · Definition of urban and non-urban quality standards related to noise and fuels combustion
        from industrial, agricultural or domestic origin (n.er 3 of Article 19);

      · Development of an environmental supervision system to control the enforcement of the
        environmental legislation (Article 30);

      · Creation of incentives, either economical or of other nature, intended to encourage the use
        of technologies, of productive processes and of natural resources according to the spirit of
        Sustainable Development (Article 33).

      By another side, in what concerns the duties of citizens:

      · To participate into Environmental Management (Article 8);

      · To use natural resources in a responsible and sustainable way whatever their purpose and
        cooperate towards the increasing improvement of life quality (Article 25).

      Taking into account its specific interest for this Project, Article 15 contents are to be
      emphasized, according to which the implementation of infra-structures in the Territory of
      Angola which dimension, nature or location result in a significant impact over the natural or
      social environment must be submitted to a process of Environmental and Social Impact
      Assessment, which will define their social, environmental and economical feasibility as well
      as the methods for neutralising or minimising its effects. This process is the specific object
      of Article 16, which establishes it is mandatory for actions that may affect social and
      environmental equilibrium and harmony and defines the minimum contents of the
      environmental impact assessment studies to base them, postponing for a specific diploma the
      respective regulations.

      It must be emphasized (n.er 2 of Article 7) that the issue of an environmental license is based
      on the result of the Environmental Impact Assessment concerning the activity proposed and
      must be done previously to the issue of any other licenses legally required in each situation.

      Besides, all singular or collective people who develop activities that may affect the
      environment classified in the legislation on environmental impact assessment, must have an
      insurance for civil liability (Article 27), disregarding the objective obligation of those who
      have caused damage for the environment, being or not guilt, through the duty of repairing
      the damages or paying a compensation to the State (n.er 1 of Article 28).

     WATER LAW (Law n.er 6/2002, dated 21st June)


      The Water Law states the fundamental principles of the legal regime concerning the use of
      water resources (Article 1) and applies to inland waters, either surface or underground ones.

      This diploma specifies (Article 3):

      a) Public water domain, general policy for its management and development, as well as the
         competences of the governmental institutions related to them;

      b) Framework of the legal regime of the activities for inventory, development, control,
         supervision, protection and conservation of water resources;

      c) Rights and duties of all the participants in water management and use.

      Chapter II of Water Law refers to the General Principles of Water Management, defining the
      principles and objectives of water management (Articles 9 e 10), to the General Inventory
      and Water Balance (Articles 11, 12 and 13) and to the Coordination and Institutional
      Arrangements (Article 14 to 20).

      In what concerns the uses requiring license or concession, dealt with in Chapter III ­
      General Use of Water, Law establishes that water supply to the population, for drinking
      purposes and hygiene needs, has priority face to other private uses (Article 33­2) and that
      struggle arising from lack of water for meeting different objectives must be resolved taking
      into account the socio-economic profitability and the environmental impact of the respective
      uses.

      Chapter IV of this Law concerns protection of water. According to Article 66, the protection
      against pollution of waters belonging to the public water domain envisages particularly:

      a) To get and maintain an adequate level of water quality;

      b) To prevent the accumulation in the sub-soil of toxic or hazardous compounds that may
         contaminate underground waters;

      c) To avoid any other action that may result in degradation of the water.

      In general, the following activities are forbidden (Article 67):

      b) To accumulate solid waste, remains or other substances, in places and conditions that
         contaminate water or involve risk of its contamination;

      c) To practice any activities that result in pollution or endanger risk of pollution or
         degradation of the public water domain;

      d) To carry on any change in the regime, flow, quality and use of the water that may
         endanger public health, natural resources, natural environment or national safety and
         sovereignity.

      Still in relation to prevention and control, the discharge of wastewater, faeces or other
      substances and any activities that may cause pollution or degradation of the public water
      domain require permission to be granted by the institution entitled to water resources
      management in the concerned hydrographic basin and other competent authorities (n.er 1 of
      Article 68).

      It must also be emphasised that the permissions for discharge must comply with
      modifications and constraints according to public and environmental needs and that their
      owners have the obligation to alter methods or technological processes resulting from those
      modifications and constraints (n.er 3 of Article 68).

      This Law also foresees the existence of regulations where water bodies are typified and
      where the quality standards for effluent discharge are defined, as well as the respective
      means of compensation (n.er 2 of Article 68).

     LAW FOR TERRITORY MANAGEMENT AND URBANISM (Law n.er 3/2004, dated 25th June)


      The purpose of this Law is the definition of the system for territory management and
      urbanisation and of the political action related to them (n.er 1 of Article 1).

      This Law identifies as the main objective of territory management the promotion of
      favourable conditions to ensure the general purposes of economical and social development,
      social well-being and protection of the environment and quality of life of the citizens (n.er 1
      of Article 1); some secondary objectives have to de outsized:

      a) To guarantee an integrated and rational improvement of the space use and favourable
         conditions to the development of economical, social and cultural activities, not
         disregarding the protection of the interests of the territory protection, internal security and
         equilibrium of the ecology and the historic­cultural heritage;

      b) To favour equal opportunities of access of the citizens to collective equipments and
         public services in urban or rural areas;

      c) To adequate densification levels of the urban communities to the capabilities of the infra-
         structures, equipments and services, existent or foreseen, in order to stop degradation of
         the life quality and prevent socio-economic rupture;

      d) To protect and improve the potential and life conditions of rural areas and create job
         opportunities in order to fix the populations to the rural environment;

      e) To preserve and protect soils with natural aptitude or used to agriculture, cattle-breeding
         or forestry purposes, introducing constraints to other uses whenever it is really needed;

      f) To protect the water resources, the riverine areas, the coastline, the forests and other
         places particularly interesting for nature conservation, compatible with the normal use of
         their specific potentialities by the population;

      g) To protect the natural and cultural heritage and value the landscapes resulting from
         human activities.

      Article 1 ­ n.er 2 emphasizes that the purposes of the territory management and urbanisation
      must harmonise with the environmental policies.

      Article 14 is dedicated to the protection of the environment and other values, referring that
      the territorial plans must discipline the occupation and use of the territory, in a way that
      enables the preservation of the environment, the quality and organisation of rural and urban
      space, the landscape and the historical, cultural and architectural values of rural and urban
      communitarian life (n.er 1 of Article 14).

      Then, natural landscapes, biologically balanced, and those resulting from human
      intervention that are characterised by diversity and aesthetical harmony, as well as the
      socio­cultural systems they support, must be protected by the territory management tools
      (n.er 2 of Article 14) and isolated or grouped buildings that are part of the landscape or
      represent historical value and contribute to add value to the space must be preserved by the
      territory management tools (n.er 3 of Article 14).

      This Law classifies territorial plans accordingly to their territorial scope ­ national plans,
      provincial plans or inter­provincial plans and municipal plans ­ as well as accordingly to
      the specific subject of the matters concerned ­ special plans and plans for activity sectors ­
      ­ and also accordingly to the nature of the space ­ rural management plans and urban plans.

      Within the municipal plans, environmental management plans must be emphasized. This
      plans act as regulations and define the rules for protection of natural, environmental or other
      assets, as well as the procedures that citizens must follow for occupation and use of land
      from the natural reserves, in respect for the legislation about land property, environment and
      other relevant issues (n.er. 6 of Article 31).

      These projects must be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Study
      to be submitted to the approval of the public entity with competence on the environmental
      issues (Article 4 ­ 1) and that must be presented by the Project Owner at the beginning of
      the administrative procedure for permission or at the beginning of the project licensing
      (Article 5 ­ 1); the Project Owner must pay for the respective expenses and costs, including
      costs concerning the execution of the public consultation (Article 8).

      The diploma specifies the documentation that the EIA study must contain (Article 6) and the
      technical activities involved in it (Article 7).

      Public consultation is mandatory and must be carried out by the Ministry responsible for
      environmental issues (Article 10). The appraisal from this entity ­ which has to be issued
      within a maximum of 30 days after reception of the required documentation (Article 12) ­
      ­ must be respected, no permission or license relating to the project being allowed if there is
      a negative appraisal of the Ministry concerning environmental issues (Article 13 ­ 1).

     LAW FOR LAND (Law n.er 9/2004, dated 9th November)


      The objective of this Law is to establish the fundamental basis of the legal regime of land
      integrated into properties belonging initially to the State, of the land rights related to those
      properties and of the general regime concerning transmission, constitution, exercise and
      extinction of those rights (Article 2).

      According to this Law, transmission, constitution and exercise of fundamental rights about
      lands which the State may release must respect several fundamental principles (Article 4),
      namely those inherent to the initial property of the lands by the State (integrated into their
      public or private domain), the non-transferable right of property of the natural resources by
      the State (integrated into its public domain) and the irreversibility of nationalization and
      confiscation of properties.

      In the terms of this diploma, no one can be deprived of his right to property or of his limited
      land rights unless in the cases specified by the Law. The State and the local authorities may
      expropriate lands if they are to be used for a specific purpose of public utility (Article 12).

      State may play a role in land management and in land concession according to the following
      objectives (Article 14):

      a) Adequate management of the territory and correct constitution, arrangement and
         functioning of urban agglomerates;

      b) Environmental protection and economically efficient and sustainable use of land;

      c) Priority to public interest and to economical and social development;

      d) Respect for the principles specified in this Law.

      In what relates to concerns about environmental protection and land use, the Law refers that
      the occupation, use and benefit from the land must comply with norms referring to
      environmental protection, namely those related to landscape protection and to the protection
      of fauna and flora, to preservation of the biological equilibrium and to the rights of the
      citizens to a healthy and unpolluted environment (n.er 1 of Article 16), which must be
      exercised in order not to compromise the capacity of regeneration of the arable soils and the
      maintenance of their productive aptitude (n.er 2 of Article 16).

      Land classification is made taking into account the intended purposes and their juridical
      regime deriving from the law (n.er 1 of Article 19). Urban land is classified in urbanised
      land, construction land and land amenable to be urbanised (Article 21). Agricultural land is

                    Environmental and Social Management Process Report
                    Volume 2 ­ Environmental and Social Diagnosis and Institutional and Legal Framework




      classified by the competent authority according to the dominant crop in lands for irrigation
      land and lands not to be irrigated, the type of crop being considered as the most adequate to
      land aptitude and conservation and to the preservation of its capacity for regeneration
      (Article 24).

      Reserves are defined as land excluded from the general regime of occupation, use or benefit
      by individual or collective owners, in function of the commitment to the concretization of
      the special purposes intended with its constitution (Article 27). In total reserves no use our
      occupation is allowed except those required for its own conservation or management; in
      partial reserves all forms of occupation are allowed if they do not agree with the purposes
      foreseen by the diploma that created them.

      Partial reserves include namely (n.er 7 of Article 27) the protection zone adjacent to water
      springs, the protection zone adjacent to dams and reservoirs, as well as the land occupied
      with several infra-structures ­ like, for instance, railways; roads; water, telecommunication,
      oil and gas mains; airports; military facilities ­ and respective adjacent zones.

      If there are expropriations for public utility or restrictions according to this Law in the
      reserves, this Law states clearly that a fair compensation must always be paid to the land
      owners and to other right owners that will be affected (n.er 10 of Article 27).

      The public domain of the State includes, namely, territorial water and their respective living
      organisms, mineral resources, roads and public ways, public bridges and railways, beaches
      and the shoreline, as well as the territorial zones affected to environmental protection, to
      harbours and airports or to military purposes (Article 29). The classification of properties
      (which acts as a declaration of public utility within the expropriation process for public
      utility) or the disaffection of properties from the public domain are declared through a
      diploma issued by the Government or through a diploma which approves general plans for
      territory management (Article 31).

      The State may transfer into local authorities any assets belonging to the public domain, the
      regime of the public domain of the State being applicable to those assets with some
      adaptations (Article 32).

     LAW FOR CULTURAL HERITAGE (Law n.er 14/2005, dated 7th October)


      This Law defines the basis of the policy and of the system for protection and valorisation of
      Cultural Heritage which is considered relevant for the Angolan cultural identity.



18307md_ing_a.doc                                                                                          130/145

                    Environmental and Social Management Process Report
                    Volume 2 ­ Environmental and Social Diagnosis and Institutional and Legal Framework




      Cultural Heritage is defined as the whole material or immaterial assets which must be
      submitted to law patronage due to its recognisable value, as well as any other assets that may
      be considered so by use and tradition and by international agreements subscribed by the
      Angolan State (Article 2). The State and the several hierarchic levels of the public
      administration, as well as the owners or people detaining any of their parts, institutions of all
      kinds and citizens themselves must proceed to inventory, study, protection, valorisation and
      public announcement of the Cultural Heritage (Article 4).

      The legal protection of the material assets integrating the Cultural Heritage relies on the
      classification of those assets, mobile or not, in what relates to their nature and their value
      (Article 7).

      The owners and keepers of assets already classified or almost classified must take into
      account the specific problems of heritage conservation in their policies of fighting against
      pollution at national and international level in order to limit the risks of physical degradation
      of the architectural heritage and must execute all the works that the competent Ministry
      considers necessary for their preservation (Article 14).

      All the cultural assets must integrate a systematic and exhaustive inventory to be carried out
      by the competent services of the Ministry concerned (Article 17). Classified buildings must
      have always a protection zone defined according to the specifications of the Law for
      Territory Management and Urbanism, which is an administrative servitude; before its
      delimitation for each specific case, that zone may be considered as 50 m away from the
      external limits of the building and may include a zone where construction is forbidden
      (Articles 19 and 21). If the classified assets are in danger of misleading, loss or
      deterioration, the competent Ministry must define adequate measures to each situation
      (Article 24).

      The archaeological assets, mobile or not (including archaeological testimonies discovered in
      submerged areas or brought by water) are considered national heritage (Articles 32 and 33).
      The execution of archaeological works referring to archaeological assets classified or almost
      classified or to their protection zones, as well as to non­classified buildings with
      archaeological interest require previous permission from the competent Ministry (Article
      33).

      The concept of Cultural Heritage includes namely natural heritage, defined as the physical
      formations and the biological species or groups of those formations or species that are

      This Law enhances the purpose of promoting the protection of the aquatic environment and
      of coastal and riverine areas, as well as the research about biological resources, their
      ecosystems and the environmental factors that condition their equilibrium (Article 3) and
      applies not only to aquatic biological resources but also to activities related to them that take
      place on land or at inland, estuarine or marine waters (Article 4).

      This diploma contemplates, in detail: fishing management; protection measures for aquatic
      resources and environment; boats and plants for processing, manufacture,                           distribution and
      aquaculture; entities and services to control the resources under consideration; and
      obligations.

      In what relates specifically to the management of aquatic biological resources, some aspects
      must be enhanced:

      · The essential purpose of measures concerning water pollution is to preserve the resources
        and the aquatic ecosystems and to prevent or reduce as much as possible the emission and
        accumulation of toxic, hazardous and/or harmful substances in water;

      · In any kind of activity to be developed through the use of those resources, it must be
        ensured, even before its execution, the least environmental impact over those resources,
        through the submission of an environmental management plan including measures to
        avoid or minimise those negative impacts.

     LAW OF OIL INDUSTRY ACTIVITIES (Law n.er 10/2004, dated 12th November)


      This Law intends to define the rules for the access to and exercise of the oil industrial
      activities in the areas available at the surface or submerged of the Angolan territory, in the
      inland waters of the territorial sea, in the exclusive economical zone and in the continental
      platform.

      This diploma revoked Law n.er 13/78 dated 26th August, which was the main diploma about
      this issue, maintaining the fundamental principle of the State property of the oil resources
      specified by the former law, as well as the regime of an exclusive concessionaire company
      and the obligation of companies to associate for oil concessions. Besides, it obliges the
      companies that hold the concession to take all precautions in what relates to environmental
      protection, namely in relation to health, water, soil and subsoil, air, preservation of
      biodiversity, flora and fauna, ecosystems, atmosphere and cultural, archaeological and
      aesthetical assets.

      of the biological resources to benefit the whole people of Angola.

      This strategy intends to execute actions during a ten years period and so priorities must be
      defined and opportunities must be maximized according to the degree of implementation of
      the activities inserted in the Strategy.

      In order to set priorities to its activities, the Strategy is divided into eight strategic areas:
      research and information, education for sustainable development, biodiversity management

       in areas of environmental protection, sustainable use of biodiversity components, role of the
       communities in biodiversity management, institutional reinforcement, legislation and its
       implementation and, at last, coordination and monitoring.

       The Ministry for Urbanism and Environment created a Unit for Management and
       Coordination of the National Strategy and Plan of Action for Biodiversity, in order to
       promote the implementation of those strategic areas.

Like the institutional units for environmental management, Angolan legislation concerning
environment is very young and so, notwithstanding having been published several important legal
diplomas related to principles and fundamental general policies it is necessary to intensify the field
application of those policies and give special attention to specific regulations.
