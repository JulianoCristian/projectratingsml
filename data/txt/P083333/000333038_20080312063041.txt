2 - THE EMERGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL MULTISECTOR PROJECT
     (EMRP)

2.1 - EMRP'S OBJECTIVES

EMRP's main objective is to help lay the foundations for the long-term reconstruction of the State
Administration of the Angolan Republic, following the next specific aims:

      a) Increase the agricultural income and food security in the provinces most affected by the
         conflicts;

      b) Improve the access to education and essential healthcare in the provinces most affected by
         the conflicts;

      c) Repair and rehabilitate critical infrastructures;

      d) Strengthen the institutional power at all levels to formulate, prepare, establish and manage
         the development of programmes in both medium and long term periods.

The EMRP aims to aid the regeneration of the transport network and improvement of the conditions
of the public services. It is intended to prevent the deterioration of health and the loss of life through
healthcare and other basic services by rehabilitating the services of water supply and improving
public health in cities. It will also help reduce poverty in both rural and urban areas by encouraging
agricultural production and reducing time and costs associated with food transportation from
producers to the market.

EMRP will assist Angola in achieving legal and regulation improvements as well as more efficient
institutions for a better govern. Lastly, it will lay the foundations of mid and long term institutional
and political reforms needed in Angola.

3 - THE EMRP'S ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS

3.1 - INTRODUCTION

The environmental and social assessment is included in the project cycle. It begins with the
integration of environmental clauses in the Project Terms of Reference and lasts until its
deactivation.

During the phase when EMPR is implemented, since it consists of rehabilitation projects, not every
stage of the Project, namely the feasibility study, the previous study and detailed design, are
considered. However, given the Project urgent status, all World Bank safeguard policies will be
respected.

The stage of development of EMPR's different projects is diverse; there are projects yet to begin,
project being planned, and projects in execution.

The environmental and social assessment adopted by EMPR is part of the project cycle and can be
divided in the activities mentioned in Diagram 3.1.

      Relation between the Project Cycle and the Environmental and Social Assessment

The suggested EMRP activities are the following.


3.2 - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS ACTIVITIES

3.2.1 - Activity 1: Project Classification

The project classification is intended to assign the project a category A, B or C, so as to identify the
need for further environmental studies and their level of development.

CATEGORY A PROJECT (World Bank) ­ A category A project is likely to cause significant,
irreversible, diversified or unprecedented negative environmental impacts. These impacts may
affect an area larger than the place or infrastructure subject to intervention. The Environmental
Impact Study of a category A project analyses the potential positive and negative impacts, compares
them with alternative project solutions (including a "no project" scenario), recommends measures to
prevent, minimise, moderate or make up for the negative impacts and improves the environmental
performance. In a category A project, the client is responsible for the elaboration of a report, an
Environmental Impact Study, in general, or an adequate regional or sectorial environmental
assessment (that should include an Environmental Audit, a Risk Analysis or an Environmental
Management Plan, if necessary).

CATEGORY B PROJECT (World Bank) ­ A project is rated category B if there is a chance of
causing negative environment impacts over the population or areas with ecological significance,
including wetlands, forests, pastures or other natural habitats. These impacts are less harmful than
those of category A. These restricted impacts, with few or no irreversible effects, can be easily
moderated in opposition to those of category A. The focus of category B project is more limited
than category A's. Like an Environmental Impact Study of a category A project, it analyses the
potential positive and negative impacts, recommends measures to prevent, minimise, moderate or
make up for the negative impacts and improves the environmental performance.

CATEGORY C PROJECT (World Bank) ­ A category C project has minimal or no expected
environmental impact. After the Preliminary Analysis, no additional Environmental Assessment
action is required.


3.2.2 - Activity 2: Environmental Analysis

This analysis must compile a chapter of the Project preliminary contextualisation report.




24907md_ing_a.doc                                                                                  15/42

                      Environmental and Social Management Process Report
                      Volume 3 ­ Environmental and Social Management Plan




The environmental analysis must simply describe the current environmental status of the project
location, the environmental impacts and the moderating, upgrading and compensatory measures.

It may, as well, establish the terms of reference and the conditions for the Environmental Impact
Study ­ Level 1 (category A rated project) or the referential terms of reference and the conditions
for the Environmental Impact Study ­ Level 2 (category B rated project).


3.2.3 - Activity 3: Level 1 or 2 Environmental Impact Studies

This action is associated with the presentation of a Level 1 Environmental Impact Study for
category A projects or a Level 2 Environmental Impact Study for category B projects.

The Level 1 Environmental Impact Study is done considering the alternative project chosen in
former actions. It must describe the project, provide a full detailed explanation of the environmental
status of the project location, evaluate the foreseen environmental impacts and indicate minimising,
upgrading and compensatory measures. It must also present a monitoring plan to several
environmental components and define an environmental management plan to works to be adopted
by the construction company.

Level 2 Environmental Impact Study shares the Level 1 Environmental Impact Study technical
content but in less detail.

These two types of studies are both an independent report and the results of the studies determine
the project's approval.


3.2.4 - Activity 4: Environmental Management of Works

The environmental management of works is intended to monitor the works in order to ensure that
damaging impacts minimising measures are adopted during the works.

The interventions are performed by the civil construction company hired by the promoter. This
company must agree to adopt the Environment Management Plan presented in its technical proposal
of environment protection organisational scheme and answer the demands of the Work Incumbency
Book's clauses.


3.2.5 - Activity 5: Environmental Management of the Project

The environmental management of the enterprise takes place during the project lifetime. The goal is
to supervise and determine if the environmental concerns are daily integrated on the management of
the project, particularly maintenance tasks. In large works or ecologically sensitive areas, this
intervention must result in periodic reports on the environmental situation of the enterprise.

                        Volume 3 ­ Environmental and Social Management Plan




The managing entity (company or public organism) is held responsible for needed intervention. An
Environmental and Social Management Plan that answers all environmental terms must be
elaborated.


3.2.6 - Activity 6: Public Consultation

The goal of public consultation is to inform all interested parties (citizens, residents in areas
affected by the project and traditional power) about the consequences of the project implementation,
the foreseen minimising measures, the compensations they may take advantage of, as well to collect
suggestions and complaints.

The public discussion is a stage that is included in the Environmental Impact Study process and is
of the responsibility of MINUA.


3.3 - ADAPTATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT
       PROCESS IN FUNCTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE OF EMRP
       SUBPROJECTS

As mentioned above, the subprojects fit in three different stages, which determine different levels of
intervention. Consequently, the following actions are suggested according to the stage of
development of each subproject (Table 3.1).

4 - EMRP ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION
    MEASURES

4.1 - INTRODUCTION

The present Chapter pretends characterize and assess the environmental impacts resulting of the
EMRP implementation, in order to propose efficient mitigation measures for the potential negative
impacts.


4.2 - EMRP ALTERNATIVES

The EMRP proposes help to build the basis for the reconstruction, in the long term, of state
administration at Republic of Angola, inside the development of a group of sub-projects whose
objectives are the increase of basic life conditions in the provinces most affected by conflicts and
the promotion of the repair / rehabilitation of critical infrastructures, in parallel with the strengthen
of the management capacity for the development and implementation of these subprojects,
including namely one important training plan for human resources.

The satisfaction of pretended objectives is based on the involvement, at various intervention levels,
of institutional structures of diverse sectors of Public Administration, with a coordinated enforce
with the help of World Bank.

This is consequently one initiative of the most social, environmental and economic interest for
Angola, with potential advantages an opportunity for creating one future alternative, which will to
the Country, in the long term, in one model of socio­economic balanced and sustainable use of
natural resources, and besides benefits the support of one credible international institution with a
large experience in similar situations.

Considering the problems of the territory development of Angola, the non realization of EMRP
involved loosing one important opportunity enhancement for social, environmental and economic
poor regions, delaying initiatives of urgent character and decreasing the fragile sanitary conditions
and social conditions of populated areas.

     SOIL IMPACTS


      Besides some negative and low significant impacts associated to the land movement during
      construction phase, mainly in the infra-structures for subprojects because there are
      essentially for rehabilitation at medium/long term the impacts are mainly positive and
      significant, particularly in relation to subprojects concerning objective a), because they can
      promote conditions for fight against desertification of agricultural lands and for fixing rural
      populations.


     HIDROLOGY IMPACTS


      It can happen with some probability that some negative impacts, occur not only in the
      construction period, but also during the operation phase, mainly in the case of subprojects
      concerning objectives a) and c), because in the first case, the increase of farmers incomes
      can induce the expansion of cultivated areas and implicate consequently a increase in water
      consumption for irrigation, and in the second case, because the use of water supply and
      sewerage systems lead normally to a increase of consumption of treated water.


     WATER QUALITY IMPACTS


      After the construction period, when some negative impacts could occur near the affected
      sites, there will be certainly positive impacts as consequence of water supply and sewage
      infrastructures (subprojects concerning objective c)).


     ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS


      There will be probably negative impacts associated to this component, during construction
      phase ­ that will involve lost of habitats ­ and during operation phase, because accessibility
      improvements and conditions to fix rural populations, resulting from various subprojects,
      will involve an increase of automobile traffic, degradation of air quality and increase of
      noise levels, that will contribute locally to decrease biodiversity.


     AIR QUALITY IMPACTS


      Negative impacts will probably resulting from various subprojects with different objectives,
      mainly during construction phase, resulting of land movements and vehicles circulation, but
      also locally during operation phase, for the same reasons appointed for the previous
      environmental component.

     PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS


       In this environmental component there will be very significant advantages from all the sub-
       projects, because there will be more accessibility to health services and the increase of
       water supply and sewerage services, and also the increase of agricultural population income
       and promotion of food security, that will involve respectively a significant decrease of
       transmissible diseases, high decrease of child mortality tax and an increase of nutritional
       conditions of people, with increase of resistance to some diseases.


      SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL ASPECTS


       Similarly to the previous environmental component, very positive impacts are foreseen in
       various levels: increase of jobs, increase of productivity, development of the population
       level of education, fight against land leasing and desertification, increase of the capacities of
       by the competent authorities, better knowledge of natural resources, cohesion strength of
       local communities and promotion of local cultural values.


4.4 - MITIGATION MEASURES

Considering the environmental and social negative impacts previously presented, the respective
mitigation measures are proposed:


     MEASURES REFERRING TO BIOPHYSICAL IMPACTS DURING CONSTRUCTION PHASE


       The elaboration and implementation of an Environmental and Social Management Plan for
       each project, adequate to its area characteristics and specification of the best way of reduce
       these type of impacts to prevent the occurrence of some of them:

       In the case of works going without the Environmental Management Plan the following
       general measures can be adopted:

       · According to the dimension and diversification of various components of EMRP, the
         impacts with more difficulties for being measured in socio-economic framework are,
         unquestionable, the "Socio­economic Impacts". In an attempt to overcome the negative
         aspects of these impacts envisaging to place adequately socio­cultural sphere inside the
         global parameters for the project, the following mitigation measures are recommended:

         - Development of significant efforts to inform resident people, in the most complete
           possible way, about the various subprojects that constitute EMRP,

         - Turn available, in appropriated sites, adequate supports to inform inhabitants in order
           they can better understand the realities presented,

24907md_ing_a.doc                                                                                  21/42

                    Environmental and Social Management Process Report
                    Volume 3 ­ Environmental and Social Management Plan




        - Attention and perspicacity of EMRP promoters, in the permanent assessment of socio-
          cultural impacts and design of ways of fight negative impacts and increase positive
          impacts,

        - Large diffusion of information about questions of local project.

        In practice these measures are supported essentially in three types of actions:

        - Information ­ given mainly to local residents about the projects to develop and the
          involvement that is expected to be obtained from people,

        - Preferable local recruitment of workers to this project­ constitutes one of the main
          ways of resident people's involvement on study area; the creation of eventual jobs must
          also take in attention to contract of local people as measure to compensate negative
          impacts on the population,

        - Formation ­ the workers and responsible at the works must be informed of the adoption
          of adequate environmental procedures, with support on procedures established in the
          scope of a correct Environmental Management;

      · The use of some materials for construction and machinery rent should be done preferable
        in the localities nearer the projects, and will result in the increase of commercial activities,
        with immediately direct benefits on the population,

      · The sites of construction works and eventually areas for temporary storage of lands and
        materials it will be carefully limited, in order of avoid the occupation of watercourses and
        ecological sensitive areas;

      · The works sites must have security areas with interdict access, for the decrease of the risk
        of accidents

      · Rehabilitation of areas and access roads affected by machinery and vehicles movement
        and work areas;

      · Decrease of deforestation, vegetation cut, minimum movement of soils scraping for works
        execution, the reconstitution of vegetation coverage being done in each intervention work
        area;

      · Measures must be taken to protected more sensitive floristic unities and with more
        conservationist value that can be affected during the works contemplated in the Projects;

      · Adopted management and monitoring measures about affected areas to recover, with the
        aim of increase, in long term, the floristic and region landscaping values;

      · Cover the deposits of waste and thin materials to avoid in their spreading with the action
        of erosive agents and, eventually, adopt systems of water aspersion on unpaved roads and


24907md_ing_a.doc                                                                                 22/42

        significant areas of uncovered soil during large periods, especially in dry season of year
        and in windy days. Transport the materials, like borrowed land, sand and stones, in closed
        trucks, or with a the charge covered;

      · The maintenance of the operational conditions of machinery and vehicles must be done to
        mitigate gas emissions and decrease the risk of oils contamination, for the lost of oils and
        hydrocarbonets;

      · In maintenance activities materials substitution and equipments, or demolition of some
        infrastructure, the wastes it will be conducted to approved deposit, to avoid its spread or
        mixture with soil, what can be origin negative significant impacts in soil and for the water
        resources;

      · For reduce the physic degradation in water quality define internal roads far away far from
        rivers

      · During construction works, the first recommendation is integrate requirements to the
        contractors that produced wastes. The wastes shall be placed in a final disposal with
        respect to environmental rules. In other side, the works must have a supervision, that gives
        the possibility to implement a waste management correct politic. The following general
        measures can be adopted:

        - The used oils from vehicles and machinery used in Works could be collect. If this wastes
          had hazardous characteristics must be send for treatment by authorized companies;

        - The recyclable wastes like plastics, paper, and metallic wastes must be collect selectively
          and send for the municipal collect system, and the wastes like urban solids wastes;

        - The lands wastes, if its characteristics permits must be used at other works, can be used
          in land regularization, if another works have necessity of land;

      · A general measure is the elaboration of Environmental Management Plan for the works
        phases, with waste management for the wastes produced, including the storage conditions
        in the works site and the transport to the final deposit.


     MEASURES RELATED WITH SOIL IMPACTS


      The measures listed previously contemplate widely the mitigation of soil negative impacts.

      Adequate interventions which permits promote the better possible integration of the project
      in this surrounding and valorise its landscaping integration could constitute interesting
      complementary measures.

                    Volume 3 ­ Environmental and Social Management Plan




     MEASURES RELATED WITH HIDROLOGY IMPACTS


      In relation to agricultural area projects, the relevant measure is the elaboration and
      implementation of an Agricultural Good Practices Manual, which will include measures to
      promote the water rational use, to avoid wastes, without prejudice to crops development
      pretended. This Manual must be elaborated in an accessible language, containing
      depositions applicable to several types of soils in presence and must be publicised
      adequately to farmers in specific information sessions, its implementation being
      supervisioned for technicians of official services.

      In respect to impacts water and sewage infrastructure projects impacts, the mitigation
      measures include control of volume supplied and, if necessary, the preparation and
      divulgation of adequate simple measures with the objective of sparing water houses
      habitations in the public uses.


     MEASURES RELATED WITH WATER QUALITY


      The control of the water quality in the aquatic systems- surface and underground - which can
      be significantly affected by the projects, is a way of controlling this type of impacts. This
      control involves the planning and execution of monitorization programmes adapted to each
      specific case and the elaboration of regular reports during a significant period, which
      permits to assess the evolution of the situation evolution to fundament the decisions
      relatively to some corrective interventions.


     MEASURES RELATED WITH ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS


      This type of measures involves the protection of ecological sensitive zones or ecosystems
      with interest to nature conservation, either by restricting access restricted to this systems, or
      by forbidding some activities in this zone and in a surrounding zone of protection or by
      driving away from this systems the origins of hydric, atmospheric or noise pollution
      (motorized traffic, for example).


     MEASURES RELATED WITH AIR QUALITY IMPACTS


      These measures are namely, to drive away or to decrease the traffic in zones with more
      sensitive the receptors­ hospitals, asylums, baby centres, schools­ or in zones interesting for
      the nature conservation, or to create barriers of trees or bushes for the protection of this
      zones.

     MEASURES RELATED WITH THE SOCIO­ECONOMIC IMPACTS


      The main negative impacts in this context occur mainly during the construction phase, in
      association with the temporary presence of workers displaced from their family homes.
      These mitigation measures include the preference for recruiting local workers for
      construction and local initiatives which facilitate their social relationship with communities
      which in a period of time receive them and professional training actions which enable
      acquisition of new competences and upgrading of life conditions.

5 - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND THE IDENTIFICATION
    OF MITIGATION MEASURES BY SUBPROJECT TYPE

5.1 - SUBPROJECTS ALTERNATIVES

The subprojects integrated in the EMRP are in very different phases of development, so this

analysis must be individual order to take in consider on the effective stages of progression for each

process. So:


      · Taken the necessity of urgent entry into the service of the respective systems, the projects of
        water supply to Kuito, Malange and N'Dalatando are already under construction.
        Considering the state of development of the work, there are no need for alternatives of
        projects in this cases;

      · They are still waiting for selection of proposals presented or contest launching the
        elaboration of projects for electric energy distribution (Malange, Uíge, Kuito, Luena and
        N´Dalatando and part of Luanda), as well as Luanda sewerage and a erosion control in
        Moxico. In these situations there are no alternatives because the studies didn't initiate yet;

      · The others sub-projects are in different study phases, so we are waiting for the development
        of the works to clarify the alternatives.

In any case they are, in the general, rehabilitation and reconstruction works, alternatives with a
significant expression are not foreseen.


5.2 - DOMINION AND ASSESSMENT CRITERIA

Nevertheless the identification of potential environmental impacts are inherent to each subprojects
and based on the local characteristics, there are some criteria that must be considered for the
establishment of the correct assessment of their implications in the environment, namely:

      · The negative impacts on water quality, air and noise will be considered significant if they
        condition the quality levels establish in law or normally used, are very significant if they
        violate the levels established by law or normally used, or if the regions affected are
        important, or also if they occur are in a large time period;

      · The negative impacts on soils are considered significant if important areas are affected,
        namely if the soils are good for objectives different previewed in the projects, and are
        considered very significant if the Projects will affected a large extension of agricultural
        areas;



24907md_ing_a.doc                                                                                  26/42

                      Environmental and Social Management Process Report
                      Volume 3 ­ Environmental and Social Management Plan




      · The negative impacts on flora, vegetation and fauna will be considered significant if they
        result in important damages on the balance of the existent ecosystems, with introduction of
        ruptures and changes in ecological processes, affecting or destroying effectives, diversity or
        stability of populations, animals or vegetal species endemics, rare or endangered or affect
        the natural heritage protected by specific legislation; the impacts will be considered very
        significant if there are great important to the balance or the species affected or if the
        extension of the affected areas is considerable;

      · In respect to landscape, nevertheless is an environmental component with more subjectivity,
        it is commonly acceptable that impacts must be considered negative and significant those
        which determine changes in areas of recognised scenic value , in function of this value or
        rarity, considering the intrusion level resultant, the extension of the affected areas and a
        number of potential watchers involved, and they must be considered very significant if
        those parameters have an important expression;

      · In relation to territorial planning and socio-economic aspects, the impacts will be
        considered significant(positive or negative depending on the sense of change introduced
        when they interfere with instruments, plans or territorial policies previously established,
        inducing changes over the form and living standards of populations, determine changes in
        pattern of mobility, economic activity and employment of populations or when they involve
        large investments and must be considered very significant when the extension of affected
        regions or populations so determines.


5.3 - CONSTRUCTION PHASE

During the works execution the environmental impacts are very similar for the various projects, and
so, in large part, these mitigation measures of negative impacts do not justify the individualization
for subprojects in this phase of EMRP.


      (A) ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

        · Generation of jobs associated to the necessity of human resources for the placement of the
          infra-structures in terrain;

        · Risk of Personal Accidents by presence of the construction yards and materials and by the
          movement of heavy vehicles;

        · Visual Intrusion inherent to the construction of the new structures or edifications;

        · Compactation of soils resulting of the vehicles and machinery movements, machinery
          parking, construction materials deposit and soil occupation by construction yards ;

      · Destruction of vegetal cover and potential habitats with conservationist interest;

      · Accidental spills of substances derived from hydrocarbons (gas oil, new or used oil, etc.),
         associated to temporary storage operations of these substances and of machinery and
         vehicles maintenance;

      · Dust release to the atmosphere, originated specially by excavations and landfills and by
         movement of machinery and trucks;

      · Production and accumulation of wastes; solid and liquid;

      · Increase of continuous noise levels, which can have values in the order of 80 dB (A) to 90
         dB (A), by the use of heavy machinery and by trucks traffic for transportation of materials

7 - INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
    MANAGEMENT OF EMRP

7.1 - INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

It Volume 2 ­ Environmental and Social Diagnosis and Institutional Framework, a first approach
was presented of the institutional framework that may integrate the function of environmental and
social assessment into the organization of Ministry of Urbanism and Environment (MINUA) and of
the relations existing with all the other entities involved in EMRP based on the information
presently available about the staff of MINUA.

The institutional organization presented at this chapter, which is defined in Diagram 7.1, constitutes
a proposal for the integration of the environmental and social component into the development and
appraisal of projects.

         General Organograme for the Institutional Organization of EMRP ­ Proposal

During the execution of EMRP the Consulting Company must lead the environmental assessment of
the Project. When EMRP finishes structures and jobs must have been created to enable the
execution of the whole process.

8 - TOOLS FOR EMRP FOLLOW-UP

Considering the multi-sector nature of EMRP and the numerous subprojects involved in it, it is
mandatory to follow up the environmental and social impact assessment with a data base to enable,
at any moment, to know the stage of a certain Project and the measures recommended for reducing
its more significant potential negative impacts. An example of a table for the data base is presented
next.

By another hand, it is important to follow EMRP with indicators in order to evaluate if the
minimizing measures for impacts are being applied.

To integrate the tri-monthly progress reports the following indicators are suggested:

     · Indicators for subproject follow-up;

     and

     ·   Indicators for the strengthening of capacities.

The first ones are included in Table 8.1.
