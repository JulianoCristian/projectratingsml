This Operational Manual is a fundamental document which describes the general procedures within

the Environmental Impact Assessment Process to follow during the EMRP and specifies in detail

the several stages of that process and the entities that participate in it.


This document has a broad character, its version for each of the sectors concerning the sub-projects

of EMRP being presented at a later stage once presently we do not have all the information required

to prepare them.

1 - INTRODUCTION


1.1 - OBJECTIVE


The present document regards Volume 4 ­ Operational Manual, concerning the contextualisation of

the Environmental and Social Management of the Emergency and Rehabilitation Project (EMRP),

carried on by the SOAPRO/PROCESL consortium, for the Ministry of Planning of the Republic of

Angola.


This Manual is intended to support the management of the process of environmental and social

assessment of EMRP's subprojects, in the Republic of Angola, by contributing to define general

action and procedure principles, so as to safeguard and assure the transparency of future options,

and also by being a helpful tool concerning all intervening entities in the environmental assessment

process.


At the same time, this Manual is supposed to contribute to a participative and equitative process of

environmental evaluation that should be adapted to the available resources of all interested entities.


1.2 - OPERATIONAL MANUAL PURPOSE


The present Manual applies to all integrated EMRP's subprojects.


The considered activities embrace all activities, projects and services that allow the integration of

the environmental and social component in EMRP's subprojects, from the selection of the location

(merely in case of a new construction), the conception, rehabilitation or reconstruction to the

exploitation during the subproject's lifetime.


The EMRP include several rehabilitation sub-projects, namely:


      · Agricultural Development Stations, laboratories and offices;

      · Rural accesses;

      · Schools;

      · Hospitals, health centres and health posts;

      · Water supply network, water treatment plants and water mains;

      · Power distribution networks;

      · Wastewater drainage systems;

      · Erosion control.

                     Environmental and Social Management Process Report
                     Volume 4 ­ Operational Manual




1.3 - OPERATIONAL MANUAL STRUCTURE


The Manual aims to give quick answers to frequently asked questions recording the environmental

assessment process, simply through the direct and easy choice of one of the 3 chapters that cover

the required studies and the future activities.


The Manual consists in 3 chapters, besides this introduction and Technical Appendixes:


    Chapter 2 ­ The Environmental and Social Assessment Process                 Why?

                                                                             What to do?
    Chapter 3 ­ The Procedures
                                                                             How to do ?

    Technical Appendixes                                                   How to implement?

1.4 - OPERATIONAL MANUAL USE


To read this Manual one must follow its logical organisation and consider the entries that

correspond to each chapter.


The Manual conception was developed in such a way that the easy and direct entries avoid the need

of a thorough read and allow the choice of one of the 3 chapters.


1.4.1 - Operational Manual Entries

Chapter 2 "Why?" concerns the environmental assessment process, informing about the needs and
stating the considered principles and concepts.

Chapter 3 "What to do?"           answers all the questions about the project classification, essential

element for the choice of the remaining chapters, and indicates the procedures that result of the
established classification and "How to do?" specifies the methodologies to use, according to the
project classification previously mentioned.

Technical Appendixes "How to implement?" presents Technical Sheets and support material to
practical execution.


References to intervening entities are presented in all chapters.


1.5 - REFERENCE DOCUMENTS


The Manual was created according to the current legislation of the Republic of Angola concerning
Environmental Impact Assessment, namely the Decree n.er 51/2004, from the 23rd of July, and the

PROJECT CATEGORIES (WORLD BANK)


CATEGORY A PROJECT (World Bank) ­ A category A project is likely to cause significant,

          irreversible, diversified or unprecedented negative environmental impacts. These

          impacts may affect an area larger than the place or infrastructure subject to intervention.

          The Environmental Impact Study of a category A project analyses the potential positive

          and negative impacts, compares them with alternative project solutions (including a "no

          project" scenario), recommends measures to prevent, minimise, moderate or make up for

          the negative impacts and improves the environmental performance. In a category A

          project, the client is responsible for the elaboration of a report, an Environmental Impact

          Study, in general, or an adequate regional or sectorial environmental assessment (that

          should include an Environmental Audit, a Risk Analysis or an Environmental

          Management Plan, if necessary).


CATEGORY B PROJECT (World Bank) ­ A project is rated category B if there is a chance of

          causing negative environmental impacts over the population or areas with ecological

          significance, including wetlands, forests, pastures or other natural habitats. These

          impacts are less harmful than those of category A. These restricted impacts, with few or

          no irreversible effects, can be easily moderated in opposition to those of category A. The

          focus of category B project is more limited than category A's. Like an Environmental

          Impact Study of a category A project, it analyses the potential positive and negative

          impacts, recommends measures to prevent, minimise, moderate or make up for the

          negative impacts and improves the environmental performance.


CATEGORY C PROJECT (World Bank) ­ A category C project has minimal or no expected

          environmental impact. After the Preliminary Analysis, no additional Environmental

          Assessment action is required.

                             Environmental Impact Assessment Activities

2.2 - ACTIVITY 1 ­ PROJECT CATEGORIZATION


The project categorization is intended to assign the project a category A, B or C, so as to identify

the need for further environmental studies, namely:


     · Category A ­ the project must be subjected to an Environmental Impact Study ­ Level 1;

     · Category B - the project must be subjected to an Environmental Impact Study ­ Level 2;

     · Category C ­ the project requires no Environmental Impact Study.

The responsibility for the project categorization relies on the Environmental Responsible of the

project promoter. If necessary, they can consult an environmental consultancy company for help.




25007md_ing_a.doc                                                                                                  8/40

                      Volume 4 ­ Operational Manual




The environmental company must then inform the Environmental Responsible of the project or the

project promoter.


2.3 - ACTIVITY 2 ­ ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS


This analysis must compile a chapter of the Project preliminary contextualisation report.


The environmental analysis must simply describe the current environmental status of the project

location and, more comprehensively, the environmental impacts, the moderating, upgrading and

compensatory measures.


It may, as well, establish the referential Terms of Reference and the conditions for the

Environmental Impact Study - Level 1 (category A rated project) or the terms and the conditions for

the Environmental Impact Study - Level 2 (category B rated project).


The Environmental Analysis is responsibility of the project promoter and must be carried out by an

environmental consultancy company.


The responsibility for the Environmental Analysis supervision is of the Environmental Responsible

of the project promoter, who may ask an environmental consultancy company for help.


2.4 - ACTIVITY 3 ­ LEVEL 1 OR 2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDIES


This action is associated with the presentation of a Level 1 Environmental Impact Study for

category A projects or a Level 2 Environmental Impact Study for category B projects.


The Level 1 Environmental Impact Study takes account the alternative project chosen in former

actions. It must describe the project, provide a full detailed explanation of the environmental status

of the project location, evaluate the foreseen environmental impacts and indicate minimising,

upgrading and compensation measures. It must also present a monitoring plan to several

environmental components and define an environmental management plan for the work to be

adopted by the construction company.


Level 2 Environmental Impact Study shares the Level 1 Environmental Impact Study technical

content but it is lesser detailed.


These two types of studies are independent reports and their results determine the project's

approval.


The environmental consulting company hired by the project team, which can be independent from

the project, have the responsibility for the Level 1 and 2 Environmental Impact Studies.

                      Volume 4 ­ Operational Manual




The technical supervision is responsibility of the Environmental Responsible of the project

promoter, who may ask an environmental consultancy company for help. The Studies have to be

approved by the project promoter.


2.5 - ACTIVITY 4 ­ ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF WORKS


The environmental management of works is intended to monitor the works in order to ensure that

mitigation measures for damaging impacts are adopted during the works.


The interventions are performed by the civil construction company hired by the promoter. This

company must agree to adopt the Environment Management Plan presented in its technical proposal

for environment protection organisational scheme and answer the demands of the Work

Incumbency Book's clauses.


The Environmental Responsible of the construction company is in charge of the integration of the

environmental component in the works execution and may also hire an environmental consultancy

company to monitor the works.


2.6 - ACTIVITY 5 ­ ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF THE PROJECT


The environmental management of the project takes place during the project lifetime. The goal is to

supervise and determine if the environmental concerns are being daily integrated on the

management of the company, particularly maintenance tasks. In large works or in ecologically

sensitive areas, this intervention must result in periodic reports on the environmental situation of the

project.


The managing entity (company or public organism) is held responsible for needed interventions. An

Environmental and Social Management Plan that answers all environmental terms must be

elaborated.


The Environmental Responsible of the promoter is responsible for the supervision of the integration

of the environment by the managing company, during the exploitation period. A consultancy

company may be hired to carry out the monitoring and the environmental management, through

environmental performance indicators or environmental observatories.


2.7 - ACTIVITY 6 ­ PUBLIC CONSULTATION


The goal of public consultation is to inform all interested parties (citizens, residents in areas

affected by the project and traditional power) about the consequences of the project implementation,



25007md_ing_a.doc                                                                                 10/40

the foreseen minimising measures, the compensations they may take advantage of, as well as to

collect suggestions and complaints.


The public discussion is a stage of the Environmental Impact Assessment.


The Ministry of Urbanism and Environment will be held responsible for the production of a Report

that reveals the registered participation during the public discussion and its conclusions.


Finally it was carry out two specifics annexes, one for demining, that is a restriction of the way of

soil occupation, and the other one compensation to fit this activity, not always necessary but of

great importance.

1 - INTRODUCTION


In order to mitigate the potential environmental impacts that can occur during construction works of

EMRP sub-projects, in the contest phase for the several works, the Incumbency Book must include

environmental clauses that enable to safeguard the existent natural resources in the work front.


Some mitigation measures are then presented related to the periods Before the Starting of the Work,

During the Construction Works and After the Works Conclusion, which can be integrated into the

Environmental Supervision Plan for each work.


Besides measures presented, according to the nature of each Project, other measures may come out

later that can also be inserted into the Incumbency Book.


1.1 - BEFORE THE STARTING OF THE WORKS


       · Forbid the settling of construction yards near public equipments, closer than 100 m from
         watercourses and in urban areas, in agricultural areas, in the visual basin of viewpoints

         and where it is necessary to proceed to destruction of tree vegetation with botanic or

         landscape interest;

       · Locate construction yards and material deposits in sites with sweet slope and easy access,
        to avoid as much as possible earth movements and construction of road accesses;

       · Define in the construction yards a zone for adequate storage of the several types of wastes,
         while they are waiting for being sent to valorisation or elimination in facilities duly

         authorised for that purpose.


1.2 - DURING THE CONSTRUCTION WORKS


       · Proceed to the storage of combustible, oils and other lubricants, as well as to eventual
         operations of fuel supply and equipment maintenance at an impervious and covered area

         with a system to collect and treat the effluents;

       · Allow oil change only for small equipment required by the construction activities, an
         impervious defined area for that purpose having to be foreseen;

WORKS CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL FOLLOW-UP


MAIN GOALS

Amongst several goals on environmental follow-ups in the construction site, the following ones are

to be distinguished:


      · Prevent visual and noise impact;

      · Control the potential pollution caused by the construction, a pointedly managing the
        produced solid wastes;

      · Control the use of dangerous products;

      · Minimize the effect in road traffic;

      · Information the surrounding area about the construction;

      · Minimize the effects on security of the surrounding population;

      · Ensure the information and training of workers attached to the construction.




ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED

During construction there are some environmental issues that should be taken under consideration

during the environmental follow-up, namely:


      · Noise;

      · Gas and liquid effluent;

      · Solid wastes;

      · Aesthetic effect;

      · Road traffic;

      · Water and energy consumptions;

      · Vegetation and woody areas;

      · Surrounding area.

                     Volume 4 ­ Operational Manual




BEFORE THE CONSTRUCTION WORK

The existing rules must be integrated in documents to realize, namely in launch of contest, contracts

and management of construction work.


Actions forbidden at site construction and surroundings must be explicit, namely:


     · trees cutting around the construction area approved;

     · changes of elements with cultural value;

     · fighter, fishing and wild animals capture and a wild plants recollection;

     · use of products with toxic materials, for example the use of paint with lead;

     · consumption of alcoholic beverage by the employee;

     · use of guns fire, with the exception of the guards authorized.




DURING THE CONSTRUCTION WORK

The environmental follow-up of the construction is a mission lead by the environmental foreman

and consists mainly by 3 aspects:


     · Follow-up the construction taking care of environmental and legal requirements;

     · Organize meetings with the colleagues to identify and solve situations related with the
       subjects above;

     · Establish goals.




TASKS

The environmental follow-up of the construction includes tasks, such as:


     · Name an environment foreman for the construction;

     · Propose an environmental follow-up program based on a study on environmental impact,
       since the beginning of construction until it's closing;

     · The construction site, if referred on the study, must be respected;




25007ax5_ing_a.doc                                                                                3/5

      · Define    means     to   ensure       the   environmental        management program and assure the

         environmental and legal requirements;

      · The environmental follow-up program must include the following information: the location
         of the interventions, the list of parameters to analyze, the human and financial resources

         necessary;

      · Procedures, in case, legal and environmental requirements are not respected;

      · Present monthly reports and meetings, to insure that the environment and social aspects
         were taken in consideration;

      · Identify workers' environmental knowledge requirements;

      · Present a final report on the main aspects of the environmental follow-up to hold back.




ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENTS TO CARRY THROUGH

The environmental follow-up of the construction may contemplate analyses e measurements, such

as:


      · Noise measurements;

      · Quality of air measurements;

      · Types of wastes produced;

      · Costs of the mitigation measures adopted by the construction company.




BY THE END OF THE CONSTRUCTION FOLLOW-UP

A final environmental follow-up report should be presented, by the end of the construction, both

reveling the most relevant aspects and also integrating information and experience collected for the

future.


In this final status the following items could be considered:


      · The mitigation measures adopted;

      · The environmental costs of the measures taken;

      · The measurements taken;

       carefully analysed to all interested parties;

     · population living standards should be improved, in relation to their initial conditions

     · the compensations should not raise tension among local population;

COMPENSATION TYPES


                                               COMMUNITY


                    A compensation in land possessions is awarded to population once any of

                    these requirements is met:

WHEN?                   ·  a definite reduction of the area of common land;

                        ·  a definite increase or decrease (equal or over 10%) of population

                           caused by technical demands during the project execution.


                    The compensations in land possessions must be proportional to the cost of the
HOW?                lost area and preserve the initial life means of the community after the

                    population increase or decrease.

                                            COMMON ASSETS


                   All common assets that provide the population with harvesting, hunting and
WHEN?              fishing    sites    and    water     supply     must  be recovered if temporarily or

                   permanently damaged.


                   The negotiations concerning compensations in land possessions must be
HOW?               opened to all interested parties and contribute to the welfare of the

                   community.



                                               INDIVIDUALS


                   If destruction surpasses 10% of housing area, that person should be resettled

WHEN?              All totally or partially destroyed assets (housing, trees, agricultural goods,

                   infrastructures or land improvements) because of intended or accidental

                   events, must be compensated.


                   The compensation will be estimated during provincial meetings. The goal is
HOW?
                   to improve individual or family living standards.



                                               CROP FIELDS


                   If fields are totally or partially affected by the project, the farmers must be
WHEN?
                   compensated for the inconvenience they have been caused.


                   During the negotiations, the farmer must indicate the area that works as a

                   source of income.

                   There will be a unique compensation tax that will take into account:

                      ·    an assessment of maximum production per acre of each crop;;
HOW?                  ·    the prices of agricultural goods in the market

                      ·    the workforce prices in a replacement field with the same area..

                   The compensation can be based of monetary amounts or land possessions or

                   both forms whether the farmers prefer. It is given priority to payment in

                   goods.

                                    TREES AND FRUIT TREES


                   Since fruit trees hold a great importance in the Angolan diet, especially

                   mangueira, palmeira de óleo, bananeira, etc., cutting down these species
WHEN?
                   should be avoided. Other trees have a high symbolic or cultural meaning

                   (such as mulembeiras) or provide shadow from the sun.


                   A compensation to the landlord must take the following aspects into account:

                      · the fruit price in the market;

                      · the species' production;
HOW?
                      · the tree's age;

                      · the amount of years needed for a plant to provide an equivalent
                         productivity.




                      VEGETABLE GARDENS AND BEE'S COMBS


                   If vegetable gardens are temporary or permanent destroyed. The bees' combs
WHEN?
                   can be relocated and, generally, bees adapt themselves to a new habitat.


                   If vegetable gardens are destroyed, landlords must be awarded the money to

                   buy the necessary ingredients to cook soup for a year, in the nearest town. If

                   the destruction is partial, the compensation must only cover the percentage of
HOW?               the damaged area.

                   The apiculturist must move their combs and will receive the equivalent to a

                   production station per comb.

                    FISHING, HUNTING AND HARVESTING SITES


                   If fishing production, professional or of subsistence, decreases (resource

                   reduction). The compensation should be based on market numbers.

                   Fishing     equipment        owners      will    be  compensated for the cost of its

                   transportation.

                   The impacts on common fishing sites will be treated like community

                   If rehabilitation works cause any effects over income generating activities,

                   such as trade.

WHEN?              If possible, all measures should be taken to keep these activities in their

                   original location.

                   The monetary or land compensations aim to maintain the activities.

                                       BUILDINGS AND LAND


                   If the project requires the demolition of buildings due to their exposure to

                   erosion agents, the resettlement and compensation processes are urgent since

                   families are at risk.
WHEN?
                   The goal is to preserve living standards of the family, before the resettlement.

                   Buildings and land must be replaced by equivalent ones, as living standards

                   should be, at least, preserved.


                   The compensation must be awarded to the person that holds the rights to use

                   them or its property title. Both buildings and walls must be assessed.

                   Buildings and land must be replaced by equivalent ones, as well as

                   production systems and living standards must be preserved.
HOW?               If the landlord prefers to be compensated in money, they should be granted

                   the opportunity to see             their situation carefully analysed. A monetary

                   compensation should be considered if the landlord has an economically and

                   real estate sustaining project, in a long term period, which does not risk the

                   social and economic balance of its family aggregate.




                                   GRAVEYARDS AND TOMBS


                   The construction over burial sites must be avoided.

WHEN?              In case an unidentified corpse is found, the project will prepare all necessary

                   arrangements, according to local procedures.

HOW?               The corpse transfer will be negotiated with family members.

                   Relocation should only occur if no other option is available.

WHEN?              This type of relocation is to be avoided. Sacred sites (sacred woods, cult areas

                   or initiation rites' locations, etc.) must not be relocated. Only when a solution

                   is found, can they be destroyed.


                   The negotiations must be opened to all interested parties, however, it is up to
HOW?               the entity responsible for the sacred site to decided on a proper compensation,

                   which must contribute to the welfare f all community.

HOW?               The compensation must cover all the rite expenses.
