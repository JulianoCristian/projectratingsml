      incomes and promote the food safety in the provinces most\n            affected by the conflict; b) improve access to basic\n            services for education and health in the provinces most\n            affected by the conflict; c) rehabilitate and reconstruct\n            critical infrastructures; and d) reinforce the government\n            capacity, at all levels, to formulate, prepare, implement\n            and manage development plans, at medium and long term. Some\n            negative and low significant impacts associated to the land\n            movement during construction phase will occur mainly in the\n            infrastructure subprojects. Subprojects concerning the first\n            objective have mainly positive and significan impacts\n            because they promote conditions against desertification of\n            agricultural lands and for fixing rural populations.\n            Negative impacts will probably result from various\n            subprojects mainly during construction phase, from land\n            movements and vehicle circulation, but also locally during\n            operation phase. Overall there will be very significant\n            advantages from all the subprojects, due to accessibility to\n            health services and the increase of water supply and\n            sewerage services, and also the increase of agricultural\n            population income and promotion of food security, that will\n            involve respectively a significant decrease of transmissible\n            diseases, high decrease of child mortality tax and an\n            increase of nutritional conditions of people, with increase\n            of resistance to some diseases. Some negative impacts occur\n            not only in the construction period, but also during the\n            operation phase. In the first case, the increase of\n            farmers' incomes can induce the expansion of cultivated\n            areas and implicate consequently an increase in water\n            consumption for irrigation. In the second case, the use of\n            water supply and sewerage systems lead normally to an\n            increase of consumption of treated water."}, "docdt": "2008-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
