INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF IRAN
FOR THE
TEHRAN POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT

REPORT AMD RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN FOR THE
TEHRAN POWTER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $60 million to the
Government of Iran for the Tehran Power Distribution Project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In mid-1969 the Government of Iran requested a loan to assist in
financing the foreign exchange cost of the project consisting of the expan-
sion and improvement of the power distribution system in the city of Tehran.
The proposed loan would be the Bank's second loan for a power project in
Iran; the first loan (247-IRN) having been made in 1960 in the amount of
$42 million for the Dez Yulti-purpose Project. This loan has been fully
disbursed.
3.        A Bank mission visited Iran from April 18 to May 5, 1970 to appraise
the project. Negotiation of the proposed loan was completed on September 24,
1970. The Iranian delegation consisted of: Mr. H. Salehi, MSanaging Director
of the Tehran Regional Electricity Company; Mr. Sahak Sahakian, Deputy
Managing Director of the Tehran Regional Electricity Company; Mr. Omidsalar,
Plan Organization; Mr. H. Nikain, Plan Organization and Mr. Mamaghani, Central
Bank.
4.        In addition to the Power Project and the Education Project currently
under consideration, I expect to make a recommendation for a proposed loan
for a Telecommunications Project for consideration by the Executive Directors
in November, 1970.

5.        The Bank has made sixteen loans, amounting to $497.2 million, net
of cancellations, for projects in Iran, of which $292.6 million was disbursed
by the end of September, 1970. The following is a summary statement of Bank
loans to Iran as of September 30, 1970:

6.        Disbursements on some of the on-going projects have been slow, but
efforts are being made to improve the rate of project implementation. Dis-
bursements on the Road Construction loan (410-IRN) and the Feeder Road Con-
struction loan (411-IRN) had fallen behind schedule partly because payments
to contractors had been allowed to fall into arrears. However, payments to
contractors have now been brought up-to-date, and arrangements have now been
made to ensure that payments are kept current with work performed. A super-
vision mission on the Ghazvin Agricultural Project (517-IRN) has recently
returned from Iran and its full report is being prepered.  Dislbursements on the
Dez Irrigation Project (594-IRN) have only recently commenced. The IMDBI
loans are being committed faster than scheduled, the. iidisbursed amounts
representing commitment or allocation for projects on which implementation
should start shortly.
7.        The IFC has invested $4.2 million in two companies - the Ahwaz
Company producing steel products and the Kahkashan Company manufacturing
ceramic tiles, and now holds $2.6 million. It is considering a number of
new proposals.

PART III - THE ECONOMY
9.        A report entitled "Appraisal of Tehran Power Distribution Project -
Tehran Regional Electricity Company, Iran", (No,, PU-51a) dated October 13,
1970 is attached.
10.       Electric power has been and remains of crucial importance to Iran's
development. The rapid growth of the economy in the sixties coincided with
substantial increases in electric power capacity and generation. During the
period of the Third Plan (1963-68) generating capacity was increased from 400
MW, mainly from diesel generating units, to 1300 MNW, the generation of electi-ic
energy increasing from 1.9 billion kWh to 4e-3 billion kWh annually. A begin-
ning was also made in establishing an inter-connected power system. The
development is being continued under the Fourth Plan (ending March 21, 1973)
and it is estimated that $550 million -will be spent on the power program in
the period 1970-73. The Tehran Power Distribution Project would constitute
a component of this program.
11.       In 1963 the power sector was still fragmented.  At that time, in
order to facilitate centralized coordination, the industry was nationalized
and the Ministry of tUater and Power wJas set up to administer and develop it.
The Ministry created one national company for generation and transmission,
eleven regional distribution companies, including TREC, and a number of
service companies. All are controlled by the Ministry, which retains most
managerial powers. This structure was adequate to allow a rapid and country-
wide development of power facilities in the 1960's. However, further growth
is creating serious administrative difficulties, largely because the Ministry
is relied upon to perform managerial functions for which it is not equipped.
The Minister has agreed to review the organization of the sector and to dis-
cuss it with the Bank in the course of the next year.
12.       TREC was set up under legislation enacted in 1964. The Company
serves an area, including the capital city of Tehran, of some 155,000 sq.
km. with a populaV-uion of about 5 million or 18 percent of the total pcpulation.
It supplies about 55 percent of the total power consumption. Although TREC
is the most efficient of the power companies, its general organization and,
in particular, its accounting standards still need considerable improvement.
However, remedial measures are being introduced and TREC has agreed to review
their progress with the Bank within a year after the proposed loan becomes
effective.
13.       The expansion of the distribution system hitherto has been barely
adequate to cope with the increased load supplied. The increasing demand
for electricity, due primarily to the growth of industry and population,
cannot be satisfied unless the distribution facilities are expanded and
improved. It is expected that generating capacity of 2,340 M4 will be



- 5 -
installed by 1973, representing an increase of 140 percent on the capacity
in 1969. This is planned to supply a projected demand of about 2,100 N4W for
the inter-connected system, including about 800 iF in Tehran.
14.       The proposed project forms a major part of TREC's construction
program for the period 1971-73. The total project cost of $93 million
represents about 80 percent of the total capital expenditure planned by
TREC for this period. The loan will finance about 65 percent of the total
estimated cost of the project and 86 percent of the foreign exchange com-
ponent, the balance being met from TREC's funds.
15.       The project will consist of:
(i) the installation of 336 km. of 63 kV circuit and twelve 63 kV
substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of 1,100 NVA;
(ii) the installation of about 1,100 km of 20 kV circuit with 130 M4VA
of static capacitors;
(iii) the provision of about 670 MVA of distribution transformer capacity
and 5,100 km of 400/220 V circuit;
(iv)  the provision of ancillary equipment and supplies, including switch
gear, hardware and protective devices;
(v) the extension of the transmission system supplying Tehran;
(vi) engineering, consulting, training and other services.
16.       TREC purchases energy in bulk from the generation and transmission
company (TAVMATR) on the basis of the provisional tariff established when
TAVANIR began operations in September, 1969. It was agreed during negotia-
tions that, within two years from the effectiveness of the loan, appropriate
tariffs for the sale of power by TAVANIR would be set in consultation with
the Bank. Until this is done TREC will maintain its current tariffs and
will thereafter review them in consultation with the Bank.
17.       The internal financial rate of return for the project is estimated
at 30 percent. This is based on the present relation between tariffs charged
for generation and transmission by TAVAI'IR and for distribution by TREC. It
is possible that the present tariffs charged by TAVAmIR would have to be
increased as a result of the study which is being undertaken. Estimates have
therefore been made assuming increases in the cost of power to TREC; even
if the bulk power rate is increased by about 40 percent without any compen-
sating increase in retail tariffs, the internal financial return on TREC's
1971-73 distribution investments would still be of the order of 15 percent.



- 6 -
18.       In view of the size of the project, which would double TREC's dis-
tribution facilities in three years, TREC has already entered into a satis-
factory contract with the London Electricity Board for consulting services
for the project. The consultants would have general responsibility for
the coordination and implementation of the project, reporting to the Vice-
President, Technical Operations, of TREC.
19.       To provide staff for its expanding activities, TREC has undertaken
to set up a training program for management, technical and supervisory per-
sonnel.
20.       The proceeds of the loan are to be passed on to TREC by the Plan
Organization, the agency through which all foreign borrowings for the public
sector are channelled, as debt on the same terms as the Bank loan under a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The BDrrower has undertaken that all funds made
available to TREC through the Plan Organization after M4arch 21, 1973 (i.e.
from the commencement of the Fifth Plan) will be made available on terms
which are no more favorable than those on which the Plan Organization obtains
such funds, as long as TREC's debt to equity ratio does not exceed 55:45.
21.       The loan will finance the cif cost of imported equipment, the foreign
exchange component of equipment manufactured in Iran, and the foreign exchange
cost of engineering, consulting and training services.  Procurement would be
on the basis of international competitive bidding, except for components which
may be required to be compatible with existing equipment and minor items for
which such bidding would not be practical. For purposes of bid comparison,
Iranian bidders would be entitled to a 15 percent margin of preference or
the prevailing level of customs duty, whichever is lower.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTMUMENTS AID AUTHORITY
22.       The Draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Government of
Iran, the Draft Project Agreement between the Bank and TREC, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
23.       The loan documents follow the general pattern of other recent
agreements for power projects.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
2h.       An economic report entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects of
Iran" (SA-8a) dated December 31, 1969, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on January 7, 1970 (R70-2). A basic data sheet dated October 12,
1970 is annexed.
25.       The Iranian economy continues to grow rapidly.   Since the early
sixties, gross national product at constant prices has been growing at
more than 8 percent per annum and investment at more than twice the rate of
growth of income. However, in recent years, the growth of domestic savings,
particularly in the public sector, has not kept pace with the requirements
of Iran's very ambitious investment program, in large part because of the
fast growth of current expenditures, particularly on defense. The ensuing
savings gap has been met by heavy reliance on foreign borrowing, most of
it on short and medium terms, which accentuate the longer run problems.
26.       Official estimates for last year (1969/70) show that GNP at constant
prices grew by about 11 percent compared with the previous year. The increase
took place mainly in the oil and services sectors; industry and agriculture
grew less rapidly, by 9 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. Public revenues
increased by nearly 18 percent. Current expenditures rose somewhat less
so that public savings increased slightly. However, public investments
increased by about 25 percent, so that the deficit of the public sector
increased substantially. For financing this deficit, the Government was able
to mobilize increased private savings. However, these were not sufficient,
and the overall gap increased further. The rise in the cost of living index
by about 3.6 percent was higher than in any of the previous five years and the
deficit in the balance of payments increased from $95 million in 1968/69 to
$154 million in 1969/70.
27.       Prospects are favorable for continued fast growth of the economy,
and of foreign exchange earnings. In this context, corrective policy would
involve merely a temporary slowdown in the growth of expenditure and should
therefore be relatively easy to carry out if initiated in time.   However,
over the next few years, Iran will continue to need large amounts of external
financing and total external debt can be expected to continue growing. At
the present time, debt service (including service on debt not guaranteed by
the Government) represents about 18 percent of foreign exchange earnings.
While Iran, with a high and assured level of foreign exchange earnings,
can afford a higher debt service ratio than countries not so favored, the
growth of debt service obligations warrants careful watching. The Government
will have to increase savings and improve the quality of the investment
program and the terms of foreign borrowing.

28.       These problems are now being reviewed by the Government.   They
form a major topic of consultations with the IMF mission which is now in
Iran, and will be further studied by the Bank Economic Mission which
will visit Iran later this month. Nlotwithstanding these problems, I con-
sider Iran creditworthy for additional Bank lending at the present time.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE UITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
29.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMIENDATION
30.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
