conservation, management, and sustainable use of forest\n            resources and associated biodiversity are developed and\n            adopted in project sites to promote sustainable development\n            and management of forest resources and protect the natural\n            environment. These practices, developed and applied for the\n            protection and sustainable management of natural forest\n            resources in pilot areas in China, will provide models for\n            wider replication under the government's Natural Forest\n            Protection Program (NFPP). There are three main project\n            components, which will be financed over a period of seven\n            years. The first component includes the following\n            subcomponents: 1) Natural forest management; yield\n            regulation and control policy studies; implementation of\n            forest management plans through demonstrations, non-timber\n            forest products domestication, and establishment of yield\n            plots to model growth and yield and assess biodiversity\n            change; and monitoring and evaluation; 2) forest management\n            training and vocational training; and community development\n            activities. The Protected areas Management component\n            supports conservation and improved management of\n            biodiversity of global importance in selected, high priority\n            nature reserves. The third component increases wood\n            production to meet the growing gap between domestic supply\n            and demand."}, "docdt": "2002-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
