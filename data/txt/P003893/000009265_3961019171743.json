The project's primary objectives were: (a)\n            to improve accounting practices: (i) in the public sector,\n            by supporting the introduction of modernized government\n            accounting practices, initially in the Borrower's\n            Ministry of Finance and three other agencies, and eventually\n            in all agencies; (ii) in the private sector by supporting\n            the development of technical standards and a code of ethics\n            for the accounting profession; and (b) to support the\n            government's program to raise the quality of accounting\n            faculty and teaching staff, and to prepare for future\n            expansion of accounting education and training. The overall\n            performance of the Bank during project implementation has\n            been satisfactory. The Borrower's performance in\n            preparation, appraisal and implementation of the project has\n            also been satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as\n            follows: (a) in executing a major effort such as\n            implementation of government accounting systems that\n            involves the whole set of cabinet ministries, high-level\n            intervention is required; (b) it is important that distinct\n            subprojects be managed separately on a functional basis to\n            avoid confusion in allocation of resources and to allow more\n            freedom for implementing agencies to implement their\n            components in accordance with their priorities; (c) exposing\n            studies and or research units such as the Accountancy\n            Development Centers to more commercial activities would\n            provide greater assurance for their sustainability; and (e)\n            unless there is an adequate assurance of availability of\n            government funds to cover expenditures after closing date,\n            project needs to be strictly monitored and approval should\n            not be given for activities that have high probability to\n            extend beyond the closing date."}, "docdt": "1996-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
