                    Amendment of the Loan Agreement
Dear Minister Sumarlin:
      We refer to the Loan Agreement (Accountancy Development
Project) between the Republic of Indonesia (the Borrower) and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank)
dated June 10, 1988, as amended.  We also refer to your Ministry's
telex of April 12, 1991 and our letter of May 24, 1991, regard the
increase in the authorized allocation of the Special Account under
the above project.
      The Bank is pleased to inform you that, after due
consideration, it has agreed to the above request.  Therefore, the
Loan Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
      1.    Paragraph 1 (c) of Schedule 6 to the Loan Agreement is
amended to reach as follows:
            "(c)  the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount
equivalent to $6,500,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account
and deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this
Schedule."
      Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by
signing and dating the enclosed copy of this letter and by returning
it to us.
                                                Sincerely yours,
