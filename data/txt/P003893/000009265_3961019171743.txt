EMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
ACCOUNTANCYDEVELOPMENTPROJECT[LOAN. 2940-INDI
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Accountancy Development
Project in Indonesia, for which loan 2940-IND in the amount of US$ 113 million equivalent was
approved on May 17, 1988 and made effective on July 28, 1988.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1995, after a one-year extension of the original closing date
of June 30, 1994. Final disbursement took place on December 4, 1995, at which time a balance of
US$ 9,558,296.88 was canceled. No cofinancing for the project was provided.
The ICR was prepared by Kunrat Wirasubrata, Operation Officer/Task Manager, and
Basilius Bengoteku, Operations Officer, both of Project Management and Implementation Unit,
Resident Staff in Indonesia, Country Department m  of the East Asia and Pacific Region and
reviewed by Himelda Martinez, Chief, Human Resource Operations Division, EA3PH, and Richard
A. Calkins, Project Adviser, EA3DR.
Preparation of this ICR, which began during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission
in July 1995, was based on materials in the project file. The borrower contributed to the ICR by
preparing an evaluation of the project's execution and by commenting on the draft ICR.

ACCOUNTANCY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 2940-IND)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.    The Bank has been involved in accountancy development in two previous projects in Indonesia
(Credit 869-IND, effective May 11, 1979 and closed June 30, 1985 and Loan 2290-IND, effective
September 1983 and closed December 31, 1990). These were the first and second polytechnic
development projects, each with a small accountancy development component, which led to this project.
One of the lessons learned from the accountancy component of the First Polytechnic Project was the need
for separate project management with clearly identified responsibility and funds allocated to it. The lesson
was incorporated in the Accountancy Development Project loan agreement.
Proiect Obiectives
ii.    The project's primary objectives were: (a) to improve accounting practices: (i) in the public
sector, by supporting the introduction of modernized government accounting practices, initially in the
Borrower's Ministry of Finance and three other agencies, and eventually in all agencies; (ii) in the private
sector by supporting the development of technical standards and a code of ethics for the accounting
profession; and (b) to support the Government's program to raise the quality of accounting faculty and
teaching staff, and to prepare for future expansion of accounting education and training. The project had
a number of secondary objectives, each of which was aligned with one of the main objectives. Of the
secondary objectives, the most important were: (a) developing the quality of government auditing agencies
and government auditors; (b) strengthening the organization of the profession of accountancy; (c)
increasing the scope and efficiency of the capital market; (d) increasing the supply of qualified accounting
professionals; and (e) improving the management of accounting education.
iii.    To promote the achievement of project objectives, the Loan Agreement stipulated that the
Borrower should maintain separate subproject management units for the Accounting Practice and
Accounting Education subprojects which had. already been working since project preparation. The
Coordinating Agency for Accountancy Development (CAAD), an agency established jointly by MOF and
MOEC in 1985 to coordinate development of accountancy in Indonesia, should also be maintained to
monitor and evaluate the implementation of the various activities under the project and the achievement of
the project objectives.
iv.    Given the size and scope of the project which required involvement of nine implementing agencies
and covered the 27 provinces of Indonesia, the objectives were complex and risky.

Implementation ExDerience and Results
v.    The loan was approved by the Board on May 17, 1988, became effective on July 28, 1988 and
was closed on June 30, 1995 after a one-year extension of the closing date. The Accounting Practice
(PPSA) and the Accountancy Planning and Monitoring (MKPA) Sub-projects were restructured in late
1990. The Accounting Education and Training Sub-project (PPA) showed satisfactory implementation
record since its inception.
vi.    Despite difficulties in the early stages of implementation, the project has achieved most of its
stated objectives (para 2.1). Under the Accounting Practice Sub-project, computerized government
accounting systems have been introduced, effectiveness and efficiency of government audit operations
have increased, accounting and auditing training have been provided to more than ten thousand
government and state-owned enterprise staff, the capacity of government to supervise the capital market
has expanded, and financial accounting and auditing principles and standards have been made effective.
Under the Accounting Education and Training Sub-project, new accounting development centers have
been established and the quality and quantity of high school and university accounting teachers and the
quality of teaching have improved. Under both sub-projects, more than one thousand government staff
were awarded foreign fellowships, more than 300 of which were for master's and doctorate studies.
During project implementation, the demand for accounting education as well as for accounting education
providers in the community has increased considerably.
vii.   A few qualifications, however, are to be noted. At its final stage of implementation, the quantity
and quality of reports produced by the government accounting systems were still inadequate for them to
be used as the basis for sound economic decision making. Also, the objective to strengthen the association
of accounting professionals could not be fully attained. The performance of the institutional and students'
loan program also was not satisfactory.
viii.   Negative factors affecting achievement of major objectives include, inter alia, delayed
establishment of the Central Accounting Office (BAKUN) to lead implementation of modemization of
government accounting (para 3.4) and inadequate assessment of institutional capability during appraisal
(paras 3.4 and 3.13). Positive factors include the restructuring measures taken in 1990 and establishment
of provincial PIUs to implement accounting education activities in the provinces.
ix.    The loan closing date was extended by one year to June 30, 1995 to accommodate major
activities that would not be completed by June 30, 1994 (e.g. overseas fellowships, procurement of
equipment and in-country training) and to provide support to the preparation of the Second Accountancy
Development Project.
x.    Total project costs at closing date was estimated at US$131.7 million, about 80 percent of
appraisal estimate. This lower cost can be explained by the lower incremental operating costs as a result
of project restructuring in 1990, unrealized civil works in STAN component (PPSA subproject), and the
devaluation of the Rupiah by more than 30 percent during the period.
xi.    The Bank's and the Borrower's overall performances have been satisfactory (paras 5.1 and 6.1).
Project outcome has been rated satisfactory as the project achieved most of its stated objectives (para
7.1).



Summary of Findings. Future Operations. and Key Lessons Learned
xii.  Inadequate institutional arrangement and lack of assessment of institutional capability caused
considerable implementation setback as reflected in slow implementation of the Accounting Practice
(PPSA) and Monitoring, Planning and Evaluation (TKPA) Sub-projects in the first two years. This also
resulted in slow acceptance of the new uniform chart of account and the failure of DIKMAS to
satisfactorily implement the students loan component.
xiii.  Sustainability of a number of components such as BEPEKA and BPKP in-country training (para
4.2), the activities of the State School of Accountancy (para 4.3), and continuous teaching quality
improvement (paTa 4.6) will be largely dependent on Government commitmnent to implement the proposed
Operational Plan. Sustainability of the students loan program is questionable (para 4.8) while that of
accountancy development coordination may be likely but not necessarily following the practice during
project implementation. Key lessons learned include:
a)    in performing a major task such as implementation of government accounting systems that
encompasses all independent cabinet-level Government agencies, high-level intervention and
leadership is required;
b)    pilot implementation of the Government accounting modernization component should have been
done in a selected province, with participation of all Govemment agencies which have operations
in the province; in this way, comprehensive province-level results would have been obtained and
immediate implementation benefits could have been realized;
c)    thorough institutional arrangements, including assessment of institutional capability, should have
been completed very early in the implementation period;
d)    separate implementation units and management are required to allow more freedom to
implementing agencies in handling their components in accordance with their priorities;
e)    exposing a studies and/or research center to a more commercial environment would give greater
assurance for future sustainability;
f)    assurance on availability of Govemment funds to finance activities which have high probability
to extend beyond closing date should be obtained before issuance of Bank's procurement
approval (e.g. no-objection letter); and
g)    budgetary allocations should be driven more by future targets than by past performances.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
ACCOUNTANCY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 2940-IND)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
1.    Project Objectives
1.1.   The objectives of the project were to improve accounting practices in the public and private
sectors and to support the Government's program to raise the quality of accounting education as well as
expand accounting education and training. The project provided funds for the following major sub-
projects:
Accounting Practice (PPSA). This included: (a) implementation of modernized government
accounting systems, (b) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall government audit
function, (c) improving the quality of course delivery and of management of MOF's School of
Accountancy, (d) assistance to the capital market authority to arrest the declining volume of business
on the exchange and to promote the capital market as an effective vehicle of resource mobilization,
and (e) assistance to the Indonesian Institute of Accountants in its evolution towards leadership of
the accounting profession in Indonesia;
Accounting Education (PPA). This included: (a) improving the quality of accounting education in
universities particularly at the undergraduate level, (b) staff and curriculum development for SMA
(general high school) and SMEA (business vocational high school) as well as provision of equipment
and materials to these schools, and (c) assistance to further extend and reinforce the accounting
training provided under employment-oriented community education programs of the Ministry of
Education;
Accountancy Planning. Monitoring and Evaluation (TKPAM. This included support to the
Coordinating Agency for Accountancy Development (CAAD) as the overall planning, monitoring
and evaluation unit of the project.
1.2.   The objectives were broad and complex as well as demanding and required involvement of seven
directorates general in two major ministries, one non-ministerial government agency, and the Supreme
Audit Council. The project objectives had responded appropriately to Indonesia's economic development
during the last decade where a number of economic/trade deregulation measures were taken and the role
of the private sector was enhanced.
2.    Achievement of Project Objectives
2.1.   Despite project management problems that led to delays in the first two years of PPSA and
TKPA, the project has achieved most of its stated objectives. From the institutional development point of
view, it has successfully introduced modernized government accounting systems in 13 Government
departments and increased the efficiency and effectiveness of government audit operations; it has provided
accounting and auditing training to more than ten thousand government staff; also, it has supported
formulation and issuance of the financial accounting and auditing principles and standards which are very



-5 -
important in supporting a well functioning capital market and in guiding the private sector financial
reporting practices. It also has increased the capacity of the capital market authority to supervise the
capital market effectively. It has supported improvement of accounting curricula in high schools and
universities and introduced computers and computerized accounting as well as provided accounting
textbooks and other related teaching materials to these educational institutions. By supporting overseas
fellowship programs both for university lecturers and government employees, the project was
instrumental in building the necessary human capital for further development of the accounting profession
in Indonesia. The project also supported activities that were not originally identified in the SAR including
a major tax accounting program at DG Tax and introduction of corporate law reforms by the Office of
the Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry.
2.2.  In spite of the success in introducing modern and computerized government accounting systems
to government agencies and capturing financial data in 12 provinces, reports produced by the systems are
still inadequate both in terms of quantity and quality in order for them to be used as the basis for sound
economic decision making (para 7.6). The final result of this sub-project component can be evaluated
only when the systems have been implemented in all government agencies in all the 27 provinces which is
not expected to happen before the year 2000.
2.3.   The institutional and students' loan component managed by the Ministry of Education, can not be
fully evaluated as the project administration at DIKMAS cannot generate reliable information on
collection and redistribution of funds. In terms of distribution, 85 percent of the originally allocated fund
has been absorbed by the private course providers and students which represents about three percent of
the loan. According to the preliminary information gathered by DIKMAS, the students' loan program was
not successful as the repayment ratio has remained low.
2.4.   Difficulties in finding qualified participants for doctorate programs in accounting caused delays
in sending doctorate fellows to overseas universities. Because of this ten fellows (nine from MOEC and
one from BPKP) were unable to complete their studies by the closing date. GOI is committed to continue
funding the programs. Areas of study also shifted from accounting to more general subjects.
3.    Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
General
3.1.   The loan was approved by the Board on May 17, 1988, became effective on July 28, 1988 and
was closed on June 30, 1995 after a one-year extension of the closing date. The Accounting Practice
(PPSA) and the Accountancy Planning and Monitoring (TKPA) Sub-projects were restructured in late
1990. The Accounting Education and Training Sub-project (PPA) showed satisfactory implementation
record since its inception.
3.2.   The extensive process, underway since 1979, of formulating the plans of Government accounting
modernization was considered to have reduced the related implementation risk. Nevertheless, the broad
scope and complex technical characteristics of the project as well as the structure of management during
early implementation period were major contributors to unsatisfactory performance during the first two
years of implementation and led to restructuring of TKPA and PPSA Sub-projects.
3.3.   The main features of the restructuring of TKPA and PPSA included establishment of separate
management for each subproject, reallocation of loan funds among expenditure categories to allow for



-6 -
more overseas training, purchase of computers to be installed in agency field offices, and inclusion of DG
Tax and EKUIN to implement a major program in tax accounting and to initiate a corporate law reform.
3.4.   As a number of activities could not be completed by June 30, 1994, the loan closing date was
extended by a year to June 30, 1995. The activities included, among others, overseas masters and Ph.D
fellowships, procurement of educational equipment, and agency staff training on the new government
accounting system (GAS Release 1.0). The extension was also necessary to provide support for
preparation of re-engineering of GAS R 1.0 to a Release 2.0 which would be supported by the Second
Accountancy Development Project. As no major activities were taking place under TKPA, the Sub-
project was not included in the extension and further support to it was provided by MOF.
3.5.   Critical problems were encountered in the early stages of implementation but were successfully
overcome by the Government and project management. There are three sets of factors affecting
implementation performance. First, the performance of Bank's appraisal and supervision teams (para
5.1). Second factors generally subject to govemment control including: a) delayed establishment of the
Central Accounting Office (BAKUN) as an echelon I unit, b) failure to establish separate management for
PPSA and TKPA during the first two years of implementation; c) budget allocation system which was
more past performance driven rather than project target driven. And third, specific factors subject to
implementing agencies' control including: a) failure during preparation to identify the need for a high-
level implementing agency to lead implementation of the government accounting modernization
component, b) inadequate assessment of CAAD's institutional capability to assume dual functions as
accountancy development coordinator and as project implementing agency, c) insufficient monitoring and
evaluation capacity particularly in the early stage of implementation, d) inadequate assessment of DG of
Community Education (DIKMAS) capability to manage institutional and students loan program; e) lack
of quality control in computer and calculator delivery to high schools, f) insufficient planning in sending
Ph.D fellows to foreign universities; and g) the well functioning regional project units for implementation
of the Accounting Education Sub-project.
TKPA Sub-nroiect
3.6.   Implementation coordination was a key task which was not satisfactorily performed by the
CAAD. This was due both to the Bank's and the Eorrower's over-confidence in the CAAD's institutional
capability to implement its original function, i.e., to coordinate accountancy development, and at the
same time to implement the TKPA and PPSA Sub-projects without realizing CAAD'S lack of previous
experience in managing a complcx project. Slow implementation was the most noticeable result of this
organizational arrangement. The restructuring of project management in late 1990 could effectively
arrested this problem by releasing CAAD from PPSA implementation responsibilities and creating a
separate PPSA project management.
3.7.   After project restructuring TKPA continued to assume the responsibility for the development of a
national coordinating agency. It also conducted research and development activities with computer
databases, set up a research network, arranged research grants to students and university staff, provided
research seminars, and maintained a library facility. With a well-defined scope of responsibility, TKPA
ended up with satisfactory results.



-7 -
PPSA Sub-Droiect
3.8.   Delays were most noticeable in the implementation of the Governnent accounting component.
This was particularly due to difficulties in staffing and the complicated interfacing problems between DG
Budget's chart of budgetary items and the newly introduced uniform chart of accounts.
3.9.   To effectively liaise with DG Budget and Bank Indonesia authorities to achieve consistency in
accounting through the establishment of a uniforn chart of account, it was deemed necessary to elevate
the status the State Accounting Office (PPKN) from an echelon II to an echelon I office within the
Ministry of Finance. It took almost three years for the Office of The Minister of Civil Service Reforms
(MENPAN) to approve the change of status. In July 1992 BAKUN (the Central Accounting Office) was
officiated and MOF approval of the new uniform chart of account was issued a month later. The nation-
wide implementation of the new chart of account in development budget was begun in Pelita VI budget
year of 1994/95.
3.10. After a long learning period, implementation of PPSA (including BAKUN, BAPEPAM,
BEPEKA, BPKP, STAN and IAI/DJLK) improved. However, delays in the first two years had led to
slow absorption of government funds which later led Bappenas to reduce budget allocation to project
activities to match past actual performances. Low utilization of government funds continued until the
project closed.
3.11.  After two years without sufficient monitoring and evaluation capacity, a project advisor to
develop PPSA and TKPA project management and monitoring system was recruited in 1990. The advisor
presented a clearer picture of the status of the project that provided a firm base on which decisions could
be made on revisions and subsequent implementation of the Sub-project.
3.12.  The Government accounting component was substantially modified after appraisal. The original
system design was changed from a manual to a computerized system (called GAS Release 1.0). This led
to major changes in the timing of design development and programming. More extensive computerization,
particularly at the (field level) agencies, was deemed necessary. This resulted in the project providing
more than 100 sets of PCs and peripheral equipment (including high speed dot matrix printers) to more
than 100 field-level agency accounting offices (UAW). During implementation, hardware utilization was
very low (only 2-3 hours per month) and many of the computers were of low quality due to weak
specification. In a number of cases, computer skills of the UAW staff were also deficient.
3.13.  During project restructuring the Bank agreed to finance a major program in tax accounting
implemented by DG Tax and to support the introduction of corporate law reforms organized by the Office
of the Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry.
PPA Sub-Dro*ect
3.14. DIKMAS capacity to administer a very large number of small loans (10,752 student and 752
institutional loans) was not adequately assessed. While the agency had been successful in implementing
other community-oriented learning activities, it did not have an edge on loan management. This was made
worse by the absence of an operational budget in the early stages of implementation, the lack of clear
implementation guidance, and the unavailability of monitoring support.



3.15. Nine Ph.D fellows could not complete their studies by the project's closing date. When the ICR
mission was in the field there were worries that DG of Higher Education would not be able to secure
funding sources to finance the remaining portion of the study programs.
3.16.  The establishment of provincial project implementation units in seven provinces has been
effective in facilitating local training and delivery of equipment to beneficiary schools.
3.17.  Many computers and calculators were delivered to the beneficiary high schools in defective
condition and many of these were not replaced. The electric calculators delivered under the second batch
procurement required installation of electric plugs in many schools; this created a burden particularly for
schools in small towns with limited budgets. Calculators from the first batch procurement used dry
batteries as their power source.
4.    Project Sustainability
4.1.   There is an apparent Government commitment to continue to nurture a functioning central
government accounting office to provide government decision makers with reliable financial information
on which sound economic decision making can be based. This, among others, is indicated by the follow-
on Second Accountancy Development Project (Loan 3801-IND) which supports improvement of GAS
Release 1.0 to a Release 2.0 and implementation to full scale by the year 2000. While some operational
issues, such as low operational budget support to BAKUN Central and Regional Offices, may remain in
the near future, sustainability of the achievement is likely.
4.2.   Sustainability of BEPEKA and BPKP activities supported under the loan will largely depend on
the ability of the agencies to optimally utilize fellowship graduates by providing better organizational and
career development plans and on further investment to maintain and expand their achievement. Both
agencies continue to issue audit guidelines and refine ones produced during project implementation. Since
they are not included in the Second Accountancy Development Project, the two agencies are now seeking
alternative sources of external financing.
4.3.   As the capacity of public and private higher education institutions to produce qualified
accountants have increased considerably in the last several years, STAN's function as a degree granting
institution may not be sustained. Its function as in-service training providers for MOF agencies may be
sustained by its mother organization, i.e, BPLK.
4.4.   The increasing importance of private sector investment provides the basis for increasing the role
of the capital market as an effective instrument of resource mobilization. In this regard, a strong capital
market regulatory body which effectively oversees compliance of public companies with the various
capital market regulations is very important to maintain investor confidence. The government has clearly
shown its strong commitment to maintaining the regulatory body -- this is indicated by inclusion of the
Capital Market Authority (BAPEPAM) in the Second Accountancy Development Project. The
sustainability of BAPEPAM's achievement is, therefore, likely.
4.5.   IAI continues to enjoy significant support from the Government by being included in the Second
Accountancy Development Project. Given this support, for the next five years, sustainability of the
Institute's achievement is likely. However, ways need to be sought to make the Institute more self-reliant.



4.6.   As the demand for accounting professionals remains high, undergraduate accounting departments
in major public and private universities have found strong interest among students to study accounting.
Qualified accounting graduates of public universities are quickly absorbed by leading industries which
offer more attractive remunerations than universities. Those who decided to become university teachers
usually have a part-time job either as a teacher in a private university or as an accountant in industries.
This has raised concern among public universities' accounting departments particularly with respect to
the quality of teaching and research work. On a limited basis these concerns are being addressed by some
of the Accountancy Development Centers (ADCs) which are embarking on more commercial activities by
providing studies, research and consulting services to industries as well as government institutions.
4.7.   The target to upgrade accounting teachers and to improve teaching quality including curricula
'and management improvement in SMAs, SMEAs and public universities has been achieved substantially.
Still, limited government resources to continue these activities and to provide support for maintenance of
computer hardware and software make sustainability of these activities questionable. With respect to
provision of computers and peripheral equipment, however, many private enterprises, particularly in
major cities, are ready to take over Government responsibility at reasonable prices.
4.8.   Unless the recovery factor of past loans is high and better organizational and administrative
arrangements are in place, sustainability of the student loans program is unlikely.
4.9.   While the need for national accountancy development coordination continues, CAAD will not
necessarily be the executing agency in this effort. Government's willingness to exclude CAAD from the
Second Accountancy Development Project indicates the low level of Government commitment to sustain
this agency.
5.     Bank Performance
5.1.   T'he overll performance of the Bank during project implementation has been satisfactory.
Inadequate assessment of institutional capability during project preparation and appraisal was
satisfactorily addressed during supervision. Bank supervision teams provided the necessary facilitation so
that the project could be implemented fairly smoothly. This was due, in part, to the previous
implementation experience in the first and second polytechnic projects.
6.     Borrower Performance
6.1.   The Borrower's performance in preparation, appraisal and implementation of the project has also
been satisfactory. Despite the long learning period needed by the PPSA Sub-project and CAAD's failure
to effectively coordinate implementation, after restructuring, the TKPA and PPSA Sub-projects managed
to improve and realized most of their stated objectives. As regards the PPA Sub-project, except for the
unsatisfactory performance of the student loans and the incomplete Ph.D fellowship programs,
implementation performance has been satisfactory since the inception of the project.
7.     Assessment of Outcome
7.1.   Overall, the project had satisfactorily achieved and, in some cases, exceeded the expected
outcome without major shortcomings (paras 3.1-3.17).



- 10-
7.2.   Given its long-term objective, the impact of the major fellowship program cannot be fully
evaluated at project completion. A recent tracer study", however, indicates that graduates are contributing
to beneficiary institutions' performance including improvement in delivery of public services (particularly
BAPEPAM), decision making process, task completion, and in disseminating new knowledge and skills to
their colleagues. There is no brain drain due mainly to post-training service obligations, and beneficiary
institutions are expected to further optimize the role of these graduates through better organizational and
career planning. This way, they are expected to generate a long lasting effect on the development of the
accounting profession both in public and private sectors, and in accounting education.
7.3.   Overseas and domestic fellowship graduates contributed to the enhancement of the effectiveness
and efficiency of government audit operations. In the financial sector, the project contributed to the better
working of the capital market. In the education sector, the project provided a firm base for further
development of accounting and computerized accounting in high school and university education.
7.4.   The objective of strengthening the IAI could not be fully attained under this project as it remains
dependent on government support for further development and continues to be run by executive members
on a time-available basis. A full-time executive secretary is being recruited under the Second
Accountancy Development Project.
7.5.   Secondary, higher and non-formal accounting education has expanded rapidly during project
implementation. While no in-depth study has been conducted to measure the extent of the project's
contribution to the development, improvement of curricula and provision of training for instructors and
managers of private accounting courses conducted under the project has, undoubtedly, had a positive
impact.
7.6.   Implementation of government accounting systems was based on a full scale plan whereby the
actual benefit will be realized only when the operations of all central government agencies in the 27
provinces are covered by the systems. This is not expected to happen before the year 2000. As the
systems were only partially implemented, the reports produced are not yet usable as the basis for
economic decision making. In this case, a pilot implementation in a key province where all (field level)
agencies are covered would have been preferred so that comprehensive results at the province level could
have been obtained and used as the basis for comprehensive evaluation. Lack of timeliness in generating
reports is another major factor which renders reports unusable.
8.    Future Operation
8.1.   The ICR mission of July 1995 received the Operational Plan of the PPSA Sub-project
components. The plan clearly indicates the need for further investment support in the five implementing
agencies. BPKP still needs more funds to implement its management information systems and to provide
for the related training and to evaluate the effectiveness of audit guidelines prepared during project
implementation. BEPEKA needs to continue with in-country training for their auditors and to evaluate the
impact of the guidelines and standards prepared during project implementation. Through Bappenas, these
two agencies are now looking into the possibility of obtaining external financial support. BAKUN,
BAPEPAM and IW are supported by the follow-on loan (Second Accountancy Development Project,
Loan 3801-IND).
/  Center for Economic and Social Studies, Evaluation of Overseas Fellowship Returnees (IBRD Ln. 2940-
IND - MOF), Jakarta, 1995.



- 11 -
8.2.   A similar situation is observed in MOEC. An operational budget to maintain the project
achievements is available only on a limited basis. MOEC's operational plans indicate that fellowship
graduates and ADCs could be further deployed to become lecturers or consultants in developing
accounting departments in other public and private universities. There are also plans to allow beneficiary
SMAs and SMEAs to use the computer facilities for commercial computer classes in the aftemoon
whose proceeds can be used to cover maintenance costs. MOEC also decided to set up a better monitoring
and redistribution mechanism for the institutional and students loan starting budget year 1996/97.
8.3.   The rapid expansion of accounting education by private providers may be expected to absorb a
significant part of government responsibility although concerns are raised with regard to the quality of
teaching.
8.4.   Bank follow-up support to BAKUN, BAPEPAM  and LAI will be geared toward full scale
implementation of the computerized govermment accounting system by the year 2000 and enhancement of
the credibility and usefulness of financial information in the private and public sectors. The second loan
also supports implementation of rigorous qualifying examinations for public accountants, a
comprehensive set of accounting standards, and the enforcement of such standards through capital market
regulatory activities.
9.    Key Lessons Learned
(a)   In executing a major effort such as implementation of government accounting systems that
involves the whole set of cabinet ministries, high-level intervention is required; and the need for a
high-level agency to lead in the implementation should have been identified during project
preparation;
(b)   In implementing government accounting modernization, the project would have achieved more if
the pilot implementation had been undertaken in one key province, with participation from all
(field level) agencies operating in the province rather than in a number of agencies;
(c)   To facilitate a smooth implementation coordination, thorough institutional arrangements, including
appropriate staffing, should have been put in place early in the implementation period; this should
have included obtaining assurance of the capability and capacity of the proposed project
leadership;
(d)   It is important that distinct subprojects be managed separately on a functional basis to avoid
confusion in allocation of resources and to allow more freedom for implementing agencies to
implement their components in accordance with their priorities;
(e)   Exposing studies and/or research units such as the Accountancy Development Centers to more
commercial activities would provide greater assurance for their sustainability;
(f)   Unless there is an adequate assurance of availability of government funds to cover expenditures
after closing date, project needs to be strictly monitored and approval should not be given for
activities that have high probability to extend beyond the closing date; and
(g)   Budgetary allocation should be driven by project targets rather than by past performances

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
An economic rate of return was neither estimated for the Accountancy Development Project at the time of
appraisal nor calculated after its close. Estimates of the ERR to investments in the retraining of civil servants
(represents more than 45 percent of project costs), for instance, would be very difficult to make.
However, as most of project targets have been achieved, and in some cases even exceeded appraisal targets,
there is a strong indication that the project has been implemented in a cost-effective manner.

REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
WORLD BANK
FINAL SUPERVISION AND PREPARATION OF
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ACCOUNTANCY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2940-IND)
JULY 1995
AIDE MEMOIRE
1     Introduction
A World Bank Team consisting of Messrs. Kunrat Wirasubrata (Operations Officer/Team
Leader) and Basilius Bengoteku (Operations Officer/Training Specialist) conducted the final supervision
and preparation of Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the Accountancy Development Project
(Loan 2940-IND) from July 3 to 19, 1995. The Team held discussions with officials of the Ministry of
Education (DG Higher Education, DG Basic and Secondary Education and DG Non-Formal Education,
Accounting Development Centers of the Universities of Airlangga, Brawijaja, Indonesia, and Sumatera
Utara), Ministry of Finance (BAKUN, BAPEPAM, DG Financial Institutions, DG Budget, BPLK
/STAN), BEPEKA, BPKP, and the Chairman of the Indonesian Institute of Accountants. The Team
acknowledges with thanks the courtesies and co-operation extended to it by the Government of Indonesia
and its agencies. A list of people met by the Team is given in Annex 1. This aide memoire summarizes
these discussions and the Team's findings which were discussed with the implementing agencies in a
wrap-up meeting held on July 28, 1995.2'
2      2he Project
The project comprises three components, each with its own Project Implementation Unit; the
Accounting Practice Subproject, under the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Accounting Education and
Training Subproject, under the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC), and the Accounting
Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Subproject, under the Coordinating Agency for Accounting
Development (IKPA). The objectives of the project are to improve accounting practices in the public and
private sectors and to support government program to raise the quality of accounting education as well as
to expand accounting education and training.
3      General Status of Implementation as of Closing Date
All subprojects have largely completed implementation. Ten doctorate degree fellows (nine
MOEC and one MOF) remain to complete their studies in overseas universities and other sources of
funding are being sought by respective implementing agency. The implementing agencies have also been
informed that no further commitments under the loan agreement can be made after June 30, 1995.
Disbursements will continue into the 4-month grace period, i.e. up to October 31, 1995. Total amount
withdrawn from the loan account after all disbursements are made will be $106.45 million leaving
unutilized balance of $6.55 million to be canceled. Annex 2 provides a financing summary of each

subproject. No audit report outstanding but the project is still required to submit audit report for the
period of April 1994 - March 1995 (now being audited) and April 1995 - October 1995. Final
implementation progress reports of the three subprojects which contain detail quantitative information on
project performance are available in the project file.
4     Preparation of Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
The Team received the necessary data and reviewed the project implementation covering, inter
alia, the aspects of project design, implementation planning, organization and costs, loan disbursement;
project development impact, economic benefits, and sustainability. The Team also provided advice as to
preparation of Government contribution to the ICR and establishment of operational plan. The Team
paid special attention to: the functioning of the accounting systems, efficiency of audit operations in
BEPEKA and BPKP, quality of course delivery in and management of STAN, and the role of LAI as a
professional association; expansion of accountancy education and training, supply of qualified accounting
professionals, and improvement of the management of accountancy education. A summary of project
performance is attached as Annex 3 of this aide memoire. MOF, MOEC and TKPA have been apprised
of the preliminary findings of this review which, in summary, are:
4.1    AccountingPractice Subproject
Tlere are no remaining activities as of June 30, 1995. All procurement have been completed.
Disbursement up to the amount of $0.5 million will extend into the 4-month grace period for payments
toward purchase of miscellaneous softwares, specialist services, and overseas fellowship. When
disbursement is completed, total withdrawn amount will reach $43.83 million and will leave a balance of
$0.68 million to be canceled. One doctorate degree fellow cannot complete his study in the UK before the
closing date; alternative sources of financing is being sought by BPKP but no positive result has been
identified.
4.1.1  GovernmentAccounting Modernization
The four main accounting subsystems, known as GAS R. 1, have been introduced and are partly
implemented. BAKUN has established 7 regional offices (KARs) to capture accounting data of 13
government departments in 12 provinces (5 others were added when this report was being prepared).
Complete balance sheet reporting has not been implemented since the necessary supporting modules
(fixed assets, investments and liabilities) are still to be developed under the second loan (GAS R.2).
The Team observed that lack of timeliness in reporting is a major constraint in implementing the
systems3'. Also, under the present implementation plan the systems will not be able to generate accounting
reports that can be used as a basis for sound economic decision making until they are installed in all the
27 provinces and in all government departments which is expected to happen in year 2000. The Team
recommends that an alternative approach be considered whereby all the 31 budget units (Bagian
3/ A consultant report mentions that average time needed for document prooessing in 4 KARs in 1994 was 171
days.



- 26 -
Anggaran)4' are covered in implementation in the existing provinces so that KARs can generate a
consolidated province-level report as an immediate benefit of the project.
With regard to systems maintenance, BAKUN and its KARs need to strengthen their technical
capability so that reliance on consultants can be minimized and quick-response capacity increased. Also,
the Team noticed insufficient operational/routine budget in BAKUN regional offices that may lead to
substandard performance.
One-hundred-and-five agencies' regional accounting units (UAWs) of 13 government
departments have been established in 12 provinces. Each unit is equipped with project-supplied PC and
high speed dot matrix printer. The Team observed that the equipment is used 2-3 hours per month only
for printing BAKUN-generated ledgers. It is recommended that alternative methods be devised to bring
the equipment to full utilization. The Team also noted that establishment of UAW is a low cost activity
and requires less than one staff-month per month to operate; on this basis, it is recommended that
BAKUN launch more promotion to encourage participation of the remaining government departments.
4.1.2 Government Auditing
The implementation of BEPEKA and BPKP components proceeded as planned and no remaining
activities as of June 30, 1995. BEPEKA, through self-managed activities, has developed 47 audit
guidelines and a government audit standard. The standard, which is modeled after the US General
Accounting Office Audit Standards of 1994, is to be distributed during 1995/96 budget year and is
expected to be in effect as soon as possible. As regards BPKP, 20 audit guidelines have been developed
and are ready for distribution to all BPKP offices, Inspectorates General, and Functional Supervisory
Units of regional governments (APF). In-country and overseas staff training have a significant
contribution to enhancement of efficiency and effectiveness of audit operations in both agencies. The
agencies have also developed own training manuals and BPKP is actively engaged in provision of training
of auditors both for internal as well as external clients.
4.1.3 Government Education and Training (STAN)
MOF's school of accounting (STAN) has substantially achieved the project targets and no
remaining activities were in progress at the closing date. Number of overseas degree holders in STAN
faculties (20) is still short of targeted (25) but this is due to administrative arrangement between STAN
and BPKP. Under the project, the school has also provided accounting and auditing training to more than
ten thousand employees of government agencies and state-owned enterprises. Based on the argument that
the capacity of accounting education in public and private universities has expanded, the Team was
informed that STAN's present role as degree-granting institution may shift to become purely in-service
training agency of the MOF.
4/ Bagian Anggaran (BA) is central level government department which has budget authority. There are 31
BAs each of which does not necessarily have an operation in every province. A consolidated provincial-
level accounting report is expected to capture accounting data of all BAs so that actual flow of financial
resources from central government to the provinces can be accurately reported. The Team was informed,
however, that a special computer program needs to be added to GAS R. 1 to enable it to generate such
reports and that GAS R 1 is not yet able to capture foreign-funded portion of government expenditure. In
any case, changes and additions should only be made with GAS R2 in mind.



- 27 -
4.1.4 Capital Market
BAPEPAM achieved and exceeded all project targets. The capital market authority is represented
in the IAI's committee of standards and contributed to the formulation of the Indonesian Financial
Accounting Standards which were put in effect in October 1994. Given the favorable economic condition
in the early 1990s, market confidence in the capital market has been strengthened as indicated by number
of companies listed, 261 compared to the targeted 50. Two employees have returned from overseas
master's degree education and have received internal promotion. Forty-eight employees have attended
various capital market related courses/training in foreign countries (mainly in the US) and have added to
BAPEPAM's capacity to supervise the capital market, enforce capital market regulations, carry out
researches, and evaluate disclosure documents of listed companies.
4.1.5 Private Sector
The component has substantially achieved all the targeted project outcomes. It has developed 15
accounting principles, 11 auditing standards, I accounting/auditing research, 4 accounting/auditing
training materials, and 1 accountants code of ethics. A total of 35 financial accounting standards have
been issued and made effective in October 1994. A codification of auditing standards has also been
issued. However, as a professional association, IAI still needs to strengthen its presence among members
and to reduce reliance on Government support. Currently, less than 10 percent of members pays
membership due regularly. Further works in the sector, including recruitment of a permanent executive
director and preparation of professional qualifying examination, will be financed by the second loan.
4.2    Accounting Education and Training Subproject
The implementation of this subproject has been largely completed except for nine doctorate
degree fellows who cannot complete their studies before June 30, 1995. Other funding sources are being
sought to finance the cost of study; if alternative sources cannot be identified DGHE, together with the
home universities, has agreed to take over the responsibility for providing sufficient financial support to
these fellows. Disbursement will extend into the 4-month grace period and when completed will leave an
unutilized balance of $4.03 million to be canceled.
4.2.1 Accounting Education in Higher Education
As targeted three new accounting development centers (ADC) have been established at the Universities
of Padjadjaran, Airlangga and Brawijaya. Utilizing overseas degree program returnees in respective ficulty of
economics, the centers are in high demand by outside institutions, public as well as private, for consulting
services, studies/research, and degree and non-degree accounting training including training of SMA and
SMEA accounting teachers under the project. Centers at universities of Indonesia, Gajah Mada and Airlangga
are embarking on to more commercial activities.
Overseas degree program returnees (141 compared to the targeted 100) also contribute to the
development of accounting departments in other public universities (through cascade approach) as well as in
private ones. However, due to difficulties in finding qualified candidates, the component has been unable to
meet the target for doctorate degree program participants. Fifteen Ph.D. candidates, compared to the targeted
30, have finally been sent to US and Austalian universities. Eight of these are fromn Gadjahmada University
and are projected to join the teaching faculty in the university's Ph.D. programn in accounting to be started in



- 28 -
1996. In addition to overseas taining, domestic master's degree training was also provided to 100 accoutng
lecturers from public and pnvate universiftes. Data as of closig date indicate that about one-fifth of mastrs
degree graduates, both overseas and domestic, originated from private universities.
In terms of student enrollment, all six leading public universites note very high aspirton among the
students to study accounting. This has led the universities (except University of Indonesia) to limit accouing
student enrllment in their faculties of econonucs to a third of total student body. The Team considers this
policy needs revisiting to ensure that it does not imply a negatve effect on supply of qualified accountant.
During implementation, the subproject took over administion of the national accountig examiation
(UNA) from the Economics Consortium and held 24 UNAs for 8,017 accounting graduates of unaccredited
universities. The subproject provided 15,750 copies of textbooks and 720 copies of journals to 18 faculties of
economics and distributed more than 1,000 computers and their allied equipment to the same ficulties of
economics and 10 IKIPs.
4.2.2  Accoundng Educcion in Secondary Education
The project provided 2,000 computers and their peripherals, 32,000 calculators, and furniture for use
by 140 SMEAs. Three months overseas training for 64 accounting teacher supervisors were also provided and
45,000 teacher manuals have been distributed. Through in-country training, more than 4,500 SMEA
accounting teachers have now been trained in computer accounting. Also, in meeting the need for accouning
teachers of SMEA in off-Java areas, 250 IKI graduates have been recruited.
Another 2,000 computers and their peripherals have been distributed to 100 selected public SMAs. A
the-month overseas training in accounting teaching and curriculum development has been provided for 58
SMA accountig teacher supervisors. In-country teachers training were given to more than 2,300 teachers. The
project also distributed 300,000 copies of student book and developed 200 accounting books.
Quality control in delivery of computers to beneficiary schools, however, appears to be
inadequate. There are schools which received defective computers and were unable to get replacements.
While teachers and teaching improvement targets have been achieved very substantially during project
implementation, time allocation for accounting class in SMA has been minimal. The new SMA and SMEA
currcula which accommodate sustainability of the achievements, and allow more time for SMA accounting
class, will be effective only in academic year 1995/96 and, therefore, the project missed the opportunity to
assess the real classroom impact.
4.2.3 NonformalAccounting Training
The project trained more than 18,000 accounting instructors. Training for trainers was also
provided to 175 trainers who are expected to train course managers/owners; the same number of training
for exam writer trainers and 105 training for exam grader trainers were also provided under the project.
Through cascade approach the graduate of these training trained 741 course owners, 9,000 exam writers
and 5,400 exan graders. The project also supported development of 179 accounting modules, 5 technical
guidance books, and 25 teacher modules.
Under the category of institutional and student loans the project allocated $ 2.8 million to support
students and private training institutions. As of closing date, the whole fund has been channeled to 10,645
students and 752 institutions. However, administration arrangement in DIKMAS appears inadequate and



-29 -
does not allow appropnate monitoring of performance; no accurate information on collection rate, for
instance, was available. The Team was informed that dunng initial stage of implementation DIKMAS
was not supported by operational budget to manage the activity. The Team recommends that MOEC
investigate the actual results of this activity.
5     Accounting Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Subproject (CAAD/I'XPA)
This subproject was not included in the June 1994 extension and no further activities were
supported by the loan after June 30, 1994. About $1.3 million will be canceled from this subproject.
CAADITKPA managed to produce studies, seninars and conferences on the supply of accounting
manpower, organization of IAI, strategy for STAN development, new accountants act, framework for the
regulation of corporate financial reporting, and computerized government accounting system.
CAAD/TKPA continues to function under the support of MOF particularly in maintaining a library
procured under the project. In this regard, the Team would like to reiterate the previous supervision
missions recommndation that the books and equipment be donated or lent to another institution for
which operating a library would be more appropriate and where access could be increased. BPLK
(MOF's Training Institute) and BPKP's Training Center have expressed their interest in obtaining such
books and equipment.
6     Operational Plan and Borrower's Contribution to ICR
A plan was reviewed with MOF for the operational phase of the Accounting Development
Project. The plan indicates that all subprojects are dependent on external financing for the sustainability
of their achievements. Of the implementing agencies, only BAKUN, BAPEPAM and the private sector
(through MOF) are supported by the Second Accounting Development Project (Loan 3801-IND). In all
implementing agencies, the Team also sees a clear indication of limited funding to finance operations and
maintenance of facilities that were built up during project implementation. A copy of the plan is attached
unedited as Annex 4 to this aide memoire. MOEC expects to complete its operational plan by end of
August.
The Team has given the Borrower a one-page guidance for preparation of Borrower's
contribution to the ICR. The guidance is attached as Annex 5 to this aide memoire.
7     Schedules for ICR Preparation
The Bank will send the draft ICR to the Borrower by October 27, 1995. Comments from the
Borrower is expected to be received by October 30, 1995 and Borrower's contribution to the ICR is
expected to be received by October 30, 1995. The Bank will incorporate the Borrower's comment and
issue the ICR by December 31, 1995. Earlier dates will be preferable both to the Bank and the Borrower.

The Accountancy Development Project
Sub Project: The Accountancy Education Development Project
Operational Plans
A. Background Information:
1.  In general, the Accountancy Education Development Sub-project has been successfully
administered and has contributed major results as expected by the government in improving
accounting education in the country.
Basic revision and development in accounting education such as curricula, teaching materials,
human resource2 and supporting teaching facilities have been successfully achieved by the
project at all level of education, that is: the Secondary Education (SA4 and SMEA),
Nonformal Education and Higher Education.
2.  When the project started, there was dualism in accounting education in Indonesia (Continental
and Anglosaxon systems).
The project has significantly reduced and eliminated the dualism by directing the accounting
education at all levels to the Anglosaxon system.
At present, accounting education has a common "language" which is also crucial in accounting
practices in Indonesia in providing reliable financial information for decision makers.
3.  At secondary and nonformal education levels, the project has been successful in building a
strong foundation for accounting education development by enhancing the quality of human
resources and education facilities such as:
a. deternining the minimum standard of capability that SMA/SMEA graduates must have in
order to meet the requirements of the society and in order to be able to revise and develop
better curricula, syllabi and course materials.
b. upgrading accounting teachers with modern accounting techniques (SMA, SMEA,
Nonformal Education), approximately 80 accounting teachers from SMA and SMEA have
been trained abroad (Australia) for three months.
c. providing supporting teaching facilities, such as: computers, calculators, books, practice
sets, modules, etc.
d. providing institution and student loans, for non-formal education
4.  At higher education, the project has been successful in strengthening accounting departments at
the faculty of economics, in terms of quality of human resources, facilities, curricula, syllabi,
teaching units, etc.



- 45 -
The establishment of six Accounting Development Centers (ADCs) at the University of
Indonesia, Gadjah Mada University, University of North Sumatera, Padjadjaran University,
Airlangga University, and Brawijaya University by the project is an important milestone of
developing accounting education nationwide, because ADCs serve as information clearing
house to provide accounting expertise for department development.
The establishment of new accounting departments such as at Hasanuddin University and
Andalas University is also important in widely spreading accounting education throughout the
country. By the cascade approach, the project has increased the number of accounting
departments exempted from the National Accounting Examination.
B. Post Project Activities:
1.  Higher Education
a. At higher education, the focus of the project was only accounting departments at the
faculty of economics. IKIP and FKIP that supply teachers for SMA and SMEA were
included in the project on a limited scope. Polytechnic and diploma level (D3) of
accounting education that supply middle-skilled accounting manpower have not been
included in the project. Therefore, further activities are needed to develop IKIPs, FKIPs,
Polytechnic and Diploma level (D3) at accounting education.
Important basic facilities to develop accounting education in 10 public IKIP have been
provided by the project during the project life, such as:
(a) in-country training for accounting IKIP and FKIP lecturers (600 man-months).
(b) short-course for 20 IKIP lecturers, for 3 months in Australia.
(c) 40 computers for each iIKP (totally 10 IKIP).
(d) The existence of 6 Accounting Development Centers which serve as information
clearing house could be used by IKIP and FKIP.
The fund to be used to develop accounting education at IKIPs is expected from the routine
budget.
b. 246 master and 15 PhDs which were produced during the project life, should be utilized
effectively in order to produce qualified accounting manpower in Indonesia as their main
tasks. For the future those manpower should be used to develop accounting education
through research and practices.
c. The distribution of computers to 18 Faculty of Economics and 10 IKIPs (40 computers
each is a great assistance to develop accounting education in the future). The maintenance
budget for the computers shall be taken from the routine budget.
d. The existence of 6 ADCs is expected to strengthen other accounting departments at other
faculty of economics, public as well as private, including the new accounting departments
in other universities. Several activities could be done as follows:



-46 -
1)  several lecturers from a certain ADC could become accounting lecturers in some
private universities; the budget in the forms of salary is from the private universities.
They are welcome to the other university
2)  an ADC could become local consultant to another new public faculty of economics.
The budget shall be from the new public faculty of economics.
3)  strong ADC could established a tailor-made short course for accounting lecturers
from other private universities. They are easily able to collect some budget for this
activity.
e. The existence of 246 Master and 15 PhDs spread out in 18 Faculties of Economics means
really something for the development of accounting education, by becoming accounting
consultants, accounting lecturers in other private universities, by establishing tailor made
short accounting courses for accounting lecturers as well as accounting teachers from
SMA and SMEA.
2.  Secondary Education (SMA and SMEA) and Non-formal Education
Although major results have been achieved during the project life, the project has just built a
foundation or a preliminary step in the accounting development process. Important follow up
activities have to be done in the future, among others:
a. The accounting curricula in the first step should be developed into technical manuals for
the implementation of those curricula.
b. Course materials, practice sets, accounting modules produced during the project life need
further revisions in order to adapt to the dynamic accounting education and practices.
The new curricula for SMA and SMEA was introduced in 1994. In each directorate, the
directorate of vocational education and the directorate of general education, there is a relevant
budget prepared for curricula validation activities.
c. The maintenance of their computers, SMA as well as SMEA is from their routine budget.
Many SMA and SMEA can maintain their computers effectively because of their
additional budget received by conducting computer class in the afternoon time. For the
future additional computers are needed in accordance with their needs.
d. Accounting teaching training of SMA accounting teachers through PKG (Pemantapan
Kerja Guru) contracted to 8 (eight) BPGs (Balai Penataran Guru) since 1990, need to be
developed continuously, to strengthen the teacher's capability, especially new appointed
accounting teachers. The budget is from the routine budget.
e. Institutional and Student loan
- This is only for nonformal education
After the project life, the directorate of non-formal education should monitor the
implementation of those loan, the repayment in details, so that the directorate can have
a clear picture of the condition of those loan. As a revolving fund it should be
administered soundly, so that it can be arranged with good system and procedure for
revolving. The budget for monitoring of the implementation of the loan decided that



-47 -
monitoring budget for Dikmas would be provided in 1996/1997 routine budget as well
as in 1996/1997 development budget, even though the project has ceased to exist on
March 31, 1996.
The existence of 6 Accounting Development Centers which serve as information
clearing house could be also used by accounting courses through the Directorate of
Non-fonnal Education.
The development of accounting curricula, modules, especially for Non-formal
Education could be prepared by establishing a special task force consisting of some
people from some strong accounting courses led by the Directorate of Non-fonral
Education. The budget will be from the existing strong accounting courses.

Annex 4
Guidance on Government's Contribution to the ICR
Government's own final evaluation of the project implementation is an important part of an ICR.
It is attached, unedited, to the ICR sent to the World Bank Board. It can be selective in its coverage and
should address issues and lessons learned in project implementation, from the borrower's perspective.
Topics covered can be the same as in the ICR, namely, project design, appraisal, implementation and
project results. At each stage of the project contribution should conmment on both World Bank and the
implementing agencies performances, with the observations, where possible, supported by evidence or
reasoned argument.
For project design the contribution could address such question as the appropriateness of the
project's objectives, the size of the project and scope of the investments proposed, aspects of design
leading to easy (or difficult) implementation and the effect on government institutions.
For project appraisal comments should concentrate on any significant changes in the objectives,
size and scope of the project and whether these were appropriate.
Project implementation experience should be divided into assessment of World Bank
performance in supporting and supervising the project and the performance of the implementing agencies.
Project results include an assessment of the direct physical benefits leading to financial and
economic benefits. Since financial and economic re-analysis of the project may be undertaken as part of
the ICR, it is suggested, if GOI so wishes, that the contribution could most usefully comment on the effect
of the project from the Government's perspective. Such an analysis would be a most useful contribution
to the ICR.
Based on the foregoing sections the contribution should list the main lessons learned from the
implementation experience and arising from the above analysis.
WB suggests that if the contribution is more than ten pages it should include a summary. The
latter is recommended for all but the shortest contributions.
The mission will be happy to provide any further elaboration or clarification required to assist in
preparation of the contribution.

GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTION TO IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
FOR THE ACCOUNTANCY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2940-IND)
This report sunmmarzes the Government's contribution to the ICR and includes contnbutions
from the three subprojects comprising the Accountancy Development Project. The format is in
consonance with World Bank Guidance Annex 5 consisting of five topics concerning project design,
appraisal, implementation, results and lessons learned.
Proiect Desien
The Project was designed as a single multidimensional project, comprising two major
ministries and two state audit agencies, for purposes of accountancy development in the public,
private and academic sectors. Both Ministries and all components were actively involved in the
initial design of the Project.
1.1    Accountinz Plannine. Monitorine and Evaluation (TKPA)
TKPA was established in 1985 by joint decree of the two Ministries to
coordinate accountancy planning including, but not limited to, the Project. Initially,
TKPA was supported by CIDA with technical assistance to prepare a joint detailed
proposal which resulted in World Bank staff appraisal and loan approval in 1988.
In accordance with the World Bank staff appraisal, TKPA was concerned with
the broad project policies, evaluation of project outcomes well as the administrative and
logistical arrangements for maintaining coordination between various activities, and
planning future stages of accounting development. These arrangements were
appropriately handled by a relatively smal secretariat with little previous experience in
the broad scope of activities in a multidimensional environment.
1.2    Accountine Practice (PPSA)
The objectives of the PPSA part of the Project were to improve accounting
practices in the public sector by supporting the introduction of modernized government
accounting practices, initially in MOF and three other agencies and eventually in all
agencies, and in the private sector by supporting development of technical' standards and
a code of ethics for the accounting profession. There were a number of secondary
objectives each of which was aligned with a PPSA component.
The size of the Project and the scope of investment were considered to
be appropriate to government accounting modernization, accounting education and
training, the capital market, private sector and two state audit agencies (BEPEKA and
BPKP).



- 50 -
1.3    Accounting Education (PPA)
From the point of view of the Accounting Education subproject, the project
objectives were clear, they were: to support the Govermnent's program to raise the
quality of accounting faculty and teaching staff, and to prepare for future expansion of
accounting education and training; to increase the supply of qualified accounting
professionals; and improve management of accounting education.
Within the Accounting Education subproject, the general objectives were to
improve accounting education at all levels, including higher and secondary education as
formal education, and public education as nonformal. Due to this broad spectrum,
problems in coordination emerged regarding the involvement of several directorates
general to prepare project plans in the interests of each party.
From the point of view of size and scope of the Accounting Education
subproject, all areas in the Republic of Indonesia were included. It was complex in that
project targets covered all schools, higher education and public education, in the regions.
The Ministry of Education and Culture had stated that the assistance would be
channelled to schools, higher education and nonfonnal institutions; whether in the form
of equipment such as calculators, computers, textbooks and accounting practice sets, or
in the form of advanced education by sending teaching staff and faculty members to
particular education institutions in-country and overseas.
2.    Proiect ADpraisal
Early in the project, the coordiation, monitoring and evaluation of activities of two
major ministries became limited along departmental lines, and the World Bank supervision
missions reviewed and reported each subproject separately in lieu of a single project.
Accordingly, in 1991, with the Bank's concurrence, the Project was restructured as three
separate subprojects, two subprojects in one ministry and one subproject in the other. Significant
revisions were made in the Ministry of Finance subprojects, TKPA and PPSA, but was not
considered to be needed at that time in the Ministry of Education and Culture subproject, PPA.
2.1    Accountine Planning. Monitorine and Evaluation (TKPA)
The revised strategy for the years 1990 to 1994 and annual work plans involved
the development of TKPA as a national coordinating body, as well as establishing an
accounting research and development facility with computer databases, university
networks, research grants, publishing, and a library. It also involved a reallocation of
loan and Government funding, all of which were submitted and acknowledged by the
Bank.
2.2    Accountine Practice (PPSA)
A detailed plan for PPSA consisting of revised annual work plans and budgets
was submitted to and acknowledged by the Bank in 1991. Revisions included increases in
the number of degree programs and short courses overseas for all components, plus



-51 -
equipment and consulting services for the Govermment accounting system. There were
offsetting decreases in in-country training for all components, and consulting services for
auditing and accounting education components.
Government Accounting
The Government Accounting System was still under study at the time of World
Bank appraisal in 1985. Therefore, the extent to which the system would be implemented
after studies and simulated operations was not appraised. This condition lasted until the
project was restructured in 1991 and an implementation plan was proposed and
acknowledged by the Bank. The plan included an increase in the level of effort of
consultants to design and deliver the computerized system.
Government Auditing
Both BEPEKA and BPKP revised their work plans and budgets to include self
managed activities directed to the preparation and issuance of government auditing
guidelines and training materials for in-country training programs. The targets listed in
the SAR were revised in the proposed plan and acknowledged by the Bank, however
Bank documents were not revised.
Capital Market
The initial project inputs to the Capital Market component were relatively
modest. With the growth of, and emphasis on the capital market, the inputs were
increased appropriately, mainly to augment the USAID Financial Markets Project by
providing funds for two essential capital market and investment operating manuals and
other studies. These were included in the Capital Market revised project work plan and
budget and acknowledged by the Bank.
Government Accounting Education (STAN)
Revisions to STAN's plans and budgets were based on a major relocation of
students and facilities to the new campus. The revisions included increases in computer
hardware and software for training purposes, training materials, and library facilities. In-
country training targets were adjusted based on the actual capacity of STAN, and
acknowledged by the Bank.
In the final stages of the Project, the World Bank recommended that it would be
premature to continue loan funding for STAN, pending consideration of STAN's future
role..
Private Sector
The project inputs were very modest for local consulting services related to
accounting and auditing standards, code of ethics and training materials for small scale
enterprises.



- 52 -
When the Government was unable to accept a USAID proposal for technical
assistance in development of the private sector, the Government and the World Bank
were both supportive in funding the institutional development of IAI in a second project.
2.3    AccountinLf Education (PPA)
The broad objectives of enhancing the quality of accounting education at all
levels meant that the availability of hardware and software in education and the quality
of teachers and staff faculties had to be improved. For these reasons, the Ministry
determined the priorities for implementation.
The priorities were chosen for programs that had the highest multiplier effect for
accountancy education development in the future. The programs of teacher and faculty
staff quality improvement was the highest priority for project implementation.
3.    Proiect Implementation
When equipment and resources were in place, all three subprojects improved physical
and budget realizations, and achieved significant progress. The Loan Closing date was extended
by one year to June 30, 1995 to accomrnmodate major activities that could not be completed by
1994.
3.1    Accountina Planning. Monitorine and Evaluation (TKPA)
With revised strategies, plans, and budgets, TKPA was effective in coordinating
accounting development in the Ministry of Finance.
During many World Bank supervision missions, it was necessary that the
subproject work in close harmony with the Bank in order to achieve mutually satisfying
results. Without this harmony, results were less satisfying.
In the best interests of accountancy development, the Government continued to
provide funding during the project extension period when loan funding was not available.
3.2    AccountinE Practice (PPSA)
By mid-project, all components had gained experience in management and
implementation of activities to achieve results. The Loan Extension was directed nainly
to overseas fellowships, procurement of hardware, software, publishing standards, and
in-country training in PPSA subprojects, and consulting services to implement and
maintain the Government accounting system.



- 53 -
Government Accounting
Noticeable progress in implementation was made after BAKUN had been
established in 1992 and staff had been recruited. By 1995, staff had increased from
very few to over 600 accounting, administrative and technical personnel, however
shortages continued to exist, particularly in technical maintenance staff.
Government Auditing
The World Bank supported the auditing component during the implementation
period, however in the final stages of the Project, further loan funding was not available
for the Government Auditing component due to borrowing constraints in the Ministry of
Finance.
The Government supported the inclusion of the audit agencies in the Project, and
also supported their inclusion in future funding from sources outside of the Project.
Capital Market
The Government has strongly supported the capital market supervisory agency
in Indonesia, and placed a high priority on the drafting of the new Capital Market Law
which is essential to enforcing capital market rules issued by BAPEPAM.
Government Accounting Education (STAN)
The Government expanded the facilities of STAN and continued to support the
school in its role in accounting training and education, while considering the
recommendations regarding the organization and structure of STAN.
Government support and financing will continue to be necessary in order to
assist STAN to conduct training for the expected large numbers of participants in the
Government accounting system.
Private Sector
The Government supported the LAI in its role in the Project and as the standard
setting body for Indonesia. Through the Government, loan funds were provided for
consulting services utilized by LIA to prepare accounting and auditing standards, code of
ethics, and training materials for small businesses. Senior officials of the Government are
taking active parts as Chairman and at the executive level in the management and
direction of LAI.
3.3    Accountine Education (PPA)
The Ministry of Education and Culture actively acted as the education project
implementing agency. To manage the operation of the project, the Accountancy
Education Development Sub Project (AEDP) was formed which is under the Directorate
General of Higher Education.



- 54 -
The AEDP carried out project implementation by using contractors as agencies
based on existing regulations. As owner of the project, the AEDP along with related
institutions monitored the project. Monitoring and evaluating was also done by the World
Bank.
The contractor which carried out the project activities was concerned with each
job specification. The job specifications were based on the program in the project plan,
supported by the budget which was later used as the aggregate price between the AEDP
and the contractor. The contractor was from a private company, especially for the
education equipment procurement of the state institution for training activities.
The constraints in project implementation were:
(a)    Coordination, related to delayed time and administration in the program
implementation as well as determining the related party managing the program.
(b)    Due to the scattered locations and scope of the program, delays occurred in the
equipment procurement realization.
The Loan Extension was directed to overseas fellowships, procurement of
equipment and in-country training in PPA subproject for those activities which could not
be completed by 1994.
4.    Proiect Results
All three subprojects achieved their main objectives. A comprehensive strategy for
accountancy development of the two ministries and two state audit agencies for 1994 to 2000
was prepared at the request of the World Bank.
4.1    Accountine Planning. Monitorine and Evaluation (TKPA)
The impact of TKPA has been most noticeable in meeting the continuing need
for accountancy development in Indonesia. The results obtained included: a number of
steering committee meetings regarding project coordination; 7 accountancy studies
concerning Draft Bill of New Indonesian Accountants Act, Framework for Regulation of
Corporate Financial Reporting, Draft Corporate Law, Accountancy Manpower Study,
and strategic studies for LAI, STAN and GAS; 38 accountancy development seminars
concerning the Accountants Law, Accounting Conceptual Framework, Standard Setting,
Code of Ethics, Accountancy Manpower, and others; accounting research involving a
library of 2,792 books and 1,570 journals; 2 database programs; 83 small grants to
university students and staff, arrangng a major conference for South East Asia
University Accounting Teachers.
4.2    Accountinu Practice (PPSA)
The imnpact on the PPSA subproject was effective over a range of essential
functions of the Ministry of Finance, BEPEKA and BPKP.



- 55 -
For all components, coordinated training programs resulted in 125 master
degrees, over 450 short course completions, approximately 26,700 participants in in-
country training. Coordinated procurement of equipment and services resulted in 56
contracts being let and administered.
The Project assisted DG Tax by procuring computers and printers, a site licence
for software and computer audit training. The Project also assisted MENKO EKUIN
WASBANG in conducting workshops as a bridging mechanism pending the
commencement of a larger USAID project.
Government Accounting
The computerized Government accounting system was being used in 105 offices
in 13 agencies in 12 regions by the end of the Project Extension. Accounting techniques
of double entry accounting and decentralized agency accounts had been implemented in
these agencies. The uniform chart of accounts has been implemented Government-wide in
31 agencies.
Government Auditing
In the state audit agencies, there was extensive in-country training for a total of
about 10,000 auditors, 119 overseas degree and over 400 participants in short course
programs for both audit agencies. An audit standards manual, 47 audit guidelines, and
audit training materials were prepared by BEPEKA. An audit manual, 20 audit
guidelines, and 36 projects using modem audit methodologies were prepared by BPKP.
A technical feasibility study concerning an extensive management information system
for BPKP was completed.
Capital Market
In the Capital Market component, over 260 companies issuing securities were
listed. 65 advisory notes, guidelines, and circular letters, a manual of Standard
Operational Procedures, and an Investment Funds Operations Manual were issued for the
use of private sector companies. Studies on taxation were conducted in conjunction with
DJP and LAI.
Govermment Accounting Education (STA
In the STAN component, there were 2 instructors holding doctoral degrees who
had not yet been posted to STAN; 20 foreign master degrees of which 9 had moved to
DG Tax; and 20 participants on overseas courses. There were increases to 2,200 DIU
and 665 DV trainees in 1995, and over 10,600 participants in courses conducted by the
PPA. Training materials, practice sets, and research studies were prepared by the PPA.
An accounting students reference library of over 2,200 books and journals was
established. A major study of the Proposed Structure and Activities for STAN resulted in
a number of reconmmendations for the consideration of the Ministries of Finance, and
Education and Culture.



- 56 -
Private Sector
In tbe Private Sector component, the IAI membership increased to over 4,900
accountants, 573 licensed accountants, 15 accounting principles and 12 auditing
standards were issued, studies were undertaken concerning compliance with standards
and the code of ethics, training materials were prepared for small scale businesses,
major seminars in accountancy were conducted for both the public and private sectors.
4.3    Accountine Education (PPA)
Generaly, the Accountancy Education Development Project (AEDP) achieved
the predetermined targets. However, due to the location and number of regions to be
developed in this country, the targets could not be totally achieved as expected.
The location of schools, higher education, and nonformal education which are
scattered in the Republic of Indonesia are the constraints and problems for future
development of the AEDP programs.
5.    Lessons Learned
Lessons learned will be useful for future projects, including the second project.
Experienced project management personnel, in both World Bank and Government, with a
fimdamental professional knowledge of the project's components are essential for both the Bank
and the Government to obtain optimum benefits.
Agreed revisions to documentation, in both World Bank and Government, are essential to
progressive project implementation.
5.1    Accountine Plannine. Monitorine and Evaluation (TKPA)
Coordinated management of Government projects with multiple components
requires that project managers in all components have appropriate qualifications and
experience.
High level coordination at senior levels of Government and the private sector are
essential to achieving the strategic objectives of accountancy development.
5.2    Accountin! Practice (PPSA)
Implementation of Government projects with multiple components is greatly
facilitated by centralizing functions of training and procurement
Government Accounting
Standards for information technology, quality assurance and financial reporting
need to be developed in order to provide consistent and useful reports throughout the
Ministry of Finance.

In-country training of agency accounting staff is essential to the government
accounting system. Large numbers of personnel continue to need training because of the
expansion of, and enhancements made, to the system.
Maintenance training is essential. Every effort should be made to provide
training in advanced new technologies. Consultants working under Government contracts
should be expected to train and transfer technology to Govenmment staffs.
Government Auditing
In-countiy training is vital to Government auditing agencies and auditors at a
time when significant progress is being made in the formulation of Government audit
standards, expansion of the computerized Government accounting system, and new
computer audit technology.
BEPEKA and BPKP will need to constantly up-grade and increase the numbers
of training instructors and equipment, including computers and computer software.
Capital Market
Technical assistance is necessary to assist BAPEPAM in rule-making and
enforcing rules. In this regard, a transfer of technology by the consultants who provide
this technical assistance is essential to enable Government staff to continue its regulatory
work without reliance on consultants.
Advanced specialized training in capital market operations is vital to the
increased efficiency and effectiveness of Government staff.
Government Accounting Education (STAN)
Government support and financing is needed commensurate with STAN's
capacity to conduct training for the number of accountants needed.
The recommendations made in the Study of the Proposed Structure and
Activities for STAN should be considered with a view to the future status of STAN.
Private Sector
The sustainability of the LAI as a standard setting body, and professional
accounting institution with responsibilities for the development of its membership, will
require financial resources beyond the current capabilities of the IAI. In order to achieve
a degree of financial stability as soon as possible, it is necessary that the IM start
immediately to meet its financial responsibilities.
It is necessary that the W should be staffed on a full time basis with at least two
full time Directors and support staff dedicated to the institutional development of IAI as
an independent, professional, financially-capable institution.

5.3    Accountine Education (PPA)
The Ministry of Education and Culture could form the project organization by
involving manpower from each directorate general, even though, as a result, the
organization structure and communication of the project may become more complex, and
the project cost could be affected.
