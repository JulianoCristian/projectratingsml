MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION ANr DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR AN ACCOUNTANCY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Government of Indonesia for US$113 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 20 years'
maturity, including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest
rate, and would finance the first phase of a program to modernize government
accountancy, strengthen the accountancy profession, and increase the scope and
efficiency of the capital market.
2.        Background.  The performance both of public administration and
private sector enterprises is hampered by archaic practices and a paucity of
well trained accounting and auditing staff. Deficiencies in accounting
practices are evident both in the public sector and in the private sector.
Government accounts suffer from incompleteness, lateness and absence of
internal controls. In the private sector, the absence of technical standards
for the profession contributes to inconsistent treatments of similar financial
transactions; the absence of a code of ethics contributes to a lack of
professional discipline. As for the scarcity of qualified accounting
manpower, pre-service and in-service training programs in accountancy are
typically of low quality and are not able to meet the demand for qualified
accountants in the public and private sectors.
3.        The Government is aware of these deficiencies, and is committed to
an accountancy development strategy to correct them. Key elements of the
Government's strategy are:  (a) Modernization of accounting practices.  Under
the recently completed Polytechnic Project (Cr. 869-IND, 1979), the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) commissioned an extensive study of needs for changes in
government accounting practices. That study developed a detailed program of
proposed changes to modernize government accountancy. After consultation with
the Bank and among the various ministries involved, the Government has decided
to implement the program. The key features of the program are: (i) the
introduction of double-entry accounting, (ii) consolidation of central
accounting, (iii) the restructuring of department-level accounts to provide
better financial information at the program level, and (iv) the introduction
of balance-sheet accounting.  The Government has just launched the first phase
of the modernization program, starting with the changes in central government
accounts and with selected departmental accounts for four ministries. To
strengthen private-sector accounting practices, the Government's strategy is
to support the development of technical standards and a code of ethics for the
profession, together with efforts to strengthen the professional association
of accountants and strengthen the capital market. At the recommendation of
the Bank, it recently established an interministerial Coordinating Agency for
Acco,ntancy Development (CAAD) which is to oversee the broad implementation of
the accountancy modernization program, including the development of
accountancy training programs and complementary measures to strengthen the



-2-
professional association or accountants and to develop accountancy standards
for the profession; and (b) Strengthening of accountancy training. To begin
to meet the need for qualified accounting and auditing manpower in the public
and the private sector, the Government is embarking on a major effort to
improve the quality and relevance of accountancy training in its various pre-
service and in-service training programs. As a secondary priority, it is also
planning a gradual expansion of accountancy enrollments.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.        The Bank has been engaged in a dialogue with the Government on needs
in accountancy development since the preparation of the 1979 Polytechnic
Project, which included the preparation of the current accountancy moderniza-
tion program. The Bank strategy is to support the Government's efforts to
modernize and strengthen its accounting and auditing systems, including
complementary legal and institutional changes. This is necessarily a long-
term efFort, requiring careful phasing of actions. Through its intensive
discussions with the Government on the content of the modernization program
and the appropriate arrangements for implementation, the Bank has satisfied
itself as to the appropriateness and the high priority of the Goveinment's
accountancy development strategy, including its plans for phased
implementation of the strategy.
Project Objectives
5.        The objeccives of the proposed project are the following:
(a) to improve accounting practices by supporting the introduction of
the program to modernize government accounting practices and related
efforts to strengthen the professional association of accountants,
to develop accounting and auditing standards, and to strengthen the
capital market (para. 3(a)); and
(b) to support the Government's program to raise the quality of
accounting staff and to prepare for future expansion of accountancy
training (para. 3(b)).
Project Description
6.        The project would address these objectives by supporting the first-
phase implementation of the Government's strategy for accountancy development
in all its major aspects. It would do so through two major subprojects.
7.        The Accounting Practice subproject would introduce a new government
accounting system in a group of government departments, improve the government
auditing services, and provide equipment (computers) and staff training. The
professional a3sociation of accountants would be strengthened by introducing a
series of accounting standards, a code of ethics and a program of continuing
professional education. Expert assistance on modern stock exchange practices
would be provided to the Jakarta Stock Exchange to improve investor confidence
and widen its app,al to local companies.



-3-
8.        The Accounting Education subproject would assist the Government to
upgrade the quality of accounting manpower by improving accounting education
in the secondary, tertiary, and nonformal subsectors. The assistance would
include local and overseas staff development, technical assistance,
procurement of teaching equipment and materials, research, expansion of the
number of Accountancy Development Centers (from 4 to 7), incentives (in the
form of local fellowships) for students to become accounting teachers, and
loan programs for institutions and students in nonformal accountancy
educition.
9.        A third, smaller subproject would provide overall project
coordination, monitoring and evaluation, including the application of
*        performance indicators.  Implementation of the AccouLnting Practice subproject
and the Accounting Education subproject would be managed by separate PIUs in
the MOF and the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOECV, respectively. CAAD
would monitor overall project implementation.  A group of distinguished
international accounting authorities (the Special Consultants) .would assist in
overall monitoring of the project and provide counsel in the development of
long-term strategies for the further development of accountancy practice and
manpower.
10.       The project is estimated to cost a total of US$164.5 million, of
which US$76.5 million is expected to be foreign in origin. Cost estimates and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. The timetable of key events of project processing are summarized
in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is shown in
Schedule D. A map of Indonesia is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report is
being distributed separately.
11.       Actions Agreed.  In view of their importance to the success of the
Accounting Practice subproject, the Government provided assurances at
negotiations that:
(a)  it would prepare and submit to the Bank for comment by December 31,
1988 a detailed program for iwplementation of government accountancy
modernization, including organizational arrangements and necessary
government Instructions, and would subsequently implement the
program in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and
(b) it would maintain the CAAD and the MOEC and MOF implementation units
throughout the project with appropriate functions, staffing, and
resources.
12.       Benefits.  The project is expected to yield sizable but diffuse
benefits. The Accounting Practice subproject would lead to improved public
stewardship, improved planning and controi of public expenditure programs and
projects and a strengthened capital market. The Accounting Education
subproject would improve the quality dnd quantity of accounting manpower both
through formal courses at the university and secondary levels, and through
nonformal instruction for persons outside the regular educational structure.
The planning, monitoring and evaluation subproject would bring the results of



- 4 -
the two operational subprojects into perspective and help map the strategy for
future actions in accountancy and related fields.
13.       Risks.  The size and scope of the project and extent of its coverage
inevitably entail risks that some participants will resist the changes which
are to be introduced, and that overall implementation could suffer from delays
in a few key components. Risks of the first type have been minimized by the
phased design of reform implementation; risks of the second type have been
addressed through the establishment oi adequately staffed implementation
units, and the special supervision and monitoring designed to help ensure that
satisfactory progress is achieved.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
