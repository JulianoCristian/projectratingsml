The first, support for\n            technology development, enhances capacity for research\n            coordination; establishes a competitive agricultural\n            research program (CARP) to support time bound adaptive\n            research on priority constraints, increases productivity of\n            the smallholder agriculture; and strengthens research\n            support for technology dissemination activities. The second\n            establishes a demand-driven technology dissemination system\n            through rationalizing, reorienting, and strengthening line\n            departments; increases participation by the private sector\n            in input supply and support services; increases\n            participation by the farming communities mobilized with the\n            help of nongovernmental organizations; and supports human\n            resource development and greater use of information\n            technology. The third supports increased private sector\n            involvement and public/private partnerships in agri-business\n            development. The fourth supports rural infrastructure\n            development by improving rural roads in the project\n            districts, rural markets, and market information collection\n            and dissemination systems. The fifth supports a project\n            management and enhanced capacity for economic policy\n            analysis while the sixth supports a project preparation facility."}, "docdt": "1998-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
