The lessons learned indicate that changing\n            policies, processes, institutions and people's\n            incentives and attitudes is a pre-requisite for agricultural\n            transformation. Commercialization and private sector\n            involvement is necessary for raising rural incomes.\n            Stability in Project Coordinator and other senior staff,\n            together with appropriate decision making authority and\n            accountability, contributes significantly towards success.\n            Administrative and financial decentralization need to occur\n            together to be effective. Use of beneficiary groups as entry\n            points for project activities improves participation and\n            beneficiaries' capacity to absorb project-supported\n            changes. Input and service supply based on full-cost\n            recovery is feasible provided quality and timeliness are\n            assured. Early and adequate training in financial management\n            for project staff, including concerned staff of implementing\n            agencies/departments, is essential in view of the time\n            required to absorb and apply these skills. Use of an\n            independent agency for M&E improves quality and\n            timeliness of reporting, contributing significantly to\n            user-feedback and effective project monitoring and management."}, "docdt": "2004-09-08T00:00:00Z"}
