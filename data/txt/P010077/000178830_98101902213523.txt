REPORT AND RECO.DMDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE FINANCING OF INDUSTRIAL INV SThENT
TO BE A34INISTERED BY THE PAKISTAN INDUSTREAL
CREDIT AND INVESTiNT CORPORATION
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent of $25 mil-
lions for an industrial investment project. The proceeds of the loan
would form a special fund to be re-lent to industrial enterprises for
specific investment projects. The management of this fund would be the
responsibility of the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corpora-
tion (PICIC). The loan would bear interest at 7¼ percent per annum and
would be repayable over 20 years, including three and a half years of
grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
1.        The most recent economic report "Economic Situation and Pros-
pects of Pakistan" (74-PAK, dated February 16, 1973) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on March 2, 1973 (R73-76). A country data
sheet is attached as Annex'I.
2.        The economy of Pakistan (the former West Pakistan) grew rapidly
during the Second Plan period (1960-65), with GDP increasing at 6.7 per-
cent per annum. This high growth was spearheaded by an industrial growth
of 13.1 percent per annum. However, agriculture grew by only 3.7 percent
per annum. West Pakistan's overall economic growth slowed down somewhat
during the Third Plan (1965-70) to about 6 percent.   The industrial
growth rate fell to 7.6 percent, but agricultural output grew at 5.6 per-
cent annually with the aid of new high-yielding wheat and rice varieties,
reducing, but not eliminating, the food deficits.
3.        Though it is hardly apparent in these figures, Pakistan's
economic development began to encounter a number of difficulties after
1965. Import restrictions and other direct controls introduced at that
time became permanent as the shortage of foreign exchange and budget
resources persisted, owing to higher defense expenditure, rising foreign
debt service, and decreased nonproject foreign aid. Both net foreign aid
and domestic savings declined, and investment fell from about 22 percent
of GDP in 1964/65 to about 17 percent in 1969/70, and to only 11 percent
in 1971/72. The slowdown in industrial growth, along with urban popula-
tion growth rates of more than 5 percent led to a rapid rise in urban



- 2 -
unemployment.  In riral areas, it Twas the larger Larmers who got most of
the benefits from the new "green revolution".
4.        The economy underwent severe straim during 1970/71 and 1971/72,
reflecting booth political events and a prolonged drought wh-ich virtually
halted the :lncrease in agricultural output. In 1972/73, however, the
economy showed signs of revival. With a recovery in industrial produc-
tion and a record wheat, crop of 7.L4 million tons, GDP is estimated to have
grown by about 6 percent. Devaluation in May 1972 has been successful in
making Pakistani 6eXoo-ts more zompetitive ir. irternational markets, in
increasing incentives to produce for tihe local nmarket, and an 'bringing
abcut a much more liberal system of import control. Exports rose by 43
per ent in 1971/72 and by arnother 36 percent in 1972/73. For the first
time s-ince l950/f1, the country had a trade surplus, and for the first
nine months of 1972/73 the balance of payments showed a surplus of $34
million.  The State Bank's gross foreign exchange reserves (net of IMF
position) nearly doubled to $360 million in the year ended June 1973.
5.       TThe floods which occurred after the monsoon this year
were a set-back for the reviving economy, which had been expected to
grow by 8 percent in l973/74¢. The floods caused damage to standing crops
of cotton, rice, sugar arnd animal fodder. There have also been substan-
tial losses of wheat stocks and cattle, and damage, in some areas, to
farm equipment, homes, transport, telecommunications and canal networks.
A mission from the Bank and the United Nations visitod Pakistan to assess
the flood damage and the need for external aid. Their detailed assesss-
ment will be available shortly. It is clear that the balance of payments
will be adversely affected as a result of increased imports of foodgrains
and of materials for rehabilitation and repair of agricultural and in-
dustrial equipment and infrastructure.
6.        Other majo-r problems facing Pakistan are to stimulate output
and employment, to control inflation, to increase public and private
saving and investment, and to improve the distribution of income.  De-
spite reasonably rapid growth in 1972/73, the domestic supply of essen-
tial consumption goods has not increased much. lThgether with the in-
creased income resulting from the strong rise in exports, this has been
an important factor behind the rapid rise in prices. The floods gave a
further impetus to prices as buyers reacted to fears of shortages. Price
increases of 20 percent last year reflect continuing domestic inflation and
sharp increases in international prices for Pakistan's principal exports
(cotton, cotton textiles, and rice) and imports. The Government has
attempted to contain inflation through increased subsidies and price con-
trols, but largely unsuccessfully.
7.        At present, the prices of Pakistan's major exports are high
and they w11 probably decliine, with adverse effects on the balance of
payments and public finanzces.  Investment irn real terms has not in-
creased much in the current year, there has been little addition to the
productive capacity of the economy, and the private sector is still
cautious.  however, if the necessary saving and investment are forthcoming,



-3-
Pakistan's growth prospects to appear relatively good. Exports appear to
be limited more by supply constraints rather than lack of demand (witn
the important exception of the textile quotas in importing countries).
The water from Tarbela Dam will be available from late 1975, and the
increasing participation of small and medium-scale farmers in the "tgreen
revolution" could mean that agricultural growth in the next 5 years will
match the 5.6 percent annual rate of the 1965-70 Third Plan period. Capital
goods, light engineering goods, and agro-based industries also have good
growth prospects. Thus, after the current fiscal year, the economy can
reasonably be expected to grow by about 7 percent annually in the next
several years, provided the inflow of foreign capital and the generation
of domestic savings are together sufficient to finance the necessa.ry
investment.
8.        Pakistan's external public debt at the end of December 1972
amounted to $4.8 billion equivalent, of which $870 million was undisbursed.
Pakistan's debt service, as at present. scheduled, would rise from $187 mil-
lion in 1972/73 to about $400 million by 1975/76.  This rapid increase reflects
the debt rescheduling operations which were arranged in May 1972 and June 1973;
it would mean a rise in the debt service ratio from 15 percent at present to
around 30 percent in 1975/76. However, it is not likely that Pakistan will
be called upon to repay as much as this; countries which are members of the
Pakistan Consortium have agreed that, after July 1, 1974, Pakistan will not
be asked to service debts on account of projects visibly located in Bangladesh.
Moreover, Consortium countries have agreed to consider providing further
debt relief to Pakistan on a long-term basis, and the Bank is preparing a
study on this subject for consideration by the Consortium.
9.        It is.clear from this that as much as possible of financial
assistance to Pakistan should be on concessionary terms. Therefore, the
major part of Eank Group aid to Pakistan is provided by IDA. However, some
Bank lending to Pakistan is justified. The last Bank loan to Pakistan was
made in 1970, and, consequently, the volume of Bank loans disbursed and
outstanding has been declining over the past few years. On June 30, 1973,
it amounted to $316 million equivalent, or less than 8 percent of Pakistan's
total external public debt. The service on 3ank debt amounted to about 30
percent of Pakistan's total debt service in FY 1973, reflecting the fact that
the terms of Bank loans are harder than those of Pakistan's debt as A whole.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
10.       The Bank and IDA made 31 loans and 38 development credits to
Pakistan (total for East and W1st) between the start of operations in
1952 and June 30, 1971. The Bank and IDA had committed $1.2 billion
to the country, about one-half of which was provided by the Bank and
one-half by IDA. Of this amount, one loan and 19 development credits,
totaling US $4.7 million and US $168.1 million, respectively (net of
cancellation), were for projects located wholly within what was then
East Pakistan and amther 10 loans and 8 development credits involved
expenditures in both East and West Pakistan.



1.        Irn auust- 1972, Bangladesh became a member of the Bank and IDA,
and it was then agreed that proposals would be submitted to the Execu-
tive Directors for reactivation of all the uncompleted projects located
in Bangladesh which had previously been financed under credits to Pakistan.
Accordingly, 11 such credits in an aggregate amount of 'JS $151.4 million
have since been made to Bangladesh. Of this amount, about US $44.1 mil-
lion has been used for the notional repayment of amounts disbursed under
th6 corresponding previous credit agreements with Pakistan. Bangladesh
Las recently agreed to enter discussions with all members of the Pakistan
Consortium concerning the assumption of liability for debts on account of
projects visibly located in Bangladesh. The Bank, too, i3 entering into
discussions with Bangladesh with a view to the taking over by Bangladesh
of li:bility for all Bank loans and IDA credits which were fully disbursed
by Decemuber 1971.
12.       Of the $1.2 billion lent to Pakistan (East and West), West
Pakistan received about 72 percent.  During its long association with
Pakistan, the Bank/IDA has been involved in almost all. sectors of the
economy.  tfrtil 1972, 38 percent of the total cormitments were for the
public services, 29 percent for agriculture, 22 percant for industry,
10 percent for industrial imports, and 1 percent for education. Lending
for public services amounted to some $325 milliorn and included loans and
credits for railways, electric power, pipelines, the Karachi Port, high-
ways, telecommunications, and water supplies.  A large part of the lending
for agriculture was for Indus Basin projects. The lending for industry
has been mostly through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation (PICIC). Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of October 31, 1973, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
13.       No Bank loans or IDA credits were made Lor Pakistan between
August 1970 and October 1972, when a $50 million credit for industrial
imports was signed. A second credit of $45 million for industrial im-
ports was signed on June 15, 1973; the resumption of project lending was
marked by the signing in July 1973 of a credit for the expansiorn of the
Port of Karachi. In addition to the present loan, a loan for a fertilizer
project and a credit for an oil terminal at Karachi Port will be presented
to Executive Directors in FY7T. UIder consideration, too, is a program
credit to assist Pakistan to recover from the recent floods. Credits for
telecommunications and for a highway improvement program are planned for
FY75,a_s i9 the resurnption of operations in the agricultural sector.-An__
economic mission has just returned from Pakistan and one of its objectives
was to study the steps needed to encourage the rural development program;
another mission, planned for early next year, is to study the question of
making the best use of' the Indus River system and the water which will
shortly become available from the Tarbela Dam. As a result of the mission,
projects in the field of salinity control and reclamation should be developed.
1J4.      I?C has made nine operations in Pakistan for a total of $28
million, of which $2(07 million was by way of' loans and $7.3 million by
equity participations.  About $14 million remains outstanding.  The



enterprises assisted by IFC include three in the field of pulp and paper
products, two in textiles, and one each in steel, cement and fertilizers.
IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - INDUSTRY IN PAKISTAN
General
15.       In terms of its contribution to the gross domestic product,
manufacturing is the second largest sector of the Pakistan economy (about
17 percent). Three-fourths of industrial output is estimated to origi-
nate from medium and large-scale industries and one-quarter from the
small-scale sector. However, about three-fourths of the industrial labor
force is employed in small-scale establishments (less than 10 employees).
Manufacturing as defined in the census of population and labor force sur-
vey utilizes about 16 percent of the total labor force of about 19 milLion.
The recent devaluation and the import liberalization have reduced some
structural distortions and should help promote fuller utilization of exist-
ing capacity.
16.       Despite substantial diversification of the production structure
in the past ten years, the share of agro-based industries (textiles, sugar,
edible oil, paper, leather, tobacco) has remained almost constant at about
60 percent of total industrial value added. Chemicals (mainly pharmaceuti-
cals and fertilizers) and engineering industries each account for about 10
percent of industrial value added. Geographically, the distribution is un-
even. Almost half of industrial output is produced in Sind (mainly Karachi)
and more than 40 percent in the Punjab. The Northwest Frontier Province
produces less than 10 percent and Baluchistan less than 1 percent. The
Government, through fiscal incentives and administrative measures, is pro-
moting the location of industries in less developed areas.   The chief element
of the past growth strategy has been the development of industries based on
processing domestic agricultural raw materials, particularly cotton textile
mills serving both domestic and world markets. The initial phase of
industrialization was primarily import substitution, but since the late
1950's there has been a continuing expansion of production for export, parti-
cularly in textiles. The increase in aggregate exports in the sixties was
almost entirely due to the expansion of sales of manufactures, which account
for somewhat more than half of merchandise export earnings. Half of
manufactured exports, in turn, are cotton textiles.
17.       In the early sixties, as noted earlier, industrial output grew
at about 13 percent per year, but in the latter part of the decade the
growth rate was markedly less - about 8 percent per year. There were a
number of reasons for this, including the war with India in 1965, a re-
duction in foreign assistance, and a less favorable investment climate
owing to political uncertainty. As a result mainly of the events of 1971,
industrial investment fell by 9 percent in 1970/71 and by a further 30
percent in 1971/72. Recently there has been a significant revival of
industrial activity based largely on a rapid increase of exports, particu-
larly of cotton textiles. Devaluation and import liberalization in May



-6-
1972 and adjustment t; changed circumstances were reflected in renewed
growth. The medium- ana large-scale manufacturing sector experienced a
growth in production of 6.3 percent during FY1973.
Industrial Planning
18.       A new five-year development plan, under preparation, is to
begin in July 1975.  It appears that the general direction of industrial
planning in Pakistan will have these features: (i) more emphasis will be
placed on the optimum utilization of existing capacity than on creation
of new capacity; (ii) efforts will be intensified to promote small-scale
industries to broaden industrial ownership, and to accelerate development
of po-r regions; (iii) engineering industries will be given high priority
to relieve pressure on foreign exchange resources and because of its
employment potential; and (iv) while the public sector will increase its
relative share in basic and heavy manufacturing, the private sector will
be encouraged to play a larger role in export-oriented industries process-
ing indigenous raw materials.
Policy Towards the Private Sector
19.       In January 1972, in accordance with its stated objective of
increasing social control of industry, the Government took over the
management of 31 private companies in ten basic industrial categorles.
These companies accounted for some 8 percent of total Pakistan indus-
trial assets, 5 percent of industrial sales, and 6 percent of employment
in firms with more than 100 workers.  The management of foreign-controlled
enterprises and those with assets of less than Rs 10 million -was not taken
over by the Government. Shareholders were allowed to retain shares and
proprietary rights, but the Government appointed new professional manrge-
ment, recruited mostly from the private sector.   The performance of many
of these companies under the new management has improved, reflecting in
part the better economic situation.   The Govermn,ent new controls an
estimated 18 percent of industrial assets, 10 percent of industrial sales,
and 11 percent of employment in industrial enterprises with more than 100
workers.  The Goverrment has stated that its objective is a mixed economy
with a dynamic private sector and it wishes to encourage the inflow of
foreign private capital. However, some recent measures, such as the
nationalization of the vegetable ghee industry and of the cotton export
trade, and the takeover of the distribution of fertilizer in the Punjab
oy the Provincial Goverrment, have not been reassuring to the private sector,
despite the fact that they were justified by the Government as necessary to
meet immediate problems and were not to be interpreted as a reflection of a
long-term policy.  However, despite this uncertainty, some revival of acti-
vity in the industrial sector is under way, as is evidenced by a continuing
demand by client enterprises of PICIC, and of other institutions providing
finance for industry, for loans in foreign exchange for the modernization
and expansion of production. It is therefore important that this revival
should not be thwarted by any shortage of foreign exchange and this provides
the justification for vhe loan now proposed.

Financial Institutions
20.       The principal sources of long-term finance for industry are
PICIC and IDBP (Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan). PICIC oper-
ates primarily in the field of medium- and large-scale manufacturing,
and IDBP in the field of small- and medium-scale industry. Although
PICIC and IDBP can both make equity investments and underwrite public
issues, their financing activities have consisted primarily of long-
term lending. Capital market activities, including securities issues,
are undertaken mainly by the Investment Corporation of Pakistan (ICP),
a Government-owned institution established in 1966, and by the National
Investment Trust (NIT), an open-end mutual fund owned by 12 institu-
tional shareholders, including PICIC and IDBP. A Government-owned
institution, the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC),
assists in promoting industrial projects in the private sector, as well
as in establishing and managing public sector enterprises, notably in
mining.
21.       Twenty-five commercial banks (17 Pakistan and 8 foreign) pro-
vide short-term working capital to industry, although they are also
permitted to provide long-term financing up to a ceiling fixed by the
State Bank of Pakistan (the Central Bank) for each bank. Insurance
companies participate in industrial financing as members of underwrit-
ing consortia, and as investors in corporate securities. Life insurance
companies were nationalized in 1972; the objective was to facilitate
the use of savings mobilized by these insurance companies for develop-
ment financing.
22.       A number of new financial institutions have been created to
assist small industries and public sector enterprises. The functions
previously performed by West Pakistan Small Industries Corporation
(WPSIC) have been entrusted to the Provincial Governments which have
recently established separate financial institutions to provide indus-
trial and financial assistance to cottage and small-scale industries.
The Equity Participation Fund (EPF), owned by the Government and
administered by IDBP, provides equity capital to medium and small
enterprises, with particular attention to newcomers and entrepreneurs
from backward areas. Finally, to finance public sector enterprise,
whose role in heavy industries is likely to grow, the Government has
established the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC).

P12 71 - TH-3" POJ3G1
23.       The Bank Group has made nine lines of credit available for the
financing of industrial investment in Pakistan for a total of $20 million,
eight Bank loans to PICIC totalling $184 million and one IDA Credit to IDBP
for $20 million. The present project was appraised in August 1973, and the
Appraisal Report (No. 273a-PAK) is being distributed to Executive Directors
separately.  Negotiations were held in Washington in late November, 1973.
PICIC was represented by NIr. Osman Alit Managing Director (and a former
Executive Director of the Bank Group) and the Government of Pakistan was
represented by Ylr. Abdul YNajid M.fti, Economic Minister, anbassy of Pakistan.
A loan and project summary is attached as Annex III.
2b.       PICIC was es.ablished in 1957 to assist private industrial enter-
prises mainly by providing medium- and long-term finance. Since the
nationalization of the life insurance companies, in 1972, the Government
controls some 38 percent of °ICIC's paid in share capital of Rs. 60 million,
foreign commercial banks 32.7 percent, IFC 3.3 percent and private Pakistan
shareholders the balance of 26 percent.
25.       PTCIC operates, as it was intended to, primarily in the medium-
and large-scale manufacturing sector, leaving the smaller projects, by
arrangement, to the Incdustrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and
other financial institutions operating at the provincial level. PICIC's
past financing accounted for 17 percent of total private investment in
medium- and large-scale industry in Pakistan. Including operations in the
former East Pakistan, PICIC's cumulative approvals since its inception
totalled Ps. 5.3 billion for loans to 839 pr^ojects and equity investments
in 155 companies.  PICIC financed projects are astimated to have generated
147,500 additional jobs. Enterprises assisted by PICIC are estimated to
contribute about $250 million annually to the country's export earnings.
PICIC's financing has gone to a large number of clients, of which many were
newcomers to industry.   PICIC has made contributions in promoting new indus-
tries and enterprises, notably through its industrial sector studies.
However, there is scope for PICIC to be more active in its promotional work.
?JC0C is considering steps to intensify its efforts in identifying and
promoting new projects.
26.       PICIC's portfolio is highly concentrated in a few traditional
sectors, particularly textiles and sugar projects. PICIC's management
realizes the desirability of a wider industrial diversification, and intends
to emphasize lending to new sectors, such as the deep-sea fishing industry.
27.       PICIC's policy statement of September 1967 restricts it to providing
assistance to enterprises in the private sector.   However, 19 of the private
companies, the management of which was recently taken over by the Government,
are clients of PICIC. PICIC's policy will continue to be to provide assist-
ance mainly for enterprises managed as well as owned by the private sector,
but it expects to continue financing projects for the modernization and
expansion of these 19 clients. For that reason, PICIC is considering an



- 9 -
amendment to its policy statement. Furthermore, the proceeds of the loan now
Droposed would not be restricted to use by enterprises in the private sector;
in this respect, the proposed loan differs from previous Bank loans to PICIC.
28.       PICIC remains an efficient institution.  The new MIanaging Director,
Mr. Osman Ali, is well supported by an experienced staff. The standards of
its internal operations are high, its project appraisal and follow-up work
satisfactory, but there is room for improvement in its economic assessment
of proJects. At the suggestion of the Bank's staff, PICIC is introducing,
on a selective basis, the calculation of economic rates of return as a
step for improving its ec,onomic work. PICIC's staff is competent, but needs
to be expanded in anticipation of an increased volume of business and to
strengthen its Appraisal, End-use and Economic Departments. PICIC has agreed
to recruit additional staff.
29.       PICIC's financial position remains uncertain since it retains
the liabilities, which still have to be serviced, pertaining to its projects
located in what is now Bangladesh, while it does not receive any income
fron the corresponding assets. These assets, consisting of foreign currency
loans, rupee loans and equity investments, amounted to $80 million equivalent
or about 30 percent of PICIC's total assets and three times its share capital
and rese:7ves. Clearly, it is not within the power of PICIC itself to remove
the uncertainty regarding its future debt servicing capacity and its
creditworthiness.  PICIC's financial problem, given both its nature and
its magnitude, could be resolved only with the Government's help and in the
context of Government policies in general. The Government has provided
financial assistance to PICIC and has undertaken, among other things, to
service on behalf of PICIC its foreign liabilities (amounting to about $70
million) pertaining to projects in Bangladesh for the time being. This
uandertaking offers a temporary solution but does not ensure PICIC's long-
term creditworthiness. It is expected that the Government will eventually
provide a solution which will ensure PICIC's long-term financial viability,
in view of the importance it attaches to PICIC as a development institution.
In the meantime, from a financial point of view, PICIC cannot be considered
a creditworthy institution.
30.       Apart from this problem of the foreign liabilities relating to
proJects in Bangladesh, PICIC's financial position and profitability remains
satisfactory. PICIC's accumulated reserves enable it to absorb the loss of
its rupee investments in Bangladesh amounting to Rs. 84 million. The Govern-
ment has given a general commitment to help PICIC observe the debt/equity
limit of 7:1 agreed under the previous Bank loan agreement, by providing
additional Government subordinated loans or through other forms of financial
assistance. In keeping with this, the Government has agreed to give PICIC
an additional subordinated loan of Rs. 15 million. PICIC has agreed to
increase its paid in share capital by Rs. 10 million.
31.       PICIC's uncommitted rupee resources as of July 1, 1973, together
with new borrowings, new share capital and prospective collections and
retained earnings, should enable it to undertake the rupee commitments it
has projected. For projected foreign exchange commitments, PICIC could use



- 130 -
additional foreign exchanga resources of $65 mi`lion in the two-year period
from January 1, 1974.   .t hoiDes to raise about $11 million equivalant from
Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW). This fLeaves a shortfall of $54 mil-
lion. The proposed Bank loan of $25 million could be used to meet about
one-half of this, with the balarce expected to be obtained from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and bilateral sources.
32.       An additional Bark loan for PICIC is Justified on the groundis of
its continuing operational capability and the need to finarce imported
equi.pment for industry.  However, in view of PrCTC 's lack of creditworthiness
at this time, it would not be appropriate to rake a loan to PICIC.    Instead,
it is recommended that the proposed loan be made to the Governmant, with PICIC
admirn ctering the proceeds under arrangements acceptable to the Government,
PICIC and the Bank.  Thins administered loan is ar exceptional arrangement to
enable the Bank to resume financing industry in Pakistan through PICIC with-
out waiting for a definitive solution of the problem of PICIC's assets in
Bangladesh. Once this problerm has been satiasfactorily resolved, further
Bank lending to PICIC shou'ld again follow the usual pattern of Bank loans
to development finance companies.
33.       The proceeds of the Bank loan to the Government would constitute
a separate fund to be administered by PICIC without ar' financial liability
on its part.  PICTC would have full freedom to take investment decisions in
accordance with its usual criteria, and would receive a management fee of
1.75 percent per annum on the amount of sub-loans disbursed and outstanding.
As was the case for the previous Bank loan to PICIC (Loan 590-PAK), there
would be a fixed amortization schedule of 20 years, including three and a
half years of grace. The funds would be re-lent to sub-borrowers at an
interest rate of 9½ percent, the same rate that PICIC charges on loans
from its own foreign currency resources, and the foreign exchange risk would
be passed on to the sub-borrowers for the period that the funds are out-
standing with them.    The free limit under Loan 590-P.AK was $4 millicn,
and since PICTC does not make loans for more thanl $4 million, this
meant that no subproject required the Bank's prior approval. It was agreed
d'aring negotiations that it would be desirable for the Bank to review some
subprojects and therefore the free linit was set at 53 m-llion.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRPWE7TTkS AND ATUTHOPITIES
34.       To give effect to the arrangements referred to above, it is
proposed that there should be a Loan Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and the Bank, a Proiect Management Agreement between Pakistan
and PICIC, and a Project Agreement between the Bank and PICIC.
35.       Under these documents, the Loan is made to Pakistan, which alone
remains liable for repayment of principal and payment of interest and other
charges thereon to the Bank.   In terms of Section 3.02 of the draft Loan
Agreement, Pakistan has agreed to establish a separate fund to which the
Droceeds of the loan would be credited and from which all disbursements under
sub-loans and investments -would be made.



- 11 -
30.       Under the Project Management Agreement, Pakistan appoints PICIC
as its agent to manage, operate and administer the separate fund, con-
ferring on PICIC full powers and responsibilities for the purpose. For
its services, PICIC is entitled to a management fee of 1.75 percent of the
outstanding amount of sub-loans.
37.       The Project Agreement provides for the carrying out of the project
by PICIC.
38.       Save as mentioned above, both the Loan Agreement and the Project
Agreement conform to the normal pattern for loans for Development Finance
Company projects.
39.       1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
40.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
Robert S. McNamara
President

C. Projects in Execution2"
Loan No. 266       Indus Basin; US $90.0 Million Loan of September
19, 1960; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
All major project items (except Tarbela Dam) have been completed.
Some minor remedial works have still to be finished and settlement remains
to be made on a number of claims. Further disbursement of this Loan (mainly
for Tarbela Dam), which was interrupted in 1971 by agreement with the
United States in order to disburse first the loan contribution of the United
States to the Indus Basin Development Fund, has now resumed. Work on the
Tarbela Dam project is proceeding on schedule. The original Closing Date of
September 30, 1973, has been extended to December 31, 1975.
Cr, No. 50         Education; US $8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 196a;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project suffered serious delays from the start. Among the
reasons for delays were unsatisfactory consultants, disorganization of one
of the main contractors, shortages of building materials, lack of local funds,
cumbersome procurement methods for instructional equipment, and the 1971 war.
Implementation is now proceeding normally with over 90 percent of total planned
construction contracts awarded, of which about 75 percent are completed.
Equipment procurement for the agricultural university represents about 78 percent
of the total revised allocation and 90 percent of the total allocated for the
technical institutes. The training of technical teachers as envisaged by the
Credit has been satisfactorily completed. The project is now expected to be
completed before the new Closing Date of June 30, 1975. The original Closing
Date of December 31, 1968, was extended first to December 31, 1970, then to
December 31, 1972, and most recently to June 30, 1975.
Loan No. 376       Karachi Port; US $17.0 Million Loan of May 14, 1964:
Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The execution of this project has been delayed substantially. The
total cost of the project has increased from the original estimate of US $37.5
million to US $47.0 million but there has been no change in the foreign
exchange component of US $17.0 million. This increase has not materially
affected theeconomic justification of the project. The project was first
delayed by difficulties with the original design of the wharves. In 1967
work had to be suspended and the wharves redesigned. Later, it was found that
more extensive soil investigation was necessary, which meant further delay.
The war in 1971 and labor troubles also contributed to the delay. The difficulties
now appear to have been brought under control and the works are now approaching
completion. The dredging operations, although more than 90 percent complete,
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

are still behind schedule but are now being expedited. The original Closirg
Date of March 31, 1969, was e xtended first to June 30, 1972, and then to
June 30, 1974, the current date,
Loan No. 548       Tarbela Dan; US $25.0 Million Loan of July 10
1960; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and no disbursements
are expected until FY 1976e Good progress is being maintained on the project.
On September 29, 1973 the Indus River was diverted through tunnels on schedule
to enable the final stage -- the construction of the closure section of the
dam -- to be undertaken. The main civil works contractors have submitted
substan`Uial claims on account of labor costs, inflation and the 1972 devaluation
of the 1hipee which are being considered by a special Government committee.
Cr. No. 145        Telecommunications; US $16.0 Million Credit of
March 6, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 19714
Cr. No. 186        Telecommunications; US $15.0 Million Credit of
May 22, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
There have been delays in implementing both these credits.   The
original proposals allowed for the expenditure under the two credits of
about US $11.3 million in the former East Wing and US $19.7 million in the
West. US $5.2 million of the undisbursed balance of Credit 145-PAK was
cancelled in November 1972 after a telecommunications project to Bangladesh
was approved. The Closing Date of 145-PAK -was extended from the original
date of December 31, 1972 to December 31, 1974. This will allow GOP more time
for the reorganization of the Pakistan Telephone and Telegraph Department, the
introduction of an effective accounting systemj and the completion of the
installation of equipment under the Credits,
Loan No, 590       Development Finance Company - PICIC; US $40.0
Million Loan of March 215 lgT; CTosing Date:
September 30, 1975
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date of
March 31, 1974 has been extended to September 30, 1975 to enable disbursements
to be made for the last sub-project.
Loan No. 621       Railways; US $14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on (a) the renewal and improvement of track and bridges,
and (b) rehabilitation and improvement of workshops and depots has been
satisfactory. However, the proposal for the expansion of the marshalling
yard at Samasata has been dropped and the first phase of a new marshalling
yard at Pipri has been included instead. The change was based on a feasibility
study conducted by consultants (SOFRERAIL, France), who indicated that a new
yard at Pipri would be economically and operationally preferable. The original
Closing Date of December 31, 1972, has been extended by three years to December
31, 1975, to al'low time for Pipri yard to be built and the balance of the loan has
been reallocated. PWR has also reappointed the consultants for a period of
18 months.

Cr, No. 157        Agricultural Development Bank; US $30.0 Million
Credit of June 26, 1969; Closing Date: June 30,
1974
Disbursements under this Credit are very much behind the original
schedule. Delays in issuing import licenses and slowness in lending for
tubewells because of difficulties in providing electrical connections were
mainly responisible for this delay. The original Closing Date of June 30,
1972, has been extended to June 30, 1974.
Cr0 No, 177        Development Finance Company - IDBP; US $20.0
Million Credit of February 11, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1974
The loss of the former East Pakistan had far-reaching repercussions
on IDBP's financial position and effectiveness in allocating resources. Pendinlg
an assessment of the situation, IDA discontinued approvals of subprojects under
the Credit in April 1972. A mission -hich visited Pakistan in October/November
1972 found that IDBP's effectiveness had been restored, but that the loss of its
East Pakistan assets seriously jeopardizes its financial position. A Memorandum
from the President containing a proposal which would enable the balance of this
Credit to be made available for industrial investment is to be distributed to
the Executive Directors very shortly.
Cr. No. S-9        Port Engineering; US $1.0 Million Credit of
June 10, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The major portion of the consulting and engineering studies is
completed. The remaining detailed design works will be completed by the present
Closing Date. The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972, has been extended
to December 31, 1973,
Loan No. 696       Gas Transmission; US $19.2 Million Loan of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1973
The 1971 war has delayed execution of this project and also caused
a small inc-.ease in its cost (less than 3%).  The project was substantially
completed in    *July 1973, but to enable disbursements to be made for retention
payments and some equipment procurement the original Closing Date of June 30,
1973, has been extended to December 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 206        Engineering Education; US $4.O Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Construction cost of the N.E.D. Government Engineering College,
based on bids recently received, indicates a cost increase in Rupees of approx-
imately 90 percent compared with the original estimates. Results of negotiations
to reduce costs are awaited. The probable completion date is now January 1975,
one year behind the schedule estimated during appraisal; equipment procurement
may not be completed in phase with the completion of the physical facilities,
due to cumbersome methods and regulations for procurement. An acceleration of
the technical assistance element of the project will be necessary to ensure
completion within the Closing Date.

Cr. No. 213        Power Transmission and Distribution; US $23.0
Million Credit of AugustI 14, 1970; Closing
Date:  December 31, 1975
Owing to political, economic and organizational factors (major
personnel changes in WAPDA in early 1972), the project has been delayed by
about six to nine months. In September 1972, a new Chairman and new members of
the Authority were appointed and progress with the project has resumed. Most
of the contracts for major equipment have been awarded and the remainder will
be awarded soon. Deliveries and construction will start very shortly. The
original Closing Date of December 31, 1974, has been extended to December 31,
1975.
Cr. No. 398.       Industrial Import II; US $45.0 Million Credit
of June 15, 1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1974
Disbursements will be completed by the present Closing Date of
September 30, 1974.
Cr. No. 422        Third Karachi Port; US $18.0 Million Credit of
July 19, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Credit is not yet effective. Deadline of effectiveness was first
extended by one month to November 19, 1973 and subsequently by arnother month
to December 19, 1973.
