skilled worker training.  The project will establish\n            three polytechnic institutes near industrial areas.  The\n            institutes will provide about 13,000 additional training\n            places.  The project will also promote a more decentralized,\n            demand-driven polytechnic system through the implementation\n            of reforms in policies and organizational structures.\n            Associated with these reforms the project will increase the\n            efficiency of the polytechnic system.  To provide the\n            required personnel to staff the institutes, the project will\n            train about 1000 new teachers and instructors and 36\n            administrators.  At the national level, the project will\n            provide technical assistance to improve the project\n            implementation and management capacity of the development\n            and supply division and the Technical and Vocational\n            Education Division.  The project will also provide technical\n            assistance to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of\n            Human Resources to implement the Human Resources Development\n            Fund and the National Vocational Training Council to conduct\n            national planning and labor related research."}, "docdt": "1993-02-19T00:00:00Z"}
