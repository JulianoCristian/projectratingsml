loom :                    Repayable in 17 years including 5 years of grace
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Project Deacrintion:      The Project would assist the Government to continue
its long-term investment program in technician and
skilled worker trainlng started under the first
Industrial Training Project (Loan 2145-Ma) and
continued in the Second Industrial Training Project
(Loan 2601-MA). The Project would establish three
polytechnic institutes near industrial areas. The
institutes would provide about 13,000 additional
training places. The Project would also promote a
more decentralized, demand-driven polytechnic system
through the implementation of reforms in policies
and organizational structures. Associated with
these reforms the Project would increase the
efficiency of the polytechnic system. To provide
the required personnel to staff the institutes, the
Project would train about 1000 now teachers and
instructors and 36 administrators. At the national
level, the Project would provide technical
assistance to improve the project implementation and
management capacity of the Development and Supply
Division (DSD/MOE) and the Technical and Vocational
Education Division (TAVED/MOE). The Project would
also provide technical assistance to strengthen the
capacLty of the Ministry of Human Resources (MOHR)
to implement the Human Resources Development Fund
and the National Vocational Training Council (NVTC)
to conduct national planning and labor related
research.
Beguegsta:                The major Project benefit would be the increased
annual availability of trained higher-level skilled
workers and tochnicians to support Malaysia's
development goals. The Project would also improve
the internal efficiency of the existing polytechnics
though improvemonts in national and local level
management, staffing, curricula, reductions in unit
costs, better capacity utilization and quality -
improvements in service delivery. External
efficiency of the system would be improved through
the establishment of better linkages with employers,
decentralization of TAVED's administrative
authority, introduction of a wider scope of course
offerings, improvement of course relevance, and

capaclty expansion in areas of employer demand. The
beneflts of more relevant and better targeted
training should strongly support the national
program for development (Sixth Five-Year Plan). New
skills offered by the institutes would also support
the introduction of new technologies and enhance the
capacity of the Government to be more responsive to
the needs of industry.
RiLsks:                   The primary Project risk is the presently inadequate
expertise and institutional capacity to train the
quantity of teachers and administrators required to
staff the Project institutions. To address this
issue, the Project would establish a Center for
Staff Development to recruit and train teachers and
administrators. To enhance the limited expertise
available, a staff development consultant would be
contracted to provide the majority of teacher
educators required.

NAL&Y8I
POLYTEEHNIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INRUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER CONSTRAINTS
A. Economic Policy and Industrial Development
1.1       Over the past decade, Malaysia has experienced one of the most
dynamic growth rates in Asia. More recently, the economy has steadily accel-
erated from 2.5 per cent growth in GNP (1986) to 8.9 per cent (1991).
Associated with this growth, the country has also experienced a rapid increase
in foreign investment.
1.2       Although the overall national growth rates have been impressive, it
is expected that some of the strongest inputs to this growth will not be
sustainable. In particular, two long-term trends are seen as having run their
course. First, Government sector expansion can no longer play a leading role
as it did in the 1970s. Second, natural resource exploitation is unlikely to
remain a strong impetus to economic growth. Many of Malaysia's natural
resources are declining rapidly. There is an emerging need to improve the
management of these resources and the expected result will be a decrease in
their exportation.
1.3       Government has recognized that the future direction of the economy
should be shaped by liberalization of policies to promote industrial develop-
ment, with controls to promote a balanced distribution of growth. The
development goals are set forth in *Vision 2020", a policy document presented
in February, 1991. This vision shows a commitment to continued deregulation
and to the development of a competitive, mature, and balanced economy with a
diversified and widely based industrial sector, a modern agriculture sector,
and an efficient and productive services sector. It emphasizes raising levels
of technology and value-added industrial development. It indicates a reliance
on the private sector as the primary engine of economic growth, with an
entrepreneurial economy that is self-reliant, and outward-looking. Growth
will be export-led, and foreign investment will be promoted. There is also a
high commitment to human resource development.
1.4       The rapid economic development of the country has brought an
increasing demand for well-trained workers, technicians, and engineers in all
fields. Fueled by private sector expansion, jobs are being restructured to
accommodate new technologies, and there are growing demands for employees with
higher level skills. This has become particularly critical in the
manufacturing sector, where expansion is continuing and employment has grown
steadily over the past decade.
B. Growth and Development Trends in Manufacturing
1.5       The strengthening of the manufacturing sector is considered the key
in the Government's economic development policy. Much of the growth in
activities of other sectors depends ultimately on investments in this sector.
As in other sectors, the Government has become increasingly active in the
liberalization of regulations relating to manufacturing. The result has been
an increase in the level of investments, both foreign and domestic, and a
surge of private sector development. Even with these developments, however,



-2-
the manufacturing base remains narrow, dominated by two large subsectors: (a)
electrical and electronics, and (b) textiles. Since 1988, these subsectors
together have produced more than 60 per cent of the sector's exports. In
addition, the sector remains focused, for the most part, on low value-added
products. This is particularly significant in subsectors that manufacture
electronic components, textiles, and chemicals. The level of automation is
rapidly rising, but is still low by international comparison. From an export
point of view, the value of the Malaysian Ringgit has also been too low, but
it is expected to rise in coming years. Recent reports also indicate that the
sector is beginning to experience rising costs in manufacturing, including
costs of labor.  Parts of these increases stem from acute shortages of labor,
particularly highly skilled workers and technicians that are key to the
introduction of new technologies and automated manufacturing systems.
1.6       During the past 30 years following independence, the manufacturing
sector has grown gradually from 9 per cent of GDP to over 27 per cent. It now
employs about 1.1 million people, accounting for over 16 per cent of the
nation's total employment. During the 1960s, the sector had a growth rate of
10 per cent per year. During those years, manufacturing was aimed primarily
at inport substitution. During the Second Malaysia Plan period (1971-75), the
sector grew at an annual rate of about 11 per cent. The growth continued to
accelerate during the Third Malaysia Plan period (1976-80). By the end of
that period, it reached a rate of over 13 per cent. During this period, the
sector shifted its focus from import-substitution to resource-based processing
and labor-intensive industries. It also began to move from donestic
consumption toward export markets. During the Fourth Nalaysia Plan period
(1981-85), its growth declined to about 5 per cent. This was due in part to
the recession of 1985/1986. As seen in Table 1.1 below, the manufacturing
sector, unlike other sectors, experienced unbroken growth during the Fifth
Plan period (1986-90) with an annual average rate of about 13.6 per cent. In
terms of contribution to both GDP and employment, the manufacturing sector
grew at a rate about twice that of the economy as a whole. In 1987, for the
first time, the contribution of the manufacturing sector to the real GDP
surpassed that of the agriculture sector. Since 1989, the manufacturing
sector has produced more than half of the nation's total exports.
C. Demand fior Skilled Man=ower
1.7       Growth of the manufacturing sector in the 1970s was based to a
large extent (about 40X) on efficiency gains. In the 1980s, efficiency
increases contributed much less, with a larger contribution being made by the
sector's growth in the use of resources. In the 1990s, it is estimated that
natural resources .re likely to play a declining role in the real economic
growth of the sector, and sustained growth must come from increases in
efficiency, as was true in the 1970s. These gains would be achieved through
technological upgrading, downstream linkages in some industries (eg. steel,
electronics, textiles, and natural resource based industries), and through
better articulation with the service sector (e.g., design and software).
1.8         It has been estimated that the present national employment of
higher-level skilled workers and technicians, in the manufacturing sector, is
about 300,000. At present there is a need for about 7000 additional workers
to fill unmet needs. Assuming a sector growth rate of 11.5X over the next



-3-
five-year plan period&/ and labor elasticity of about 50X (Table 1.1), the
total employment of skilled workers and technicians in the manufacturing
sector should steadily grow to about 400,000 by the and of the Sixth Five Year
Plan period. If this trend continues, as it is expected to, there would be an
average demand for at least 20,000 new higher-level skilled workers and
technicians each year through the next decade. Assuming limited attrition
during training, it is expected that there will be a requirement to expand
national training capacity by at least 2002 over the next decade. This
estimate remains conservative awrd assumes that employers would -sin to take
on increasing responsibilities for training such workers and    .icians as
pressures build to import higher levels of technologies and ausmation.
Additional demand for highly skilled workers and techniciants would also come
from other sectors, as they begin directly and indirectly to benefit from the
growth of the manufacturing sector.

the field of training) are exceptionally high in almost all training
institutions (ranging from about 75X to 931). In the polytechnies, where the
bulk of such persons are trained, it is also typical to have a waiting list of
15,000 to 20,000 applicants for a few thousand openings each year.
Furthermore, in the quality institutions, it is not unusual for students to
receive several offers for employment a year or more before graduation.
1.10      Employer's associations have openly expressed their concerns about
the lack of skilled workers in the country. In doing so, they have stated
that they believe that future capital investment in their respective sectors
may be held back by the country's lack of capacity to train highly skilled
workers and technicians. This of course would thwart the development of the
sector. To support their argument, employers point to firms that f lad it
necessary to employ low- to medium-skilled workers from neighboring countries
because trained workers are not available. In 1990, it was estimated that
100,000 to 200,000 low- to medium-skilled workers from Indonesia and other
neighboring countries were employed, mostly in agriculture and construction.
The press and various other public organizations are also becomlng Lncreas-
ingly vocal in their expressions of concern over the growing shortages of
skilled manpower.
D. SUDD1Y of Skilled Workers and Technicians
1.11      In Malaysia, VTE is a centralized, nationally administered program
of formal secondary and post-secondary systems. Policy direction is provided
by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) and the National Vocational Training
Council (NVTC). The latter is responsible for formulating, promoting, and
coordinating vocational and industrial training strategy and programs in
keeping with Malaysia's technological and economic development needs. The
Council is also responsible for planning, development, and evaluation of
vocational training activities.
1.12      Low to Medium Skilled Workers.  The primary producers of low and
medium skilled workers are the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of
Human Resources (MOHR). The MOE currently operates 57 secondary vocational
schools and nine technical schools with enrollments of about 21,000 and 5,000,
respectively.
1.13      The MOHR operates seven industrial training institutes (ITIs) with
a total enrollment capacity of about 6,000 full-time students. The ITIs
typically operats shurt-term programs of instruction.  Other ministries also
offer some entry- to medium-level skill training. The most notable is the
Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA), which has nine schools (IKMs) to train Bumi-
putras. The Ministry of Youth and Sport (MOYS) operates seven Youth Training
Institutes which provide informal training for out-of-school youth, with a
total output of about 1,000 trainees annually. There are fewer than 40
private and independent organizations offering low to medium-level skill
training!/. Most are quite small and are targeted to specific population
groups.   Proprietary service providers that offer low- to medium-level skill
training are typically influential in the training of persons in business
skills and in the service industries.

1.14      Highlv Skilled Vorkers and Technicians.  The Ministry of Education
operates seven polytechnics that are the primary producers of technicians and
higher-level skilled workers. The system currently has an output of about
3000 graduates each year (1992). Bank participation in this sector began in
1982 with the establishment of two polytechnics under Loan 2145-HA. Sub-
sequent investments under Loan 2601-MA established three additional poly-
technics, which are only recently completed and have not yet reached full
enrollment. The system has a design capacity of about 11,000. At full
operation in 1993 (estimated at 80X of facility capacity), the system should
have a total annual output cf at least 4000-3/. Highly skilled workers and
technicians are typically trained in either two-year (certificate level) or
three-year (diploma level) programs depending upon the skills roquired.
1.15      Other producers of higher-level skilled workers and technicians
include: (a) universities with 1,129 technical diploma graduates in 1989;
(b) MARA Institute of Technology (ITM) with 89 certificate and 1,871 diploma
graduates in 1989: and (c) Tunku Abdul Rahman College (KTAR) with 250
certificate and 377 diploma graduates in 1989. During that year, a small
number of private independent institutions provided technical training and
education with an output of about 1,468 certificate and 965 diploma graduates.
1.16      Although these output figures suggest that there is a formal
training capacity to produce about 9000 graduates each year, several factors
make it difficult to accurately estimate the number of these graduates who
would be available for employment. These factors require an understanding
that: (a)  actual dnc'aented employment rates of polytechnic graduates average
about 75X_/; (b) universities are not expected to continue training technical
diploma graduates past year 2000; (c) polytechnics are significantly
increasing their enrollment of students seeking diplomas (at least 30X of
enrollments by 1997); (d) the potential output of Batu Pahat Polytechnic must
be discounted over the next decade as it will remain off line to serve as a
staff training center for the proposed project and an in-service training
facility for existing polytechnic staff; and (e) it is planned that a
significant number of certificate and diploma graduates (1000 to 1500) would
be further trained as polytechnic instructors and teachers over the next
decade. Such training and employment would remove them from the employment
market as higher-level skilled workers and technicians.
1.17      With these factors considered, it i- estimated that in 1992, the
national output, available for emIloyment, from these formal institutions
would not exceed about 6500 graduates. This estimate points to the need to
triple the national training capacity for higher-level skilled workers and
technicians by year 2000 (see para. 1.8). After the proposed project's full
implementation (1998 or 1999), the three new polytechnics should add at least
3000 employable graduates per year for a total national output per year of
about 9500 graduates. Increased efficiencies and new development of the other
producers should also add to the national output over time. Following the
financing of the proposed project, the Government plans to initiate a second
1/  One polytechnic will be kept temporarily off-line to provide the
facilities to train about 1000 new teachers required to staff the three
proposed new institutions.

Graduates".



-6-
phase investment program to establish two or three additional polytechnics.
At full implementation, these institutions should bring the output capacity to
about 13000 graduates each year. With the expected increases in training
capacity and the upgrading of instructional programs from medium-to higher-
levels in other delivery systems (i.e., KARA, higher education, and industry-
based training) the total supply capacity should be in line with estimated
employer demand by year 2000 or within a few years thereafter.
II.  TRAINING OF HIGEU-IZL SgILLED WORUR  AND TECHNICIAS
A. Intdiuaction
2.1       As indicated above, the primary providers of training services for
higher-level skilled workers, technicians and middle-level supervisors are the
polytechnics (MOE), university-based diploma programs, ITMs (MARA), and a
number of private institutions (e.g. Workers' Institute of Technology, Federal
Institute of Technology, and Tunku Abdul Rahman College). Although all these
forms of education and training contribute to the manpower development, the
polytechnics have the greatest potential for expansion of higher-level
technical training services capacity through the next decade.
2.2       Universities place high priority on academic development, and there
is limited capacity for lower-priority university-based diploma programs.
This order of priorities -- quite normal for universities -- makes it
difficult to plan for consistent, long-term capacity expansion of diploma-
based programs. The ITMs (MARA) are administered by MOE as a targeted
training program for Bumiputras.
2.3       Private and independent training institutions currently offer
training in a wide range of technical fields, commerce, computers and computer
applications, tourism, and food services. Only a few of the larger, better
financed institutions offer any significant training opportunities for higher-
level skilled workers and technicians in manufacturing and related industries.
2.4       A recent study_ has suggested that there is a downward trend in
the output of private and independent training institutions. In 1984, 4,495
students graduated from private and independent VTE institutions (primarily
low- to medium-level training), while, in 1987 and 1989, only 3,600 and 2,433
graduated, respectively. Part of the problem is seen as the inability of
private and independent institutions to compete on the open market with
modern, heavily subsidized public training institutions. At present, many of
the private and independent institutions attempt to offer similar programs as
the public institutions. Many are failing to recruit a sufficient number of
students in their program and are suffering financially. With only a few
exceptions, it has become increasingly evident that the future growth of
private and independent training institutions will depend largely upon their
ability to: (a) change their focus from time-based (two- and three-year)
programs to shorter duration, flexible programs offering specific and
intensive training required by employers; (b) improve instructional quality
~/   See Working Paper Number 23, "The Role of Proprietary Institutions in
Provision of Certificate and Diploma-Level Technical Training and
Education .



-7-
and the uniqueness of their course offerings; and (c) improve their
relationships with employers. If successful, there is reason to believe that
future relationships between the private and public training institutions
should be mutually supportive with their services being somewhat exclusive to
each other.
B. Ixenditure on Higher-Level Skill Tralning
2.5       Financing.  The subsector is financed from a variety of sources,
both private and public. In the public sector, most of the ministries finance
some training in specialized areas. The large majority of the higher-level
skill and technician training is financed through the Ministry of Education.
Government operated institutions such as polytechnics, ITMs (MARA) and higher
education institutions are financed from 80% to 90% from a state subsidy
derived from general revenues. From 15X to 25% of the training costs are
financed from tuition and other types of school fees. At present, a small
contribution, less than 2X, is derived from corporate inputs.
2.6       Private and independently operated institutions!/ are primarily
financed from student fees, for longer term courses, and employers, for short-
term and industry-based courses. The student fees and charges to employers
are market driven and vary considerably in cost/. It should be noted that
many students, who attend private and independent institutions, receive
various types of Government grants or scholarships.
2.7       Direct and Indirect_Onerational Expenditures.  It is estimated that
about US$22.5 million would be required to finance the total direct
operational costs for the training of the 1991 graduates from higher-level
skill and technician training programs in the country. The 1991 cohort
comprised about 4500 certificate graduates and about 4500 diploma graduates.
The estimate of costs include salaries, maintenance, materials, supplies, etc.
It is based upon an estimated national average cost of about US$1000 for each
higher-level technical student, per year.
2.8       Total indirect operational costs (non-institutional) for meals,
transportation, housing, clothes, etc., amount to about US$17.2 million. This
is based upon an estimated national average cost of about US$765 per student,
per year. The total direct and indirect operational costs to produce a
certificate graduate is about US$3528. It would cost about US$5293 to produce
a diploma graduate. These estimates exclude capital investment.
2.9       Cost Recovery.  Using the estimates above and assuming that the
recovery rates for capital, direct and indirect operational costs are, for
polytechnics 55%, ITMs 501, universities 38%, KTAR and private/independent
W   Of the 37 VTE institutions represented in the National Association of
Private and Independent Educational Institutions (NAPIEI), only a few
offer higher-level skill training.
2/ The NAPIEI estimates that the tuition and materials fees of its relevant
members range from M$60 to M$100 for certificate courses, and from M$140
to M$160 for diploma courses. Fees for foreign components of the
training are much higher and vary greatly depending upon the
organization offering the training and the demand for the training.



-8-
institutions 100l, then the total cost recovery per year for the cohort of
9000 graduates would be about US$8.7 million in combined direct and indirect
operational costs and capital costs. These costs are recovered from students,
families and employers through fees and direct expenditure requirementsV/.
2.10      Using the above assumptions, the cost recovery would be US$1933 for
each two-year (certificate) graduate and US$2900 for each three-year (diploma)
graduate. The total unrecovered direct and indirect costs amount to about
US$21.8 million for the cohort. These costs would be subsidized by the
Government over a two- or three-year period.
2.11      Cagital Costs.  It is estimated that capital costs per student per
year, amortized over the expected life-time of the institution (50 years) and
installed equipment (20 years), would range between US$200 and US$350, depend-
ing upon the original cost for facilities, levels of technology being taught,
the quality of building and equipment maintenance, and many other factors.
C. The Polytechnic System
2.12      Seven polytechnics have been established since 1969 by the Ministry
of Education as institutions for technical and business training:/. Their
main objective is to train higher-level skilled workers, technicians and
middle-level supervisors. Depending upon the technical specialty, the
institutions offer two- and three-year post-secondary programs leading to the
award of certificates (two years) and diplomas (three years). Between six and
twelve months (depending on the program) is spent in an industry-based
attachment to gain work experience before graduation. As previously
mentioned, the Bank has partially financed the establishment of five of the
institutions.
2.13      Costs.  In 1990, the recurrent budget for the polytechnics was
M$22.7 million (US$9.1 million).  The polytechnic budget represents less than
1% of the recurrent allocation of the Ministry of Education. (see para. 4.8
for a more detailed discussion of recurrent cost implications.)
2.14      The per student, direct operational cost (unit cost) of the sub-
sector averages between US$700 to US$1000 per enrolled student, per year. The
cost for the polytechnics averages about US$800 per student per year. These
costs are considered low-to-moderate by international comparison. Although
staffing costs should rise in the future, as part-time and evening students
become more heavily enrolled, the costs should be reduced even further.
Capital investments are difficult to calculate on a per student basis as the
costs vary considerably from institution to institution and from system to
system. However, it has been estimated that initial capital investments for
new construction and equipment range from US$14,000 to US$17,000 per full-time
student place established. Estimates for the proposed institutions planned
during the Sixth Plan period are about US$11,500 per student place. This is
about 30X lower than the per student investments made in previous poly-

Studies: Fees and Other Costs, Scholarships, Loans, and Bonding", 1991.

-9-
technics. The reduced costs would come from increased efficiencies in the
design, scale and operation of the institutions.
2.15      Polytechnic students currently pay about M$680 (US$260) in fees and
non-institutional costs ranging from M$1300 to M$2600 (US$500 to US$1000) each
year. The fees paid are about one half of those required for similar
enrollments in universities.
D. Problems and Issues In the Polytechnic System
2.16      Staff Recruitment and Develoment.  The existing polytechnic system
is authorized to employ 978 teachers and instructors. Currently there are 657
teachers and instructors employed in the system. In terms of degree teachers,
the system is presently understaffed by about 20X. Some portion of this is
due to three of the new institutions not yet being fully operational, and full
staffing not yet being required. In total, however, there is a substantial
shortfall and a need to focus more subsector investments on staff development.
The sub-issues surrounding this problem are complex.
2.17      The existing capacity of the teacher training system is not
adequate to meet the goal for such a quantity. In addition, existing
personnel policies and procedures do not support the recruitment of trained
teachers from other services and the retention of trained teachers even if
they could be recruited. The wages of technical education teachers are so low
that there are few incentives for skilled craftsmen to seek employment in the
system. Industry employment is more attractive.
2.18      Recent engineering graduates from higher education are typically
not attracted to teaching positions. This is because most graduates are
sponsored or contracted to enter employment very early in their university
careers. This approach has some drawbacks. These new teachers are typically
young and often lack any acceptable level of industrial experience 'to support
their academic preparation.
2.19      System Training Capacity.  The growing demands for higher level
skilled workers and technicians are commonly recognized by the Government and
the Bank. The polytechnic system has significant potential for capacity
expansion to meet these growing demands. Since 1969, the Government has
implemented a program of investments to gradually expand the system as
employer needs are recognized. Both current and forecasted estimates of
training requirements indicate that there is a need to continue to increase
capacity in the polytechnics through the next decade.
2.20      Industrv-Education Linkages.  In 1991, the Government established a
policyL/ that all future skill training would be demand-driven, that is,
based upon the demands of employers, rather than supply-driven, based on labor
supply estimates. This important reform requires significant linkages with
employers.
2.21      Cost Recovery.  At present, much of the cost of training in the
country is borne by the Government from general revenues. There is a need to
IQ/ Recommended by the Cabinet Committee on Skill Training, 1991.



-.0-
seek other financing options which nay provide for a lower unit cost and would
enable more flexibility in the systems being administered. The evidence is
mixed regarding the willingness of Malaysian employers to pay for training,
but international experience has shlown that, in time, employers can be
convinced that quality training is a good Investment. Of course, the key
factor is the ability of the Government-operated institutions to deliver
quality services that meet the needs of Industry at a reasonable cost.
2.22      Internal Efficiency.  Throughout the system, there is a need to:
(a) increase the internal efficiency of the institutions; (b) provide
incentives to quality teachers; (c) improve staffing patterns; (d) improve
the allocation and utilization of supplies and materials; (e) improve
workshop and classroom utilization; and (f) improve student scheduling.
These ineffici_.cies contribute to an increase in the unit costs for training
in the existing institutions.
2.23      Locus of Control.  Due to centralized control and management of the
polytechnic system, the Ministry of Education relies heavily on national-level
manpower forecasting to determine services to be provided at the local level.
Its success in this area has been mixed. The centralized control also reduces
the institutions' flexibility and capacity to meet the ever changing needs of
local employers. This is reflected in a rigidity in the selection of
curricula and program offerings. Such rigidity reduces the potential effect
of locally established industry-education linkages. The overall effect of
this situation is a lowering of the internal and external efficiency of the
polytechnic system.
2.24      Imolementation CaVacity of DSD.  The demands for improved planning,
coordination, documentation and reporting are increasing in the DSD (PIU).
The volume of procurement and civil works managed by this unit is already
significant and it will be growing under the Sixth Five-Year Plan.
Furthermore, the Ministry has in the past had difficulty meeting the Bank's
guidelines for audit compliance. Therefore, DSD has recently been provided
with equipment for the computerization of the project management system under
Loan 2601-MA. In addition, a full-time project architect has been appointed
to the unit (para. 4.16).
2.25      Location of New Institutions.  Some existing skill training
facilities are not satisfactorily located across the country. In particular,
training is not available in some areas where the Government is planning to
promote industrial growth. The location of training services in industrial
regions is necessary to facilitate close relationships with industry and
maintain high graduate employment rates. Inadequate locations would adversely
affect the internal and external efficiency of the involved institutions.
This issue is particularly important as new institutions are being planned for
future projects. The appraisal mission has discussed the issue of the
locations of new institutions with Government. The Bank and Government are in
agreement that future polytechnic expansion would be located in areas of high
industrial growth.
2.26      Rationalization of Curricula to EmAloer Needs.  There is a
recognized need to revise curricula to offer more scope in the respective
institution's offerings and to relate more adequately to the needs of
employers. There is also a need to consider offering non-industrial tech-
nician training programs to support the development of other sectors (e.g.,
home economics, health, and commerce).



-11-
E. Government Strategy and The sank's Role
2.27      Government's Strnte;v.  The Fifth (1985-1990) and Sixth Malaysia
Plans (1991-1995) and the Second Outline Perspective Plan (1991-2000) place
high priority on the promotion of increased private sector investment and
growth. To support this goal, the plans emphasize the need to improve the
efficiency and capacity of technical education. In particular, they point to
the importance of establishing training practices that are market-oriented to
reduce structural unemployment as well as encourage greater labor mobility and
an increased rate of labor absorption by the employing sectors2/.
2.28      During the Fifth Plan period (1985-1990), efforts were made to
improve the quality and capacity of technical education programs and to
increase industry's involvement in training. Private sector participation in
training did exist in various forms, such as representation in NVTC, the
utilization of the Double Deduction Incentive Scheme for training
(construction sector) and the Apprenticeship Scheme; however, overall
participation was considered inadequate. Several studies were undertaken that
pointed to the need to improve linkages with employers and the effectiveness
of technical education at the post-secondary level. The studies identified
specific issues and recommended measures to address them. These
recommendations led to the establishment of the Cabinet Committee on Training
(CCST) in 1990.
2.29      The setting up of the CCST reflected the Government's efforts to
continue to improve the existing system through the provision of better
coordination and analysis of the issues. After some deliberation, the
Committee called for major structural reforms in the existing training systems
as well as for greater private sector participation in the planning and
implementation of all types of skill training!/. These recommendations have
been endorsed by the Government and include: (a)  expansion of the capacity of
vocational and technical education (VTE) in areas where there is employer
demand; (b) establishment of mechanisms for feedback from employers; (c)
provision of greater flexibility in the management of training institutes;
(d) upgrading of procedures to attract and retain teachers and instructors;
(e) increase of collaboration with the private sector; (f) increase of non-
government operation of training institutes; (g) establishment of centers of
excellence within institutions; (h) maintaining of constant review of course
design and curriculum; (i) expansion of the program to accredit skills; (j)
improvement in incentives for student and employer participation in training;
(k) wider dissemination of labor market information; (1) establishment of
specialized training centers (sector-specific) that would require private
sector participation; and (m) establishment of a national technology
information board. The Bank agrees with the proposed reforms, which are far-
reaching and consistent with the policy recommendations put forth in the
recent Bank policy paper on vocational and technical education2/.

-12-
2.30      In response to the recommendation of CCST to increase the national
capacity to train higher-level skilled workers and technicians, the
Government, during the Sixth Plan period, will establish five new polytechnics
and expand the existing ones where possible. It is also planned that the
polytechnics will offer more diploma courses as well as new courses in the
engineering fields (i.e., electronic communications, computer technology and
textile engineering):/.   Using the CCST recommendations as a guide, the MOE
has already partially or fully implemented a number of reforms. These reforms
included: (a) a National Advisory Committee for the Polytechnics has been
established; (b) local advisory committees have been established for most of
the existing polytechnics; (c) staff recruitment and training have been
strengthened; (d) curriculum development has been initiated to establish a
broader range of demand-driven courses; (e) new programs are being planned in
cooperation with the private sector with an increased emphasis on cost
recovery; and (f) evening programs and shorter, part-time programs are being
established in most of the existing polytechnics, thus increasing the facility
utilization factors. The MOE has also reviewed and increased salaries and
benefits of technical education teachers.
2.31      Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Projects in Education Sector.
Since 1969, the Bank has invested US$464.2 million in eleven projects, which
makes it the main source of external finance for education. These operations
have made a substantial contribution to the physical expansion, quality
improvement, and management of the sector. Taken together, they involve
eleven interventions in the vocational and technical education sub-sector
(including agricultural training), five each in secondary education and in
teacher training, four each in learning resources, boarding facilities/staff
housing, and training/specialist services, and two each in primary education,
higher education and educational management. The first four projects (Loan
599-MA, Loan 810-MA, Loan 974-MA, and Loan 1329-MA) display a much broader
subsectoral dispersion than subsequent ones (Loan 1657-MA, Loan 2145-MA, Loan
2601-MA, 2685-MA, 2987-MA and the two on-going projects) which are more
focused around specific clusters of issues. Two projects are still under
implementation: the University Development Project (Loan 2887-MA) and the
Third Primary and Secondary Education Sector Project (Loan 3536-MA). Overall
implementation progress is satisfactory, although somewhat slow with respect
to disbursements under the First Sector Project, and to strategy formulation
under the University Development Project.
2.32      Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs) have been prepared for
the First, Third and Fifth Projects (PPARs No 2520, 6280 and 9709) and Project
Completion Renorts (PCRs) for the Second, Fourth and Sixth (PCRs No 4471, 6499
and 9257). PCRs are under preparation for the First and Second Primary and
Secondary Education Projects (Loans 2685-MA and 2987-MA) and the Second
Industrial Training Project (Loan 2601-MA). The main problems encountered and
lessons learned from these documents, and from on-going supervision work, are
summarized below.
2.33      A number of projects, especially the first four, experienced
administrative bottlenecks, leading to implementation delays (up to 117X for
Loan 974-MA) and cost overruns (19% for the same project). These problems,
which are especially acute in the case of Sabah and Sarawak, were related to:
(a) the acquisition of communal land ruled by tribal laws; (b) the

agency in charge of supervising and controlling for quality the civil works
program; (d) the difficulty experienced by MOE in collecting evidence of
payment for pre-financed expenditures; (e) quantitative and qualitative
staffing and equipment constraints in the Finance and the Development and
Supply (DSD) Divisions which slowed down the processing of accounts; and (f)
the two-tier auditing system (MOE, then Auditor-General's Office), which led
to delays of up to one-year in submitting audits.
2.34      A number of remedial measures are being introduced or reinforced by
the Government to address those issues before the future projects become
effective: (a) advance planning of land acquisition, facilitated by the
availability of adequate funds (introduced under Loan 2987-MA); (b) the
recruitment of private engineering consultants to reinforce the JKR
(introduced under Loan 974-MA); (c) regular DSD trips to Sabah and Sarawak
(Loan 2987-MA) to collect perforated vouchers as evidence of payments; and
(d) the adoption of a form of evidence of payment more expeditious and more
in line with GOM's sophisticated, computerized financial reporting and control
system.
2.35      A somewhat looser but equally important set of lessons relate to
the limited impact of training, specialist services and studies in previous
projects. Under loans 599, 974, 2145, and 2601-MA, specialist services were
not utilized, or were replaced by more training. Similarly, the studies
financed under loan 2685-MA to lay the framework for a revision of the
sectoral strategy did not fulfill their potential as a vehicle for
strengthening national research capabilities and for promoting a broad
dialogue within Government and with the Bank. PCR No. 6499 (Loan 1329-MA)
stresses the importance of closely linking the specialist services and
training to the issues addressed by the Project, and of carefully planning all
stages of the process, from TORs to implementation and impact indicators. The
same recommendations hold true for innovations such as curriculum changes, as
shown by Loans 599, 810 and 1329-MA, and confirmed by research.
2.36      Bank Assistance Strategr.  Across sectors, the Bank assistance
strategy aims at helping Malaysia to define and implement the broad policy and
institutional measures and the investments required to achieve the dual
objectives of growth and equity. This involves economic and sector analyses
focusing on strategic issues, the development of sound sectoral policy
frameworks and investment programs and support to Government's key areas of
emphasis. Human resources development is one of these, as a pre-requisite for
increases in productivity and in private sector investment. In education and
training, the strategy aims at enhancing the ability of the system to respond
to the demand for skilled workers in a competitive, rapidly evolving,
technology-oriented economy, while completing the unfinished equity agenda.
Central to achieving this is the need to determine the most efficient mix,
level and type of public and private sector interventions in the regulation,
financing and delivery of services.
2.37      Rationale for Bank Involvement in the Progosed Project.  The
proposed project would be the third in a sequenced program of Bank investments
to upgrade higher-level skill training. Bank involvement in the proposed
project would support continued institutional development and policy dialogue
on important reforms within the polytechnic system. The Project would also
support the Govtrnment's study of options and implementation strategies that
relate to demand-driven systems for skill training in formal and informal



-14-
settings. ComponentG of the Project would also assist in the establishment of
a Human Resources Development Fund and the strengthening of the research and
planning functions of the NVTC, both under MOHR.
III.  THEl MOJECT
A. Proiect Objectives and Scooe
3.1       In support of the Government's overall strategy to reform the VTE
system with the goal of making it more responsive to the changing needs of the
Malaysian economy, the Project would aim to: (a) promote a more de-
centralized, demand-driven polytechnic system through the implementation of
reforms in policies and organizational structures; (b) expand the annual,
full-time training capacity of the polytechnic system by establishing about
13,000 additional training places in three new locations; (c) increase the
efficiency of the polytechnic system through the provision of a wider scope of
services, increased quality of service delivery, better capacity utilization
and the lowering of unit costs; (d) upgrade the quality and availability of
staff through the recruitment and training of about 1000 new teachers and
instructors and about 36 administrators; (e) upgrade the capacity of the
Technical and Vocational Education Division (TAVED/ MOE); (f) strengthen the
capacity of the Ministry of Human Resources to implement the Human Resources
Development Fund; and (g) strengthen the planning and research capacity of
the National Vocational Training Council. The proposed project would have a
duration of six years.
B. Detailed ProcjLt Descrintion
Capacity Exransion CUSS142.1 million equivalent)'f/
3.2       Three new polytechnics would be established in locations close to
existing industrial regions with high potential for future development. These
institutions would be located at: (a) Shah Alam; (b) Penang; and (c) Johor
Bahru (see map). Each institution would have an enrollment capacity of about
3,500 full-time students. Each institution would also train about 900
students in a variety of industry-based and evening program offerings. The
Project would finance technical assistance to support the design and planning
for each institution. The Project would also prepare the sites (each would be
about 100 acres in size), construct the buildings and provide landscape
services. Equipment and furniture would also be procured as required.
Policy Reform & Institutional Strengthening (USSO.2 million equivalent)
3.3       Through the Project, the Government has assured the Bank that it
would support the implementation of a coordinated program of reforms
throughout the polytechnic system (para. 6.1(a)). These reforms would: (a)
establish the structures to support a training system that is driven by
employer demand; (b) introduce more cost recovery and operational efficiency;
(c) decentralize the control of the polytechnic institutes to the extent
j-/ Component cost estimates in Section B include contingencies.



-15-
feasible; and (d) improve capacity utilization, teacher/student ratios,
scheduling of services and the lowering of unit costs. The following briefly
describes the key policy reform activities of the Project. See ANNEXES 5 and
6 for a more detailed description of the reforms.
3.4       National Level Adfisory Committee.  A ministry-level (national)
technical education advisory committee has been established for the
Polytechnics to secure inputs from employers regarding national-level issues.
This advisory committee includes Government officials, school administrators,
and employers' and labor representatives. At least 50Z of the committee
membership comprises employers and employer association representatives from
the public and private sectors. These employers and associations would
provide a balanced public and private sector perspective to the proposed
goals, objectives and activities of the NOE as they relate to higher-level
skill training.
3.5       Local-Level Advisory Committees.  Each new polytechnic would
establish and maintain local advisory committees to provide employer input
into the planning and operatior of the individual institutions. These
committees would have private and public sector representation from employers
and employers' associations and would be chaired by the principal of the
respective polytechnics. The committees would also provide inputs to
curriculum issues, proposed purchases of equipment and instructional
practices.
3.6       Cost-Recovers in Financing.  The Government would introduce
policies to: (a) allow firms and other private or public training organiza-
tions to use training capacity of the polytechnics on a cost recovery basis;
and (b) allow individual polytechnics, on a cost recovery basis, to contract
with local employers to provide training and other agreed upon services within
and outside the institutions. The Government would also consider the
introduction of student fee increases on a schedule that would bring them in
line with similar college and university fees by the end of the Seventh Five-
Year Plan period.
3.7       Internal Efficiency.  The new polytechnics would be designed to
demonstrate high levels of internal efficiency. There would be a significant
increase in the use of computers and specialized software to: (a) schedule
students; (b) maintain student/personnel records; (c) monitor and control
costs; and (d) facilitate instructional processes. The institutions would
also be designed to support high utilization rates (about 80Z) for most
classrooms, laboratories, and workshops. When compared to similar costs in
previous polytechnics (Loans 2145-HA and 2601-MA), these design changes would
reduce initial, per student investment for civil works and equipment by about
301.
3.8       The Project would also introduce the use of career guidance
counselors and other specialized staff. The use of specialized staffing would
free teachers and instructors from many administrative duties so that they may
concentrate on the important task of teaching and working with students.
Associated with this move to improve the working conditions of teachers, the
faculty employment schemes would be reviewed and improved. The use of career
guidance and counseling for students should also reduce drop-out rates, an
important factor in the improvement of internal efficiency.



-16-
3.9       Decentralization of Admlnistration.  The Government has agreed, in
principle, to decentralize a number of adminlstrative responsibilities to
local polytechnic principals. To initiate this reform, TAVED would authorize
local principals to: (a) modify, within established parameters, existing
curricula to meet local needs of employers; (b) on a cost recovery basis,
initiate contracts (with the prior approval of TAVED) to provide training and
other services for or within local firms; (c) on a cost recovery basis,
establish short-term courses based upon local employers' needs; (d) initiate
the use of ad hoc temporary advisory committees for short-term needs; and
(e) conduct operational research activities relative to local training needs.
3.10      Strengthenint of DSD and TAVED.  The Government has agreed to
insure that the PIU is managed by a senior education specialist supported by a
team of specialists in civil works and procurement"/. The Project would also
provide a full-time architect to strengthen the capacity of DSD (PIU) and
support the implementation of the Project (ANNEX 10). Under the provisions of
Loan 2601-MA, additional funds were provided for the computerization of the
project management system of DSD and the purchase of additional computers,
printers, software and training services.
3.11      The Government has recently established a permanent post of Deputy
Director in TAVED. However, this post has not yet been filled. The
Government has agreed to fill the position with a well-qualified candidate
prior to loan effectiveness.
Staff DeveloRment (USS40.0 million eguivalent)
3.12      Overview.  The Project would establish a Center for Staff
Development (CFSD) in an existing polytechnic (ANNEX 8). Assisted by a team
of international consultants, the Center would train or coordinate the
training of about 1000 new teachers and instructors over the duration of the
Project.   The establishment of the Center was appraised as the least costly
option to train the large number of teachers and instructors required. The
Center's objectives would be to provide: (a) bachelor degree training in
Engineering; (b) master degree training in technical education; and (c)
certificate of skill upgrading and training in technical education for non-
degree teachers. Degrees would be conferred on successful candidates by the
Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) under a special agreement between UTM and
HOE.
3.13      Center for Staff Development.  The Center for Staff Development
would be located in the existing polytechnic at Batu Pahat. The Government
has decided to maintain the facility as a teacher training institution. This
Center would serve as a base of operations for an overseas university (or a
consortium of overseas universities) that would be contracted to offer degree-
level teacher training in engineering and technical education. The Center
would consist of administrative facilities, classrooms, laboratories, work-
shops, food service facilities, student housing and faculty/staff housing. At
negotiations, the Bank received assurances from the Government that it would
award the contract for staff development by October 31, 1993 (para. 6.1c).
3.14      Center-Based Teacher/Instructor Training.  Polytechnic graduates
would be recruited for the degree (450) and non-degree (200) teacher training
§/    For an organization chart of DSD (PIU), see ANNEX 11.



-17-
programs offered by the Center. Those admitted to the degree program would
receive three and a half years of full-time engineering training at the
Center. Upon graduation they would receive a Bachelor of Science degree in
engineering and would be immediately admitted to a Master's of Technical
Education degree program for eighteen months of full-time training. When these
graduates are combined with returning teacher trainees from foreign fellowship
programs, it is estimated that the Center would provide Master's level
training for about 700 teachers. They would then be assigned to polytechnics
as teachers. Those polytechnic graduates who are admitted to the certificate
program (200) would receive one year of full-time training in skill upgrading
and pedagogy and technical subjects and receive the certificate of technical
education before being assigned to a polytechnic as instructors (ANNEX 4).
3.15      The UTM will administer the center for staff development and
provide about 15X of the instructional staff. Understanding has been reached
that MOE will provide about 34 related-instruction teachers for the center
(para. 6.3). The required technical teachers will be provided by a consultant
to be engaged by MOE. UTM will also award the bachelor's and Master's degrees
to successful candidates. An agreement is being finalized between MOE and UTM
which specifies the roles and responsibilities of both parties under the
Project. Bank receipt of a signed copy of the MOE-UTM agreement acceptable to
the Bank is a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2(d)).
3.16      CounterRart Training.  Selected senior degree teachers (12) from
the present polytechnics would be assigned to The Center to assist with
training. Those teachers would be assigned as counterparts to specialists
from overseas. The local counterparts would be provided with a systematic
program of instruction and practice by the contractor. In this way, the local
counterparts would be able to assume positions as teacher trainers at the
Center, or other appropriate locations in the polytechnic system, following
the completion of the Project. Selected counterpart faculty members would be
provided with an opportunity to study for the Masters of Technical Education
degree during their assignment at the Center.
3.17      Fellowships and Short-Term Training.  Using established MOE
fellowship selection criteria, both in-country and overseas fellowships and
short-term training would be made available as required. The following are
examples: (a) 110 polytechnic graduates would be selected and awarded
four-year fellowships to study on a full-time basis in Malaysian universities
in business-related degree programs; (b) 130 polytechnic graduates would be
selected and awarded four-year fellowships to study on a full-time basis in
overseas universities in home economics and design; (c) 50 selected degree
teachers would be given one- to two-year full-time graduate overseas
fellowships to complete a Master's Degree in engineering, commerce (business),
and home economics; (d) where local contractor training expertise is not
available, selected degree teachers (74) would be given short-term overseas
fellowships to acquire (or improve) their knowledge relating to new
technologies and courses offered by the new polytechnics.
3.18      Administrator Training.  Training of administrators for the
polytechnic system will be also necessary as the new polytechnics become fully
operational and their curriculum more comprehensive. Experienced polytechnic
teachers with a minimum of two years of teaching experience would be selected
from the present polytechnics and provided with overseas fellowships for
master's degree programs (30) and doctoral programs (6) in Administration of
Technical Education.



-18-
Curriculus Develogment (fS81.4 million equlvalent)
3.19      Technical assistance would be provided to upgrade existing
curricula and develop now courses as necessary to expand the offerings and
services of the polytechnic system. It is expected that about 15 new courses
would be developed. Existing courses would be reviowed before they are
incorporated into the offerings of the new polytechnics. If found to be
inadequate, these courses would be upgraded or modified. Equipment and
supplies specifications would also be prepared as a part of the effort. About
120 man-months of consultant services would be used to support this activity.
Related Studies (US$0.9 milllon equivalent)
3.20      Several studies would also be financed, including: (i) a system-
wide tracer study of polytechnic graduates; and (ii) three local employer
surveys to support the effort to rationalize the curricula to meet the needs
of employers. A small amoint of funds would also be provided to assist in the
preparation of future projects.
3.21      Trac2r Stud.  In 1995 the Project would assist TAVED to conduct a
tracer study of all polytechnic graduates from the previous three years. In
addition, six programs would be formally reviewed for relevance. The Project
would finance both local and/or foreign, short-term consultant services as
required. The study would be focused upon the determination of unmet graduate
and employer needs, in order to improve the system's external efficiency
through improvements in curriculum, equipment selection, instructional
methodology, etc.
3.22      Employer Studies.  Although the Government has conducted feas-
ibility studies to determine appropriate locations and the general focus of
course offerings for each of the new polytechnics, there remains a need to
determine the specific curriculum-related needs of local employers. There-
fore, the Project would support a follow-up survey of local employers within
the institutions' respective service areas (also termed, employability area).
TAVED and a team of consultants would assist the local polytechnic admin-
istrations to plan, conduct and analyze the findings of the study. The
Project would finance local and foreign consulting services to support this
effort. The studies would demonstrate the application of small, targeted
employer surveys to determine the changing needs of curricula, new course
offerings and types of new technology that should be introduced into the shops
and laboratories of the concerned polytechnic.
3.23      Future Xestment Studies.  This subcomponent would finance
consultants to implement studies that would be required in the planning for
Phase II of the Government's investment program to increase the productivity
and capacity of the polytechnic system. The terms of reference for the
studies would be determined by the MOE, in accordance with Government pro-
cedures that are agreeable to the Bank.
Human Resources Development Fund (USS0.2 million eauivalent)
3.24      Under the Human Resources Development Act which was passed in July
1992, the Government is establishing a Human Resources Development Fun4. The
aim of the scheme is to encourage private sector firms to provide company-
specific training programs to upgrade the work force with specialized and up-
to-date skills. As production techniques become increasingly automated and



-19-
complex, this would enhance the firm's productivity and the quality of its
products. Initially large and medium-sized firms in the manufacturing and
tourism sectors would participate. They would be required to make a mandatory
contribution amounting to one percent of their monthly payroll to the Fund.
This contribution would be used to finance training undertaken by the
contributing firms.
3.25      The Human Resources Development Council would be established as a
statutory body to manage the fund. Its members would comprise two-thirds
private sector representation and one-third public representation. The
function of the Council would be to: (a) assess and determine the types and
extent of employee training and retraining roquired in keeping with the human
resource needs of industries; (b) promote and stimulate manpower training;
(c) determine the terms and conditions under which financial assistance or
grant would be given.
3.26      The Council is given the following powers to: (a)  collect and
recover all monies due to the Fund; (b) establish guidelines for processing
and approving applications to the Fund for financial assistance; (c)
determine the terms and conditions for making grants or loans from the Fund,
(d) determine the proportion of monies from the Fund which should be used for
grants or for loans; (e) organize, establish, upgrade, and maintain, or to
assist in organizing, establishing, upgrading, and maintaining training
facilities; (f) organize and supervise, or to assist in organizing and
supervising the implementation of training courses, projects, and programs;
and (g) examine any records, accounts, and other documents relating to the
grant, loan, or any other benefits granted to any employer to ensure due
compliance by the employer of the provisions of the Act.
3.27      Technical Assistance.  The objective of the technical assistance
component is to develop and enhance the capability of the HRDF Secretariat in
implementing the proposed scheme. The technical assistance activities would
begin in January 1994, and be completed in December 1995. Assistance is
required in four areas:
(a) development of expertise on advising firms on methods of identify-
ing training needs and priorities, establishing models to assist in
designing, commissioning, and improving training programs specific
to company requirements;
(b) development of expertise on formulation of training programs for
training managers and other appropriate personnel of companies
participating in the scheme;
(c) development of expertise on designing models of resource
allocation, i.e., developing a range of financing packages,
determining grant conditions, requirements, and weighing systems in
the Malaysian context; and
(d) development of expertise on monitoring, evaluating, and improving
the effectiveness of training programs supported by the Fund, and
evaluating the effectiveness of the Fund in promoting industrial
training.
3.28      Sco2e of Services.  The task under area (a) above would require a
labour economist, for one month, with experience in industrial training,



-20-
especially in the area of training needs assessment and the development of
training programs. The tasks under (b) and (d) above would require a
technical trainer, for one month, with experience in developing and evaluating
training programs. The task under (c) would require a consultant with
experience working with similar training fund schemes. It is envisaged that
three consultants would be required for a total oq. 16 months. The consultants
would work with local counterparts to build up their expertise in their areas
of work. Study visits or attachments of officers of the secretariat would be
made to institutions in other countries implementing similar schemes for an
estimated total of 10 months.
National Vocational Training Council (USS0.2 million equivalent)
3.29      Background.  In 1971 the National Industrial Training and Trades
Certification Board was established. The Board was responsible primarily for
the establishment of trade and training standards, curriculum development, and
trade testing and certification. The Board was replaced in 1989 by the
National Vocational Training Council (NVTC), which was established for the
purpose of formulating, promoting, and coordinating vocational and industrial
training strategy and programs in keeping with Malaysia's technological and
economic development needs. The Council thus takes on new responsibilities,
including planning, development, and evaluation of vocational training
activities.
3.30      The objectives of Council are: (a)  establish a coordinated
comprehensive system of vocational and industrial training; (b) promote,
assist in, and develop vocationa' and industrial training programs in skilled
and semi-skilled levels; (c) ensure the attainment of levels of skill
competence commensurate with the stage of technological development; and
(d) tap the potential for in-plant training in selected industrial
establishments and private sector training institutions.
3.31      In order to achieve these objectives, the Council: (a)  assesses
needs for skilled and semi-skilled manpower; (b) monitors and evaluates
public vocational training programs and recommends changes where appropriate;
(c) recommends establishment of new training programs; (d) advises
Government on public training programs; (e) assists and promotes the
development of in-plant training programs; (f) establishes national trade
standards and develops training syllabi; (g) organizes and implements trade
skill testing and certification; (h) assists trainers in updating their
knowledge on technological development in industry; and (i) promotes and
carries out research on vocational training.
3.32      The Council is served by a secretariat and comprises a number of
standing committees. First, the Trade Advisory Committees (TACs) are ap-
pointed to advise the Council on training needs, trade standards and certifi-
cation, and structure and content of courses. Second, the Standards and
Certification Committee acts as the authority for approval of trade standards
and certification.
3.33      As the result of the Government's efforts to reform the VTE
subsector, the Polytechnic Development Project would assist the MOHR to
upgrade and enhance the capacity of the NVTC Secretariat, in particular the
Planning and Development Division. Four areas of assistance are envisaged:
(a) develop a national vocational training philosophy and associated



-21-
development strategies and action plans; (b) develop a computerized national
level information system for research and planning; (c) establish an
evaluation methodology in vocational training; and (d) establish research
methodology for identifying training needs. The implementation period would
cover the 24-month period from January 1994 to the end of December 1995.
3.34      Scope of Services. It is expected that the following expert
services will be required: (a) philosophy, strategies, planning, two person-
months; (b) computerized information system, four person-months; (c)
evaluation methodology, three person-months; and (d) research methodology,
three person-months. In total, 12 person-months of consultancy services are
required. In addition, it is estimated that six months of fellowships, would
also be required. These fellowships would be used for study visits and
attachments to other training organizations.
IV. COSTS. FINANCING. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENTS
A. Costs
4.1       Summaries of Costs.  The total cost of the Project, including
duties and taxes, is estimated to be about Malaysia Ringgit 482.0 million or
US$185.0 million equivalent. It is estimated that US$107 million equivalent
or 58X of the total project cost would be foreign costs. The loan will
finance lOOX of the foreign costs. The breakdown of costs of the proposed
project components, categories of expenditure and sub-components for the
Project is summarized in Tables 4.1 and 4.2.  Detailed costs of the Project by
components, categories of expenditure, and time are given in ANNEX 1.
4.2       Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated costs for civil works are based
on actual unit costs for construction of recently completed polytechnics and
on current unit costs for similar projects (i.e., teacher training facilities
and secondary VTE schools) recently completed by DSD and the Public Works
Department (PWD)'7/. Base costs are estimated at January 1992 prices. Base
year (1992) unit construction costs, excluding site development costs,
statutory contribution fees and professional fees, for the various
accommodations range from US$180 to US$320 per square meter of gross floor
area, depending on intended use.
4.3       Site development costs and statutory commitment fees represent 30
per cent of the construction costs. The costs are considered reasonable for
comparable Bank Group-assisted construction. Costs of professional services
of project consultants and for the design and supervision of construction
reflect the scale of fees established for similar services provided in prior
projects and by local architectural consulting firms. Estimated equipment
costs were drawn from lists developed by the GOM with the assistance of
consultants. Furniture and instructional material costs are based upon GOM
estimates and reflect current prices. Estimated costs for the salaries of
staff are based on basic pay scales including standard allowances for social
and other benefits applicable under the civil service employment regulations.

Paper Number 19, "Estimated Unit Costs for Civil Works Component of the
Proposed Polytechnic Development Project".



-22-
4.4          Customs Duties and Tazes.  All imported equipment and teaching
materials would be exempt from customs duties and taxes. Custom duties and
taxes on building materials are estimated to be less than one per cent of the
total cost of the Project.

B. Financing Plan
4.7       The estimated total project cost would be US$185.0 million
equivalent. The Bank would finance 1001 of the foreign costs or about 581 of
total project costs net of taxes. This would amount to a Bank loan of US$107
million equivalent. The financing plan by project component and category of
expenditure is presented in Table 4.3.

C. Recurrent Cost Implications
4.8       Over the past two decades the Malaysian economy has been
experienced a growth rate of GDP averaging 6.7 percent a year. In the past
four years the average has been about 9 percent. This success has allowed
Government recurrent expenditures to increase by 15 percent a year during
1990-92. Even with these overall increases, however, education has been
allocated above the average. The result has been to increase the sector's
share from 17.7 percent in 1989 to a historical high of 19.6 percent in 1992.
Revenue increases appear to be slowing down. For 1992 they are forecast at
5.7 percent and for 1993-95 around 7 percent. The enrollment projections
contained in the Sixth Plan, together with unit cost estimates, suggest that
sector expenditures would be roughly 70 percent higher in 1995 than in 1990
(percent in real terms). Much of this increase has already occurred through
salary increases included in the 1991 and 1992 budgets but there is still a
requirement for around an 8 percent increase a year up to 1995. This is only
slightly above the forecast growth in total expenditures and should,
therefore, broadly be feasible with the sector's current share of total
recurrent expenditure.
4.9       In 1990, the recurrent budget for the polytechnic subsector was
M$22.7 million (US$9.1 million). The polytechnic budget represents less than
1X of the recurrent allocation of the Ministry of Education. The Project would
include major reforms to introduce several schemes for cost recovery. The
reforms, when fully implemented, would reduce unit operational costs by about
101. When the Project becomes fully operational, the polytechnic system's
annual recurrent budget (for 10 institutions) would be increased by about 401
(US$4.5 million). As the total capacity of the system would be almost
doubled, it is estimated that the efficiencies, economies of scale, and policy
reforms, introduced by the Project, would reduce the current unit cost per
student (about US$400) by about 20X.
4.10      The GOM has indicated a willingness to commit the additional
recurrent budget required at full implementation. Furthermore, the Sixth
Five-Year Plan provides for the full implementation of the Project as planned.
In previous Bank-assisted polytechnic development activities (financed by
Loans 2145-MA and 2601-MA), the GOM has demonstrated its capacity to provide
the necessary recurrent costs.

D. status of Preparation
4.11      Designs and Drawings for Nov Polytechnlcs.  Having designed five
Bank-financed polytechnics since 1984, the Government has considerable
experience in the management of polytechnic design activities. A task force
has completed the preliminary laboratory, classroom and administrative area
designs. These designs were based upon a determined curriculum plan that was
prepared using manpower supply and demand information, advisory committees
(with representation from employers) and technical experts. The
recommendations from the task force were reviewed by the appraisal team.
Using these inputs, the GOM has employed architectural corsultants who would
complete site plans and working drawings for each institution.
4.12      Sites.  Sites for the three new project polytechnics have been
identified and the Government is currently in the process of acquiring them.
The acquisition of the sites is a condition of loan effectiveness.
4.13      Furniture. Equipment. Vehicles. Books. and Consumable Instructional
Materials. In accordance with the implementation plan for the Project, lists
have been prepared by the GOM. They were reviewed and deemed adequate by the
appraisal team.
4.14      Staff DevelrpDment.  The Batu Pahat Polytechnic is being readied for
use as the Staff Development Center. Currently under reconstruction, it is
planned that the institution would be available by June 30, 1993. Completion
of the Center is a condition of loan effectiveness.
4.15      The Government has prepared a draft letter of invitation, terms of
reference and a draft contract for the staff development component which have
been submitted to the Bank for review. The Government has agreed to award the
contract by October 31, 1993. The Government is also finalizing an agreement
with UTM, in consultation with Bank staff, for the administration of the
Center.
E. Prolect Management/Imolementation
4.16      The principal executing agency for the Project would be the
Ministry of Education. Within the Ministry of Education, the Development and
Supply Division (DSD) would serve as the project implementation unit (PIU) for
the Project. The DSD is a permanently established unit with responsibility
for implementation of all large infrastructure projects executed within the
Ministry of Education. As such, the DSD would be required to plan, implement
and document all civil works and procurement associated with the Project. The
Government has agreed that, for the duration of the Project, a senior
education specialist would serve as the manager of the PIU thus ensuring
articulation between the pedagogical concerns of the Ministry and the
requirements of civil works. The Technical and Vocational Education Division
(TAVED) would also provide input into the procurement and design requirements,
particularly as it relates to curricula, staff training, and student/personnel
requirements.
4.17      The PIU and TAVED both have considerable experience in project
implementation, having jointly implemented the two previous industrial
training projects (Loans 2145-MA and 2601-MA) as well as a number of other
Bank- and donor-assisted projects in the education sector. The teaming



-26-
structure of DSD and TAVED would be essentially the same as has been used
successfully in the two previous projects mentioned above, but with enhanced
project capacity. The UTM will administer the Center for Staff Development
under an agreement with HOE (para 3.15).
4.18      In the previous projects, the lack of technical staff, a computer-
ized management information system, and up-to-date office technology have
hindered the implementation of the projects. However, recently funds from the
previous Project (Loan 2601-MA) have been used to install a computerized
management information system as well as modern office technology and
associated training. The Government has also agreed to strengthen the TAVED's
capacity through the appointment of a Deputy Director. The appointment is a
condition of effectiveness.
4.19      Two other project components would be administered by the Ministry
of Human Resources. These components include technical assistance to support:
(a) the implementation of the Human Resources Development Fund; and (b) the
planning and research functions of the National Vocational Training Council.
The Ministry has agreed that the chief administrators of the Fund and the
Council would be the designated project implementation officer(s) for their
respective components.
4.20      The proposed implementation period is six years.  To allow
sufficient time for submission of final withdrawal applications following the
scheduled Completion Date of June 30, 1999, the Closing Date would be December
31, 1999 (ANNEX 7). Due to the relative complexity and scale of the Project,
above-average supervision coefficients of about 15 staff weeks per year would
bc required in the first 3 - 4 years of project implementation. The Bank
would supervise the project on a quarterly basis during the first 24 months of
project implementation. It is expected that the remaining years would require
two missions each year with a third being scheduled only if necessary.
Overall supervision would be the responsibility of the task manager who would
be assisted by a project architect to handle civil works and related
procurement, and a procurement specialist to oversee the procurement of expert
services and fellowships. ANNEX 12 presents a Bank supervision plan for the
first 24 months of the Project.
F. Honitorin. Review and Evaluation
4.21      The GON has agreed that key indicators of quality and efficiency
improvement have to be developed, integrated into the overall monitoring
system, and used systematically as a part of the project implementation
supervision. These indicators may be modified and adjusted as implementation
progresses. During negotiations, the GON provided assurances that in
conjunction with the Bank, it would undertake an annual review of project
progress on the basis of key performance indicators agreed upon with the Bank
(ANNEX 6). The annual review would be carried out within 60 days following
the end of each fiscal year. The findings of the review would be documented
in an annual progress report and would be provided to the Bank for review and
comment within 90 days following the end of each fiscal year. Bank
supervision missions would use the key performance indicators listed in ANNEX
6 to ensure a planned and timely monitoring of the unique aspects of the
Project.

4.22      Disbursement Percentages.  The proposed Bank loan of US$107 million
equivalent would finance 100l of the estimated forelgn exchange for the
Project. Disbursements would be made on the basis of: (a) 30X of the cost of
civil works, related professional services and furniture; (b) 1001 of foreign
costs of directly imported goods; (c) 100l of local costs (ex-factory) of
locally manufactured goods; (d) 601 of local costs for other goods procured
locally; (e) 80X of costs for other than civil works related consultants; and
(f) 1001 of costs for training.
4.23      Reguired Documentation.  Disburseoments in respect to contracts for
civil works, goods and training estimated to cost less than US$200,000
equivalent would be made against Statements of Expenditure certified by the
Ministry of Education. Documentation would be retained by the MOE and
available for review by the Bank during scheduled supervision missions. All
other disbursements, including those on consultant and professional services,
would be made against fully documented withdrawal applications. To the extent
practicable, withdrawal applications would be aggregated in amounts of
US$100,000 or more prior to submission to the Bank for reimbursement out of
the proceeds of the loan. In view of the satisfactory budgetary procadures
and financing for earlier education and training projects, it was agreed to
accept the GOM's preference not to establish a special account and matching
operating account.
4.24      Disbursement Profil-.  The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed
over a period of six years. The disbursement schedule (ANNEX 7) is based on
the implementation schedule and the experience with disbursement in the
education sector in Malaysia and the region. The profile for the Project
shows a similar rate of disbursement as in the education sector (Malaysia) and
regional profiles. The appraisal team determined that the Project's
recommended six year time-frame is realistic given the status of project
preparation, the Project's design, and the existing capacity and implemen-
tation experience of the PIU and TAVED. To allow sufficient time for sub-
mission of final withdrawal applications following the scheduled Completion
Date of June 30, 1999, the Closing Date would be December 31, 1999.
H. Procurment
4.25      Civil Works.  Civil works contracts of US$5 million or more
(estimated value US$71.3 million) would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines. Civil
works contracts for less than US$5 million (estimated value US$9.0 million)
would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB), in
accordance with Government procedures that are acceptable to the Bank. With
the exception of small civil works contracts awarded for less than US$500,000,
all contracts would be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. The
Malaysian model bidding document for civil works would be used as the basis
for all works procurement.  A summary of procurement methods is shown in Table
4.5.
4.26      Furniture. Equipment. Vehicles, Dooks and Consumable Instructional
Materials. Items would be grouped to the extent possible into attractive bid
packages US$200,000 or more to facilitate procurement. In the comparison of
bids for ICB, local manufacturers would be extended a margin of domestic



-28-
preference of 151 of the c.i.f. costs of competing imports or the actual
customs duties, whichever is lower. All goods contracts awarded for
US$200,000 or more would be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank.
4.27      Furniture packages estimated to cost US$200,000 or more (estimated
total value US$4.6 million) would be awarded on the basis of LCB, and packages
estimated to cost less than US$200,000, up to an aggregate value of US$0.6
million would be purchased through local or international shopping according
to Government procurement procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. The
total expenditure on furniture is estimated at US$5.2 million.
4.28      Equipment packages estimated to cost US$200,000 or more (estimated
value US$33.4 million) would be awarded on the basis of ICB. Equipment and
vehicles estimated to cost less than US$200,000 (estimated value US$12.4
million) would be awarded on the basis of LCB. Up to an aggregate total of
US$1.8 million, small items of equipment and vehicles with an estimated cost
of less than US$50,000 per contract may be purchased through local and
international shopping or may be supplied under existing government bulk
procurement contracts awarded in accordance with procedures which are
satisfactory to the Bank. The total expenditure on equipment and vehicles is
estimated at US$47.6 million.
4.29      Books and consumable instructional materials would be purchased
through local and international shopping. Some books (up to an aggregate of
US$0.8 million) may be procured through direct negotiations. The total
expenditure on books and instructional materials is estimated at US$2.0
million.
4.30      Consultant and Professional Services.  Consulting and professional
services contracts (value at US$34.4 million equivalent) valued at US$100,000
million or above would be subject to prior Bank review. Single-source
contracts, consultant contracts for assignments of a critical nature, and
contract amendments raising the contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or
above would be subject to prior Bank review. Table 4.4 provides a breakdown
of the services required.
4.31      The staff development contract will be the largest consulting
procurement activity in the Project. It is expected to be awarded to a
consultant organized to provide high quality education/training services. The
Bank has assisted the Government to prepare for this important investment by
providing services during the preparation of the component. It is a condition
of the loan that the signing of the staff development contract will be
completed by October 31, 1993. For a detailed description of this component,
see ANNEX 8.

4.32      Prior Review.  Prior Bank review would be required for procurement
amounting to a total cost of about US$148 million. This amounts to about 80X
of the total cost of the Project.
I.  Accounting and Audltinc
4.33      The Project would be subject to normal GON accounting and auditing
procedures which are considered satisfactory by the Bank. As in previous
projects, the Bank would accept audit reports prepared by the Government's
Auditor General's office. The MOE project accounts would be maintained by the
MOE Development and Supply Division. The MOHR project accounts would be
maintained by the respective administrative offices of the Human Resources
Development Fund and the National Vocational Training Council.

4.34      Within six months following the end of the fiscal year, each
ministry would be required to submit to an independent audit of their project
accounts and financial statements to the Auditor General for Government review
and certification. The certified report of the audit would be sent to the
Bank for review and comment within nine months following the end of the fiscal
year. Using the same time frame, the respective ministries would also provide
a separate, independent audit of accounts relating to their disbursement
against statements of expenditure. Within six months after the Closing Date,
the MOE, MOHR and the Bank would jointly participate in the preparation of a
project completion report.
J.  b1ixga. l Impact
4.35      The new institutes would be established in or near industrial areas
where there are sufficient utilities, roads and other communications services
to support the institutions' populations and facilities. The CON requires
environmental reviews as an integrated component of all site appraisals for
large-scale infrastructure development in the country. In the case of the
proposed project, the Government's site appraisals revealed no environmental
issues.
4.36      The Project would clearly contribute to the improvement of the
environment of the nation. The systematic training of large numbers of
higher-level skilled workers and technicians would provide the critical



-31-
manpower required to move many industries from being heavy consumers of raw
materials to being providers of technology-related services and value-added
manufacturers. The project institutions would also offer training that would
directly impact on the implementation, maintenance and operation of environ-
mental works and projects. For example, it is planned that the institutes
would train technicians in the areas of: electronics; controls; chemical
processing; civil works; petroleum processing; and equipment maintenance.
Many of these trained workers and technicians would seek employment in water
and sewage treatment plants, power generation plants, road construction,
mining, etc. It is also planned that the curriculum development teams would
introduce relevant environmental topics into the curricula. TAVED would be
responsible for reviewing the curricula of the institutions to insure that
environmental issues are properly addressed.
K. SUstainability
4.37      The proposed project would be the third in a series of priority
investments to upgrade the country's capacity to train higher-level skilled
workers and technicians. Previous investments in the subsector have been
fully supported by the Government and the investments have resulted in high
levels of graduate placement, employer acceptance, and reasonable costs of
operation. The proposed project would further reduce the initial capital
investment costs in the new polytechnics by about 30% (per full-time student
enrollment). It would also improve the internal efficiency of the system
through the introduction of higher student/teacher ratios, demand-driven
curriculum, improved facility utilization, and the incorporation of cost
recovery schemes. The incremental recurrent cost is estimated to be less than
11 of the recurrent budget for the entire sector. The increased role of
employers in the sector would also improve the sustainability of the Project.
L. ImDact on Women
4.38      The polytechnic system already has a policy of gender equity in
enrollments. At present, about 27X of all enrollments are women. Many of
these are in areas of commerce, drafting, and chemical processing. Although
some programs are less popular with women, all programs are open for their
enrollment if desired. Efforts would be made in the establishment of the new
institutions to provide more opportunities for the training of women in
traditional and non-traditional employment. Special facilities for women
would be established in close proximity to all classrooms and laboratories.
Through recruitment and staff development, the Project would also increase the
percentage of women teachers, instructors and administrators employed by the
polytechnics.
V. B      =FITS AND RISKS
A. Bengfits
5.1       The major project benefit would be the increased annual
availability of trained higher-level skilled workers and technicians to
support Malaysia's development goals. The Project would also improve the
internal efficiency of the existing polytechnics though improvements in



-32-
national and local level management, staffing, curricula, reductions in unit
costs, better capacity utilization and quality improvements in service
delivery. External efficiency of the system would be improved through the
establishment of better linkages with employers, decentralization of
administrative authority, introduction of a wider scope of course offerings,
improvement of course relevance, and capacity expansion in areas of employer
demand. The benefits of more relevant and better targeted training should
strongly support the national program for development (Sixth Five-Year Plan).
New skills offered by the institutes would also support the introduction of
new technologies and enhance the capacity of the Government to be more
responsive to the needs of industry.
B. Risks
5.2       The primary project risk is the presently inadequate expertise and
institutional capacity to train the quantity of teachers and administrators
required to staff the project institutions. If these teachers and
administrators are not adequately recruited and trained, the potential of the
Project would be degraded significantly. The need for this training capacity
would be short-term and may not be sustainable if established permanently.  To
address this risk, the Project would establish a Center for Staff Development
for the duration of the Project, at Batu Pahat to recruit and train teachers.
To further reduce risk, a consultant for staff development would be contracted
to provide the majority of teacher educators required.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECONMENDATION
6.1       The Bank has received assurances from the Government that it would:
(a) carry out an action plan for policy reform and institutional
strengthening (para. 3.3 and Annex 5);
(b) conduct an annual review of project progress based on key
performance indicators agreed upon with the Bank (para. 4.21
and Annex 6); and
(c) award the contract for staff development by October 31, 1993
(paras. 4.15 and 4.30).
6.2       Conditions of effectiveness of the Loan include:
(a) acquisition of the project sites at Shah Alam, Penang and
Johor Bahru (para. 4.12);
(b) the appointment of the TAVED Deputy Director (paras. 3.11 and
4.18);
(c) completion of the reconstruction of the Batu Pahat Polytechnic
(para. 4.14); and
(d)  Bank receipt of a signed copy of the MOE-UTM agreement
acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.15).



-33-
6.3       Understanding has been reached with the Government that it would,
through the MOE, appoint about 34 related instruction teachers by March 31,
1994 to the Staff Development Center (para. 3.15).
6.4       Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the project would
constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan for US$107 million equivalent to
Malaysia at the standard variable rate for a term of 17 years including a
grace period of 5 years.
