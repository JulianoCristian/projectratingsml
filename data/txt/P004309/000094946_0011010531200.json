outputs, sustained Government commitment through\n            project implementation, good private sector participation,\n            and an effective implementation agency. Prospects for\n            sustaining the project's outcomes are highly likely.\n            Both World Bank and Borrower performances were rated\n            generally satisfactory. Key lessons learned from this\n            project include the following: Large infrastructure projects\n            should first be broken down into clearly designed,\n            straightforward, and easy to understand elements before\n            being formed into project components in order to allow for\n            efficient implementation. Secondly, the use of\n            contractor-supported, in-country teacher training can\n            significantly reduce the costs for teacher training when\n            comparing the costs for international fellowships to train\n            the same number of teachers. Third, this was an\n            input-oriented operation that did not lend itself easily to\n            assessing improvement in the quality and relevance of\n            vocational training. A future operation should establish a\n            Performance Management Framework to provide early and\n            continuous assessment of both outcomes and impact of the\n            project on all stakeholders. This should include evaluations\n            measuring the effect of investments in capacity building,\n            improved training facilities and better-trained staff, and\n            the cost-effectiveness of public sector training."}, "docdt": "2000-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
