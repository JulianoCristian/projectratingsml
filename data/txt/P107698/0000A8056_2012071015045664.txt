                         The project is closing on June 30, 2012. The project has encountered some minor problems with the pre-emergency communications systems put in place. The contractor has come
                         to Kurdistan to fix the problems which have been resolved. The blood banks in two of the three cities are operational. The third in Erbil is not yet operational: the new Director has

                         At the time of project closing, the three major cities of Erbil, Sulaimanyah, and Dohuk are operating the pre-hospital emergency care system. Emergency medical training has been
                         completed. The Emergency Medical Systems (EMS) Framework put in place by the KRG-MOH requires improved management to ensure full sustainability of the system.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Sustainability of the EMS is needed through a specific budget line item, and multi-sectoral high level commitment. This will also require that skilled and qualified personnel at the
                         central level be identified and provided with the required authority to implement the EMS in a coordinated and effective manner. The Minister has been informed of these
                         recommendations.
