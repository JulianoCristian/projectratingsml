         Emergency Response Project for Iraq were as follows: overall\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, and both the Bank and the Borrower\n            performance were moderately satisfactory. The important\n            project lessons learned were: (1) in uncertain,\n            post-conflict and low capacity environments keep the project\n            simple and focused on the main development outcome. (2)\n            Proactive supervision and hands-on support are paramount for\n            success in low capacity environments. (3) In conflict or\n            post-conflict projects, flexibility in adjusting project\n            content during implementation is advisable. (4) Planning and\n            investing for sustainability should be embedded in the\n            project design. (5) Training and capacity building are\n            mandatory but not enough for acquiring specialized technical\n            expertise. (6) Dedicated expertise is still needed after\n            project completion to ensure sustainability. (7) Solid\n            technical knowledge and skills and management expertise are\n            a sine qua non in the selection process of the\n            implementation agencies for successful project preparation\n            and implementation."}, "docdt": "2012-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
