                         The project had encountered several delays, particularly with the readiness of the Emergency Coordination Centers (ECCs) which are almost but not fully completed with the requisite
                         equipment. To date the purchase of one last key item is being launched and the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD)/Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) system is currently being

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The above delays have meant that the project will not meet the full objectives by December 31, 2011. The Ministry of Health has requested a 6-month extension of the project, and a
                         request is awaited from Government by mid-October 2011.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
