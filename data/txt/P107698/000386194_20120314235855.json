This is a second level restructuring to include\n            an additional method of procurement to the grant agreement\n            for the project as per the request of the Ministry of Health\n            of the Regional Government of Kurdistan (KRG MOH) dated\n            January 4, 2012. The original grant for the above project\n            was approved on June 19, 2008 for US$8.7 million, with\n            additional financing for US$4.5 million approved on June 30,\n            2010. The project is at 80 percent physical completion, with\n            the disbursement level at 82 percent. The project is rated\n            as moderately satisfactory, with the near completion and\n            functionality of the Emergency Coordination Centers (ECCs),\n            the installation of the CAD/AVL (emergency tracking system),\n            and the installation of radio towers. All blood banks have\n            been completed, equipped, and is operational, except for the\n            Erbil Blood Bank which has settlement cracks in the facility\n            which need to be remedied prior to being operational. Data\n            for collection and use of blood for emergency purposes is\n            currently being collected. Other project data such as\n            response time using the new system and registration of\n            incoming calls, will be collected in February 2012 once the\n            Emergency Coordination Centers (ECCs) are operational."}, "docdt": "2012-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
