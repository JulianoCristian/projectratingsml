                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Additional financing in the amount of US$4.5 million was approved on June 30, 2010 to cover the cost of: (a) establishing an up-to-date and effective emergency telecommunications
                         system; and (b) expanding the technical training of emergency medical and paramedical staff to maximize the efficiency and yield of Kurdistan's Emergency Medical System (EMS).
                         In order to provide sufficient time for these expanded and scaled-up activities to be fully implemented, the Project Closing Date was extended by an additional 18 months, from June

                         Civil works at the Emergency Communications Centers (ECCs) and the Blood Banks in Sulaimaniyah and Dohuk have been completed, and the ECC and Blood Bank in Erbil remain
                         at 65% physical progress. The contract to carry out the emergency response training program for medical and paramedical staff was signed in October 2010 and training activities are
                         currently underway led by the International Medical Corps. The contract for the procurement of consultants to design and implement the emergency telecommunications system has
                         been in place for several months and the two separate contracts for Radio Communications, and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD)/Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) system are
                         expected to be signed soon. However, a critical factor is the Government (Ministry of Communications) assignment of the radio frequencies which had been stalled since July 2010,
                         but is now under active review by the Government (the agreed date for this frequency assignment was February 15, and it is estimated that the frequency will be obtained before end
                         of March). The radio contract cannot be signed and launched until the radio frequencies are assigned. Failure to meet this deadline will put the project at risk.
