satisfactory, the sustainability was highly\n            likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the project: Targeting mechanisms that are\n            strengthened to reflect lessons and experiences during\n            implementation allow for more effective channeling of\n            project development resources to the poorest and vulnerable.\n            Well-designed monitoring and evaluation systems allow for a\n            meaningful tracking of project performance and achievements,\n            responsiveness to priority needs of target beneficiaries,\n            and informed decision-making. By aligning capital\n            investments with capacity development, the stream of\n            benefits and impact of development project resources can be\n            maximized. Commitment, action, a strong drive for results,\n            and flexibility to respond to evolving needs, are important\n            elements to enhancing project effectiveness. Maximizing\n            development impact requires that interventions be designed\n            in a more integrated fashion and that the necessary\n            complementary inputs, including software, are in place."}, "docdt": "2006-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
