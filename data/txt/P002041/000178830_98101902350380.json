It will consist of a package of\n            farm support services and physical infrastructure designed\n            to benefit directly 55,000 smallholder farm families located\n            in the northern part of Oyo State. Support services will\n            include extension advice, crop protection measures, weed\n            control, improved seeds, fertilizers, and the provision of\n            credit facilities. Physical infrastructure will include\n            constructing (550 kms.), improving (250 kms.), and\n            maintaining gravelled feeder roads, constructing dams and\n            wells, and establishing project headquarters and farm\n            service centers. Consultant services will be engaged to\n            recruit a project management team. The risks involved in the\n            project are minor and will arise from failure to achieve the\n            farmer adoption rate or to contract consultant services on\n            time, but the basic agricultural package is simple and well tested."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
