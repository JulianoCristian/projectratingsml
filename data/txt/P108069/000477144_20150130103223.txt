1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Sierra Leone made strong progress in building peace after the end of the civil war in January
2002 by achieving macro-economic stability, re-establishing democratic institutions, strengthening
core systems and bringing decisions and resources closer to citizens through a significant
decentralization initiative. This was followed by the Cabinet approval of the 2004 Local
Government Act (LGA). From 2004 to 2009, the adoption of key policies of the LGA was supported
by the Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP) funded by the Bank, the
Department for International Development (DFID) and the European Union (EU). The IRCBP was
successful in putting resources and strong implementation intent behind the government decision to
pursue a policy of decentralization and improving PFM as core responses to the country’s post -conflict
predicament. In the process of actualizing this intent, the IRCBP generated credence for the
decentralization initiative as well as helped to confer legitimacy for the newly established structure of
sub-national government through the increasingly visible and effective operations of the Councils and
improvements in PFM.

2.       Growth averaged over 7.0% from 2004 to 2006 and moderated somewhat to about 6.4% in
2007 and 5.5% in 2008. In September 2007, the All People’s Congress (APC), which had been in the
opposition, won the presidential and parliamentary elections, which was followed by a peaceful
transfer of power from the Sierra Leone People’s Party (SLPP) to it.

3.       The Republic of Sierra Leone’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) for 2008-2012 set the
direction and development priorities for the administration at the time of appraisal. With the central
objective of faster growth and poverty elimination, the PRS focused the country’s development
priority toward investments in energy, transport, health, and education. The growth and poverty
reduction strategy was based on a foundation of good governance that included strengthening the civil
service, decentralization and local government, fighting corruption and strengthening public financial
management (PFM). In order to adequately move forward, a budget system that fully reflected these
and other GoSL priorities was required. In view of the importance of PFM to the effective
implementation of the PRS, to reduce opportunities for corruption, and attract budget support
assistance from the development partners (DPs), the effective functioning of PFM institutions and
systems at central and local levels of government in Sierra Leone was considered high priority.

4.       Beginning 2002, under a post conflict situation, the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) made
good progress in strengthening its PFM framework and systems through the implementation of the key
recommendations under the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) of 2002. Notable
achievements included the establishment of the legal and regulatory framework for budgeting,
accountability and procurement; (a) implementation of a financial management information system
(FMIS) in the Accountant General’s Department in 2005 with roll out to several ministries,
departments and agencies (MDAs); (b) removal of the backlog of annual financial statements; and (c)
establishment of basic budgeting, procurement and accounting procedures in the local councils.

5.      Despite the very low starting point at the end of the civil war, Sierra Leone scores from the
2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment were similar to the average
for other countries in the region. It is worth noting, however, that modest improvements were
achieved more recently based on the scores of the 2010-12 PEFA assessment done in early 2014 (see
PEFA scores in Section 3.4). Although the timeliness of financial statements and audit reports had
improved, budget credibility hit a low point in 2007 which was an election year. This and other



                                                   1
analyses such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) report Sierra Leone: Implementing Public
Financial Management Reforms indicated that PFM areas of major weakness remained.

6.       The 2008 Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Program by the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) stressed that in order to build on the progress already
achieved, there was urgent need to address the lack of budget credibility and predictability, fiscal
management challenges, weaknesses in expenditure control (including payroll), and low levels of
transparency. Among other things, the PFM Oversight Committee, chaired by the Financial Secretary
of the MoFED, emphasized the importance of strengthening fiscal and budget management,
accounting, reporting and oversight, payroll management and cross-cutting issues of capacity
development and organizational strengthening. The program also identified the need for a phased
reduction in the dependence on Development Partner (DP) funding for key line positions in the
MoFED. These led to the development of the Integrated Public Financial Management Reform
Project (IPFMRP) that was led by the MoFED’s Public Financial Management Reform Unit (PFMRU)
and which was previously funded by the Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP).

7.       The Bank appraised the project and determined that the PFM institutions and systems had
critical impact on service delivery and on the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Program (PRSP). Critical factors noted at appraisal that would improve PFM practices were as
follows: (i) timely resources availability to public service providers and in accordance with the budget;
(ii) direction of resources to stated government priorities; (iii) using resources for the intended
purposes; (v) preventing misappropriation of resources; (iv) executing the budget without running up
arrears and creating macro-fiscal instability; and (vi) demonstrating to citizens how resources have
been spent. Furthermore, the appraisal noted that social and infrastructure sectors are dependent on
reliable and well-managed finances, and without this, the GoSL’s ability to efficiently and effectively
deliver key services and projects were fundamentally undermined. Building PFM from a rudimentary
to a well-performing system was considered a central element of the development and governance
agenda in Sierra Leone.

8.       Bank support for public sector management and governance was initially delivered through
the IRCBP (P078613) whose achievement of development objectives was rated “Satisfactory” when it
closed in March 2009. IRCBP supported the process of decentralization and the strengthening of
PFM. The IRCBP’s key results included: (a) establishment of an improved local government system
at the local level and local councils that were fully staffed with core skills in the areas of development
planning, internal audit, monitoring and evaluation and procurement; (b) implementation of the Local
Government Development Grant (LGDG) that successfully funded the development budget of all local
councils that were released with minimum conditions in terms of implementation of capacity building
activities for local staff in the areas of participatory planning, budgeting, financial management and
project management; (c) introduction of budget transparency such as posting on notice boards at LC
offices relevant financial information on a monthly basis; and (d) roll out of the IFMIS system to 10
MDAs that included the wide installation of the system and full implementation of the new IFMIS in
MoFED and one line Ministry. The IRCBP also implemented the interim local government financial
management system that resulted in 8 LCs using the simplified (PETRA) financial management
system which interfaces directly with the central government chart of accounts. Follow up PFM
support on decentralization was provided through a DFID and EC funded multi-donor trust fund
(MDTF) managed by IDA.

9.      The IPFMRP was designed to take into account the challenges identified and the priority
actions needed to effectively address the various PFM challenges. The Bank played an important
role as GoSL’s key partner to further develop the achievements of PFM reforms. Since earlier
support related to PFM was fragmented and lacked coherence and comprehensiveness, the project


                                                    2
implementation arrangement developed at appraisal ensured that PFM support was closely coordinated
between IDA, EC, DFID and AfDB. GoSL and the DPs endorsed the coordination role in managing
the joint DP support of EU and DFID to the core components of the IPFMRP through the MDTF
Grant Agreement. GoSL also endorsed the role of IDA as a key partner in PFM reform with the
required integrative and technical skills to complement policy engagement on PFM.

10.     The IPFMRP was formally approved on streamlined procedures by the Bank’s Board on June
4, 2009 and became effective on December 15, 2009. A launching mission visited Freetown in
February 2010 and the first implementation support mission was carried out in May 2010. A mid-
term review (MTR) mission was conducted in June 2012.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

11.      The project’s original PDO “to support Government of Sierra Leone in sustainably improving
the credibility, control and transparency of fiscal and budget management” was designed to contribute
to the GoSL’s higher level objective of improving strategic allocation of resources and quality of
expenditures required for the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The project
aimed to contribute to the FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy’s (CAS) Strategic Priority 1:
Governance, Decentralization and Public Financial Management, particularly those outcomes
involving improved strategic orientation of the budget, transparency of resource envelope and
allocation, accountability of spending units, transparency and accountability of procurement, and
staffing. For example, with the project’s support, GoSL carried out a number of PFM reforms at both
the central and local levels. These contributed to the improvement of public budgeting, public
procurement, public sector accounting and reporting, internal audit and external oversight of public
finances in recent years but challenges remained in some specific PFM areas. To address the
remaining challenges, GoSL developed a medium-term PFM Reform Strategy for the period 2014-
2017. To this end, GoSL remains committed to improving fiscal discipline, strengthening budget
credibility and ensuring value for money as agreed under the Multi-Donor Budget Support
Performance Assessment Framework (MDBS-PAF). The implementation of this strategy is being
supported under the new Public Financial Management Improvement and Consolidation Project.

12.     The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the project were based on the PEFA framework for
the overall monitoring of PFM performance. The PEFA indicators guided the development of a
common framework of objectives, indicators and targets to phase and monitor the project.
Consistency with the PFM dimensions of Multi-Donor Budget Support was a key consideration.
Specifically, the project’s Results Framework (RF) was developed with the view to strengthening
MoFED’s capacity to track and monitor impact of spending. Although at the time of appraisal, the
RF was considered adequate for monitoring and evaluation purposes, the MTR mission in June 2012
proactively revised the framework for better alignment of the intermediate indicators with the PDO
indicators and so that the indicators are more focused on measurable outcomes (see also Sections 1.2;
2.3 & 3.2).

1.2 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

13.     The PDO was not revised but as stated earlier the Results Framework was revised in order to
make the PDO indicators stronger and smarter and capture all aspects of the PDO at the intermediate
indicator level so that they are more closely aligned to the PDO and more focused on outcomes (see
also Section 2.3). The Results Framework developed during appraisal was the basis for assessing
progress from project launch until the end of December 2013, and the revised version was the basis in
assessing the final outcomes and results at the ICR stage.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.     The main beneficiaries of the project included the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development (MoFED), the National Public Procurement Authority (NPPA), the Parliament
responsible for the implementation of PFM reforms and Non-State Actors (NSA) that received supply
and demand driven funds intended to promote its role in scrutinizing use of public resources and
building constituency for reform of PFM system across an array of NSAs. Other beneficiaries
included the National Revenue Authority, Audit Service of Sierra Leone that received separate DP
support and relevant local councils.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

15.      The original components, as approved are presented in Table 1 below (see Annex 2 for
detailed description of the components/sub-component and relevant outcomes and results). Project
components remained relevant to the PFM reform strategy of GoSL throughout the implementation
period and beyond. For example, with the project’s support under Component 1 (Macro-fiscal
Coordination and Budget Management), the regulations for effective implementation of the new
Public Financial Management Bill were prepared and will be submitted to the Parliament shortly.
The new PFM Bill: (a) presents clear and comprehensive definitions of Government entities; (b)
introduces fiscal responsibility principles; (c) improves macro-fiscal planning and management of
fiscal risks; (d) strengthens budget discipline to enhance budget credibility; (e) improves cash
management; and (f) strengthens accounting, reporting and auditing. Progress in the establishment of
the Treasury Single Account (TSA) has also advanced. It was scheduled for completion in
September 2014 but technical assistance was delayed due to the Ebola outbreak. Under Component 2
(Key Aspects of the Control System), the project provided funds to address issues related to costs and
risks of domestic debt burden. In this regard, GoSL with the new tools will be able to review the
Medium Term Debt Management Strategy in 2015 to assess the impact of Ebola outbreak on the debt
sustainability thresholds. GoSL will also be able to adopt a comprehensive framework within which
it can make informed choices on how financing requirements could be met at the lowest possible cost
consistent with a prudent degree of risk.

16.      Table 1 below also presents the allocations of the various components and the final status of
the use of project funds. The allocation of Component 1 (Macro-fiscal Coordination and Budget
Management) was increased due to the procurement of additional computers and other equipment.
The allocation of Component 2 (Key Aspects of the Control System) was increased due to the higher
than estimated cost of the PETS exercise and increased support for capacity building of Parliamentary
committee members. Component 3 (Sustainable and Capable Central Finance Functions) received
the highest allocation due to the relatively high cost associated with the IFMIS software (Freebalance)
and hardware although the allocation was not fully utilized due partly by the suspension of
Freebalance and delays in procurement of various items during the last 3 months of the project (see
also Section 7 for the Bank’s explanation on the underutilization of MDTF funds) and the closure of
Sub-component 3.4 (Salary Support for MoFED Civil Service Staff). The allocation of Component 4
(Supporting NSAs) was higher than the estimate due to additional support for the capacity building
support to key NSA stakeholders. Component 5 (Project Coordination and Administration) required
additional funds for administration due to the extension of the project. The unutilized portion of the
funds was cancelled.

1.6 Revised Components

17.     The components were not revised. However, sub-component 3.5 “Phased Exit and
Transitional Support for Staff Remuneration” was closed on February 2, 2010. The reason for the
closure is explained in Section 1.7 of this ICR.

1.7 Other significant changes

18.    The project was funded by IDA and MDTF grants, and restructured four times during the
implementation period.

19.      The first restructuring dated December 21, 2010 amended the IDA Grant (H493-SL) and
MDTF Grant (TF095389) to allow for the retroactive financing of: (a) outstanding invoices
(US$227,806.35) and 10% contract hold back (US$146,451.00) incurred during the implementation of
the Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP) related to the 5-year IFMIS Contract

1 According to the World Bank’s Disbursement Office, the original allocation was US$21.446 million and the revised amount was
US$20.49. The amounts shown in Table 1 are derived from the final Interim Financial Report prepared by GoSL. The totals are not
identical to those recorded by the Disbursement Unit of the World Bank due to the different dates used by GoSL and the World Bank in
converting the amounts to US dollars. Also according to World Bank records, the cancelled amount was US$946,743.38 (US$362.85 IDA
and US$946,380.53 MDTF).




                                                                  5
(US$2,018,318) with FreeBalance Inc. of Canada for the supply, integration testing, commissioning
and support of an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS)
(IRCBP/IFMIS/01/2004) dated October 21, 2004. This included the cost of hardware, network
infrastructure and related services; and (b) outstanding invoices under the FreeBalance Master
Software Contract (Software License Agreement signed by GoSL on August 25, 2005 and
countersigned by FreeBalance on September 9, 2005) for annual product support, license fees,
maintenance, training and other services. The IFMIS contract was originally procured and approved
by the Bank under the IRCBP. According to GoSL, the IRCBP closed in March 2009 but the
FreeBalance contracts ended in November 2009. GoSL explained that the outstanding invoices were
not brought to the attention of the Bank when the IPFMRP was being prepared because GoSL thought
that these contractual obligations would automatically roll over as an eligible expenditure under sub-
component 3.1 (Financial Management Information Systems) of the IPFMRP.

20.      The second restructuring dated June 2011 amended the MDTF Grant Agreement (TF095389)
for the following reasons: (a) to accommodate additional resources (EUR 2.0 million) approved by the
Administrative Agreement signed by EC on April 8, 2001; and (b) to reflect the reallocation of these
additional funds across the various expenditure categories.

21.      The third restructuring dated April 19, 2013 amended the MDTF Grant (TF095389) for the
following reasons: (a) deletion of Part 3.4 of Schedule 1 (Project Description) of the MDTF Grant
Agreement; (b) amendment of Section II.A.1 (Project Reports) of Schedule 2 of the MDTF
Agreement; (c) amendment of Section IV.A.2 of Schedule 2 of the MDTF Agreement pertaining to the
allocation of the Grant proceeds; and (d) extension of the closing date to March 31, 2014.

22.      The fourth and last restructuring dated March 21, 2014 amended the IDA Grant (H493-SL)
and MDTF Grant (TF095389) for the following reasons: (a) reallocation of IDA and MDTF Grant
proceeds; (b) amendment of the total Grant Amount of the MDTF Agreement (TF095389); and (c)
extension of the closing date of the project from March 31, 2014 to July 31, 2014. With regards to
the last restructuring, the amount allocated under Category 2 of Schedule 1 of the IDA and MDTF
Grant agreements (US$0.30 million of the IDA Grant and US$1.4 million of the MDTF Grant) for
Sub-component 3.4 “Salary Support for MoFED Civil Service Staff” were reallocated to other
categories. The reallocation was done because GoSL was unable to provide the Bank with the
following documents within the deadline of March 31, 2011: (a) an overall policy for the
establishment of sustainable human resource capacity within MoFED; and (b) an implementation and
financing plan for each respective Fiscal Year in which civil service staff salaries are to be financed
under the Project with details on the numbers, names, conditions of service, salaries and other benefits
of MoFED civil service staff proposed to benefit from transitional support, the proportion of the wage
bill to be supported and other relevant information. The unutilized portion of the allocation under sub-
component 3.5 “Salary Support MoFED Consultants” was also reallocated to other categories as a
result of GoSL’s inability to meet the disbursement condition of sub-component 3.4 within the
deadline stipulated in the legal agreement. Funds under sub-component 3.4 provided interim funding
for salaries of selected PFM consultants in MoFED to enable the performance of key line functions of
MoFED prior to such consultants becoming eligible for support under sub-component 3.4 until March
31, 2011 (see also Sections 2.1 and 3.5). While our intention was not to reward the GOSL for lack of
performance, donor partners recommended to reallocate the resources to core PFM components to
allow for better use of the funds.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

23.      Soundness of the Background Analysis. The background analysis was sound. Project
context was based on priority areas for PFM improvement that were reflected in the action plan of the
Republic of Sierra Leone, Poverty Reduction Strategy 2008-2012 and the key findings of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) report (Sierra Leone: Implementing Public Financial Management
Reforms 2 ). The project focused appropriately to strengthen areas of major PFM weaknesses
identified during project preparation. The appraisal correctly identified the urgent activities that
would enable GoSL to more vigorously move the system from one that is functioning at a rudimentary
level to one that is able to direct resources to priority areas and support high quality expenditure
outcomes.

24.    The project was prepared in close collaboration with all stakeholders from GoSL,
Development Partners, Non State Actors and relevant Local Councils.

25.     The close collaboration during project preparation was strongly endorsed due to the
fragmented and incoherent support for PFM provided by IDA, EC, DFID and AfDB in earlier projects.
It is worth noting that despite the modest contribution of the Bank (US$4.0 million), the preparation
team successfully mobilized the equivalent of about US$17.4 million from the Donors (DFID and EU)
through the establishment of an MDTF agreement. Another positive aspect agreed at preparation
was the funding by the Donors of an international consultant based in Freetown that served as the
“boots on the ground” of the project. Among other things, the Donor funded an international
consultant to help address day-to-day implementation bottlenecks that arose during the life of the
project including closer monitoring of implementation progress. Financial issues related to
accounting, reporting and audit of project funds were also minimized that led to greater synergies in
the use of the resources. These actions also contributed to relatively more efficient FM reporting
which was instrumental in rating the project’s financial management as “Satisfactory”.

26.     The project also accommodated the continued IDA support to public sector management and
governance delivered through the IRCBP on decentralization (PFM reforms) through the DFID and
EC funded multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) managed by the Bank. This ensured uninterrupted
implementation of decentralization activities that were linked to the achievement of the objectives of
the project.

27.     During project appraisal, an assessment was made to support the salaries of MoFED civil
service staff that was subject to a disbursement condition requiring GoSL to first provide an
acceptable HR Policy before funds could be released. Funds equivalent to US$3.0 million (IDA and
MDTF) were budgeted under Sub-component 3.4 (Salary Support for MoFED Civil Service Staff).
The rationale for allocating the resources was based on GoSL’s heavy reliance on DP-financed Sierra
Leonean contract staff (“Local Technical Assistants” – “LTAs”) who were performing key line
functions in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED). The appraisal team
noted that DP-funded LTAs made up 40% of the total staff of the MoFED and at the professional level
(grades 7 and above) significantly outnumbered the regular civil servants and were paid considerably
more than their regular civil service counterparts that affected negatively on the morale of other civil
servants. However, this sub-component was dropped from the project because GoSL was unable to
provide the Bank an acceptable HR pay policy within the timeline. GoSL eventually provided the
Bank with a strategy entitled “Government of Sierra Leone – A Multi-Year Public Sector Pay Reform

2
    D. Last, L. McKenzie, R.Tibana, and C. Karamaga, IMF FAD, June, 2008.



                                                                  7
Strategy” that called for the implementation of pay reform within a holistic and integrated public
sector reform framework over a five year period (2011-2015). Since the deadline had already passed,
the Bank and GoSL agreed that the issue of LTAs at MoFED would be addressed under Component 1
(Support to the GoSL’s Reform Program) of the Pay and Performance Project that was approved on
May 31, 2012. The Bank’s preparation team had overestimated GoSL’s commitment to carry out
this PFM reform action in a post conflict environment that led to the delay by more than 3 years in
approving the HR pay policy.

28.     Project components were oriented towards achieving the project objectives. Institutional
design was rated as “Moderately Satisfactory” in terms of the oversight and monitoring of reforms by
the PFM Oversight Committee chaired by the Financial Secretary (FS) and composed of members that
included relevant stakeholders across GoSL. Project management was carried out by a project
administration unit partly staffed with mainstreamed civil servants whose skills were strengthened
through capacity building support of the project. Overall, the administration and coordination of the
project was rated moderately satisfactory (see Section 5.2).

29.      During project preparation, the overall risk was rated moderate to substantial. At the country
level, the risks were judged as substantial. This was due to the historically weak performance in
governance and control of corruption in Sierra Leone, revenue volatility and the uncertainty created by
a change in government. At the project level, risks were judged as moderate.

30.      Two key areas of challenges were identified. The first challenge was related to the
achievement of budget credibility and predictability which was central to the project. At the time of
project preparation, it was assessed that the budget management system had allowed expenditure
beyond the means of the GoSL through the creation of arrears and MDAs reported that when cash was
highly constrained their ability to continue to function relied on these arrears. For the procedures and
systems to improve the realism of estimates and tools for commitment control to be able to work, it
was noted that political commitment was required to an aggregate spending ceiling that will force very
hard political choices between expenditure priorities, as well as depend on rapid MDA adjustments to
changing resource flow projections. Earlier increased involvement of the cabinet in the budget
decision-making process including the setting of the expenditure framework at the outset of the budget
process was a measure that built ownership of the budget framework. In addition, the increases in
control, in particular commitment control, had to be matched by a timely release of authority to incur
expenditure so that the MDAs see the benefits to their operations of a more orderly process of budget
execution. The emphasis of the project was therefore on the MoFED meeting its obligations for
realistic budgeting and predictable budget execution. The challenge on predictability was partly
addressed with the implementation of the 2010 Goods and Services Tax and passage of the 2011
Customs Act. All taxes now have separate, consolidated, single, and easy-to-follow piece of
legislation. The National Revenue Authority (NRA), however, still exercised discretionary powers,
particularly waivers of custom duties. Delays in transfers from commercial banks to NRA were
reduced with the introduction of the new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the banks.
Revenues outside of NRA, in particular extractive industries, were more systematically determined by
the newly established Units within NRA. The project addressed the challenge with respect to
political commitment in setting expenditure framework and budget decision-making through the
implementation of activities that promoted stronger awareness on these issues through closer
interaction between program management and Parliamentary committee members. There is now
increased oversight and scrutiny of public finances by Parliament through the Parliamentary Finance
Committee (PFC), Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and Transparency & Accountability Committee
(TAC). The reviews which are usually open to the public are now organized regionally covering
MDAs, local councils and school authorities. Extensive capacity building support had been afforded
Members of the respective Committees and the clerks assigned thereof. These included exchange


                                                   8
visits to UK Parliament and other Parliaments in Sub-Saharan Africa and attendance at regional
meetings. All of these are positive outcomes that helped achieved project objectives.

31.     The second area of challenge identified during preparation pertained to the sustainability of
the systems, procedures and capacity developed. The project involved an exit strategy from the
current DP funding for contracted MoFED staff and the building of capacity of permanent staff that
was perceived to be very challenging especially with regards to the prevailing public sector pay
environment at that time. To increase the likelihood of success, design had been undertaken in
consultation with the Public Sector Reform Unit (PSRU), in the Office of the President that ensured
consistency with the evolving public sector and pay reforms and strong support from the relevant
agencies of government concerned with human resource management, planning, development and
remuneration. In addition, the design of the capacity building approach built on a process already
commenced wherein the Accountant General was filling vacancies arising through attrition with
accounting graduates, and using professional training and accelerated career development as
incentives to stay in the public service at least for some time. Funds were, therefore, allocated to
Sub-component 3.5 (Salary Support for MOFED Consultants) to avoid possible disruption in the
implementation of project activities during the pre-determined period.

32.      Finally, the issue of the GoSL’s heavy dependency on the donor-funded local technical
assistants posed a risk of attracting new development partners who work outside of the framework and
fund staff positions of the project. This challenge was addressed by the pooling of Bank and DPs
funds under an MDTF Agreement managed by the Bank and the allocation of US$3.1 million under
Sub-component 3.4 (Salary Support for MOFED Civil Service Staff) of the project. Unfortunately, the
sub-component was cancelled due to the inability of GoSL to meet the disbursement condition within
the deadline. To avoid disruption of project activities, LTAs were funded by GoSL during the life of
the project and a holistic HR strategy was eventually developed by GoSL and is currently being
implemented under the ongoing Pay and Performance Project.

33.      The project preparation team also assessed the challenge on sustainability of systems and
procedures. This challenge was addressed through the institutionalization of the management of the
reform program and by the processing of all government expenditures from the Consolidated Fund
through the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) by key rolled out MDAs
from their respective locations and the rest by the AGD for and on behalf of the respective MDAs.
Furthermore, the ICT infrastructure supporting the IFMIS had been strengthened, the FreeBalance
Accountability Software (including Performance Budgeting Module, Fixed Assets and Inventories)
upgraded to version 6.5E and the Civil Service Management Module introduced replacing the
previously utilized Human Capital Accountability Module. The aforementioned modules are now
being utilized by the respective stakeholders (Budget Bureau, AGD and HRMO) in executing their
responsibilities. Last but not least, the current PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2017 provides for full roll
out to all MDAs which had been captured in the new Public Financial Management Improvement and
Consolidation Project (PFMICP). In ensuring sustainability, continuous training on the respective
modules is provided internally for MDA officials by MoFED. Over 300 officials across rolled out
MDAs had been trained on the use of the FreeBalance under the project.

2.2 Implementation

34.     Between the periods December 2009 (Effectiveness Date) to July 2014 (Closing Date), the
project’s nine (9) Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) recorded the “Development Objective” (DO)
rating was “Satisfactory”. With respect to “Implementation Progress” (IP), the rating was mixed
during the implementation period. The IP rating was “Satisfactory” from December 2009 (project
launch) to July 2010 but was downgraded to “Moderately Satisfactory” in April 2011. The Bank’s


                                                       9
rationale for the downgrading of the IP rating in April 2011 was associated with the risks posed by the
transition to an Integrated Project Administration Unit (IPAU) arrangement proposed by GoSL. The
Bank was concerned about: (a) the lack of clarity in the roles and relationship between the Director for
PFM Reforms and the proposed IPAU; (b) the non-alignment of functional responsibilities with the
accountability for results under IPFMRP; and (c) the risk of weakening the project’s internal control
mechanisms, as a result of the consolidation of fiduciary, project implementation and coordination
responsibilities under one unit. The project was managed at that time by a “central” project team
headed by a Director established by GoSL that performed coordination and procurement
responsibilities for IPFMRP and other Donor-funded development projects in Sierra Leone. The Bank
was also concerned that the various component managers were not familiar with the procurement plan
associated with their component. During this period, the project management arrangements
continued under the original design without major problems except for slight delays in execution of
procurement activities while awaiting government’s response to the issues raised by the Bank. The IP
rating was eventually upgraded to “Satisfactory” in August 2011 when GoSL agreed to move away
from the PIU model to pilot the mainstreaming/integration of project management fiduciary systems
into government.

35.      The mid-term review (MTR) in June 2012 reviewed the implementation progress, M&E
reports and levels of results achieved under the various components with respect to targets set for the
various indicators. The MTR found that generally substantial progress had been made towards
achieving the project’s performance indicators as outlined in the PAD. However, the MTR noted
that certain delays in procurement affected implementation. The Bank’s procurement expert carried
out vigorous follow-up to resolve the delays and the PAU’s procurement officer was sent to external
training. This and other actions helped to resolve most of the implementation issues. The Bank
also facilitated the provision of a short term expert who provided hands on training to staff of the
procurement unit of the PAU.

36.      Between the MTR in June 2012 until the ISM in March 2013, the IP rating remained
“Satisfactory”. The IP rating was downgraded to “Moderately Satisfactory” during the ISM in
March 2013 due to procurement delays and modest progress in the implementation of outstanding
activities during the previous eight months. On the project level, there were recurring delays in the
approval of the Budgeting and Accountability Act and subordinate fiscal rules and debt regulations,
the commissioning of an IFMIS Audit by an independent reviewer, and the lack of a MoFED IFMIS
Strategy Plan inclusive of an ICT Security Policy. The downgrading rationale on the macro level
was attributed to the overall domestic conditions supporting macroeconomic and fiscal stability that
remained fragile due to marginal progress in structural reform, as suggested by the external audit
reports and the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) for the period
2010-2012. The PEFA report stated that the lack of budget credibility proved to be a serious
weakness during the review period although there were signs of improvement in 2013. The PEFA
highlighted several weaknesses such as: (a) lack of capacity in planning and budget formulation in line
ministries; (b) the process of budget ceilings revision linked to IMF missions hindered allocative
efficiency and service delivery; (c) approximately 40% of procurement was operated under non-
competitive bidding and the appeals process required significant additional effort and resources to be
fully implemented and independent; (d) the single Treasury Account was still not operational in
practice; (e) there were many autonomous government Agencies (AGA) and project accounts outside
the ambit of the IFMIS; (f) Accountant General’s (AG’s) reports were not acted on in a timely manner
and sometimes were not forthcoming at all; and (g) despite significant improvements, Audit Services
of Sierra Leone (ASSL) still did not cover all of the general government expenditures. Actions taken
by GoSL to address some of these concerns under the project included: (a) acceleration of the
introduction of a Treasury Single Account (TSA), strengthening of the infrastructure to facilitate the
smooth operation of the TSA and establishment of a Cash Management Unit in the AGD; (b)


                                                  10
institutionalization of procurement in MDAs, through the establishment of a Procurement Cadre; (c)
recruitment of Procurement officers for at least 30 MDAs and local councils that resulted in
approximately 90% of contracts across government above the $100,000 threshold in 2013 that used
open competitive methods; (d) rolling out of FreeBalance Financial Package to 12 key of the 15
targeted spending MDAs; and (e) further rolling out of the Treasury, Purchasing and HR functions of
IFMIS. The follow-on Public Financial Management Improvement and Consolidation Project
(PFMICP) is expected to continue to address the remaining relevant outstanding PEFA issues.

37.     The IP rating remained “Moderately Satisfactory” until project closure (July 31, 2014),
although the Bank proposed various corrective actions and recommendations to help upgrade the
rating. However, the IP rating could not be upgraded during the last ISM in March 2014 because
among other things, GoSL was unable to share documents such as more detailed training
reports/assessments and IFMIS rollout verification statements to adequately validate an upgrading.
The Bank team scheduled an ICR mission to Sierra Leone in September 2013 to get these documents
and carryout consultation with GoSL to discuss the final outcomes of the project including the
preparation of the ICR. However, due to the Ebola outbreak, the field visit was cancelled and the
Bank team had relied on written and audio communications and documents sent by GoSL to Bank
during the preparation of the ICR to validate some of the final outcomes and other results of the
project. The PFMICP that became effective recently is expected to obtain copies of these documents
and carryout the required assessment of these documents within the context of its objectives.

38.     About US$0.95 million of the MDTF allocation was not utilized due primarily by the
suspension of Freebalance, cancellation of procurement of ICT equipment during the final months of
the project and the cancellation of Sub-Component 3.4 for the mainstreaming of LTAs at MoFED.
The reason for the underutilization is explained in Section 3.5 (c) of this ICR.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39.      M&E design. The Quality at Entry Review (QER) conducted in July 2008 confirmed that the
M&E framework of the project contained a number of good quality outcome measures and indicators
but that it needed to focus on a sub-set that is simple in order to be manageable, ensure effective
monitoring and understandable to a wide audience. The QER made the following recommendations:
(a) to the extent possible, the indicators should be selected from within the overall PEFA set, and any
additional indicators should be well justified; (b) it was appropriate that the revenue variance measure
captures revenue under-forecasting as well as over-forecasting; (c) the performance of donors in terms
of transparency and predictability was weak which impacts on budget planning and execution, and this
could be included in the results framework; (d) Cabinet engagement and oversight of the budget could
be included; (e) it was inappropriate to have an indicator that suggests the Auditor General should not
give a qualified audit opinion; (f) tax expenditures and non-tax revenue had major implications for
budget management, and could be captured in the framework; (g) the definition of “poverty reducing
expenditures” was problematic; and (h) variance of actual to budgeted total expenditure (PEFA PI-1)
could be considered. The M&E framework was, therefore, developed based on these
recommendations. However, the MTR mission in June 2012 found that the framework was still not
fully adequate and assessed that: (a) some of the indicators did not lead logically to the achievement of
project objectives; (b) some indicators were not fully centered on outcomes; and (c) there was need to
improve the alignment between the PDO and intermediate indicators. As a result, GoSL and the
Bank worked closely to revise the framework that led to some indicators being changed (or) dropped
and new intermediate indicators introduced. The M&E framework in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) provided for the monitoring and evaluation of six (6) PDO indicators and twenty
four (24) intermediate indicators. The revision of the M&E framework during the MTR resulted in
nine (9) intermediate indicators being changed, eight (8) indicators being dropped and five (5) new


                                                   11
indicators being introduced. As such, the revision of the framework resulted in the reduction of the
number of intermediate indicators from twenty four (24) to twenty one (20). This is a positive
reflection of the Bank’s team proactive approach towards implementation support.

40.      Implementation progress was monitored from project launch until the MTR using the original
framework as per PAD of May 14, 2009 and the revised M&E framework was used from March 2013
until project closure in July 2014.

41.      It is worth noting that at least two of the PDO indicators, one of which measured the impact of
public spending in key sectors, were partly validated by the results of the Public Expenditure Tracking
Surveys (PETS) carried out by GoSL. Data generated from PETS were instrumental in the
identification of areas for corrective action with regards to: (a) whether all essential facilities funded
during a particular period, including medical supplies and educational materials, actually reached the
intended beneficiaries; (b) proper distribution of essential drugs to health centers; (c) outcome of
payment of school fees subsidy; (d) distribution of textbooks to targeted primary schools; (e)
procurement and distribution of seed rice to farmers; (f) utilization of public resources at service
delivery facilities and civil works carried out by contractors in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of
schools. There were at least 2 surveys conducted during the project period.

42.      M&E implementation. The periodic monitoring and evaluation of the project had been
undertaken in a relatively satisfactory manner. The consistency between the overall PEFA
framework and the project’s Results Framework enabled component managers to more coherently
measure outcomes on a periodic basis based on agreed targets that were consistent with the PEFA
indicators. With regards to M&E data management, a focal person at the project administration unit
was appointed to collect, compile and analyze data received from various component managers of the
project.

43.     This arrangement helped ensure the timely compilation of M&E data for inclusion in the
Quarterly Progress reports that were shared with the Bank. Both the original and revised indicators
were closely monitored and progress assessed based on periodic targets throughout the project life.

44.     M&E Utilization. Project progress reports – prepared quarterly and annually - utilized the
information from the M&E framework to assess progress during the implementation period. Both the
original and revised frameworks were utilized effectively and provided data necessary to adequately
assess progress.

45.     In terms of data utilization, GoSL was able to measure progress more effectively and the Bank
was also able to recommend more focused corrective actions to facilitate/accelerate implementation.
Data was also useful in tracking and monitoring the impact of spending such as those generated by the
Public Expenditure Tracking (PET) surveys. PETS data allowed MoFED to identify areas of
improvement in budget formulation and execution. Two (2) PETS reports published in (October
2010 and September 2011) were both instrumental in the identification of mitigation measures to
correct systematic failures in financial programming and procurement of essential goods on service
delivery in key sectors such as health and education. Unfortunately, MoFED decided that the surveys
will no longer be done on an annual basis. The PETS exercise was not carried out in 2014.
Therefore, the surveys can no longer be considered a regular feature of the PFM monitoring system.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

46.     Financial Management. The project’s financial management risk was rated substantial at
appraisal. The risk was associated with the possible delays in disbursement by different contributing


                                                   12
partners that could undermine project implementation and increase transaction costs. The risk was
mitigated by the establishment of pooled funds under an MDTF agreement managed by the Bank and
close supervision by the Bank’s FM Specialist and provision of appropriate trainin g to the Project
Accountant in processing withdrawal applications electronically and real-time basis through “Client
Connection”. The task team also closely coordinated with the relevant DPs to help ensure timely
transfer of MDTF funds to GoSL. For the most part, project audits were carried out as stipulated in
the IDA Grant Agreement within the required deadline. Interim financial reports were prepared and
submitted by GoSL to the Bank on a relatively timely manner. At the Bank’s advice, MoFED also
modified the quarterly financial report formats by including the status of funds utilization by project
components as well as cash projection/forecast which helped improved financial planning and
accountability. These and other positive actions helped maintain the overall financial management
performance rating of “satisfactory” throughout the project period.

47.      Procurement. At appraisal, procurement risk was rated as “Moderate”. This risk rating
was based on the assessment that procurement capacity was weak and good practices were not yet well
established at project preparation stage. During the early part of the project, procurement
responsibility was vested in a central Project Administration Unit (PAU) within MoFED under the
supervision of the Director of PFM Reforms and overall purview of the Financial Secretary (FS). At
the early stage of project implementation, the central PAU procurement specialist handled IPFMRP
procurement tasks and was also responsible in building capacity of the MoFED procurement unit
especially in ensuring that agreed procedures were followed and requisite reports were submitted on
time. This arrangement was established to mitigate the procurement risk associated with compliance
with fiduciary requirements of the project. The person appointed to carryout IPFMRP procurement
tasks worked closely with component managers who were not fully familiar with the procurement plan
associated with their components. This procurement arrangement was interrupted when MoFED
proposed an Integrated Project Administration Unit (IPAU) that resulted in some changes of the
procurement arrangements. The proposed IPAU organizational set-up raised concerns from the Bank
that the alignment of functional responsibilities was not clear and could weaken internal control
mechanisms. The Bank, therefore, downgraded the IP rating to “Moderately Satisfactory”.
However, procurement fiduciary perspective remained “Satisfactory”. The IP rating was eventually
upgraded when GoSL agreed to mainstream the functions of project administration including
procurement. MoFED appointed a procurement officer within the civil service. However, the latter
was not fully knowledgeable in Bank’s procurement guidelines and encountered challenges. He was
eventually replaced by a relatively more skilled and well trained individual. This transition resulted
in delays in finalizing the 2012-13 procurement plan. In order to address this problem, GoSL
engaged an external consultant within the region but the appointment was short lived. The external
consultant arrived but worked only for a few days in Freetown to take another assignment. In order
to minimize further delays, the Bank recommended to mobilize an international consultant
immediately from its own sources. MoFED agreed and the latter visited Freetown in October 2013,
provided hands on training to the project’s procurement staff and assisted in finalizing the 2012-13
procurement plan in December 2013. The protracted delays in finalizing the procurement plan,
however, resulted in the downgrading of the procurement performance to “Moderately Satisfactory”
during the last ISM.

48.     Disbursement. The original credit amount of XDR 2.70 million (USD 4.00 million
equivalent) was approved by the Board on streamlined procedures on June 4, 2009, and it became
effective on December 15, 2009. As of September 3, 2014, the project disbursed XDR 2,699,752.19
(USD 4,161,701.10 historical equivalent) or almost 100% of the original grant amount. With respect
to the MDTF Grant, of the original grant amount of USD 17,445,566, USD 16,516,914.05 was
disbursed or 94.7% of the total grant. Approximately USD 946,743.38 (USD 362.85 of IDA and
USD 946,380.53 of MDTF) was cancelled.


                                                  13
49.     Environmental Assessment. The environment category of the project at appraisal was “C”
and therefore, there were no environmental or safeguards issues that had to be addressed.

 2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

50.     Two ongoing projects, the Pay and Performance Project (P128208) approved in May 31, 2012
and the Public Financial Management Improvement and Consolidation Project (P133424) approved on
November 27, 2013 continue to support the GoSL in pursuing its strategic agenda on PFM reform.
The objectives of these projects are linked to the IPFMRP. The development objective of the Pay
and Performance project is to improve competitiveness in pay, performance management and
accountability, and increase staffing of middle and senior staff in the civil service in Sierra Leone. The
development objective of the Public Financial Management Improvement and Consolidation Project is
to improve budget planning and credibility, financial control and accountability, and legislative and
public oversight management and use of government finances in Sierra Leone.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

51.      Relevance of Objectives. The objectives of the IPFMRP were to support GoSL in
sustainably improving the credibility, control and transparency of fiscal and budget management.
These objectives were relevant since the activities were developed in order to contribute to the
outcomes of the FY2010-13 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) related to improved strategic
orientation of the budget, transparency of resource envelope and allocation, accountability of spending
units, transparency and accountability of procurement and staffing. The project’s objectives were also
consistent with the GoSL’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-III) – the Agenda for Prosperity
(2013-2017) on governance particularly with respect to further decentralization to local government
and strengthening public financial management. It was also consistent with the Budget Submission to
Parliaments during the life of the project. The project’s PDO were monitored using indicators based on
the PEFA framework remained highly relevant from design to completion stage.

52.     The CAS Progress Report for the period FY2010-13 dated July 12, 2012 (CAS Report No.
69913-SL) assessed that while the CAS objectives and priorities remained fully relevant, important
adjustments were proposed in light of the significant changes in the country context and key lessons
learned. The changes proposed included: (a) continued support through measures like disseminating
the Citizens Budget, and contract monitoring activities; (b) continued provision of TA on
strengthening Public Investment Management capacity; (c) helping GoSL generate options for
managing the fiscal space; (d) effective use of revenues to deliver results by helping GoSL prepare
strong credible sector plans and expenditure frameworks in anticipation of rising domestic revenues;
and (e) putting emphasis on building capacity for improved governance and service delivery within
government and within civil society – in other words emphasizing both the ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ side
of good governance. All of these changes were appropriately addressed during the implementation of
the IPFMRP.

53.     Relevance of Design & Implementation. The design and implementation of the M&E
framework made project monitoring more effective in terms of assessing the degree to which the
project activities contributed to the achievement of the PDO. The M&E framework indicators were
designed to assess achievement of the PDO along three (3) dimensions, ‘Credibility’, ‘Control’ and
‘Transparency’.



                                                   14
54.      The project also supported GoSL’s key PFM reform initiative related to “Core PFM
components relating to budget management, accounting and transparency in the use of public funds”.
The support was provided through the implementation of activities under Components 1, 2 and 3.
Last but not least, the project provided technical support to budget decentralization and innovative
approaches (rather than pre-determined models) to Non-State Actor (NSA) oversight through
Component 4. These approaches included: (a) development of analytic and dissemination of capacity
of civil society and NSAs in exercising scrutiny over the use of public resources, as well as building a
constituency for PFM reforms; (b) more proactive, diverse and independent NSAs with support
mechanisms for sustainability; (c) improved access and flow of information between NSAs and MDAs
particularly at the district level; and (d) improved public transparency and accountability of
development activities, contributing to the enabling environment for good governance.

55.      The Bank in coordination with the DPs leveraged its experience as a lead and strategic partner
in supporting large scale capacity building programs, improved governance, accountability, and the
scale, efficiency, and responsiveness of public service delivery at national and local levels through an
incremental approach.

56.      The GoSL took action to bolster and mobilize revenue and strengthen PFM. The initiative
was fully supported by the project and was prompted by the need to maintain prudent borrowing
policies based on the projection by the IMF that growth would accelerate to 15.2% in 2012 to 13% in
2013 due to increased iron ore exports and solid growth in the non-mining sector. The GoSL,
therefore, was in a position to balance its budget in the medium term and undertake major reforms in
PFM to facilitate fiscal consolidation and better allocate and prioritize government resources. The
time was also propitious for better targeting of project investments and subsidies as a platform for
better service delivery to the most vulnerable social groups. The government acknowledged that
reforms in budget formulation and management, including greater emphasis on prioritizing spending
and delivering results, would require greater effort to improve public expenditure policy and
management. These factors led GoSL to start implementation of a renewed and wide-ranging PFM
improvement program. Several DPs agreed to provide technical and financial support for targeted
PFM actions in core budget support operations. To this end, the PFM regulatory framework was
updated and the process of making further revisions had commenced. Budgeting and treasury
management systems and processes also started to be strengthened.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57.         There were 6 PDO indicators and 20 intermediate results indicators (Table 2) that measured
the achievement of the project’s objectives. Of the 6 PDO indicators, 3 were fully achieved, 2 were
partially achieved and 1 was not achieved. Of the 20 intermediate indicators, 11 were fully achieved,
8 partially achieved and 1 not achieved. The following paragraphs provides a detailed analysis of level
of achievement according to the three PDO dimensions towards improving fiscal and budget
management: Credibility, Control and Transparency.

58.      Credibility. Three (3) of the six (6) PDO indicators assessed the achievement of the
‘Credibility” dimension of fiscal and budget management. The final targets for the “reduction in
variance in expenditure for the 20 largest budget heads” and “reduction of payment arrears” were fully
achieved. The first one was achieved through the effective implementation of the IFMIS system that
facilitated the issuance of various in-year budget execution reports by MDAs to inform on the use of
public resources in conformity with legal authorizations, as well as the balance of undisbursed
commitments and uncommitted resources. The second one was achieved after the successful


                                                  15
development of the Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) that provided a comprehensive framework
with which central authorities made more informed decisions in the financing of Government
operations over the medium term without endangering the overall fiscal position. The third PDO
indicator that measured “the increase in the share of actual to budgeted spending on pro-poor spending
priorities” was not achieved because the share of budgeted spending priorities compared to the ratio of
actual to budget expenditures for all other discretionary primary expenditures was 114.1% (poverty
actual budget) and 130.0% (other actual budget).

59.      Control. There was one (1) PDO and 12 intermediate results indicator that assessed the
achievement of the ‘Control’ dimension of fiscal and budget management. The indicator that
measured the timeliness of the submission of audited public accounts by the Auditor General to the
Parliament was fully achieved. This positive outcome was mainly due to the successful
strengthening of the capacity of Internal Audit Units in MDAs and effective support to internal
auditors across central government. Among other things, the capacity building support funded by the
project strengthened the ability of Internal Auditors in conducting review sessions that identified
issues and challenges faced that led to prompt action by relevant officials in addressing and resolving
these issues. With respect to payroll strengthening, system controls developed within IFMIS provided
hard budget control to ensure that spending did not exceed overall quarterly budget allocations – the
focus being to keep payments within approved limits. The Accountant General Department (AGD)
was able to produce monthly statements comparing approved budget with the total of the executed
budget and the outstanding contractual commitments. The central processing controls operated
within AGD – Other Controls Unit - did not allow the budget/cash limits to be exceeded.

60.     Transparency. Two (2) PDO indicators assessed achievement of ‘Transparency’ dimension
of fiscal and budget management. One indicator measured the increase in percentage of MDA
contracts in compliance with provisions of GoSL’s procurement legislation and regulations and the
second indicator measured the increase in the number of financial and procurement documents listed
in PEFA-10 published regularly. These indicators were both partially achieved. The indicator on
procurement compliance showed that only 89% against the final target of 95% of contracts were
signed using competitive bidding methods. It is worth noting, however, that despite the partial
achievement, the project funded activities that led to the revision of the National Public Procurement
Act 2004 and its subsequent approval by Cabinet. The revisions were based on recommendations of
the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) led by the Bank. The second indicator was
also partially achieved because only 4 of the 6 targeted documents were published.

Credibility
1. Reduce the variance in expenditure           x                                                    The variance between total actual primary expenditures and total
   for the 20 largest budget heads                                                                   originally budgeted primary expenditure was 7.9% against the
                                                                                                     target of 10%.
2. Reduce payment arrears (excluding            x                                                    Domestic expenditure arrears (total from all years) as % of total
   interest and donor-financed project                                                               expenditure for the year (excluding interest and donor-financed

61.      The project supported key PFM reform initiatives that led to the achievement of PDO
indicators related to the reduction in expenditure of several targeted MDAs, reduction of payment
arrears and timely audit of public accounts. However, it is recognized that public sector reform is a
huge undertaking that deserves a structured and phased approach. The project supported GoSL in the
strengthening its PFM mandate in some areas but the 2014 PEFA assessment highlighted that budget
credibility was still a serious weakness during the period 2010-2012 despite some demonstrated
improvements in 2013 (Table 3). For example, the PEFA assessment noted that inflated growth
estimates of 52% was used as the basis for planning expenditures in 2010, with the GoSL initiating
public investments from the government budget. These long term contracts resulted in over
expenditures, impacting negatively on aggregate financial discipline. Furthermore, on the domestic
side, there remained a tendency to over-estimate expected revenues relative to actual revenue and non-
transparent discretionary exemptions that led to the undermining of the tax base. Budget support
from donors had also not been predictable, although the cancelation of the IMF program in early 2013
did not impact negatively on donor support since the new IMF program was signed in October 2013.
Successes in IFMIS implementation, however, facilitated the control of commitments so that the
overhang of arrears that built up during the war was largely addressed. Whilst IFMIS provided a
significant number of system controls, there were continuing challenges on connectivity and frequent
loss of power which undermined some aspects of control. This and other weaknesses will be
addressed by the recently approved follow-on PFMICP operation and at the same time build upon the
positive achievements of the IPFMRP.

62.       The Audit Service of Sierra Leone (ASSL) had seen a significant increase in the coverage
of audit work performed from 69.3% in 2009 to 83.7% in 2013 on the 2012 Annual Statement. The
Audit Service had completed nine performance audits of which seven had been subjected to PAC
hearings. Performance audit had become a regular aspect of the external auditor’s scope. T he
Finance Committee carried out scrutiny function on the budget and the Public Accounts Committee on
audited accounts although delay in submission of the budget to the Finance Committee remained.
The submission on December 16, 2013 of the 2012 Accounts met the Auditor General’s constitutional
mandate to submit to Parliament the report on the accounts to the legislature within 12 months of the
end of the period covered. In addition, all of the Value for Money (VFM) reports undertaken by
ASSL were submitted to Parliament and subjected to PAC hearings.

63.       Other favorable outcomes worth mentioning include: (a) development of the Local
Governments Equitable Grants Distribution Formulae that provided clear and timely information on
allocations to each of the 19 local councils for each of the devolved services (although the timing of
transfers remained “reliably late”); (b) hiring of Budget, accounting, planning, procurement, and
administrative personnel in the 19 local governments; and (c) implementation of a simplified PFM
systems solution (PETRA). The support by local governments was the single most compelling
aspect in Sierra Leone’s quest for public sector reform. Another positive outcome worth noting
relates to the follow up on the monitoring of budget execution that was put in place and the regular
audit that was carried out on the local councils report. However, the focus of reporting was on the
use of the central government transfer, and not own resource revenues. A system for overseeing
fiscal risk from public enterprises was in place, but did not consider overall fiscal risk. Both national
leaders and external donors favored support to city and town councils that had been the most affected
by internal social conflict and strife and this represented a platform on which to build a sound
decentralized PFM reform.

3.3 Efficiency

64.      An Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for this project was not calculated since attempts to
determine an ERR was not useful for a technical assistance operation. In order to quantify some of
the direct and indirect benefits arising from the project interventions, the following results that led to
more efficient management and utilization of fiscal resources are being presented: (a) a substantial
reduction of over execution rate from 20% to 13% between the years 2012 and 2013 as a result of the
execution online of all expenditures as part of the IFMIS roll out; (b) successful elaboration by the
Revenue and Tax Policy Department of an Administrative Guideline on Tax Exemptions which set out
clear criteria for eligible individuals and companies that led to a reduction of fiscal losses by 23% in
2013; and (c) validation of personnel data using the IFMIS personnel Management module “CSM
Version 7.0” that resulted in the removal of 365 staff from the payroll due to late retirement status.




                                                                  21
65.      Efficiency in the use of project funds was achieved through the use of the least cost approach
in procurement of goods and best value for money in the hiring of consultants. Similarly, cost
efficiency of training activities were measured by approving in advance all training proposals on the
basis of a properly budgeted training plan and expensed in accordance with agreed unit rates for fees,
accommodation, travel and per diem. For local training, government guidelines were used and for
international training, the prevailing UNDP rates were used. This ensured cost efficiency in the use
of project funds. The Bank’s FM Specialist also closely monitored utilization of resources associated
with training activities.

66.      Unintended outcomes discussed earlier negatively affected project efficiency. The unplanned
retroactive financing of the FreeBalance contract caused delays in processing payments of the product
support and maintenance. It also affected MoFED’s ability to get technical support and additional
software licenses and delayed some of the rollout of the IFMIS. The second extension of the closing
date also led to the inability of GoSL to utilize the remaining MDTF funds of about US$0.9 million.
As explained earlier, the closing date could only be extended until July 31, 2014 since it was not
possible to process a longer extension because the time needed to formalize the administrative and
legal formalities of the MDTF Agreement was too short (see also Section 7).

67.     The actual cost for preparation, supervision and ICR preparation was US$1,056,195. The
cost estimated during appraisal for project preparation and supervision was US$1,265,356. The
actual cost was therefore 17% lower (US$209,161) than the cost estimated at appraisal. Furthermore,
the average annual cost of the IPFMRP is US$211,239. This amount is about 22% lower when
compared to the annual cost of US$258,581 of a similar project that closed in March 2014, the
Mauritania Public Sector Capacity Building Project’s (P082888). Given that the IPFMRP was also
extended for one year, the cost incurred to undertake the Bank’s support and oversight role was a
strong evidence of the effective use of Bank and donor resources.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.      This ICR rates the overall outcome rating as “Moderately Satisfactory.” based on the
assessment that while the relevance of the objectives, design and implementation was highly
satisfactory, the achievement of the PDO and efficiency/efficacy had moderate shortcomings.


69.      The project was implemented beginning with building foundations by doing an incremental
approach, starting with basics and focusing on priority areas and avoiding the risk of pursuing reforms
across a wide front, which could lead to the ineffective spreading of scarce resources. On the positive
end, however, it must be recognized that although the IDA contribution of US$4.0 million was
relatively small when compared to the US$16 million contributed by EU and DFID, the Bank had
successfully mobilized the additional resources and made a significant contribution to the effective
implementation support to GoSL’s PFM reform agenda.

70.    On balance, the project contributed to developing the foundations for further reform and
improving the ability of a wide variety of actors to manage complex change. However,
implementation problems related to planning, sequencing and alignment of outcomes emerged.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

71.       As explained earlier, the Project context was based on priority areas for PFM improvement
that were reflected in the Action Plan of the GoSL Poverty Reduction Strategy 2008-2012. The project
supported PFM and service delivery improvements through capacity building in ministries that are of
critical importance for achieving poverty reduction goals. In particular, achievement of the PDO was
based on the key indicator related to the share of actual to budgeted spending on pro-poor expenditure
priorities as reflected in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and the PSRP.

72.       Gender aspects had always been given due attention by GoSL especially in the
implementation of capacity building initiatives. Furthermore, although gender was not a specific
focus of the project, 22% out of the 280 officials that were awarded certification of merit during the
courses provided by Institute of Public Administration and Management (IPAM) were women. With
regards to social development aspects, the support to non-state actors under the project led to
broadened participation of civil society in its interaction with the state. Among other things, the
project supported strengthening of advocacy activities and dissemination of information on all aspects
of PFM at national and local government levels.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

73.      The project in itself included Sub-component 3.3 that supported capacity building activities
for technical FM staff across the government (including, inter alia, fiscal economists, budget and
planning officers, procurement officers, internal auditors, accountants and ICT officers) and the
capacity building of staff of NPPA and various units of MoFED to strengthen their specialized skills
and knowledge of state-of-the-art standards and practices. The Project also supported the capacity
building of non-state actors (NGOs, civil society and media groups) including their monitoring and
oversight functions of PFM. The institutional arrangement of the project included a project
administration and coordination team that was staffed partly by civil servants and LTAs. The project
provided funds to strengthen further the skills of members of the project unit with the goal to
institutionalize and mainstream its functions within government.

74.      The project helped the establishment of new government units and adoption of key functions
such as: (a) creation of the Human Resource Planning Directorate responsible for determining critical
staffing needs and formulation of the HR Plan and Budget of MDAs; (b) creation and staffing of a
Public Investment Management Division which is now integrated into the budget formulation,
execution and monitoring and evaluation processes; (c) establishment of a Procurement Cadre and
recruitment of Procurement Officers that were assigned to more than 30 MDAs and local councils; and
(d) establishment and strengthening of budget committees in all MDAs and District Budget Oversight
Committees (DBOCs) in 19 councils.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

75.      The cancellation of Sub-component 3.4 “Salary Support for MoFED Civil Service Staff”
funded by IDA and the MDTF (US$3.0 million, or 14% of the total project cost) was an unintended
outcome. This sub-component aimed to provide transitional funding for salaries of selected civil
service staff in MoFED to enable the establishment of sustainable human resource capacity for
performing key line functions of MoFED through the mainstreaming of donor-funded local technical
assistants (LTAs) performing key PFM functions into the civil service. The donor funded LTAs


                                                 23
made up 40% of the total staff of the MoFED and at the professional level (grades 7 and above)
significantly outnumbered the regular civil servants.4 It was cancelled because GoSL was unable to
meet the disbursement condition in the Grant Agreement within the stipulated deadline. GoSL
recognized the importance of retaining the LTAs to avoid possible disruption of PFM activities.
MoFED, therefore, used local funds to retain the services of these LTAs.

76.      Another unintended outcome pertained to the inability of GoSL to utilize all the resources
within the life of the project. Approximately US$0.9 million of the MDTF resources were
undisbursed because GoSL was unable to complete the procurement activities between the months of
March 2014, the first closing date extension, to July 2014, the second project closing date extension.
The closing date could only be extended for four months from March 2014 July 31, 2014, because
extending the closing date beyond July 31, 2014 required the approval of senior HQ officials of the
EU in Brussels and would have taken a relatively longer period of time to finalize. The extension
until July 31, 2014 could be approved by the local EU Office in Freetown. The project was,
therefore, extended only until July 31, 2014. Despite the Bank’s Task Team support to facilitate the
procurement approval process, GoSL was unable to implement all of the remaining procurement
activities.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

77.        The main risks are:

      a) Vested interests may oppose measures to tighten financial controls, introduce ICB-based PFM
         systems, and strengthen transparency in all areas of PFM and procurement. Such measures
         reduce the scope for rent-seeking and corruption;
      b) The incidences of low paid, under-facilitated and inadequately managed civil servants
         especially those in the PFM functions, may seek better opportunities elsewhere and erode the
         human resource capacity to sustain reform implementation;
      c) There is continued potential risk associated with delays in the processing of procurement
         actions can impair gains achieved under the project;
      d) The “temporary suspension” of FreeBalance (the proprietary owner of the IFMIS applications
         software) poses an attendant risk that progress in the GoSL’s IFMIS implementation may be
         undermined; and
      e) The ongoing review of the central finance functions in the MoFED could impair the design
         and quality of the coordination arrangements of the PFM Reform program.

78.     The Public Financial Management Improvement and Consolidation Project (PFMICP),
successor of IPFMRP, would adopt the following mitigation measures: (a) GAC action plan
particularly the demand side interventions would help mitigate the negative effects brought by rent-
seekers and corrupt individuals; (b) The “Public Sector Reform” strategy under the Pay and
Performance Project (P12808) will address HR related issues on PFM staffing; (c) strong collaboration
between the Bank’s TTL of the PFMIP and the implementing entities, as well as by ensuring that
qualified procurement professionals continue to serve the procurement requirements of the program;
(d) continued suspension of FreeBalance would be mitigated by securing financing from GoSL’s

  According to the report “Design of an Exit Strategy and Arrangements for Transitional DP Support for Remuneration of Contract PFM
Staff” (GHK in association with Positive Change HR Consultancy Services), of the approximately 70 staff in grades 7 and above, 39 were
DP-funded LTAs and 6 others were on the GoSL payroll making a total of 45 who were paid significantly higher than civil service salaries..



                                                                   24
domestic budget or other development partners to directly acquire additional licenses as well as cater
to the sustenance of the annual support and maintenance of the system and substitution with a new
application software funded partly by PFMICP and any other shortfall funded through ‘additional
financing’ although this is potentially an expensive option; and (e) while mainstreaming of overall
strategic coordination of the PFM reform at MoFED rests with the institutional and governance
arrangements designed under the follow-on project, PFMIP, GoSL confirmed that a strengthened
project management unit at MoFED will not be impacted by the proposed restructuring of the central
finance functions.

79.      Nevertheless, continued risks to the Development Outcome are considered substantial
due to the persisting fragile country context. Adoption of the mitigation measures will require
significant engagement from the Bank side to ensure adequate supervision and to maintain structured
flexibility during the implementation of the IPFMRP’s successor.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.      Quality at entry is rated “Moderately Satisfactory” for the following reasons. On the positive
side: (a) the project design applied a number of lessons drawn from experience in PFM and public
sector management reforms in other countries and the PFM reforms undertaken in Sierra Leone; (b)
the task team was composed of the right skills mix during preparation; (c) preparation was well
coordinated with development partners; (d) Bank support focused on the GoSL’s agenda and
priorities; (e) the Bank team correctly identified the need for appropriate institutional arrangements for
managing the reform process to ensure reforms are institutionalized and linked to a clear strategic
framework developed by GoSL with only limited input from the development community. However,
on the negative side and as explained earlier, despite reflecting the comments received from QER on
the formulation of the results framework (RF), the MTR mission still found that the RF was not fully
adequate and several indicators had to be revised.




                                                   25
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

81.     Visits were undertaken at least twice each year from December 2009 to July 2014 and this
allowed the task team to provide implementation support to relevant stakeholders. Although two (2)
different task team leaders (TTLs) led the project, the transition occurred in a relatively smooth
manner when the new TTL took over in December 2011.

82.     The task team provided prompt responses to procurement requests from the Project Director
and Component managers. The average period of response to requests for no-objections and review of
terms of references was five working days except when documents were incomplete and/or the
procedures used were not consistent with the agreed guidelines and therefore, took longer to process
than the norm of five working days.

83.     For the most part, the Bank’s team and its approach was pro-active, demonstrating flexibility
in addressing issues. The task team supported the GoSL towards achievement of developmental
impact in accordance with the agreed timetable for implementation of key activities that were
sequentially phased. Action oriented mission reports were prepared at the end of each mission and
the ISRs were frank with justifiable ratings.

84.     The MTR in June 2012 assessed progress and highlighted issues, as well as proposed
remedial actions that were agreed upon which led to more focused attention to resolution of priority
issues.

85.     The Bank’s task team was composed of technical experts that were qualified and possessed
experience in the various key areas of the project (i.e. accounting & budgeting, internal controls,
IFMIS & ICT, procurement, parliament, civil society & non-state actors and project management). As
such, the implementation support missions yielded very detailed and constructive recommendations
for reaching or meeting practical and beneficial results.

86.      The Bank closely coordinated with the DPs to ensure that relevant funds were mobilized and
transferred to GoSL in accordance with agreed modalities on the use of these funds. The Bank
provided the needed fiduciary oversight on the use of both the IDA and MDTF grants.

87.     Overall, the Bank was able to craft a constructive partnership with the Government that led to
an informed, relatively steady relationship over the medium term.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.     Given the “Moderately Satisfactory” rating for quality at entry and the satisfactory rating for
supervision, ICR guidance requires overall Bank performance to conform with the outcome rating,
which was “Moderately Satisfactory”.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                                  26
89.     The rating assigned in this ICR to the performance of the borrower is “Moderately
Satisfactory” for the following reasons.

    a)   Capacity building initiatives funded by the project were successfully implemented. Key
         officials from NPPA, Revenue and Tax Policy Division, Budget Bureau, Economic Policy
         and Research Unit, Internal Audit Department, NSA Secretariat, PFMRU, ICT Division,
         Public Debts Management Division, Multilateral Projects Division and Accountant
         General’s Department attended relevant courses within Sierra Leone and outside of the
         country during the project period. Approximately 290 officials across MDAs and Local
         Councils were also trained at the Institute of Public Administration and Management
         (IPAM) University of Sierra Leone in the areas of public procurement, internal audit,
         human resource management and administration;

    b)   The draft Citizens’ Budget 2014 that complied with international standards and deadline
         was prepared on time and published annually and the fact that non-state actors were
         financed by the GoSL from its resources was a case that deserves special recognition;

    c)   The disbursement condition associated with Sub-component 3.4 “Salary Support for
         MoFED Civil Service Staff” was not met. This resulted in the non-utilization of funds
         and cancellation of this sub-component from the project. Although the component was
         included under the Pay and Performance Project, implementation of this component could
         have contributed to more immediate results to the institutional strengthening objectives of
         the project;

    d)   The GoSL took full ownership and management of the project beginning in 2009 and
         managed it according to the agreed arrangements during project design. In 2011,
         GoSL proposed to transition to an Integrated Project Administration Unit (IPAU)
         that raised concerns with the Bank regarding the institutional arrangements of the
         project. Among other things, the proposal presented uncertainties related to non-
         alignment of functional responsibilities and possible risk of weakening the project’s
         internal control mechanisms.          Although GoSL subsequently adopted a
         mainstreamed administration unit that was agreed with the Bank, the time it took to
         formally adopt the arrangement resulted in delays in the implementation of some
         activities; and

    e)   Implementation rating was downgraded from “Satisfactory” to “Moderately
         Satisfactory” in May 2013 due to procurement delays and modest progress in the
         implementation of outstanding activities during the previous eight months. Most critical
         were the recurring delays in the approval of the Budgeting and Accountability Act and
         subordinate fiscal rules and debt regulations, the commissioning of an IFMIS Audit by an
         independent reviewer, and the lack of a MoFED IFMIS Strategy Plan inclusive of an ICT
         Security Policy. This rating remained unchanged until project closure due to the lack
         of progress in resolving these outstanding activities and overall domestic conditions and
         the fragile macroeconomic and fiscal situation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90.      Project management under the IPFMRP was rated “Moderately Satisfactory” for the most part
of the implementation period. The rating is based on the following:


                                                 27
    a)       The IPFMRP maintained the appropriate number of project staff (project management,
             procurement, financial management and monitoring and evaluation) for implementing the
             project. It was able to utilize effectively technical assistance that contributed to the
             achievement of deliverables. With adequate resources at hand, the IPFMRP was able to
             implement work plans and effectively meet its fiduciary requirements in relation to
             financial management, procurement and external audit. For the most part, financial
             records were maintained, annual external audits were commissioned on time and the
             reports were delivered to the Bank within the stipulated six months after the preceding
             financial year. Progress reports were also prepared and the Results Framework was
             managed annually in a timely manner and shared with the Bank and DPs;

    b)       The Project Director generally discussed project’s achievements and bottlenecks in
             coordinating the reform agenda with relative frankness and openness with both the Bank
             and the DPs;

    c)       Extended delays in the finalization of the 2012-2013 procurement plan resulted in undue
             delays in the processing of urgent procurement activities towards the end of the project;
             and

    d)       Overall, component managers were not fully familiar with the procurement plan
             associated with their components and this sometimes led to misunderstanding of the
             correct process and caused undue delays in procuring urgently needed goods and services.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.    Given the “Moderately Satisfactory” rating for the Government's performance and the
performance of the implementing agency, ICR guidance requires overall Borrower performance to
conform to the outcome rating of “Moderately Satisfactory”.

6. Lessons Learned

92.     Some key lessons learned can be drawn from the implementation of IPFMRP in Sierra Leone.
The following lessons could be useful for developing public sector projects in post conflict countries.

    a) The need to clearly understand the political economy and authorizing environment in
       the country and therefore adequately sequence the interventions.

              Fragile domestic conditions. The design underestimated the implementation challenges
               inherent in managing such a complex program. During project implementation, the
               IPFMRP faced challenges due to the fragile domestic conditions that affected fiscal
               stability and resulted in marginal progress in structural reform. This should be taken into
               account when designing similar operations in the future.

              Comprehensive planning framework. The project in retrospect lacked a more
               comprehensive planning framework, and consequently a sustained effort aimed to
               strengthen core PFM components is needed. PFM reform was the result of several
               interventions. The 2010-2012 PEFA Assessment stated that the government reform



                                                    28
                  agenda could have been aided with a more focused approach to strengthen the treasury
                  management system as well as other core financial management functions in the central
                  government. Also, the sequencing of the reform was at least lacking in the areas of
                  training, institutional capacity, ICT audit and legal and regulatory framework. It is
                  therefore, important to design similar future operations that strongly reflect sustained,
                  focused, well-sequenced, long-term approach embedded in the government reform
                  agenda.

                 Institutional weaknesses. An examination of the major donor interventions5 identified
                  the contributions to PFM reform and pointed to a number of institutional weaknesses
                  coming into view since its approval. Institutional weaknesses have emerged during the
                  agenda dialog about key areas of PFM reform not directly targeted by the IPFMRP.
                  Institutional constraints pertain to human resource management, tax administration, and
                  external audit. The lesson that can be learned from this experience is that needed PFM
                  reforms are pervasive and much larger than was previously recognized and should be
                  given due attention by developing mitigation measures to minimize the implementation
                  risks to future reform activities especially those projects funded by the Bank.

                 Adherence to proposed implementation plans. The interdependent nature of some of
                  the key PFM reform activities especially ICT-related necessitate the need for continued
                  enhanced collaboration amongst various agencies especially those engaged in IFMIS-
                  related functions. This was addressed through the PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2018 and
                  accordingly aligned in the PFMICP. Although, key inter-related Agencies including
                  MoFED, NRA, HRMO and ASSL have all been adequately provided for in the succeeding
                  PFMICP operations it is still necessary to ensure close monitoring so that the agreed
                  sequencing of the activities are adhered to. Mitigation measures also need to be put in
                  place to ensure adherence to proposed timing of the implementation of various activities
                  of the next stage of the PFM reform process.

                 Mainstreaming of LTAs. It is necessary to mainstream LTAs in the Ministry of
                  Finance and strengthen PFM units at the MDA level, improve the procurement system and
                  identify IT requirements. The accounting system, PFM's legal and regulatory base--all
                  are likely to require strengthening or change to mobilize the needed political will to move
                  the PFM system and agenda beyond the core level. These are valuable lessons that could
                  be applied in similar projects and more importantly should be taken into account during
                  the implementation of the successor project, the PFM Improvement and Consolidation
                  Project. PFM reform needs a solid platform before moving on to more advanced reforms.

                 Effective and efficient leadership. The establishment of the PFM Reform Directorate
                  within MoFED and appointment of a civil servant as Director has ensured that PFM
                  reform receives the level of authority and attention it requires under the supervision of the
                  Office of the Financial Secretary. The complex and challenging reforms embarked upon
                  during the IPFMRP straddling various MDAs (including HRMO, NPPA and Parliament)
                  and all nineteen local councils received the due attention through the effective and
                  efficient leadership of the PFM Directorate. This has been seen as critical in advancing
                  PFM reforms as recognized in the PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2017 which mandates that

5
     Among the relevant projects are the AFDB’s Economic Governance Reform Program II (UA10M), World Bank’s Dece ntralized Service
    Delivery Program II’s Component 2 (Capacity Development and Technical Assistance to Strengthen LCs and MDAs Capacity, US$3M)
    and Component 3 (Results and Social Accountability, US$4.1M), EC Support to Civil Service Reform Program (EUR 15.7M) and the
    World Bank’s Pay and Performance Project (US$17M), among others.



                                                                  29
       the Director PFM Reform shall have overall responsibility for coordination and
       Monitoring & Evaluation of the PFM Reform. This institutional arrangement should be
       replicated in future similar PFM operations.

b) The need to focus on capacity development during reform implementation in order to
   secure adequate sustainability

      Knowledge of financial and procurement arrangements. There is the need for sound
       understanding of IDA's financial management practices especially procurement guidelines
       by all components associated with operations of the Project. Key to this is a strengthened
       Procurement Unit with vast knowledge of IDA procurement and financial management
       rules which must in turn be cascaded to the respective implementing agencies through
       well-structured capacity building initiatives. This facilitates project implementation and
       eliminates challenges encountered midstream resulting from weak knowledge of IDA
       fiduciary rules. It is, therefore, important that the World Bank team continue to provide
       capacity building support to relevant GoSL staff especially when new guidelines are
       introduced.

      Capacity building of NSAs. The establishment of a NSA Secretariat in MoFED and
       appointment of a NSA Coordinator has created the space for NSAs to engage officials of
       MoFED and other PFM agencies including oversight bodies such as ASSL and
       Parliament. The introductory training afforded these NSAs on core PFM issues and
       subsequent release of grants to qualifying organizations has increased awareness and
       aroused their interests on PFM matters. This has ultimately improved the engagement
       between State and NSAs in addressing PFM issues including those at the service delivery
       level of local councils. Introductory training needs to be sustained and formally adopted
       as a pre-condition to the Grant scheme.

c) The need to look at technical complexities particularly in the ICT aspects of the reform
   program

      Comprehensive and targeted medium-term capacity building strategy and work
       plan. A comprehensive and targeted medium-term capacity building strategy and work
       plan must be developed in order to provide the basis for core annual budget and
       procurement processes and subsequent program implementation centrally and to local
       levels. The lack of this type of strategy seriously affected the ICT/IFMIS planning and
       management, as there was no (i) long-term ICT strategy, (ii) proper institutional
       arrangement, and (iii) fully functional ICT security policy supporting PFM reform. A
       long-term ICT strategic plan aligned with the government objectives for its IFMIS needs
       to be in place for effective planning, management and would help identify the most
       critical IFM infrastructure requirements to be met before moving to reforms beyond the
       core. Moreover, it is critical to put in place a government-wide information security
       policy approved by an appropriate government body and reviewed on a periodic basis to
       accommodate new requirements.

      Combining PEFA based indicators with other relevant dimensions. Three PEFA
       assessments have been completed during the implementation of the project (2007, 2010,
       and 2014) and evidence of some positive developments in a number of key dimensions
       collected through PEFA assessments. However, existing indicators heavily relied on
       measuring the budget performance (plans / actuals) and controls based on the reports



                                            30
             (mostly generated from IFMIS and other sources). These may not be adequate to
             monitor all expected outcomes (regular publication of results/contracts, usefulness of
             citizens’ budget, feedback from NSAs, etc.). The same pattern is visible in the new
             IFMIS project as well. Assessment of similar future IFMIS operations could benefit
             from combining PEFA based indicators with other relevant dimensions to measure citizen
             participation and accountability aspects as well.

      d) The need to build well-articulated coalitions both within stakeholders in government,
         beneficiaries and donor community

            More frequent joint meetings. The integrated approach adopted by Government and
             key budget support partners towards addressing PFM reform issues helped create the
             platform for a more coordinated approach in strengthening public financial management.
             This has been further strengthened through the establishment of the PFMICP which is also
             supported by the key budget support partners in achieving the objectives outlined in the
             National PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2017. There is the need for more frequent joint
             meetings of GoSL representatives and Development Partners (DPs) supporting PFM
             Reform to facilitate improved collaboration and avoid duplication of PFM support by
             DPs.

            Integrated legislative agenda. PFM reform is an ongoing effort that needs consistent
             management with responsibility shared across reform areas. The PFM reform program is
             meant to be a living document that should be updated annually at a minimum, planned
             with a medium term view, supported by lawmakers by means of an integrated legislative
             agenda, steered by a focal group of decision makers and regulators, and implemented by a
             team of committed task leaders. IPFMRP sought the active participation of national and
             local authorities, including non-state actors. The intention was to execute it on behalf of
             the government through a dedicated PFM Reform Unit, with adequate targeted
             interventions from donors but among other things, the inability of GoSL to update the
             program annually and the lack of an integrated legislative agenda affected sequencing of
             project activities. Future reform activities, therefore, need to consider better sequencing,
             narrowing the reform to core financial management functions as a priority, and then
             deployment of planning and policy bodies and sector line agencies based on assessed
             capacity with subsequent capacity transferred to other MDAs and LCs.

            Medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). Institutional weaknesses were also
             identified within IPFMRP that will require improved coordination by the government. The
             medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), whose purpose was to enhance financial
             planning and monitoring, was not linked to a medium-term performance framework
             (MTPF). This will require strengthening institutional linkages within MOFED to enable
             synchronization of programs and results structures, and improved flow of financial and
             non-financial data. Capacity building in the use of MTEF will require a continued and
             sustained effort from MDTF donors.

                                                   was too short to implement the remaining activities, GoSL submitted a request to
                                                   further extend the closing date to July 31, 2014. In early March, 2014, a project
                                                   restructuring was initiated for the US$2.5 EU supplemental contribution and the
                                                   closing date extension until July 31, 2014. Unfortunately, despite the extension,
                                                   GoSL was still unable to utilize all the remaining resources. The closing date
                                                   could not be extended beyond July 31, 2014 because of the limitations on time
                                                   associated with the legal formalities of the MDTF Agreement.

results provides enhanced explanatory value in support of the project rating.

2.      Component 1 - Strengthening Macro-fiscal Coordination and Budget Management.
Objective: Improved budget credibility associated with a more appropriately developed and
managed aggregate fiscal position, delivery by the MoFED of predictable funding in accordance
with budgets, constrained MDA budgets and control of the in year position contributing to Platform
1 objectives, and improved strategic prioritization contributing to Platform 2 objectives. The
component financed consulting services, vehicles, and office equipment. Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.       Sub-component 1.1 – Macro-fiscal Management and Budget Formulation.
Outcomes/Results: Objective: Replacement of the overly-complex and detailed multi-year budgeting
that existed during the early part of the project through the establishment of a credible and policy-
oriented budget process through, inter alia: (i) the development of a macro-economic and fiscal
framework incorporating realistic aggregate fiscal estimates; (ii) the development of improved
procedures and the building of capacity for revenue forecasting by MOFED; (iii) the establishment
of expenditure ceilings through the medium term expenditure framework; (iv) the design and
implementation of arrangements for transparency and participation in the budget formulation
process; (v) the strengthening of the strategic planning capacity of MDAs; and (vi) the
strengthening of aid policy and management processes. The formulation of the budget on the basis of
a robust fiscal framework, with realistic revenue forecasts, was linked to the achievement of
Platform 1 objectives.

4.       Highlights of Results & Outcomes:

        Budget Framework paper now developed as part of the budget process and MDAs now
         prepare their budget in accordance with MTEF guidelines.
        New macroeconomic forecasting model-Sierra Leone Integrated Macroeconomic Model
         (SLIMM) has been introduced and training conducted for key forecasting staff within
         MoFED, National Revenue Authority and Statistics of Sierra Leone
        Budget Committees established in MDAs and Local Councils are trained on Strategic
         Planning and Forecasting.
        Medium Term Debt Strategy developed incorporating policy on public debts and guarantees.
        Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) updated regularly.
        Aid Policy developed for Sierra Leone and District Working Groups established and trained.
        Cash Management Committee established in MoFED.

5.      The Annual Economic Assessment Surveys by the Economic Policy and Research Unit
(EPRU) that was geared towards the development of a macroeconomic and fiscal framework that
incorporated realistic aggregate fiscal estimates was successfully completed.               Capacity
enhancements of EPRU staff resulted in the production of relatively higher quality forecasts. A
Mining Revenue Forecasting Model that forecast mining output, mining exports and mining
revenues was successfully developed with the IMF. The model was subsequently integrated with
the SLIMM model that produced more comprehensive and realistic resource forecasts. Other
achievements of EPRU were the following: (a) A Macro-fiscal unit in EPRU and Cross-Government
Steering Group were established; (b) A macro-economic model that provided MoFED with accurate
forecasts of key macro-fiscal indicators such as GDP, inflation, exchange rate, government revenues,



                                                 34
as well as non-discretionary expenditure and financing terms was developed; (c) GDP data provided
by Statistics of Sierra Leone and IMF was harmonized; (d) The SLIMM model with the new series
was updated; and (e) The Freetown based CPI and national CPI was harmonized. The forecasts
generated by the model provided a strong basis for discussions on the medium-term outlook with the
IMF review missions under the ECF program.

6.       The Revenue and Tax Policy Department (RTPD) prepared and submitted to Cabinet
Secretariat the Finance Bill 2012 and a Statutory Instrument for revision of taxation rates for MDAs.
RTPD led and provided the Secretariat for the Mining Revenue Forecasting Team guidance in
utilizing the IMF Model and provided training on the calculations of new taxes in the draft of the
Extractive Industry Revenue Bill (EIRB). It actively participated and continued to be involved in
mining contract negotiations. Another notable outcome was the successful elaboration by RTPD of
an Administrative Guideline on Tax Exemptions which set out clear criteria for eligible individuals
and companies. These efforts led to a reduction of fiscal losses by 23% in 2013.

7.      On budget formulation, the Budget Bureau (BB) championed the revision of the MTEF
Guidelines and their implementation as part of the efforts to strengthen the 2014-15 budget
formulation process. The introduction of the revised Chart of Accounts and the transitioning to
Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB) helped improve budgetary planning and performance monitoring.
Another notable outcome was the printing of the Citizens Budget Handbook that was distributed and
disseminated nationwide to relevant stakeholders in the regions and local government.
Participatory discussions for MTEF 2012-2014 budget were held and actions were taken to educate
the general citizenry about the key budget objectives, its benefits, and specific roles they can play in
budget monitoring and implementation especially service delivery at the local level.

8.      The Development Assistance Coordination Office (DACO) organized and successfully
conducted two (2) Development Partnership Committee (DEPAC) meetings in March and July 2013.
The meetings created more meaningful partnership and dialogue between GoSL and international
development agencies. With 40% of capital expenditures being funded by foreign aid, DACO, PIM
Unit and the Budget Bureau recognized that it would pursue further the development of a
methodology to align the planning and budgeting of externally-funded programs and projects and
prevent any error or inefficiency in the process of recording and reporting development aid data.

9.       The Local Government Finance Department (LGFD) within MoFED carried out activities
that led to LGFD’s ability to more effectively manage the fiscal decentralization process in Sierra
Leone. Financial reports, technical progress reports, M&E and internal audit reports were prepared
and submitted in a relatively timely manner. Furthermore, quarterly transfers were more
predictable and annual local council budgets were more consistent with sectoral national goals.

10.      Sub-component 1.2 - Budget Execution. Objective: Development of a more realistic
budget in 1.1 above provided the basis for 1.2 to establish a predictable budget execution process
through, inter alia: (i) the design and implementation of improved MOFED procedures for cash
forecasting, cash management and quarterly releases; (ii) the streamlining and implementation of
commitment control procedures for all central government expenditures; and (iii) the strengthening
of the budget execution capacity of the MDA budget committees. These were all Platform 1 activities.

11.    A Cash Management Committee that met weekly was established under the leadership of
MoFED, in collaboration with AGD and BoSL. A Public Financial Management Act and fiscal
rules were drafted. MoFED also promoted awareness amongst relevant stakeholders about the
importance of restraint in the growth of non-essential expenditure and prevention of serious overruns
when executing investments. Based on the data presented in Table 1, it can be deduced that


                                                  35
MoFED successfully raised awareness since the budget over execution rate decreased to 13% from
above 20% on average during 2010-12.

12.      A Public Investment Management (PIM) Unit was formally established in November 2013
by PIP Regulation dated June 27, 2012. The project successfully funded the capacity building of
the PIM unit that: (a) improved guidance from MoFED on the design and costing of domestic capital
projects; (b) capacitated MDAs on the design and costing of domestic capital projects; (c) planned
future MoFED-led PIM reforms for 2014-15; and (d) capacitated the Director on other country
reforms via South-South peer learning. It is expected that the PIM Unit will continue to eventually
evolve into a well-functioning unit by virtue of the capacity building funds provided under the
project.

13.      Sub-component – 1.3 – Debt Management. Objective: Development of an improved
legal, policy and institutional framework for sustainable debt management through, inter alia: (i) the
development of a policy on the criteria and limits regarding the government’s public debts and
guarantees; (ii) the adoption and implementation of a plan to reduce the stock of domestic debt and
expenditure arrears; (iii) the strengthening of MOFED’s debt database; (iv) the drafting of revisions
to relevant legal instruments governing debt management; (v) the establishment of a system for
regular analysis of the fiscal position and risks arising from state-owned enterprises; and (vi) the
setting-up of mechanisms for cross-government coordination on debt management policy and
analysis. Strengthening data on debt for cash management purposes and reducing the stock of
arrears were priorities for Platform 1.

14.     Various positive actions were undertaken by MOFED in the domain of public debt
management. A national Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) was developed in collaboration
with the World Bank, IMF, West African Institute for Financial and Economic Management
(WAIFEM) and Public Debt Management Division (PDMD).                    The MTDS provided a
comprehensive framework with which central authorities made more informed decisions in the
financing of Government operations over the medium term without endangering the overall fiscal
position. The PDMD also facilitated the completion of a follow-up survey of contingent liabilities in
Local Councils and State-Owned Enterprises and the issuance of an annual debt bulletin. The CS-
DRMS database was reallocated from Bank of Sierra Leone to the PDMD. PDMD officials had
been trained in the use of the CS-DRMS. System administration support provided by BSL and
MOFED resulted in the regular updating of debt transactions, issuance of flash reports and proper
monitoring.

15.    Component 2 – Reinforcing Key Aspects of the Control System to Support Improved
Service Delivery. Objective: Development of an updated legal framework, robust public
procurement practices, tightened payroll controls, strengthened internal audit, improved accounting
procedures in the MoFED and MDAs and further publication of Public Expenditure Tracking Survey



                                                            36
(PETS) contributing to an effective control environment in MDAs. Strengthened scrutiny of public
finances by Parliament was expected to reinforce internal controls. More effective internal controls
were designed to support Platforms 1 and 3. This component financed consulting services, vehicles,
office equipment, and workshop.
Rating: Satisfactory.

16.       Highlights of Results & Outcomes:

         A Draft PFM Bill had been approved by Cabinet. The Bill provides for the introduction of a
          Treasury Single Account, Revenue Resource Management including the establishment of a
          Transformational Development Fund and management of fiscal risk amongst others. Once
          enacted, it shall secure the prudent, efficient, effective, and transparent use of public
          financial resources throughout the public sector. It will replace the Government Budgeting
          and Accountability Act 2005.
         A Draft Bill to revise the National Public Procurement Act 2004 had also been approved by
          Cabinet. This incorporates recommendations from the Country Procurement Assessment
          Review (CPAR) led by the World Bank.
         The Financial Administration Regulations for the Local Government Act 2004 had been
          drafted and agreed upon by key local government stakeholders and had been forwarded to
          the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development for onward submission to
          Cabinet.
         A Public Debts Management Law which lays out the framework for public sector borrowing
          and debts management was enacted by Parliament in 2011. Regulations for this Law had
          been drafted and submitted to the Office of the Solicitor General for final review prior to
          submission to Cabinet.
         Websites of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development8 and The National Public
          Procurement Authority 9 (NPPA) were revamped, publishing key fiscal, financial and
          procurement information.
         Procurement had been institutionalized in MDAs, through the establishment of a
          Procurement Cadre. Procurement Officers had been recruited and assigned to more than 30
          MDAs and all 19 Local Councils who now undertake day to day procurement activities of
          MDAs and local councils. These officials have received extensive training on procurement
          methods and operations useful in carrying out their functions. Approximately 90% of
          contracts across government above the $100,000 threshold in 2013 used open competition
          method.
         In strengthening records management at the Accountant General's Department (AGD),
          Records Management Manuals10 were developed for the AGD and training conducted for
          Stores and Records Officials of the AGD. A New Accounting Manual covering all
          operations of the Accountant General’s Department (AGD) had also been developed. This is
          also utilized by Accounting Officers assigned to MDAs.
         Major progress in the introduction of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) in Government to
          enhance effective cash planning and management, and ultimately reduce borrowing costs.
          Survey of all bank accounts operated across MDAs has been conducted and opening of
          further bank accounts rationalized. The infrastructure to facilitate the smooth operation of
          the TSA is now being put in place and a Cash Management Unit established in the AGD.
         Verification and validation of civil service employees undertaken resulting in the removal of
          obsolete names from the payroll.

       Internal Audit had been strengthened through the recruitment of various levels of staffing
        across the Internal Audit Cadre assigned to MDAs. From an initial seven MDAs prior to the
        IPFMRP, Internal Audit Units were established in thirty seven MDAs by the completion of
        the Project. All nineteen local councils too now have Internal Auditors in post. These
        Internal Auditors further received extensive training both locally and internationally in
        various aspects of internal audit work. Audit Committees had also been established in MDAs
        and Local Councils and training provided for the members respectively.
       There is now increased oversight and scrutiny of public finances by Parliament executed
        through the Parliamentary Finance Committee (PFC), Public Accounts Committee (PAC)
        and Transparency & Accountability Committee (TAC). The reviews which are usually open
        to the public are now organized regionally covering MDAs, local councils and school
        authorities. Backlogs of audited public accounts were cleared by the PAC including
        performance audit reports submitted by the Auditor General. Extensive capacity building
        support had been afforded Members of the respective Committees and the clerks assigned
        thereof. These included exchange visits to UK Parliament and other Parliaments in Sub-
        Saharan Africa and attendance at regional meetings.

17.     Sub-component – 2.1 – Legal and Regulatory Framework. Objective: Updating of the
legal and regulatory framework that was substantially revised in 2005. Drafting of revisions to key
legal instruments governing public financial management, including revisions to the GoSL’s
Government Budgeting and Accountability Act of 2005 and the Financial Management Regulations
of 2007, and finalization and dissemination of local government financial administration
regulations.

18.     The drafting of the revisions of the following key legal instruments governing public
financial management was completed: (a) Government Budgeting and Accountability Act (2005); (b)
Financial Management Regulations (2007); (c) Procurement Act (2005); (d) Debt Regulations
(2011); and (e) Local Government Financial Administration Regulations.

19.      Sub-component – 2.2 – Public Procurement. Objective: Strengthening of MDAs’
capacity and practices in public procurement through, inter alia: (i) the drafting of revisions to the
legislation, regulations and standard bidding documents governing procurement; (ii) the
development and adoption of a plan for full application of transparency and monitoring
arrangements by NPPA; and (iii) the strengthening of the capacity of MDAs to carry out
procurement in accordance with the applicable legal framework and procurement plans.

20.     The drafting of the revised Public Procurement Act (PPA) had been completed after
extensive consultation and discussion with stakeholders and several pre-cabinet sensitizations.
Other achievements were: (a) The public procurement legal framework documents were revised; (b)
Specific standard bidding documents (SBDs) for Information Technology (IT) and health were
developed; (c) The Arbitration Act for Sierra Leone was drafted; (d) The National Public
Procurement Authority (NPPA) website was updated and upgraded; (e) Regular compliance
monitoring and follow-ups on MDA/Local Councils was implemented and compliance of selected
MDAs and Local Councils (about 5 of the 6 planned compliance monitoring) were carried out; (f)
The 2012 procurement compliance and performance assessment was completed; (g) The 2010 price
norm to reflect current market trends was updated; (h) Cabinet ministers, Parliamentarians and Local
Councils chairmen, mayors and councilors were sensitized and trained on the existing PPA and the
proposed amendments of the 2004 PPA; and (i) An annual Procurement Forum was implemented.
Procurement Planning workshops were also carried out by NPPA in collaboration with the Public
Financial Management Reform Unit, Budget Bureau, and the Accountant General’s Department.
The workshops included a procurement plan validation exercise that served as a platform for


                                                 38
reaching out to MDAs and ensuring that all procurement plans were realistically linked to the
approved budget and were also received on time.

21.      Sub-component – 2.3 – Accounting, Recording and Reporting. Objective: Further
improvement of the quality and maintenance of the timeliness of financial accounting, recording and
reporting through, inter alia: (i) the re-design and documentation of accounting processes by the
AGD in line with the IFMIS; (ii) the introduction of stores and asset management systems; (iii) the
introduction of improved procedures for the management of accounting records; and (iv) the
establishment of requirements for improved financial reporting by various parastatal and public
agencies and in respect of donor-funded projects.

22.     The frequency and timeliness of financial reporting had improved. MoFED also enhanced
the quality of accounting and reporting in response to the performance monitoring needs set forth in
the Agenda for Prosperity. The IFMIS system had facilitated the issuance of various in-year budget
execution reports by MDAs to inform on the use of public resources in conformity with legal
authorizations, as well as the balance of undisbursed commitments and uncommitted resources. An
Accounting Procedures Manual that integrated transactional flows and public accounts across
government, including those related to Cash and Banks, Human Resources and Payroll, General
Purchasing and Stores had been developed. A Treasury Single Account (TSA) policy framework
paper had been drafted. Sensitizations to various stakeholders were held and internal consultative
process for the most feasible option was undertaken.

23.     Sub-component – 2.4 – Payroll Strengthening. Objective: This was an ongoing sub-
component from the IRCBP that aimed to improve the management and control of personnel
spending through, inter alia: (i) the roll-out of the personnel management (Human Capital
Accountability (HCA)) component of the IFMIS; and (ii) the development of improved medium-term
budgeting for civil service payroll costs as part of the budget preparation process.

24.      The upgrading of the IFMIS personnel management module (CSM version 7.0) was
completed and targeted personnel were trained on its proper use. A comprehensive Manpower Plan
and Budget was developed for MDAs as part of the 2013 budget planning process. HR Planning
and Budgeting training of about 65 newly recruited HR Managers and Officials in the preparation of
the FY2014 budget cycle was successfully implemented. Validation of personnel data in the CSM
system was undertaken and this action resulted in the removal of 365 staff from the payroll due to
late retirement status. Manpower Plan and Budget Hearings were organized for the civil service
that enabled the determination of critical staffing needs across MDAs. A five-day retreat was
conducted where information on the planned HR resources were compiled and costed. The retreat
produced a proposal of a comprehensive manpower and payroll component of the budget for the
MTEF period 2013-2015 that was submitted to Parliament as planned.

25.     Sub-component – 2.5 – Other Aspects of Internal Control. Objective: Establishment
of improved internal audit functions in MOFED and other MDAs, and support for the
implementation of the PETS through, inter alia, (i) the capacity building of internal audit staff of
MOFED and other MDAs; (ii) the creation and capacity building of MDA audit committees; and (iii)
the support for timely publication of PETS reports.

26.     The capacity of Internal Audit Units (IAUs) in MDAs was strengthened through capacity
building funds provided by the project. The internal auditors across central government were also
supported through review sessions where issues and challenges faced were addressed and
recommended actions communicated to relevant officials. At the local level, seven (7) Local
Councils (LCs) have formed Internal Audit Committees (IAC). Mentoring and coaching exercises


                                                39
were given to all Local Councils IACs for reviewing the efficiency and effectiveness of local council
finance operations. Training on audit techniques were successfully completed for about 100
internal auditors on both central government and local councils. The Public Expenditure Tracking
Survey (PETS) for October 2010/September 2011 was published in the MOFED website in the
second quarter of 2013.

27.     Sub-component – 2.6 – Reinforcing Controls through Parliamentary Oversight.
Objective: Strengthening of the capacity of the members and support staff of the budget and
finance committee and the public accounts committee of the GoSL’s Parliament to analyze budgets
and audit reports and exercise oversight on the use of public resources.

28.      Training funds provided under the project strengthened the capacity for Parliamentary
oversight. In particular, members of the Parliamentary Accounts Committee were better able to
exercise oversight responsibilities especially with respect to the conduct of the hearings with MDAs
and Local Government and Schools on the Auditor General’s reports for 2011 and 2012. The
Parliamentary Finance Committee and the Transparency and Accountability Committee has also
visited local councils and MDAs and, among other things, raised awareness on the need for better
oversight and capacity support from MoFED (and by extension the Ministry of Local
Government and Rural Development) to improve accounting and financial reporting practices at
local government level.

29.     Component 3 – Strengthening Central Finance Functions. Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory. Key achievements under this component are described below.

30.      Sub-component – 3.1 – Financial Management Information Systems. Objective:
Implementation of various cross-cutting activities including IFMIS rollout, all aspects of training
and human resource (HR) capacity development that are required to support the main PFM
functions that are being strengthened in the other components and other steps to help establish
sustainable HR capacity in the MoFED. This component financed consulting services, vehicles,
office equipment, IT equipment, training, study tours, salaries, and workshops.

31.       Highlights of Results & Outcomes:

         Roll out of the Treasury, Purchasing and HR functions of the IFMIS – FreeBalance Financial
          Package has been rolled out to 12 key spending MDAs.
         Petra Accounting Package introduced (same chart of accounts consistent with Central
          Government) and rolled out to all local councils.
         Yearly Financial Statements for local councils are now produced timely in accordance with
          Cash Basis International Public Sector Accounting Standards.

32.     IFMIS had been rolled out to 12 of the 16 targeted MDAs. The IFMIS disaster recovery
site (DRC) that was identified for the reliable offsite backup system for the IFMIS was refurbished.
The personnel management aspect of Civil Service Management module was rolled out to all of the
3 targeted MDAs. Petra Accounting Package was rolled out to all of the 19 targeted local councils.
Local councils are now able to formulate their budgets in accordance to the 27-digit Chart of
Accounts adopted by central government and uploaded to the Petra Accounting Software.

34.    Sub-component – 3.2 – ICT.              Objective:    Strengthening of ICT planning and
management through, inter alia: (i) the setting-up of a structure and function within MOFED to
support ICT systems development and maintenance in MOFED and other MDAs; (ii) the
development of an ICT policy; and (iii) the timely maintenance and updating of MOFED’s website.

35.     The ICT Department was formally established in January 2010. All ICT activities across
MoFED are now vested to one organizational unit. This means that ICT Department became
responsible for supporting ICT systems development and maintenance in MoFED and other MDAs.
In general, the establishment of the ICT Department led to improvements in the overall reliability
and availability of ICT services. The IFMIS implementation audit and development of an ICT
strategy had been undertaken. The exercise was completed towards the end of the project, The
strategy would be the basis for determining the optimum way forward for MoFED in its proposed
and future investments in computing and communications infrastructure and would also shape
MoFED’s ICT investment and operations strategy for the coming years. The report of the
consultant will be shared through the Bank’s follow-up project. The Disaster Recovery/Business
Continuity aspect of the project was implemented. MoFED signed a lease for the DRC site and the
site was prepared and equipment purchased, delivered, installed and tested.

36.      Sub-component – 3.3 – Organizational Strengthening and PFM Capacity Building.
Objective: Development of PFM capacity through the provision of: (i) general professional
training for technical PFM staff across government (including, inter alia, fiscal economists, budget
and planning officers, procurement officers, internal auditors, accountants and ICT officers); and
(ii) specific training for staff of NPPA and various units of MOFED (including, inter alia, the budget
bureau, the Accountant General’s Department, the debt management unit, the revenue and tax policy
unit, the internal audit unit, and the units in charge of IFMIS and ICT) to meet specialized skills
needed to achieve Project objectives.

37.      Key officials from NPPA, Revenue and Tax Policy Division, Budget Bureau, Economic
Policy and Research Unit, Internal Audit Department, NSA Secretariat, PFMRU, ICT Division,
Public Debts Management Division, Multilateral Projects Division and Accountant General’s
Department attended relevant courses within and outside the region during the project period. The
comprehensive PFM training program conducted by the Institute of Public Administration and
Management (IPAM) University of Sierra Leone resulted in the capacity building and award of
certificates to approximately two hundred ninety (290) officials across MDAs and Local Councils in
the areas of public procurement, internal audit, human resource management and administration.

38.     Sub-component – 3.4 – Salary Support for MOFED Civil Service Staff. Objective:

Integrated Project Administration Unit (IPAU) within the Directorate of PFM Reforms. The IPAU
was headed by a Project Director who reported directly to the Financial Secretary and met regularly
with component managers and managed and coordinated the implementation of the various activities
according to the agreed work plan and procurement plan. IPAU was staffed with mainstreamed
civil servants who were responsible for the procurement fiduciary, financial controls and reporting
and monitoring and evaluation aspects of the project throughout the project period.

Introduction

1.       Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) has been taking steps to improve its financial management
practices over the years based on various diagnostic studies. A Country Profile Financial Accountability
(CPFA) assessment was conducted in December 2001 and a Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) was completed in March 2002.The European Commission (EC) conducted an audit resulting in a
matrix of corrective measures to be undertaken by the Government. Heavily Indebted Poor Countries -
Assessment and Action Plan (HIPC-AAP) was conducted in February 2004 in which sixteen key
indicators were reviewed with each ranked A, B or C according to pre-determined criteria. Benchmarks
were set for each question, with some requiring a B ranking, whilst others required an A. The assessment
showed that Sierra Leone met 7 out of the 16 PEM benchmarks in 2003, with four questions ranked A and
6 ranked B and C respectively.

2.       The CFAA, HIPC-AAP and EU matrix of corrective measures had various actions that the
government was required to undertake to improve on weak PFM areas over time; all of these were
consolidated into a common action plan (CAP) and an oversight committee was formed to monitor its
implementation; The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) has Public Financial Management (PFM)
targets and indicators needed to monitor its implementation. The Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS)
Partners use the Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) to assess performance of the budget and other
targets. The Improved Governance and Accountability Pact (IGAP) highlight Government and the
Development Partners’ commitment to PFM reforms around the same agenda.

3.     The secretariat for the PFM Technical Steering Committee which meets quarterly is housed within
the Public Financial Management Reform Unit (PFMRU) in Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development (MoFED) that was formed in June 2004. The PFMRU coordinates overall PFM Reform in
Government and quarterly reports to the Technical Steering Committee in accordance with the current
PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2017.

Background to the IPFMRP

4.       Initial support for PFM Reform by the International Development Association (IDA) was
channeled through the Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP) which supported the
introduction of the Integrated Financial Management Information Systems (IFMIS) in the Accountant
General's Department (AGD) and strengthening of public procurement amongst others. Other MDBS
Partners also separately supported PFM reform through other interventions in the form of projects within
MoFED and other MDAs which were financed directly. Following the completion of the IRCBP in 2009,
a more integrated approach was agreed upon between the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) and key
budget support partners (African Development Bank, Department for International Development,
European Union and World Bank) wherein support to PFM reform would be jointly coordinated and
managed. Thus, in addressing the PFM challenges faced in the budget cycle, the GoSL with support from
the development partners11, developed a comprehensive program of PFM reforms to strengthen fiscal and
budget management, accounting, reporting and oversight, payroll management and cross-cutting issues of
capacity development and organizational strengthening. The initial Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment in 2007 and the review by the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2008 also provided the basis for the development of this
comprehensive PFM reform program.

5.       Establishing sound institutions and systems of PFM, at central and local levels of government was
identified as a high priority if service delivery is to be improved upon and sustained. The Integrated Public
Financial Management Reform Project (IPFMRP) was therefore designed to enhance the above and
address weaknesses in the PFM systems identified by the respective studies outlined above and laid out the
next phase of the reforms, for the period 2009-2013.The Project has been led by MoFED’s PFMRU. It
became effective in December 2009 following the appointment of the Director of PFM Reform.

Project Development objectives

6.      The Project sought to achieve sustainable improvement in the credibility and predictability,
control and transparency of fiscal and budget management, with the aim of improving public service
delivery and governance of public resources. The priorities identified for the IPFMRP were the need
to strengthen fiscal and budget management, accounting, reporting and oversight, payroll
management and cross-cutting issues of capacity development and organizational strengthening. The
Project also supported the establishment of a Non-State Actors Secretariat in MoFED.

7.       The project also aimed to contribute to the GoSL’s higher level objectives in improving
strategic allocation of resources and quality of expenditures required for the implementation of the
Poverty Reduction Strategy, and also consolidate and improve upon the progress made in the
Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP).

Project Component objectives and Progress/Achievements

8.     The Project supported the core of the Government’s Integrated Public Financial Reform
Program through three inter-related components and one component that supports capacity
development of non-state actors (NGOs, civil society and media groups) including their monitoring
and oversight functions of PFM. A fifth component supports project management.

Component 1 – Strengthening Coordination and Budget Management. The key outcomes of this
component include improved budget credibility associated with a more appropriately developed and
managed aggregate fiscal position, delivery by the MoFED of predictable funding in accordance
with budgets.

Key Progress in Achieving the Objectives of this Component

9.      There has been considerable improvement in the coordination of macroeconomic and fiscal
planning and budget management during project implementation. The following were established
and strengthened:

       The Sierra Leone Integrated Macroeconomic Model (SLIMM) which is an IMF-styled
        Financial Programming and Policies Model was developed during 2010 and was later linked
        with the Mineral Revenue Forecasting Model developed with assistance from IMF-FAD.
        Extensive training sessions were organized for key users of the model (largely constituting
        the Working Group- MoFED, Statistics Sierra Leone, Bank of Sierra Leone and National
        Revenue Authority) in strengthening their forecasting/analytical skills and overall
        application of the model. This has resulted in improved forecasting of macro-fiscal variables
        including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation, domestic revenues (including mining
        revenue), exports, imports and money supply. The resulting macro-fiscal framework informs
        budget planning and forms the basis for dialogue with the IMF and other Development



                                                  53
             Partners on the medium term prospect of the economy. A Macro-fiscal Section now
             functions within the Economic Policy and Research Unit of MoFED.
            Establishment and strengthening of budget committees in all Ministries, Departments and
             Agencies (MDAs) and District Budget Oversight Committees (DBOCs) in the 19 councils.
             Establishment of these committees and regular consultations to progressively improve
             capacity of these committees has not only enhanced wider participation and transparency in
             the budget management process, but also strengthened strategic planning capacity of MDAs
             and Local Councils and facilitated the production of activity based budgets introduced in
             2014 by MoFED. Budget Officers were also recruited and assigned to key MDAs in
             strengthening the budget process. Approximately three hundred and fifty (350) officials of
             Budget Committees across MDAs received basic training on budget management in
             strengthening the budget process.
              The Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) Guidelines were revised and re-
             launched in 2012. Two hundred (200) MDAs officials were accordingly trained on the
             revised guidelines.
              Improved oversight, coordination and monitoring of Local Councils’ budget execution by
             the Ministry of Finance. The project supported consultative seminars wherein stakeholders
             agreed upon issues including grants distribution, budget planning and preparation, and
             aligning sector strategies with Government’s agenda at local government level. These
             activities aided the promotion of transparency, budget adherence and improve budget
             credibility at the local council’s level.
            Human Resource Planning has been institutionalized in the Human Resource Management
             Office (HRMO). A Human Resource Planning Directorate has now been set up in the
             HRMO responsible for HR planning. HR Managers and Officers totaling sixty five (65) have
             been recruited and posted to various MDAs and training conducted in strengthening HR
             Planning of MDAs. The Directorate regularly conducts Manpower Hearings for MDAs in
             order to determine the critical staffing needs and formulate the HR Plan and Budget of
             MDAs. These have enhanced budget credibility in terms of predicting human resource needs
             and in turn minimize payroll volatility thereby addressing the previously large fluctuations in
             payroll.
            Public Investment Management (PIM) had also been institutionalized in MoFED through the
             creation and staffing of a Public Investment Management Division and is now integrated into
             the budget formulation, execution and monitoring and evaluation processes.
            A Medium Term Debt Strategy 12 (MDTS) incorporating policy on public debts and
             guarantees is now in place with regular Debt Sustainability Analysis13 (DSA) conducted.
             There is also regular publication of the annual debt bulletin that provides an insight and
             serves as a useful guide on public debt management including contingent liabilities.
            A comprehensive database of all ongoing projects (donor-funded and funded directly by
             Government) is now maintained by MoFED 14 . Key officials across projects including
             Coordinators, Accountants, Procurement Specialists and Monitoring and Evaluation Officers
             totaling thirty five (35) were trained on various aspects of project management focusing on
             operational rules of the respective funding agencies. This addressed bottlenecks in project
             implementation in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of donor-funded projects in
             budget formulation and execution.
            A Handbook on Investment Incentive Guidelines and Duty Waiver Procedures was
             published by MoFED. This Handbook had streamlined the duty waiver process and seeks to
             clarify the procedures and accessibility criteria of duty waivers and tax incentives.

12
     The latest MTDS of 2013-2017 was revised in 2014 and is still in draft
13
     The latest DSA of 2013 was revised in 2014 and is still in draft
14
     A website has been created (www.mofedprojects.org) to which key information of all projects shall be uploaded



                                                                 54
            Additionally, Non-Tax Revenue rates were reexamined and reviewed in the light of recent
            economic trends and incorporated in respective Finance Acts. The above have contributed
            significantly in strengthening the forecasting of revenues through the SLIMM.
           A National Aid Policy had been developed and Sector/Districts Working Groups formed in
            enhancing aid coordination. This has improved coordination in the budget formulation and
            execution processes and in some instances guarded against duplication of resources in the
            delivery of services.

Component 2 – Reinforcing Key Aspects of the Control System to Support Improved Service
Delivery. The key outcomes of this component include an updated legal framework, robust public
procurement practices, tightened payroll controls, strengthened internal audit, and improved
accounting procedures in the MoFED and MDAs, and further publication of Public Expenditure
Tracking Survey (PETS) contributing to an effective control environment in MDAs. Striving for
these internal controls will be reinforced through strengthened scrutiny of public finances by
Parliament.

Key Progress in Achieving the Objectives of this Component

           A Draft PFM Bill had been approved by Cabinet. The Bill provides for the introduction of a
            Treasury Single Account, Revenue Resource Management including the establishment of a
            Transformational Development Fund and management of fiscal risk amongst others. Once
            enacted, it shall secure the prudent, efficient, effective, and transparent use of public
            financial resources throughout the public sector. It will replace the Government Budgeting
            and Accountability Act 2005.
           A Draft Bill to revise the National Public Procurement Act 2004 had also been approved by
            Cabinet. This incorporates recommendations from the Country Procurement Assessment
            Review (CPAR) led by the World Bank.
           The Financial Administration Regulations for the Local Government Act 2004 had been
            drafted and agreed upon by key local government stakeholders and had been forwarded to
            the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development for onward submission to
            Cabinet.
           A Public Debts Management Law which lays out the framework for public sector borrowing
            and debts management was enacted by Parliament in 2011. Regulations for this Law had
            been drafted and submitted to the Office of the Solicitor General for final review prior to
            submission to Cabinet.
           Websites of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development15 and The National Public
            Procurement Authority 16 (NPPA) were revamped, publishing key fiscal, financial and
            procurement information.
           Procurement had been institutionalized in MDAs, through the establishment of a
            Procurement Cadre. Procurement Officers had been recruited and assigned to more than 30
            MDAs and all 19 Local Councils who now undertake day to day procurement activities of
            MDAs and local councils. These officials have received extensive training on procurement
            methods and operations useful in carrying out their functions. Approximately 90% of
            contracts across government above the $100,000 threshold in 2013 used open competition
            method.
           In strengthening records management at the Accountant General's Department (AGD),
            Records Management Manuals17 were developed for the AGD and training conducted for

15
     http://mofed.gov.sl/
16
     http://www.publicprocurement.gov.sl/
17
     Electronic Records Management Manuals are also in the process of being developed



                                                               55
       Stores and Records Officials of the AGD. A New Accounting Manual covering all
       operations of the Accountant General’s Department (AGD) had also been developed. This is
       also utilized by Accounting Officers assigned to MDAs.
      Major progress in the introduction of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) in Government to
       enhance effective cash planning and management, and ultimately reduce borrowing costs.
       Survey of all bank accounts operated across MDAs has been conducted and opening of
       further bank accounts rationalized. The infrastructure to facilitate the smooth operation of
       the TSA is now being put in place and a Cash Management Unit established in the AGD.
      Verification and validation of civil service employees undertaken resulting in the removal of
       obsolete names from the payroll.
      Internal Audit had been strengthened through the recruitment of various levels of staffing
       across the Internal Audit Cadre assigned to MDAs. From an initial seven MDAs prior to the
       IPFMRP, Internal Audit Units were established in thirty seven MDAs by the completion of
       the Project. All nineteen local councils too now have Internal Auditors in post. These
       Internal Auditors further received extensive training both locally and internationally in
       various aspects of internal audit work. Audit Committees had also been established in MDAs
       and Local Councils and training provided for the members respectively.
        There is now increased oversight and scrutiny of public finances by Parliament executed
       through the Parliamentary Finance Committee (PFC), Public Accounts Committee (PAC)
       and Transparency & Accountability Committee (TAC). The reviews which are usually open
       to the public are now organized regionally covering MDAs, local councils and school
       authorities. Backlogs of audited public accounts were cleared by the PAC including
       performance audit reports submitted by the Auditor General. Extensive capacity building
       support had been afforded Members of the respective Committees and the clerks assigned
       thereof. These included exchange visits to UK Parliament and other Parliaments in Sub-
       Saharan Africa and attendance at regional meetings.

Component 3 – Establishing and Maintaining Sustainable and Capable Central Finance
Functions. This component undertakes various cross-cutting activities including IFMIS rollout, all
aspects of training and human resource (HR) capacity development that are required to support the
main PFM functions that are being strengthened in the other three components and other steps to
help establish sustainable HR capacity in the MoFED.

Key Progress in Achieving the Objectives of this Component

      All of government expenditures from the Consolidated Fund are processed through the
       Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). Some of these are processed
       directly by key rolled out MDAs from their respective locations and the rest processed by the
       AGD for and on behalf of the respective MDAs. The ICT infrastructure supporting the
       IFMIS had been strengthened, the FreeBalance Accountability Software (including
       Performance Budgeting Module, Fixed Assets and Inventories) upgraded to version 6.5E and
       the Civil Service Management Module introduced replacing the previously utilized Human
       Capital Accountability Module. The aforementioned modules are now being utilized by the
       respective stakeholders (Budget Bureau, AGD and HRMO) in executing their
       responsibilities. The current PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2017 provides for full roll out to all
       MDAs which had been captured in the new Public Financial Management Improvement and
       Consolidation Project (PFMICP). In ensuring sustainability, continuous training on the
       respective modules is provided internally for MDA officials by MoFED. Over three hundred
       officials across rolled out MDAs have been trained on the use of the FreeBalance during the
       life of the IPFMRP.



                                              56
          The infrastructure for the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management
           Software (CS-DRMS) in MoFED had been strengthened and adequate training (including
           secondments to Commonwealth Secretariat) accordingly provided to staff of the Public
           Debts Management Division in MoFED.
          Financial Management of local councils had been strengthened through the roll out of the
           Petra Accounting Software to all 19 local councils, ensuring consistency across all Councils
           in the application of the 27-digits chart of accounts structure also utilized by the central
           government. The Petra Accounting Software provided the avenue for the capturing (though
           not presently on real time basis18) of transactions processed through the bank accounts
           maintained by respective local councils and also accounting for fixed assets through the
           Fixed Assets Module19. The Local Area Network (LAN) provided for in the respective
           councils provides the opportunity for key PFM practitioners including Mayors/Chairpersons
           and Deputies, Chief Administrators and Deputies, Finance Officers, Accountants and
           Internal Auditors to access and review transactions and reports directly from the Petra.
           Extensive training on the use of the Petra and other basic financial management trainings
           were provided for over three hundred and fifty (350) local councils officials including
           chairpersons and members of Budget and Finance Committees 20 and those assigned
           responsibilities for Health, Education, Agriculture and Solid Waste devolved functions
           amongst others.
          In ensuring consistency of reporting and improved transparency across local councils, the
           International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) Cash Based reporting had been
           adopted by all local councils for the preparation of annual financial statements. Extensive
           training on the IPSAS Cash basis of reporting was provided for key local councils officials
           and the Audit Service Sierra Leone by MoFED. Thus, the aspect of inconsistency of
           reporting, which was a concern previously expressed by the Auditor General, has now been
           addressed.
          In strengthening the capacity of key PFM Officials especially those in the recently
           established cadres of Procurement, Internal Audit and Human Resource, a partnership with
           the Institute of Public Administration and Management (IPAM) University of Sierra Leone
           was established through which training programs were designed for key officials across
           MDAs and local councils on Negotiation Skills and Contract Management, Internal Audit
           Techniques, Human Resource Management and General Administration. Certificates of
           merit were issued to two hundred and eighty (280) officials across the aforementioned
           disciplines from MDAs and local councils. Additionally, officials across MoFED (including
           AGD), NPPA, HRMO and local councils benefited from external training, including online
           Master's degree courses and study visits on aspects specific to their respective areas of
           operation.
          In ensuring a more holistic approach to mainstreaming of consultants performing line
           functions across MDAs into the civil service, the mainstreaming of donor-funded PFM
           Consultants which was initially provided for within the IPFMRP was cancelled following
           the Project's mid-term review and transferred to the Pay and Performance Project (PPP)
           coordinated by the Public Sector Reform Unit (PSRU). The PFM Consultants in the AGD
           have already been mainstreamed into the civil service through the PPP whilst the process for
           those in MoFED is already at an advanced stage.
          The provisional salary support to PFM consultants in MOFED up to 28th February 2010 was
           successfully completed.

18
   The PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2017 provides for the phased rollout of real time processing through the Petra. This is to be financed
by the PFMICP
19
   A fixed assets policy was drafted by MoFED in consultation with the local councils and forwarded to the National Assets and
Government Properties Commission for ratification and issuance
20
   These are elected Councilors who are primarily responsible for monitoring the finances of Councils



                                                               57
Component 4 – Assisting Non-state Actors’ Scrutiny. This component assists the development of
the analytic and dissemination capacity of Non-State Actors (NSAs) in exercising scrutiny of the use
of public resources, as well as building a constituency for reform of the PFM system across an array
of non-state actors.

Key Progress in Achieving the Objectives of this Component

            A Non-State-Actors Secretariat is now established in MoFED and network of NSAs in place.
             The activities and reports of the NSAs are now published on an NSA website21 set up for
             that purpose.
            A maiden Citizens’ Budget which is an abridged version of the National Budget was
             published in 2012 and annually afterwards in increasing the openness, transparency and
             accessibility of the annual budget. This has increased citizens' understanding of how public
             funds are allocated and thus put them in a better stead in monitoring the implementation of
             Government’s policies.
            There is now active participation of NSAs in the budget process. This includes witnessing
             policy hearings and budget discussions of MDAs and organizing public forums (including
             radio discussions) addressing strategic allocation of resources to MDAs and local councils.
             Reports of such forums are submitted to MoFED for consideration in finalizing the budget.
            In strengthening the capacity of NSAs, basic financial management training sessions
             covering the PFM cycle including planning, budget formulation and execution, procurement,
             accounting and recording, internal audit and external oversight were held for over one
             hundred and seventy registered organizations and Parliamentary Press Gallery. This was a
             prelude to providing NSAs with grants to review PFM operations of MDAs and local
             councils as part of their monitoring responsibilities.
              Fifteen qualifying NSAs nationwide were provided grants through the demand driven
             component enabling such NSAs in effectively monitoring and overseeing public financial
             management in MDAs and local councils. The evaluation of these NSAs was done by an
             independently recruited consultant prior to the award of the grants by MoFED.

Component 5: Project Management. The Project was led, managed and administered by the
Directorate of PFM Reform in MOFED which was facilitated by a Project Administration Unit
comprising a Project Accountant and Senior Procurement Officer of MoFED. Fiduciary
responsibilities alongside monitoring and evaluation of progress were vested in the Project Team led
by the Director, PFM Reform. Regular progress reports including financials were timely provided by
the Project Team during the life of the Project.

10.     The Directorate of PFM Reform also facilitated the development of a medium term strategy
for public financial management reforms (PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2017) to ensure that gains
already made are sustained and improved upon. This formed the basis for the development of the
follow-on Public Financial Management Improvement and Consolidation Project (PFMICP).

Major Implementation Issues Encountered.

11.          The key implementation issues encountered are outlined below:

            Reconciling available funding in Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF). The World Bank
             experienced challenges in reconciling the MDTF resources available for execution of Project
21
     http://www.nsasl.org/



                                                   58
          activities during the final year of the Project which resulted in the Government being
          notified of additional funding of $4.5m in March 2014 which was the final month of Project
          operations22. This led to a further extension of the Project by four months although this was
          visibly too short a period for the execution of the remaining activities of the Project. This
          resulted in an unutilized balance of $946,380.53 in respect of withdrawal applications not
          timely recorded within the bank's system by Project closure of 31st July 2014.
         Indefinite Suspension of FreeBalance Inc. by the World Bank. MoFED was notified by
          the World Bank that the IFMIS software service provider, FreeBalance Inc. was indefinitely
          suspended in 2013. Thus, further contracting of FreeBalance Inc. for additional licenses and
          other services could not be financed by the funds managed by the Bank. As the IFMIS has
          largely been financed directly through the PFM Projects managed by the Bank since 'go-
          live', the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the indefinite suspension imposed by the
          World Bank hindered the scaling up and further rollout of the IFMIS to additional MDAs as
          was initially envisaged. This situation currently remains the same.
         Limited Procurement Capacity in MoFED. In a bid to ensure sustainability following
          the completion of the IPFMRP, procurement responsibilities for the Project were vested in
          the Procurement Unit of MoFED headed by a Senior Procurement Officer, who is a civil
          servant. Adequate training from Project resources was initially provided for the said official.
          The transfer of the already trained Senior Procurement Officer to another MDA in May 2013
          and replacement with another Senior Procurement Officer with very limited previous
          knowledge of Bank's procurement and financial rules, hindered the speed of executing
          procurement-related activities including the development of timely procurement plans. Steps
          were however taken to provide adequate training for the replacement Officer, the benefits of
          which are now being reaped by his continued secondment to the Public Financial
          Management Improvement and Consolidation Project (PFMICP), the successor project.
          The ultimate recruitment of an International Procurement Specialist did not yield dividend as
          he was unable to fulfill the assignment due to other commitments.
         Mainstreaming of donor-funded PFM Consultants in MoFED into the Civil Service.
          In ensuring a more holistic approach towards mainstreaming of consultants performing line
          functions across the MDAs into the civil service, it was agreed that component 3.4 of the
          Project be cancelled and reallocated to other key mainstream PFM functions already
          supported by the Project. The utilization of the resources of $3m initially allocated to
          component 3.4 necessitated an initial extension of the Project by a period of nine months.

12.    The mainstreaming of all consultants performing line functions in MDAs is now being
channeled through the Pay and Performance Project administered by the World Bank.

Sustainability of PFM Reforms

13.     The Government in partnership with the IPFMRP Development Partners had developed the
PFMICP which seeks to improve upon and consolidate the gains achieved within the IPFMRP. The
PFMICP, which is already in operation, supports the objectives outlined in the Government's Public
Financial Management Reform Strategy 2014-2017, which is itself anchored in the National Agenda
for Prosperity (PRSP 3). It is anticipated that the successful completion of the PFMICP shall ensure
that PFM gains already achieved shall be improved upon, consolidated and sustained.




22
  The Project Team had utilized over 99% of the resources within the confirmed IDA and MDTF initially made available, by 31st January
2014 and had earlier requested confirmation regarding additional MTDF resources to be provided as per Project records.



                                                              59
Key Lessons Learnt

      Improved Government/Donor Coordination on PFM. The integrated approach adopted
       by Government and key budget support partners towards addressing PFM reform issues
       helped create the platform for a more coordinated approach in strengthening public financial
       management. This has been further strengthened through the establishment of the PFMICP
       which is also supported by the key budget support partners in achieving the objectives
       outlined in the National PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2017. There is the need for more
       frequent joint meetings of GoSL representatives and Development Partners (DPs) supporting
       PFM Reform to facilitate improved collaboration and avoid duplication of PFM support by
       DPs.
      Proper Sequencing of PFM Reform. The interdependent nature of some of the key PFM
       reform activities especially ICT-related necessitate the need for continued enhanced
       collaboration amongst various agencies especially those engaged in IFMIS-related functions.
       This was addressed through the PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2018 and accordingly aligned in
       the PFMICP. Although, key inter-related Agencies including MoFED, NRA, HRMO and
       ASSL have all been adequately provided for in the succeeding PFMICP operations it is still
       necessary to ensure close monitoring so that the agreed sequencing of the activities are
       adhered to. Mitigation measures also need to be put in place to ensure adherence to
       proposed timing of the implementation of various activities of the next stage of the PFM
       reform process.
      Sound Knowledge of IDA's Procurement and Financial Management Rules. There is
       the need for sound understanding of IDA's financial management practices especially
       procurement guidelines by all components associated with operations of the Project. Key to
       this is a strengthened Procurement Unit with vast knowledge of IDA procurement and
       financial management rules which must in turn be cascaded to the respective implementing
       agencies through well-structured capacity building initiatives. This facilitates project
       implementation and eliminates challenges encountered midstream resulting from weak
       knowledge of IDA fiduciary rules. It is, therefore, important that the World Bank continues
       to train relevant GoSL staff especially when new guidelines are introduced.
      PFM Operations to be completely focused on core PFM issues and separated from
       Civil/Public Service Reform. Whilst sustainable human resource capacity for performing
       key line functions is critical in ensuring sustained PFM reform, the challenges experienced
       in addressing this through sub-component 3.4 of the IPFMRP revealed that it would have
       been better addressed through a civil/public service reform program. This resulted in the
       eventual cancellation the said sub-component of the IPFMRP following the mid-term review
       of the Project and thereafter channeled through the Pay and Performance Project managed by
       the Public Sector Reform Unit (PSRU).
      Collaboration between MoFED and NSAs on PFM. The establishment of a NSA
       Secretariat in MoFED and appointment of a NSA Coordinator has created the space for
       NSAs to engage officials of MoFED and other PFM agencies including oversight bodies
       such as ASSL and Parliament. The introductory training afforded these NSAs on core PFM
       issues and subsequent release of grants to qualifying organizations has increased awareness
       and aroused their interests on PFM matters. This has ultimately improved the engagement
       between State and NSAs in addressing PFM issues including those at the service delivery
       level of local councils. Introductory training needs to be sustained and formally adopted as
       a pre-condition to the Grant scheme.
      Institutionalizing Public Financial Management Reform in MoFED. The establishment
       of the PFM Reform Directorate within MoFED and appointment of a civil servant as
       Director has ensured that PFM reform receives the level of authority and attention it requires



                                              60
          under the supervision of the Office of the Financial Secretary. The complex and challenging
          reforms embarked upon during the IPFMRP straddling various MDAs (including HRMO,
          NPPA and Parliament) and all nineteen local councils received the due attention through the
          effective and efficient leadership of the PFM Directorate. This has been seen as critical in
          advancing PFM reforms as recognized in the PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2017 which
          mandates that the Director PFM Reform shall have overall responsibility for coordination
          and Monitoring & Evaluation of the PFM Reform. This institutional arrangement should
          be replicated in future similar PFM operations.

Contribution of the Bank and IPFMRP Development Partners

14.     MoFED acknowledges the support and commitment of the World Bank and Joint IPFMRP
Development Partners (African Development Bank, Department for International development and
European Union) from the design stage through to the implementation and closure of the IPFMRP.
Support in the form of Technical Assistance where necessary, was promptly provided in addition to
the unflinching support and commitment demonstrated by the leadership and members of the
respective Country Teams in providing requested assistance to the Project Team. These included
hosting bilateral meetings and video conferences to facilitate project implementation.

15.      Supervisory missions led by both Task Team Leaders (TTLs) 23 were well-resourced
resulting in fruitful discussions with the respective implementing agencies, yielding positive
outcomes.

16.     The flexibility of the TTLs and respective Partners in responding to emerging PFM needs
has been unrivaled.

17.       Overall, the contribution of all Partners in advancing PFM reform has been immense.

Conclusion

18.     The leadership provided by the Hon. Ministers of Finance and Economic Development24
and Team demonstrates the overall commitment of the Government of Sierra Leone in strengthening
PFM across MDAs and local councils in ensuring the effective and efficient delivery of services. It is
anticipated that gains already achieved shall be improved upon and consolidated through the
PFMICP in accordance with the PFM Reform Strategy 2014-2017 and in fulfillment of PRSP 3
(Agenda for Prosperity).

             Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


1.     The UK provided £5.065 million to the multi-donor trust fund that supported the
implementation of the Government of Sierra Leone’s Integrated Public Financial Management
Reform Project (IPFMRP).

2.      DFID conducted its own Annual Reviews of the program, finding that the program
progressed either in line with expectations (2011-2012 and 2012-2013) or just short of expectations
(2013-2014). In the final year, progress was made in each output area, however the speed of progress
was slower than desired. There is no single reason to explain the slowdown in the program’s
performance, but a few factors have likely played a part. There is the general challenge of
maintaining momentum towards the end of a program’s life, and the ‘distraction’ of a next phase
PFM program being designed during the final year of the IPFMRP. There was reportedly limited
capacity to cope with implementation of IPFMRP and respond to demands from the design of the
next phase program. It is thought that shifting priorities and incentives signaled by the next phase
program also diverted attention away from IPFMRP.

3.      Through its Annual Reviews, DFID noted that the IPFMRP has helped to improve the
macroeconomic framework that underpins the budget, the entire budget process, and financial
reporting. New internal audit and procurement cadres have been established and are becoming
more effective. New legislation was passed that clarifies the responsibilities for public borrowing
and a new debt strategy has been developed. All local councils now have the same accounting
software and chart of accounts. Important developments in transparency and accountability have also
been achieved. The public accounts are submitted and audited on time and audit reports are
routinely published where in the past they were not disclosed.

4.      One of the biggest achievements in DFID’s view was the progress made in the non -State
Actors (NSA) component, where the new NSA coordinator helped achieve significant results, such
as the publication of the first citizen’s budget, PFM training and the start of a grant facility for civil
society. In addition, the NSAs managed to secure Sierra Leone’s participation in the Open Budget
Index survey for the first time.

5.       However, significant gaps remain, particularly on updating the legal framework, improving
the credibility of annual budgets, and ensuring fully-functional ICT systems. DfID also noted the
lack of political 'buy in' to the objectives of the program, which the Bank references above.

6.      Procurement practices remain a problem and have a track record of hindering progress of
PFM reforms in Sierra Leone. As noted above, procurement delays affected the IPFMRP negatively
and contributed to the downgrading of the Bank’s IP rating in March 2013. Training and other
capacity building activities have taken place on a range of procurement topics and extended to
MDAs, however procurement outcomes are still falling well below expectations; delays and a lack of
competitive bidding are common. DfID takes this issue very seriously and is working with the World
Bank, African Development Bank and the GoSL to address this pressing issue.

7.      These challenges highlight that further entrenchment of the reforms is necessary to prevent
stagnation and move the PFM system to the next level.

8.       DfID drew a number of lessons from its Reviews of the IPFMRP which will inform
activities throughout the lifetime of the PFMICP. These include the need for improved sequencing of



                                                 62
PFM reforms; that successful PFM reform requires us to develop mechanisms and tools for making
ongoing and real time judgments about the level of buy-in at senior political levels and at technical
levels, so that we can adjust ambition and political influencing accordingly; that alignment of
development partners’ Annual Review patterns would reduce the burden on GoSL; that the balance
between international consultancy missions and in-country presence of Bank staff needs careful
attention; that there should be close attention paid to the consistency of results framework indicators
and activities financed; that there is scope for a strengthened partnership between GoSL and
development partners; and that overlap between implementation of a program and design of the next
must be managed carefully so as not to divert attention from the ongoing program – this will require
strong leadership from the development partners. Several of these are elaborated on below.

9.      Whilst there are many wide-ranging PFM reform initiatives that are ongoing, planned, or
scheduled, the GoSL, in collaboration with its partners, has lacked the ability to comprehensively
implement all of those plans; implementation of the IPFMRP was hindered by inadequate planning
and prioritization, as noted above. DfID would like to see a focus on fewer initiatives whilst placing
greater emphasis on the implementation and completion of those selected initiatives. DfID fully
supports the Bank’s recommendation above that future operations must strongly reflect a sustained,
focused, well-sequenced, long-term approach embedded in the government reform agenda.

10.     The added value of international consultancy missions should be clearly identified and Bank
presence in country may need to be scaled up for the new program; the UK’s Multilateral Aid
Review (MAR, 2011) was critical of World Bank staffing levels in fragile and conflict affected states
(FCS), warning that a lack of staff resources dedicated to FCS could be a major risk to delivery. The
2013 MAR found a slight improvement in Bank staffing levels in fragile states. While there is
undoubtedly value in international consultancy missions, the experience of IPFMRP reinforces the
MAR’s finding on the importance of having staff based in-country in FCS and not relying too
heavily on short international consultancy missions. This will be an important lesson for the new
PFM program.

11.      DfID observed that there could have been better consistency between the program log frame
(results framework) and the activities that were financed. For example, areas such as public debt
management reform, and training of civil servants on procurement and IFMIS etc., are not in the
final results framework, despite a significant amount of money being spent on those activities and
genuine progress having been made.

12.      DFID’s perception is that the partnership between development partners and the Government
of Sierra Leone was, overall, relatively strong, although there is scope for improvement. GoSL
would significantly benefit if development partners were to act ‘as one’ throughout the program
rather than carrying out separate reviews and bringing different expectations to program delivery. In
return, development partners would have benefited from a clearer administrative separation of which
PFM reform activities were carried out under the IPFMRP and which were not, as well as from more
regular reporting to development partners on progress made and critical challenges being faced.

13.     DFID could be a more effective partner in PFM activities in Sierra Leone if it could: reduce
the time burden it places on the Government by not aligning its monitoring and reviewing with other
donors; continue to be ready and willing to provide technical and economic advice on PFM reform
when Government capacity is deemed to be weaker than would be ideal; and better appreciate the
Government’s ambition for PFM reform to be ‘organic’ and home-grown rather than donor-driven.
