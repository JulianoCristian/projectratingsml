Financial\n            Management Reform Project for Sierra Leone received a\n            moderately satisfactory outcome with moderate risk to\n            development outcome. Both the Bank and Borrower\u0092s\n            performances were moderately satisfactory. There were four\n            restructurings that took place during this project and\n            concerned reallocations of funding within components of the\n            project and they occurred retroactively. Reallocations were\n            introduced mainly for unintended administrative\n            expenditures. Two of the four restructurings pushed the\n            closing date of the project back for a total of eight\n            months. Some key lessons learned can be drawn from the\n            implementation of IPFMRP in Sierra Leone. The following\n            lessons could be useful for developing public sector\n            projects in post conflict countries. a) The need to clearly\n            understand the political economy and authorizing environment\n            in the country and therefore adequately sequence the\n            interventions. Conditions of this lesson include: fragile\n            domestic conditions, comprehensive planning framework,\n            institutional weaknesses, adherence to proposed\n            implementation plans, mainstreaming of LTAs, and effective\n            and efficient leadership. b) The need to focus on capacity\n            development during reform implementation in order to secure\n            adequate sustainability, which includes: knowledge of\n            financial and procurement arrangements and capacity building\n            of NSAs. c) The need to look at technical complexities\n            particularly in the ICT aspects of the reform program\n            (specifically comprehensive and targeted medium-term\n            capacity building strategy and work plan and Combining PEFA\n            based indicators with other relevant dimensions). d) The\n            need to build well-articulated coalitions both within\n            stakeholders in government, beneficiaries and donor\n            community including more frequent joint meetings, integrated\n            legislative agenda, and Medium-term expenditure framework."}, "docdt": "2015-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
