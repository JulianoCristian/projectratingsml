                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The MTR Mission reviewed the full project including the Appraisal document, Financial Agreement Grant Agreement as well as the ISR and arrived at the conclusion that the PDO is
                         consistent with the current CAS. The MTR mission concluded that the project PDO is focusing on outcomes for which the project can be accountable for. While the project is well
                         focused and have specific targeted outcomes of credibility, control and transparence in fiscal and budget management. Special attention will be done to ensure that interventions and

                         outcomes are likely to be sustained beyond project completion. As regard to intermediate outcome indicators, the MTR Mission worked with the Government of Sierra Leone and
                         agreed to make some changes in a set of Intermediate Outcomes Indicators (Annex 5 of the Aide Memoire).

                         As at June 15, 2012, the MTR Mission observed that the level of disbursements has increased to about 63% and 38% respectively for the MDTF (TF-95389) IDA (H-4930)
                         respectively. Disbursement is expected to continue to increase in the coming months and it is projected that there is a need for additional resources to cover the priority needs of
                         government. GoSL has been advised to prepare a proposal for additional resources for discussion with Donor partners and if agreed, the need for additional resources will be formally
                         reflected in a restructuring package to be prepared by the Bank.

                         Unfortunately, the disbursement conditions for sub-component 3.4 continue to be an outstanding issue, The MTR Mission monitored the new timetable agreed with the Government,
                         IDA and the MDTF partners. Again, if agreed conditions are not met by end of September 2012, the resources under this sub-component might be canceled. The triggers to be met
                         are: (i) mainstream policy approved by the Civil Service Steering Commission; (ii) identification of LTAs by MoFED and signed off by HRMO; (iii) approval of an the already
                         organogram proposed by MoFED by the Civil Service Steering Commission; (iv) determination of remuneration for each LTA position; and (v) recruiting staff competitively The
                         Minister of Finance agreed to take responsibility for ensuring completion of the conditions and agreed to take this issue up with PSC, HTMO and PSRU.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
