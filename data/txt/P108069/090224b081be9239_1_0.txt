                         months. Prolonged delays in procurement have affected the relationship between the project Management team and beneficiaries. The MoFED Senior Procurement Specialist was
                         transferred in September 2012 to another MDA. Since then the IPFMRP’s procurement has been managed by a Procurement Assistant, without sufficient knowledge and experience
                         in World Bank procurement regulations. This has resulted in prolonged delays in procurement matters and multiple revisions by the Bank procurement team of basic procurement
                         packages.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         While the project is well focused and has specific targeted outcomes of credibility, control and transparency in fiscal and budget management, special attention is recommended to
                         better prioritize certain actions and reallocate the remaining resources to ensure that interventions and outcomes are likely to be sustained beyond project completion. As regard to
                         intermediate outcome indicators, the ISR mission calls on the Government of Sierra Leone to make the necessary changes in the set of Intermediate Outcomes Indicators (Annex 5
                         of the Aide Memoire) in order to getting the Project achieve those priority actions. The Bank is advancing in the restructuring of the project to make the best use of the remaining
                         available resources and extension of the closing date.

                         As of March 31, 2013, the ISM mission observed that the level of disbursements has increased to about 90% and 64% respectively for the MDTF (TF-95389) IDA (H-4930)
                         respectively. The main reason for this increased disbursement level is two payments to FreeBalance.

                         Unfortunately, outstanding issues continue endangering fiscal discipline and seriously affecting the sustainability of PFM reform, insofar as critical legal and regulatory reforms and
