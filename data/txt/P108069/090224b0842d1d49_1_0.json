for Sierra Leone were as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            strategies for sustainability can be part of the project\n            design from the very beginning. Extensive use of capacity\n            substitution and supplementation as in Sierra Leon to\n            short-circuit capacity constraints while providing an\n            opportunity to move forward on the reform agenda, poses\n            clear challenges to longer-term sustainability. Monitoring\n            and evaluation arrangements are most helpful when designed\n            from the outset so as to ensure usefulness not only for\n            reporting on project performance but also for learning and\n            adjusting implementation as needed across all project\n            stakeholders. Achieving long-term sustainable institutional\n            capacity building outcomes such as the one pursued by public\n            financial management (PFM) reforms and in a post-conflict\n            context of low capacity requires a programmatic,\n            step-by-step approach built in a long-term vision but\n            focused on a reasonable number of building block priorities\n            at a time and aligned with actual capacity. Capacity\n            building requires much more than training and equipment. A\n            right balance of supply and demand side interventions in PFM\n            capacity building projects may help in achieving sustainable\n            results as there may be more appetite for PFM reforms\n            outside of the executive; an opportunity to build a\n            coalition for reform."}, "docdt": "2016-04-05T01:29:04Z"}
