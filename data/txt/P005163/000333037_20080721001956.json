the Population Project\n            for Egypt were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory;\n            and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the projects included: supply-side and\n            demand-side interventions supporting population and family\n            planning objectives can be truly & synergistic when they\n            are delivered through a well defined and well functioning\n            partnership of local actors. An important element of any\n            investment in management capacity building is the support of\n            monitoring and evaluation activities. However, when the\n            focus of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) support is\n            project-specific, rather than program-wide, an opportunity\n            is missed to learn from experience across projects and to\n            use evidence to fine-tune national policies and strategies.\n            This lesson is especially relevant when innovative\n            activities are supported in the same geographic area by\n            different externally-financed projects. Demand-side\n            interventions, though critical to achieving population and\n            family planning goals, are not likely to be sustained or\n            expanded in the absence of an institutional home for these\n            activities and a well-defined, evidence-based program of\n            activities. Efforts to ensure and improve the quality and\n            client-orientation of family planning become all the more\n            crucial when they are undertaken in the context of health\n            sector reform program."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
