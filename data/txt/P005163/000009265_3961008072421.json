These\n            objectives will reinforce and expand the goals of the\n            national family planning program. The project consists of\n            two major components: 1) capacity building, which will help\n            install capacity in the population and Family Planning\n            Sector of MOHP for a set of key functions including policy\n            and program development, business planning, sectoral\n            manpower development and training, research programming,\n            planning, resource mobilization, supervision, monitoring and\n            evaluation, and public/nongovernmental organizations/local\n            community program coordination; and 2) population activities\n            program, which will include projects to increase awareness\n            of population issues, to strengthen motivation for couples\n            to plan their families, to facilitate access to and use of\n            reproductive health services, and to educate and motivate\n            people in such related areas as child nutrition, safe\n            motherhood, male awareness, and delayed age of marriage."}, "docdt": "1996-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
