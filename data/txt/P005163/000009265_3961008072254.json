          Project are to help Egypt: 1) better manage population\n            growth and prevent avoidable population growth by giving the\n            Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) the institutional\n            capacity to play the lead role in the population sector; and\n            2) improve the conditions and status of women and children\n            in areas where fertility remains high, mainly in rural areas\n            of Upper Egypt, by stimulating additional demand for smaller\n            family size and for family planning services. These\n            objectives will reinforce and expand the goals of the\n            national family planning program. The project consists of\n            two major components: 1) capacity building, which will help\n            install capacity in the population and Family Planning\n            Sector of MOHP for a set of key functions including policy\n            and program development, business planning, sectoral\n            manpower development and training, research programming,\n            planning, resource mobilization, supervision, monitoring and\n            evaluation, and public/nongovernmental organizations/local\n            community program coordination; and 2) population activities\n            program, which will include projects to increase awareness\n            of population issues, to strengthen motivation for couples\n            to plan their families, to facilitate access to and use of\n            reproductive health services, and to educate and motivate\n            people in such related areas as child nutrition, safe\n            motherhood, male awareness, and delayed age of marriage."}, "docdt": "1996-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
