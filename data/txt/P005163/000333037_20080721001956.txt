About this Report
      The IndependentEvaluationGroup assessesthe programsand activitiesoftheWorld Bank for two purposes:
first,to ensurethe integrityofthe Bank'sselfevaluation process andto verifythat the Bankswork is producingthe
expectedresults,and second,to helpdevelopimproveddirections, policies,and proceduresthroughthe
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As partof thiswork, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank'slendingoperationsthroughfieldwork. Inselecting operationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those
that are innovative,large,or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations;those for
which Executive Directorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments;and thosethat are likelyto generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examineproject files and other
documents,interviewoperationalstaff, visit the borrowing country to discussthe operationwith the government,
and other in-country stakeholders,and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff bothat headquarters and
in localoffices as appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subjectto internalIEGWB peer review, Panel review,and managementapproval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commentedon by the responsibleBank department.IEGWB incorporatesthe comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers'comments are attached to
the documentthat is sent to the Banks Board of ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board,it is disclosedto the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB'suse of multipleevaluation methodsoffers both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibilityto adaptto
lendinginstrument,projectdesign, or sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluators all apply the same basicmethodto
arriveat their project ratings. Followingis the definitionand ratingscale used for each evaluation criterion
(additionalinformationis available on the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extentto which the operation'smajor relevantobjectiveswere achieved,or are expectedto
be achieved,efficiently.The rating hasthree dimensions:relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevanceof objectivesand relevance of design. Relevanceof objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectivesare consistent with the country's currentdevelopment prioritiesand with current Bank country and
sectoral assistancestrategies and corporategoals (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers,Country
Assistance Strategies,Sector Strategy Papers,Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project'sdesign is consistentwith the stated objectives.Efficacy is the extentto which the project'sobjectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved,taking into account their relative importance. Efficiencyis the
extentto which the projectachieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the opportunitycost of capital
and benefitsat least cost comparedto alternatives.The efficiencydimensiongenerally is not applied to adjustment
operations.Possible ratings for Outcome: HighlySatisfactory,Satisfactory,Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Riskto Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation,that development outcomes (or
expectedoutcomes)will not be maintained(or realized).Possible ratings for Risk to DevelopmentOutcome:High
Significant,Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
      BankPerformance: The extentto which servicesprovidedby the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operationand supported effective implementationthroughappropriatesupervision (including ensuringadequate
transitionarrangementsfor regular operation of supportedactivities after loankreditclosing,toward the
achievementof developmentoutcomes. The rating hastwo dimensions:quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possibleratingsfor Bank Performance:Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Perfomance: The extentto which the borrower(including the government and implementing
agency or agencies)ensuredquality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenantsand
agreements,towardthe achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions:government
performanceand implementingagency(ies)performance. Possible ratingsfor Borrower Performance:Highly
Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

PREFACE

       This is the Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) for the Egypt
PopulationProject, financedthrough IDA Credit No, 2830 inthe amount of US$17.2
million (11.9 million SDRs), withplanned government and community contributions of
US1.6 millionandUS$l.9 million, respectively. The credit was approved on March 21,
1996, becameeffective on June 24, 1998, andwas 87 percent disbursedwhen it closedon
March 31,2005, three years andthree months after the originally plannedclosing date.

       The findings ofthis assessment are basedon an IndependentEvaluationGroup
(IEG) missionto the Arab Republic ofEgypt carried out inNovember 2007. The mission
met inCairo with authorities and staff of: (i)
                                             the Ministry of Health andPopulationand
the Social Fundfor Development; (ii)  researchinstitutions; (iii)
                                                               selectedNGOs andcivil
society groups; and(iv) the developmentpartners. The mission also visitedthe Urban
GovernorateofAlexandria, anddistricts andvillages inthe Upper Egypt Governoratesof
Menya andQena, where itmet withhealthauthorities, healthandfamily planning
servicesproviders, NGOs, civil society actors, social change agents andproject
beneficiariesto assess inputs andactivities supportedby the Bank. Key sourcesof
evidence consulted include: (a) World Bankproject files; (b) project-related reporting
andevaluation; (c) healthfacility data; and(d) epidemiological data, studies, surveysand
researchon health, much ofit generatedinEgypt.

        This PPAR i s one of several conductedon the development effectiveness ofthe
World Bank's support to health, nutritionandpopulation indifferent countries. Evidence
from these assessments andcountry case studies onthe Bank's lendingandnon-lending
supportwill contribute to a forthcoming evaluation by IEGofthe World Bank's support
to health, nutrition andpopulation outcomes over the past decade. As such, more

SUMMARY

         Egypt's resident population in2006 was 72.6 million, some 20 million(or 37
percent) more thanthe population sizejust 15 years prior, andit is highly concentrated
aroundthe arable landaroundthe Nile DeltaandValley. The annualrate ofnatural
increase(currently estimatedat 1.8 percent) appears to be slowing down as fertility has
declined more rapidly thanmortality over the past 15 years. The Government of Egypt
(GoE) has supportedanationalpopulationpolicy for well over 40 years, but increasein
contraceptiveprevalenceratesanddeclines infertility havebeeninequitable.

         The objectives ofthe Egypt Population Project were "...to helpEgypt:(a) better
managepopulation growth andprevent avoidable population growth by givingthe
Ministry ofHealth andPopulation(MoHP) the institutional capacity to play the lead role
inthepopulationsector; and(b) improvethe conditions andstatus ofwomenandchildren
inareaswhere fertilityremainshigh, mainlyinruralareasofUpperEgypt, by stimulating
additional demandfor smaller family size and for family planning services." Key
performance indicators were establishedto track changesinattitudes (desired number of
children, approval of family planning, andintentionto use contraception), behavior
(contraceptive prevalence) and outcome (total fertility).

         The project's supportwas organized aroundtwo components. The Capacity
Building component was designed to strengthenthe strategicmanagementcapacity of the
newly establishedPopulationandFamily Planning Sector (PS) ofthe Ministry of Health
andPopulation(MoHP). The Population Activities Program (PAP) component was
designedas a small grants programto finance community-level subprojects, proposed
andmanagedbyNGOs andother civil society organizations, aimedat stimulating
demandfor family planning. Its geographic focus was on rural Upper Egypt, where
fertility was highanddemandfor anduse o f family planning serviceswere low.

        A Project ImplementationUnit(PIU), housedinthe MoHP, was responsible for
the implementation ofthe Capacity Buildingcomponent. The PAP Small Grants
component, which constituted 87 percent o fthe total project cost, was contractedto the
Social Fundfor Development (SFD).

        Better management ofpopulation andfamily planning. No specific indicators for
this objective were identifiedduringproject design. Inline with adecision taken at the
project's mid-termreview (MTR), support to population capacity buildingwas reoriented
away from aninitial focus on central MoHP, concentratinginsteadon the governorate,
district andcommunity levels withinRuralUpper Egypt. The project provided training
andtechnical assistanceto various groups of local-level actorsto strengthen their
respectivecapacitiesinthe planning, design, delivery andoversight ofpopulation and
family planningactivities. However, the impact ofthis training was not evaluated. The
project developedanew cadre o f social change agents, madeupofrespectedwomen
from the communities, which served as an effective interfacebetweentarget women and
family planninginformation and services. The project was instrumental inforging
effective partnershipsat the local levelbetweenMoHP, the SFD, NGOs andother
community membersinthe designand delivery ofpopulationandfamily planning
activities inselecteddistricts andvillages andat the governoratelevel. However, it was

less successfulinsupporting and institutionalizingMoHP partnershipswithNGOsand
civil society organizationsat the national level. AnNGO Support Departmentwas
createdinMoHPPS butnever became fully functional. Notwithstanding its support to
the implementation ofproject-specific M&E, the project was unsuccessful in
strengtheningMoHPPS capacity to monitor andevaluatethe overall progress ofnational
populationandfamily planningefforts. The project also contributed to increased
contraceptivesecurity andprocurementcapacity.

         Changesin attitudes, behaviorsand outcomes in Rural Upper Egypt. The project
supportedthe implementationof fifty-five subprojects, designed andmanagedby
community developmentassociations, providingthe poorest villages of RuralUpper
Egyptwithapackageofinformationandservices that are knownto influence changes in
desiredfamily size andincreasedcontraceptiveuse. Duringthe period o f subproject
implementation, modest advanceswere made onwomen's literacy rates and employment
rates inRural UpperEgypt. It is plausible to assume that subprojects may have made
some contributionto modest changes inthese andother socio-economic indicators in
RuralUpperEgypt. However, project attribution is difficult to establish giventhat (a) the
coverageandimpact ofvarious demand-side interventions on socio-economic indicators
were not evaluatedand (b) numerousother socio-economic development activities were
ongoing inthe project area. Project investments ininfrastructure, equipment,
contraceptivesandtraining supportedimprovements inthe supply andquality of family
planningservices offered inor near villages benefitingfrom demand-side interventions.

        Between2000 and2005 total wanted fertility (total actual fertility minus
unwantedbirths) declined inRural Upper Egyptfrom 3.7 to 2.6 children, a total decrease
o f 1.1 children. This decline is greater than what was achieved duringthe previous five-
year period inRural Upper Egyptandalso more important than overall national declines
between2000 and2005. Duringthis period the use of family planningbecameeven
more acceptable. In2005 85 percent of ever-marriedwomen residing inRuralUpper
Egyptconsideredit appropriateto use family planningafter the first birthcomparedwith
70percentin2000. However, demandfor family planning(met andunmet) increased
only very modestly (from 60 to 63 percent).

        Between 2000 and 2005, contraceptiveprevalencerose from 40 to 45 percent in
RuralUpperEgypt(comparedwith anincreasefrom 56 to 59 percent for all ofEgypt). It
increasedinall eight of the governorates inRuralUpper Egypt, rangingin2005 from a
low of 33 percent inSouhagto ahighof 62 percent inGiza. The share o ftotal demand
for family planningwhich is satisfied increasedslightly inrural UpperEgyptfrom 69
percentin2000 to 73 percent in2005, while itremainedvirtually unchanged for Egypt as
a whole. Between2000 and2005 the total actual fertility rate (TFR) inruralUpper
Egypt declinedby 0.8 children, from 4.7 to 3.9, faster thanthe decline for country as a
whole. The TFR inUpper Egypti s still highcomparedwith other regions inEgypt, but
the statistically significant change inthis rate is a major accomplishment andhas
narrowedthe gap acrossregions. Women's actualfertility is still greater than their
desiredfertility; andthe gap betweenactual anddesiredfertility appearsto be growing in
Egypt,withthe most rapid growthinUpper Egypt.

         The changesinattitude, contraceptiveuse and fertility inRural Upper Egypt
cannot be solely or evenprimarilyattributed to the project. First, only 9 percentof
villages were covered. Second, two other major developmentpartnerswere financing
similar (demand- andsupply-side) interventions, alsotargetedto rural UpperEgypt.
Third, other developmentandpoverty alleviation activities are also likelyto have
improved the economic opportunities ofwomen and family wellbeing. Fourth, dataon
key indicators inthe 148 villages ofproject intervention are incomplete, although they do
provide partial evidence ofsomepositive effects. Nevertheless, the project influenced
changes inpopulation indicators inRural UpperEgypt beyondthe villages ofdirect
intervention. The multi-sectoral, demand-sideapproachdevelopedunder the project was
an important departurefrom previous (supply-side) interventions inEgypt andinfluenced
the design and implementation of interventions inRural Upper Egypt financed by others.

        The outcomeofthe Populationproject is moderately satisfactory. The outcome
o fthe first (management capacity building) objective is unsatisfactory, basedon its
modest relevance, eficacy and eflciency. The outcome ofthe second (fertility decline)
objective is satisfactory, basedon its substantial relevance, eficacy and eficiency. The
overall outcomeof moderately satisfactory is a function ofthe heavier weight applied to
the secondobjective. Riskto developmentoutcome is rated as substantial. The Bank's
performancewas moderately satisfactory andthe Borrower's performance was
moderately unsatisfactory.

Lessons:

        Supply-side anddemand-sideinterventions supporting population andfamily
        planningobjectivescanbetruly synergistic whenthey are deliveredthrough a
        well-definedandwell-functioning partnershipof localactors.
        An important elementofany investment inmanagementcapacity building is the
        support ofmonitoring andevaluation activities. However, when the focus of
        M&Esupport is project-specific, ratherthanprogram-wide, anopportunity is
        missedto learnfrom experience across projects andto use evidence to fine-tune
        national policies and strategies. This lessonis especially relevant when
        innovative activities are supportedinthe same geographicarea by different
        externally-financed projects.
        Demand-sideinterventions, thoughcritical to achieving populationandfamily
        planninggoals, are not likelyto be sustainedor expandedinthe absence ofan
        institutional home for these activities and aWell-defined, evidence-basedprogram
        ofactivities.
        Efforts to ensure andimprove the quality andclient-orientation o f family planning
        becomeall the more crucial when they are undertakeninthe context of health
        sector reformprogram.

 1. BACKGROUNDAND CONTEXT

 1.1     General Country Information. Only 6 percentofthe total areaofEgypt is
inhabited. Despitethe recently adoptedEgyptian policy ofreclamation andfostering of
new settlements inthe desert, the majority of Egyptians live either inthe Nile Delta,
locatedinthe north o fthe country, or inthe Nile Valley (southof Cairo).

 1.2    Egypt is dividedinto 28 governorates and Luxor City. The five Urban
Governorates(Cairo, Helwan, Alexandria, Port Said and Suez) have no rural population.
O fthe remaining 23 governorates, nine are inthe Nile Delta(Lower Egypt Region), nine
are inthe Nile Valley (Upper EgyptRegion) and five are Frontier Governorateslocated
onthe easternandwestern boundaries of Egypt.

 1.3    Egypt's economy expandedsteadily duringthe 1990s. GDP per capita reached
US$1,580 by2006 (World Bankdata, 2008). Annual growth of GDPaveraged4 percent
duringtheperiod 1986-1996 andincreasedto anaverage of4.4 percentthe following
decade (1996-2006), reaching 6.8 percent in2006. Similarly, annual growth of GDP per
capita averaged 1.9 percent during 1986-96, increasedto an averageof2.4 percentthe
following decade, andreacheda level of 4.9 percent in2006 (World Bank, 2005).
BetweenFY96-00 the poverty incidence rate declined from 19.4 percentto 16.7 percent,
likely attributable inpart to overall economic growthduring that period. Butthere are
important disparities across regions. UpperEgypt, the poorestregion, grew at a slower
rate than Lower andMetropolitan Egypt, andpoverty increasedthere.

 POPULATIONINEGYPT

 1.5     According to the results ofthe most recent (2006) census, Egypt's resident
 population in2006 was 72.6 million,' ofwhich 31.O million (43 percent) were urbanand
 41.6 (57 percent) rural. Between 1991and2006, Egypt's resident population grew by
 almost 20 million, a 37 percent increase, andthe urban-ruralbreakdownof Egypt's
population remainedvirtually unchanged. The rate ofnatural increase o f Egypt's
 populationappearsto be slowing down. Between 1991and 2004, the crude birthrate
 declinedfrom 30 to 26 per 1000population, while the crude death rate declined, mainly
 inthe 199Os, fiom 7.2 to 6.4 per 1000.

GOVERNMENT'S       RESPONSE

 1.6     The Governmentof Egypt (GoE) has longrecognized the implications ofrapid
population growth on the social andeconomic developmentprospectso fEgypt andhas
supporteda national population policy for well over 40 years2 Already in 1953 the
National Commission for PopulationAffairs consideredpopulation growthto be an
obstacleinraising overall standardsof living. This view is also reflectedinthe GoE's
 1995 Letter ofHealth Sector Policy, which stated that population growth is "...one o f the
central constraints to Egypt's per capitaincome, productivity, education andhealth"
(World Bank, 1996). Growingpressure on Egypt's limited arable landandthe highcost
of bringing newlandinto productionwere also concerns (Cochrane and Massiah, 1994).
Egyptwas one ofthe first countriesto adopt formal populationpolicies andobjectives
andpopulation continuesto be accordedhighest priorityby the highest levels of
government. National efforts, supportedby bilateral andmultilateral assistance, have
culminated inwell-documented increasesincontraceptiveprevalence rates and declines
infertility, butgainshavediffered: acrossregions, betweenurbanandruralareas, across
levels ofeducationandacross income groups. Poor, less educatedwomen, ruralresidents
andresidentsofthe RegionofUpperEgypthavemuchless favorable population
indicatorsthanthe national average.

1.7     In1993, the year priorto projectpreparation, aMinistry ofPopulationandFamily
Planning (MoPFP) was created, givingpopulation a direct voice inthe Cabinet andthe
long-existing National Population Council (NPC) was reorganizedto serve as athink-
tank onpopulation issues. This alsofacilitatedthe preparationofthe landmark
InternationalConferenceon Population andDevelopment (ICPD), which was held in
Cairo in 1994. In1996the MoPFP was mergedinto the Ministry o f Healthandthe
MinistryofHealthandPopulation(MoHP) was thus created. This was inresponseto the

SUPPORTOFOTHER PARTNERS

1.9      The three mainpartners financing population activities at the time ofproject
design were: the UnitedNations PopulationFund(UNFPA, supporting management
capacity building); the UnitedStates Agency for International Development (USAID,
supporting contraceptivesandfamily planningservices), andthe EuropeanUnion(EU,
supporting reproductive health services).

WORLD BANKSUPPORT

1.10     IDAhadfinancedtwo populationprojects inthe late 1970s/early 1980s, whose
mainobjectives (to improve andexpandfamily planning services) were not achieved.
Evaluation ofthe first Population Project (for which aUS$5 millionIDA credit was
approvedinOctober 1973 andclosedinJune 1979) was fiustrated by the failure to define
quantitativeobjectives. Itwas credited withhavingcontributed to the development and
maintenanceofhealthinfrastructure, the promotion of home-visiting andthe
strengtheningofthe MoH's capacityto formulate andimplement projects. Serious cost
over-runs were tracedto implementationdelays that ultimately ledto reduction of the
scale ofthe project. The completionreport cited four lessons: (a) the Borrower and IDA
should reacha clear agreement on the project log frame; (b) atime-phased
implementationplanshouldbeprepared; (c) an early reconciliation ofBank and
Governmentprocedureswould avoid implementation delays; and (d) details o f innovative



 The consensusofICPD was to addresspopulationgrowthandfertility reductionthrough (a) abroader
sexual and reproductivehealth agenda, deliveredthrough primaryhealthcare services, including
reproductive healthservicesand family planning(includingsafe abortion andthe eliminationofFGM); and
(b) interventionsbeyondhealthand family planningthat wouldaddressdeterminantsofhighfertility,
including:poverty eradication, sustainable economic development, girls education,gender equity and
equality, food security, humanresources developmentand humanrights.

    activities (inthis case home-visiting) should beworked out inadvance. These lessonsare
    inpartattributableto the Bank's relativeinexperienceinlendingfor population!

    1.11     The SecondPopulationProject (for which a US$25 millionIDA credit was
    approved inOctober 1978 andclosedinMarch 1986) was cancelled due to limited
    progressafter 7 years o fimplementation. Itwas plagued by a lack o f commitment to the
    objectives among staff o f the health service, managerialdifficulties, anddoubts among
    health officials about the importance o f family planningandpopulation objectives. The
    completion report drew a numberof lessons :(a) IDA haslimited leveragewith which to
    redefine the priorities o fthe Govemment ofEgypt;' (b) projects should start small and
    establisha solid base for reforms; (c) implementing agencies should be involved in
   planninganddesigning major innovations; (d) the implementationcapacity ofthe MoH
    should berealistically appraised; and(e) the Bank should not expect intensive
    supervision to substitute for good planning andclear understandingswith implementing
   authorities.

   4This project, the Bank's eight investment inpopulation, was approved less than three years after the
  Bank's fitst population investment (Jamaica PopulationProject, approved inJune 1970). The first five
  years o fthe Bank's work inpopulation was characterized by "hardware" projects that emphasizedthe
  construction o f facilities and development o fpost partumprograms as channels for attracting family
  planningacceptors.
"-  Inthe 1970sEgypt's FamilyPlanningBoardintroducedaprogramto encourage fertility decline by small-
  scale development projects, a reflectiono fthe Bucharest PopulationConference dictum that "development
  is the best contraceptive." An evaluation o fthis program several years later revealed that it had little
  impact on fertility (Cochrane and Massiah, 1994).

 2.3        The logicofthis design(Table 2.1) is groundedinevidencedocumentedinthe
 World Bank's WorldDevelopment Report, 1984,which addressedthe theme of
 "Population Changeand Development." Itdistilled researchthat pointed to factors which
 influence lower fertility, notably: reductions ininfant andchildmortality; increase in
 income; educatedparents; women's employment and status; urbanresidence; efficient
 marketsandsecurity; increasedage at marriage; breastfeeding; andaccessto quality
 family planning informationand services (Annex D). It also emphasizesthat demand-
 side and supply-sideinterventions are complementary and synergistic and, together, have
 hadpowerful effectson outcomes. The design logic also respondsto the ICPD consensus
 (para. 1.7).

 2.4        The project's supportwas organized around two components(Box 2-2). The
 first component was designedto supportthe preparation andimplementation of a
 business planto definethe work ofthe newly establishedMOWand a strategy for
 buildingneededcapacityto complementanongoingUNFPA-funded Management
 Development Project, slatedto be completed in 1997.8 The secondcomponentwas
 designedas a smallgrantsprogramto finance community-level subprojectsaimed at
 stimulating demandfor family planning. Its geographic focus was on Rural Upper Egypt,
 where fertility was highanddemandfor family planningservices was low. At appraisal
 it was estimatedthat the PAPwould finance around 100projects over five years. Itwas
 also assumedthat USAID'Ssubstantial support to primary health care andfamily


 as will promote smaller families and create social conditions conducive to lower fertility, all inaccordance
 with the Population Policy Statement."

CapacityBuilding (US$2.6 million, 13 percent o ftotal): This component aimed to enhanceMoHPRS
capacity to: (a) conduct highlevel advocacy andresearch; (b) undertake strategic leadership o fplanning,
managementand interdepartmental coordination; (c) monitor andevaluate overall progress; (d) mobilize
andallocate resourcesefficiently; and(e) support NGOandlocalcommunity initiatives. Support included:
training, technical assistance, policy studies, vehicles, office equipment, furniture andmaterial.

PopulationActivitiesProgram (PAP) (US$l8.1 million, 87 percent o ftotal): This component was
designedto finance grants to NGOs, local community organizations and public sector agenciesto support
activities to: increase awareness, strengthen motivationfor couplesto plansmaller families andfacilitate
access to anduse o freproductive health services.

PROJECTMANAGEMENT               AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

2.5         CapacityBuilding. A Project Implementation Unit(PIU) inthe Office ofthe
Undersecretaryfor Population andFamily Planning, Mom, was given responsibility for
implementation ofthis component. Functions included: recruitment andmanagementof
consultants, managementofproject-financed training, project procurement, financial
managementandreporting.

2.6         PAPSmall Grants.The PAPwas to bemanagedby aPopulationProgramto be
establishedwithinthe Social Fundfor Development (SFD). Itsresponsibilities included:
funds management, managementandsupport of grantees, promotionandoutreach,
subprojectappraisal, field supervision, and regular reporting. Inaddition to Population
Program swing, apopulation officer was assignedto work ineach of the eight
governorateoffices ofthe SFD inUpper Egypt. Generalmanagementand oversight was
to beprovided by an Executive Committee chaired by (and accountableto) the Minister
ofHealthandPopulation andcomprised o f four other committee members, including at
leastone representativeo fthe SFD andothers as seen fit bythe Executive Committee.
The Committee was also responsible for approval ofthe first 10 submitted subprojects
andall thoseamountingto LE65,000 or more.' ProjectApproval Committees were also
to be set upat the Governorate level, responsible for: approval ofprojects lessthanLE
65,000 (after the initial 10 approved by the Executive Committee); promotion and
outreach; and semi-annual portfolio reviews. Technical rigor of PAP subprojects were to
beensuredby the population officers at the governorate level SFD offices andthe family
planningandreproductive healthofficers representingMoHP onthese Committees. The
SFD was responsiblefor reporting to the MoHPRS, which, inturn, reportedall o fthe
project activities to the Bank.

2.7         Subprojectproposalshad to meet three essentialcriteria: (1) a reasonable
probability to reduce fertility preferencesandto beof sufficient scope andweight (by


 Equivalent to about US$20,000 at the time o fproject design.

   themselves or inconnection with other interventions) to affect fertility; (2) demonstration
   ofcommunity commitment; and(3) demonstrationthat the proposalwould be effectively
   implemented. Inaddition, the following were to be favorably considered: targeting of
   lower-income populations; the presenceof adequatecontraceptive supply to ensure the
   satisfactionofincreaseddemand; sustainability ofactivities and/or effects beyondgrant
   termination; a favorable impact on healthandwelfare, inaddition to fertility impact; and
   synergiesof activities withinaproposal or withother development initiatives. Itwas
   expectedthat most grants would not exceedLE65,000 andwould be implemented intwo
   years or less.

   2.8          Risks. The mainrisks identifiedduring project design were: the difficulty of
   establishingan effective public sector organization inEgypt; insufficient subprojects
   demand, selectivity and/or implementation; andinaccessibility ofeffective family
   planning servicesto new clients. The project sought to mitigate these risks by: anup-
   front agreementon the functions, managementand staffing o f the newPopulationand
   Family PlanningDepartment inthe MoHP; the developmentof apipelineo f subprojects
   andclear criteria for their approval andimplementation; the provision oftechnical
   support to NGOs; andexpanding the role ofNGOsandthe private sector infamily

.  planningservice delivery andreliance on significant USAIDinvestmentinMoHP clinics
   to strengthen the supply of family planningservices.


   3, IMPLEMENTATIONAND COSTS

   3.1          AppraisedinJuly 1995, the Populationproject was declaredeffective onJune
   24,1998, more thantwo years after its March 1996approval by the Bank." Itwas
    launchedat awidely attendedconference held inOctober 1998 and implementedover a
   period of six years andnine months, closing on March31,2005, after two extensions."
   GoErequestedathirdextension to permit the use of cost savings due to exchangerate
   fluctuations, but this was denied by the Bank.12The mid-term review (MTR) was heldin
   June 2002, almost four years later thanthe initialdate ofOctober 1998.

   PLANNEDVERSUSACTUALCOSTSAND FINANCING

   3.2          The total project cost is estimatedat US$17.7 million or 86 percent ofthe cost
   estimatedat appraisal (Table 3.1). The Capacity Buildingcomponent cost over two and
   one halftimes the original estimate, while the actual cost of the PAP componentwas 65


    10The IDA creditwas approvedby the Prime Minister and sent for Parliamentaryratification inMay 1997,
   but was not yet forwardedto the National Assembly by the third extension deadline. On February25,
    1998, on an exceptionalbasis, Regionalmanagementapproveda fourth extension(to June 30, 1998).
   While effectivenessdelays were commonin Egypt's portfolio at the time, projectfiles do indicate that the
   approvalprocesswas held up inthe Prime Minister's office because of Government's concernabout the
   use ofan IDA credit for technicalassistance andtraining. See also para. 3.3.
   I' The first extension (from December 31,200 1to December31,2003) was granted around the time of
   projecteffectivenessto compensate for the delayed effectiveness. The second (15-month extension)
   extensionwas grantedinlate 2003 onthe basisof QER recommendationsandthe satisfactionof a
   RemedialAction Planto accelerate implementationand disbursements.

 percent ofthe estimate at appraisal. O fthe original IDA credit amount of 11.9 million
  SDR, 87percent (10.4 millionSDRs) was disbursedandthe remaining amount (1.5
 million SDRs) was cancelled(Annex E, Table E-2).13 Government counterpart funding
  amountedto US$1.9 million versus the plannedamount o fUS$1.6 million. Beneficiaries
  contributed an estimatedUS$1.O millionequivalent. While this amount i s about halfof
 the plannedbeneficiary contribution (US$l.9 million), it does represent about 10percent
 ofthe total costs of the subprojects financed, meetingthe requirementsunder the project
 design.

 3.3         The Population project was implementedlargely as planned, with a few
 exceptions. First, at credit effectiveness(June 1998) the consultantsandtraining
 category was decreasedby 77 percent (from 0.9 million SDRs to 0.2 million SDRs) and
 thegoods categorywas increasedby 700,000 SDRsto provide for the financing of
 ambulancesandtechnical equipment for maternalcare and family planning services in
 UpperEgypt." This amendmentalso specifiedthat under ComponentBthe project
 could finance smallgrants for micro development activities commensurate with
 population andfamily planningactivities proposedby communities. Second, at the time
 ofthe MTR (June 2002) the Bankandthe GoE agreedthat capacity buildingefforts
 shouldbetar etedmoreto the regional level insteado fan almost exclusive focus onthe
 central levelf6 Third, in2003 another amendment provided for the procurement of
 several years worth ofnational needs for IUDsand insertion kits, inpreparation for the
 withdrawal ofUSAID support to Egypt's population sector."

 IEG's attemptto documentand quantifyproject inputs,activitiesand outputs, based on evidence collected.
 However,some informationgaps couldnot be filled, largely due to the fact that Government'sprojectfiles
 couldnot be locatedand made availableto IEG,despite severalrequestswhile inthe field.
 IsIEG's review ofevidence indicatesthat this reallocationwas likely promptedby the Prime Minister's
resistanceto the use ofthe IDA creditfor trainingandtechnical assistance andto the discomfortofthe new
Minister ofHealthand Population's about the small size and software content ofthe capacity building
'component(managed by MoPH) incontrast to the large size ofthe componentto bemanagedby the SFD.
 16This was basedon experience ofPAP implementationandneeds identifiedat the regionallevel andon
the reasonabledecisionnotto invest heavilyinMoHPPS ingeneraland inthe NGO departmentin

p7 The goods category was increasedby SDR 3.62 million and the unallocated and subprojectsgrants
categorieswere decreasedby 1.07 million SDRs and 2.55 million SDRs, respectively.

say here that: (a) this component, as originally designed, was only partially implemented;
(b) IEGwas unableto find aquantification of actualconsultant services, training and
studies delivered; and(c) only 24 percent ofthe initialallocation for consultantsand
training (900,000 SDRs) was actually used for this purpose. Nevertheless, the actual cost
of this component was two andone halftimes the original estimatebecauseof greater
thananticipatedsupply-sideinvestments, specifically the procurementofcontraceptives
andthe refbrbishmentandequipmentofrural facilities (paras. 3.3 and 5.11).

3.5          PopulationActivitiesProgram Against anoriginal estimateof 100, atotal of
55 subprojects were implementedover four phases." The activities andoutputs of
subprojects are discussedandlinkedto project objectives inChapter 5, with further detail
on the design, approachandcontent of subprojects provided inFigure D.l inAnnex D.
While the first phasewas initially slatedto be launchedin1997, subprojectproposal
solicitation, appraisal and implementationwere delayed, frrst due to the delayed
effectivenessdate andthendue to delays inlaunchingthe process(training, information
campaigns, identification of capableNGOs, etc., settingupproposalevaluation
committees). Eachphase employedarefined model for the collaboration with civil
society, attempting to improve onthe previous phases withregardto subproject
management andoversight andefforts to improve community targetingandoutreach
(Table 3.2).

3.6          The subproject cycle evolved during the project life as refinements were
introduced with experience andlessons. Ingeneral, deprivedareas (withhighfertility
indicators) were identified onthe basis ofapopulation database. NGOs withrelevant
experience would be identifiedand encouragedto prepareand submit proposals, with
technical assistanceprovidedby SFD. Contracts would bepreparedonthe basis of
approved subprojects.l9 Projectidentification, preparation, appraisalandapproval were
implementedwith longdelays andthe roles o fthe Executive and Governorate
committees were slow to activate.20 By the time of Phase4 the following steps hadbeen
distilled andnow serve as amodel for SFD: (i)            project site identification; (ii)    contracting
the NGO/CBO; (iii)       approvalof subproject action plan; (iv) community profiling; (v) pre-
intervention assessment (baselinedata collection); (vi) scopingof priorities throughjoint


18 Fewer projects were implementedthanplanned becauseo f (a) slower than anticipated start-upo f initial
subprojects approvaland implementation; (b) the clustering inPhase4 o f a small network o fcommunity
development associations andtheir activities into one subproject under the managemento f an experienced

with. While the Operational Manualwas respected, the MoHP was delayed in
commissioning anindependentevaluation o fthe program.

3.8        Procurement. Procurement under the capacity building componentwas
initiallyfoundto beunsatisfactory becauseMoHP's Central ProcurementDepartment
confusedIDA and Egyptianprocurement guidelines andprocedures, a phenomenon ifits
limitedcapacity inprocurement andmanagement. The Bankrespondedby providing
neededtraining andworkshops inprocurement andcontinued withperiodic reviews and
feedback; andthe PIUemployed a qualified procurement expert, familiar withBank
procedures. These actions ultimatelyledto a satisfactory ratingofprocurement activities
underthis component. SFD, responsible for the PAPcomponent, was found by a Bank
post-review missionto have unsatisfactory procurement performance. The appointment
oftwo seasonedprocurement officers under the SFD's GeneralProjectsDepartment
(responsiblefor supervision o fthe Population Unitof SFD) helpedto improve
procurementcapacity. Procurementprocessesundertakenat the NGO levelwere
examinedby IDAat the MTRandfound to be satisfactory. However, the following year
SFDprocurementactivities were found againto beunsatisfactory. Simplified
procurementproceduresfor NGOs, acceptable to IDA, were developed to expedite
subproject implementation. This, combined withtraining for NGOsand SFD Population
officers inregional offices on local shopping procedures, was effective inimproving
procurementperformance

3.9       FinancialManagement. The PIUof MoHPhad good performancewith
unqualified audit reports. In2003 the PIUfinance managerresignedtojoin another
Bank-financedhealthproject (Health SectorReform Project         -- HSRP)   andanew finance
officer was recruitedto undertakeproject financial management. Weaknesses inthe
internal control systemwere identifiedinanaudit, which the PIUundertook to resolve.
Intheearly yearsofthe projectthe financial managementsystemat SFD was weak with
regardto its: (i) reporting andrecording capabilities; (ii) internal control systems; (iii)
internal audit function; and(iv) compliance issues identifiedby external auditors. In
2002/03, following managementchangesat SFD, a numbero f stepswere taken to
address weaknesses, notably: hiringo f competent managerandstaff o f internal audit
department; the releaseo f a completeset offinancial managementreports inaccordance
withBank's guidelines; the recruitment ofanewfinance director andrestructuringof
SFDto enhanceits autonomy. Continued efforts onthe partof SFDto improve its
financial management(hiringofmore than 10qualifiedinternal auditors; creatingatask
force to generatefinancial managementreports for the project; andreceiving an
unqualified audit report in2003) causedthe SFD financial systemto be satisfactoryinthe
end.

3.10      Disbursementswere extremely slow, reaching alevel of lessthan30percent
some four years into project implementation. Improvements andstreamlining inapproval
processes, withdrawal applications andprocurement did serve to accelerate
disbursementspost-MTR.


4. MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

DESIGN

4.1       The design ofmonitoring andevaluation (M&E) focused exclusively onthe
second objective ofthe project: to stimulate the desire for smaller families, an increased
use of contraceptivesand a decline infertility. There was no specific design underthe
project to monitor or evaluate the objective to strengthenthe role and hctioningofthe
MoHP. As such, M&Edesign encompassed(a) the monitoring of individualsubprojects;
(b) themonitoring ofsubproject implementationas awhole; (c) the evaluation of
subprojects' effects and cost-effectiveness; and(d) the distillation o f lessonsemanating
from experience. Eachgrantee was responsiblefor subproject monitoring; andproposals
were expectedto include a monitoring planandmonitoring indicators specific to the
particular activities proposed andtheir linksto fertility-related objectives. Overall
programmonitoring was envisagedto track the coverageofvillages, the number of
proposals submittedand approved, the number of projects implementedcompleted and
projects' ratings (on the basis ofcriteria tailored for eachindividualproject).

4.2       Six key performance indicators were identifiedinthe designdocument (World
Bank, 1996): threetracking fertility preferences(desired number ofchildren, approvalof
family planning, andintention to use contraception among non-users); andthree tracking
resultingbehavior andoutcome (contraceptiveprevalence, contraceptive discontinuation
rate, andtotal fertility). DHSandother national survey data were envisagedto be
exploited, and supplementedwith two evaluation surveys tracking the impacts of

                                                  12


subprojects, the first to document progressat the mid-termreview, andthe secondto feed
into the end-of-project evaluation. The evaluation ofprogram interventions was
envisagedto assess the impact of local-level interventions inthose communities and
compare outcomeswith communities inUpperEgypt not benefiting from projects
through statistical analyses, drawing on DHSandother data sourcesand including
multivariate analysis to isolate project effects. A few qualitative studies focused on
particular communities were plannedto supplement the two above-cited surveys,
enabling the tracking ofa project's intervention over time inselectedcommunities to
establishbaseline conditions and assess how they changedover time. A review of
relevant sociological literature on key determinantsof fertility was also envisaged.

4.3         MOWwas responsiblefor supervisingallmonitoringandevaluationactivities.
Itwasto carry out themonitoringactivities itself, withassistancefromthe SFD. The
evaluation was to be contractedout to a well qualifiedagency that would carry out all
aspects of the two surveys on subproject interventions: designingthe sample andthe
questionnaire; recruiting, training andsupervising field staff; data entry andverification;
analysis; andreport writing. The in-depth community studies were also slatedto be
contracted out.

IMPLEMENTATION

4.4         Implementation ofM&E(a) provedto bemore difficult than envisaged, (b)
experienced significant delays, and(c) fell short ofinitialplans. Just after project
effectiveness(late 1998)internal Bankreporting indicated that arrangementsto render
the M&Esystem operational were proceeding satisfactorily. Almost two years later, in
August 2000 (whensubprojects implementation was actually launched), the selection of
indicators for subprojectmonitoring andevaluation was reportedto be "still under
discussion" andthe M&Esystem hadnot yet beenestablished. Itwas only in2001, some
three years after project effectiveness, that the PIUestablishedaM&Eunitwiththe
mandateto develop an M&Esystem. That same year the SFD's PopulationUnitwas
reportedto be developing anM&Esystemfor the subprojects. Inearly 2002 the M&E
systemfor the subprojects still hadnot been developed?'

4.5         The MTRtook place inJune 2002 without the benefit ofplanned studies
(baseline surveys andcompilation o f lessons, amongothers), andnotedthe persistent lack
o f an adequately functioning M&Esystem andthe failure to incorporate fully into the
project appropriate (sub)project indicators. The intention to launchandimplement an
M&E systemwas againarticulated atthe MTRworkshop andinBank's communications
with Government. Although the baselinesurveys insubproject villages were not
undertaken priorto the MTR, a consultant was recruited to assess the three ongoing pilot
projects (under phase 1) andproduced areview o fexperience as an input to the MTR.
Finally, in2003, some five years after effectivenessandthree years after subprojects


*'InternalBankreportingrevealedthat the estimatedbudgetfor the M&E consultantwas limitedanddid
notpermitthe identificatiodrecmitmentofa qualifiedM&E consultant, and, as a consequence,the SFD
was pursuingthe possibilityof incorporatingthe subproject M&Erequirementsinto an M&E tool that was
beingdevelopedfor the SFDas a whole. The Bank didnotsucceedinits effortto mobilizetrust fund
support for M&E.

                                                  13


launch (a) the baselinesurveys insubproject villages were undertakenand (b) a                 a

consultant was recruited to documentthe lessons of experienceunder the subprojects.
The secondround of survey work was carried out in2004. The 2003 and2004 datasets
cover only Phases 2 and 3 ofthe four phasesof subprojects and were not insync withthe
pre-project andend-project timeframes22andthus were unable to document evidence of
subproject impact. Under the oversight ofthe PIUMoHP, dataon CPR and utilization of
family planningservices were compiled inall districts where the project intervened.
However, district data is not disaggregatedby village andthus does not reveal trends in
villages (individually or collectively) coveredby the subprojects, or compare them with
trends invillages not coveredby subprojects.

4.6        The two sets ofdata (project-level household survey andMoHP district data)
have only two years (2003,2004) andtwo indicators incommon (contraceptive useand
utilization of family planning services). The definitiono fthese two indicators andthe
basisonwhichthey are calculated(methodology for data collection, specification ofthe
numeratorsand denominators) are not well documented, raising issues ofdata
qualityheliability and comparability. Datawere not collected on key componentsof the
results chain that would havehelpedestablishplausible links betweenproject
interventions, andthe extent to which they influenced changes inattitude andbehavior.
Changes inattitudes were not systematically monitored, although some anecdotal
information is available (perspectiveso fbeneficiaries, social change agents, andservice
providers). The cost-effectivenessof subprojects was not assessed, as planned.23M&E
efforts didnot take into account other demand-sidestimulation activities financed by
other partners providing support inUpperEgypt24andor other changes insocio-
economic status that are likely also to have stimulated changes inattitudes or behaviors.
An opportunity was thus missed to document the cost-effectiveness o f demand-side
innovations acrossprojects that couldhave enhancedknowledge of what works in
particular contexts andinfluencedprograms andpolicies. At the project's end, the PIU
didnot commission anindependentevaluation as hadbeenenvisagedunderthe design,
nor was the plannedliterature review on key determinants offertility ever carried out.

USEOFDATA DECISION-MAKING
                 FOR

4.7       Becauseof issues inthe choice of indicators and inthe relevance of data,
utilization of data for decision-making was limited. The evaluation o fthe lessonsof each
subprojectphase commissionedunderthe project providedanopportunity for learning
andfine-tuningthe approach, which was well exploited, as evidencedinthe refinements
andimprovements ofthe approachwitheachnewphase. The collection ofdataon CPR
andFPutilization keptactivities andimplementers focusedoneffecting changes inthese
indicators. Butthe failure to collectlanalyze data on the various components o fthe
results chainundermined the systematicdocumentation o fproject impact and,
consequently, the use of datafor decision-making.


22Phase2 and3 subprojects were implementedduringthe respectiveperiods of2001-2004 and2002-2004.
23An assessment ofplannedvs. unitcostswas undertakenthat calculatedthe numberofbeneficiaries
covered, but effectiveness(number ofbeneficiariesadoptingcontraceptiveuse, for example) was not
assessed.

 5. OUTPUTSAND OUTCOMESBYOBJECTIVE25

 OBJECTWE #I:      IMPROVEM O W ' S MANAGEMENT OFPOPULATION/FAMILY PLANNING

 5.1       No specific indicators for this objective were identifiedduring project design. It
 was anticipatedthat they would be identified inYear 1through the preparation of athree-
 year business planfor institutional strengtheningofcentral-level MoHP. IEGwas unable
 to obtain acopy ofthis document andfound no evidencethat it was ever produced. The
 following provides a summary o f capacity andinstitutional strengtheningsupport and
 outcomes.

 5.2       In line with a decisiontaken at theproject's mid-term review,project support
topopulation capacity building was reoriented awayfrom the initial design's support to
 central-levelMoHP,focusing instead on thegovernorate, district and communitylevels
 within rural UpperEgypt.

 5.3       Theprojectprovided training and technicalassistance to variousgroups of
local-level actors to strengthentheir respective capacitiesin theplanning, design,
delivery and oversightof population andfamily planning information and services.
 Withregard to MoHP stafi some 683 doctors, nurses andmidwives working inclinics
responsiblefor servingclients inareas of subproject interventionreceivedtrainingunder
the project infamily planning service delivery, which emphasizedservicequality and
client orientationandworking inpartnership with community-basedorganizations and
other civil society actors to achieve a better synergy betweendemand- and supply-side
efforts. Reproductive healthand family planning supervisors at the governorateand
district level offices o f MoHP also receivedtraining andtechnical support fromthe
governorate-levelSFD to enable them to serve as trainers and supervisors o f these front-
line serviceproviders. NGO administrators,fznancial oficers and supervisors were
trained inthe design, oversight andsupervision o f subproject activities. Close technical
support andoversight ofNGO staffprovided bythe SFD also contributed to the capacity
buildingobjective by facilitating a guided learning-by-doing approach. Unfortunately,
IEGcouldnot finda full quantification ofproject-financed training provided to staff and
managersofdecentralizedlevels o fMoHPando fNGOsandother community-based
organizations. Furthermore, there was no evidence thatsuch training was ever
evaluatedto documentits impact in termsof the acquisitionand applicationof new
knowledge and capacities.

5.4        Theproject developed a new cadre of social change agents toserve as an
interface between women living in target communities@otentialclients) andfront line
services. The project recruitedandtrained 3,085 social change agents(SCAs). These
women, selectedfrom the communities inwhich they worked, hadthe credibility to reach
the targetwomen andlinkthemwith (a) the benefits ofthe subprojects(microcredits,
literacy training, home visits, informationand supportregarding family health and
wellbeing) and(b) the information, counseling andother servicesprovidedby local
health andfamily planningclinics. Interviews withbeneficiaries andfield observations



25Annex Hpresents a matrixof actual outcomes against objectivesand targets set.

                                              15


revealedthat SCAshadestablisheda highlevel of trust andcredibility with the women
they were serving andthat their services were highlyappreciated. Another significant
indication o fthis level ofappreciation (among many observedandexpressed) is the
women's decisionat the end ofthe subproject support to increasethe interest rateofthe
microcredits made available to them inorder to continue the remuneration(andthus the
services) o f SCAs. An independentevaluationfound SCAs to be avital link betweenthe
community andthe service points for the poor andkey to increasingdemand for services
(Georgetown University, 2007).

5.5       By nature of its innovativedesign and approach, theproject was instrumental
inforging effective partnershipsat the local level between MoHP, theSFD and NGOs
and other community members in theplanning, design and delivery of population and
family planning activities in selected districtsand villagesin Upper Egypt. As
illustrated inFigureD.1, Annex D, SFD andMoHP: (a) collaboratedinthe identification
and selection of CDAs for implementingactivities; (b) collaboratedwith the selected
CDAs ina dissemination conferenceto informandinvolve local leadersinpopulation
activities; (c) maintainedeffective partnershipsduringimplementation addressingboth
supply anddemandissues andensuringtheir appropriatenessto local needsand
conditions; and (d) together with the CDAscollected data to evaluate subproject
interventions. While, inthe initial stages ofproject implementation, the M o mwas not
fully convinced ofthe benefits ofpartneringwithNGOs, partnershipandcollaboration
betweenMoHP andNGOs at the local level have improved over time as the effectiveness
of suchcollaborationwas demonstrated. A review of lessons ofthe first three phases of
subprojects documentsthe evolution towards regular meetings among the three main
partners o fthe project (SFD, MoHP andthe CDA[s]) andthe resultant revival inMoHPs'
role intechnical supervision andimplementation (Center for Development Studies,
2005). Fieldinterviewsandvisits conductedinruralUpper Egyptrevealedstrong
collaboration and synergy amongthese actors. Further evidenceof improved
partnerships is that, inmore than 50 districts inUpperEgypt where the project
intervened, annual populationplansare routinely andjointly preparedby: local
authorities, MoHP managersand staff, SFD andNGOs and civil society, includingthe
SCAs.

5.6       Theproject has been less successful in supporting and institutionalizing
MoHPpartnerships withNGOs and civilsociety organizationsat the centrallevel. An
NGO Support Departmentwas createdinMoHP for population, but never becamefully
functional. MoHP's current organigramme (source: WHO 2006) does include a General
Departmentfor FamilyPlanning Servicesinthe Private andNGOs Sector. This
departmenthasprovided supply-side supportto NGO family planning clinics operating in
Egypt, including the establishmentand dissemination o f national service quality
standardsandthe provision o ftrainedphysicians to someNGOclinics, at their request.
On the other hand, the definitionand institutionalization o fthe role ofNGOs inplanning
andpolicy formulation andindemand-sidestimulation were relatively neglectedduring
the project period. The institutional home and accountabilities for demand-side
interventions are still not specified inthe organigramme. The intentionto partnerwith
NGOs is articulated inMoHP's April 2005 document, "Facing Population Challengesin

                                                  16


 PartnershipwithNGOs,'' which draws onproject experience.26 Governmenthas noted in
 its comments (Annex I) activities of the NGO GeneralDepartmentto strengthen
                           current
 partnershipandnetworking withNGOs, including ongoing efforts to involve NGOs more
 l l l y inpolicy formulation andimplementationandinthe stimulationofdemandfor
 familyplanning.

 5.7        Notwithstandingits support to the implementationof project-specificM&E,
 theproject was unsuccessful in strengtheningMoHP'scapacity to monitor and
 evaluatethe overallprogress of nationalpopulation andfamily planning efforts. DHS
 data are usedfor tracking outcome (andsome output) indicators, andMoHP datatrack a
number ofserviceprovisionindicators, butthe componentsofaresults chain appear to
havebeenneither defined nor tracked. IEG's review of evidence has indicatedthat
monitoring andevaluationofpopulation andfamily planninginterventions are largely
undertakenat the level ofexternally-financed projects, butnot for the program as a
whole.

5.8         Withproject support MoHP acquiredthe capacity toprocure contraceptives
through a competitiveprocess and enhanced its contraceptivesecurity through the
purchase of severalyearssupply of contraceptives. Inlighto fthe gradualpullingout of
USAIDassistancefromthepopulationandfamily planning sector, theproject's purchase
of contraceptivesavoided apossible rupture inthe supply o f contraceptives. MoHP
procuredthe contraceptivesfor the frst time with the intensive training, coaching and
support o fthe Bank, which ultimately establishedtheir capacity to assume this
responsibility. Previously, MoHP relied onUNFPA, which undertook procurement o f
contraceptiveson their behalf, andon USAID, which supplied contraceptivesinkind. It
is significant to note that duringthis time MoHP benefitedfrom supplementalsupport
from USAIDto help Egypt achievesustainable contraceptive security (Ainsworth and
Dickens, 2004).

OBJECTIVE#2: PROMOTELOWERFERTILITYAND HIGHER CONTRACEPTIVE USEIN
RURALUPPER        EGYPT

5.9        Inassessingattributionofoutcomesrelatedto this objective, itis important to
note, over and above the data limitations (Chapter 4), that (a) the project's coverage was
modest, supporting activities in 148villages or less than 10percent of all 1700villages in
the Regionof UpperEgypt; (b) the duration ofthe subprojectintervention was short (two
to three years) relative to the overall project life of sevenyears; (c) other partners were
providingsimilar demand-sidestimulation andsupply-side interventions for advancing
the populationagendainRuralUpperEgypt duringtime periods overlapping withthe
project:'   and(d) other social development supportthat would havehadanimpact on
attitudes andbehaviors (poverty alleviation, employmentlmicrocredit, literacy training,
among other development activities) were also ongoing. Nevertheless, the project's
contribution to outcomesinRural Upper Egyptis greater thanits impact on the 148

villages of direct intervention. Prior to this project, population activities were largely
limitedto supply-side interventions. Evidencecompiled by IEGsuggeststhat the
project's innovative designinfluencedother major demand-sideinterventions inRural
UpperEgypt(particularly those supportedbyUSAIDandthe EU)?' This section
documents outcomes for Rural Upper Egypt. To the extent datapermitit also documents
changes inindicators indistricts and villages ofdirect project intervention. Annex G
presents amatrix summarizing outcomes againsttargets and objectives. For reasons
noted inChapter 4, these data must be interpretedcautiously.

5.10      Theproject wassuccessful in establishing a community-basedapproachfor
reachingtargetgroups with apackage of information and support services that are
known to influence changesin desiredfamily size and increased use of modern
contraception(WDR, 1984). Fifty-five subprojects, designedandmanagedby
community development associations (CDAs), were implemented inthe poorestvillages
ofRural Upper Egypt. These subprojects supportedactivities to improve the family
planningandreproductive healthknowledgebaseofwomen ofreproductive age,
especially younger, low parity women, andto stimulate a demandfor smaller family size
andthe use ofmodemcontraception. The four phases ofproject design and
implementation permittedrefinementsinthe approachas well as inthe content of
projects, but essentially the support consistedofthe following elements. A dissemination
conference held after contract signature withNGOsKDAswas instrumental incatalyzing
the support and collaboration of local level leaders, actors and stakeholders (including
MOW,localcommunity andexecutiveleaders, the SFDandthe Association[s]) around
the project objectives ensuringboth coordination and synergy between those working on
demandstimulation andthose working onthe supply ofservices. Training wasprovided
to all critical actors involved ineachproject: serviceproviders at local healthfacilities
(doctors, nurses, midwives); community-basedoutreachworkers andtheir field
supervisors; andproject administrators andfinancial officers.          The mainoutreach
activities included: homevisits (targeting women ofreproductive age [especially
younger, lower parity women], andtheir husbandsandmothers-in-law, whose influence
ontheir reproductive healthdecisionsis significant); the organization o fhealth
conferencesincommunities andthe encouragemento f healthy behaviors; the provision
ofmicrocredits for women; literacy classes andother activities to promote women's
income generation (crafts, day care); andthe encouragementof increaseduse of local
health services for maternalandchildhealth care, inadditionto family planning.
Subprojects ultimately supported22,400 families in 148 villages inall eight governorates
ofUpper Egypt. This translates into a 9 percentcoverage of all (1700) villages inRural
UpperEgypt. All combined, subprojectsdelivereda number ofkey outputs, including:
3.5 million home visits; 1,734 healtheducationseminars at the village level; 9,320
microcredits for women andtheir families; 300 literacy classes attendedby 5,640 women.

5.11        Theproject also improved thesupply and quality of family planning services
ofSered through thepublic healthsystem in selected villagesbenefitingfrom demand-
side interventions. While USAIDand other bilateral donors were assumedat project

 designto be covering the neededimprovements inservices access and quality, services
 were found not to beeffectively respondingto demandinareas of subproject
 intervention. Project support included the refurbishment and equipment of 105 clinics
 providing family planningservices andthe equipment of an additional 195 clinics, all
 servinginsubprojectareas. Equipmentincluded 347 ultrasound scanners and 112
 autoclavemachines(for sterilization). The project also createdandtrained apool o f 63
 family planningsupervisory teams responsible for training, supervision andtechnical
 oversight offront-line serviceproviders. The project also purchased4.25 million IUDs
 and 12,812 IUDinsertionkits in2003 to cover the needs ofEgypt's entire program for
the following few years, at atimewhenUSAIDwas gradually withdrawing itsmajor
 support. Project investmentsinupgrading o f staff skills andfixed facilities culminated in
 improved service availability andquality andincited an increaseinthe numberof clients
 (MoHP end-of-project evaluation interviews withbeneficiaries and service providers and
IEGfield visits andinterviews). Establishment ofRH/FP trainers at the district level left
aviable and efficient capacity for monitoringandupgrading service delivery skills
(interviews with SFD staff and MoHP managersand staff at the local level). The
project's investmentsinmobile clinics were found to beparticularly effective inreaching
the poorest andmost vulnerable women living inmore remote locations with family
planning information and services (Center for Development Studies, 2005; and
interviews with SCAs andbeneficiaries).

5.12      During theperiod of subproject implementationmodest advances were made
in Rural UpperEgvpt on somefactors known to influencefertility.29 Between2000 and
2005 the percent of ever-married women who cannotreadat all declined from 71 to 62
percentinRuralUpper Egypt. At the national level it also declined, but from a much
lower startingpoint    -- from  50 to 41 percent. Duringthis same period, the percent o f
ever-marriedwomen reportingthat they attendedliteracy programs increasedfrom 7 to
 13 percent inRuralUpper Egypt (compared with an increasefrom 9 to 13 percent,
nationally). This level of attendanceinRural Upper Egypt is very low, considering the
persistentlyhighlevel of illiteracy there. The medianduration o fbreastfeedinginRural
UpperEgypt increasedmodestly from 19.7to 20.1 months, comparedwiththe national
level increasefrom 17.9to 18.6months. Unemployment ofever-married women has
declinedmost rapidly between2000 and2005 amongthose from RuralUpper Egypt
(from 93 to 84 percent), comparedwiththe national trend of 82 percent in2000 and 78
percent in2005.

5.13      It isplausible to assume that subprojectssupported under thePopulation
project may have madesome contribution to these modest changesin socio-economic
indicatorsin Rural UpperEgypt. However,project attribution isdiffult to establish,
given that (a) the coverageand impact of variousinterventionswere not evaluated and
(6) numerousother investments and developmentactivitieswere ongoingin that
Region, both in the context of; and beyond, thepopulation agenda. Changes in
socioeconomicindicators have not been systematically recordedby the project inthe
villages of intervention. Neverthelessanecdotal informationprovides some evidence o f

possible impact. Beneficiary feedback3' has revealed that the microcredits, literacy
training, marketable skills training, andhealthadvice andinformation and social support
providedbythe social changeagents (all ofthese financed under subprojects) have
positively impactedthe wellbeing o fwomen living intarget villages andthat oftheir
families. They also report positive changes inthe attitudes o f their husbandswho
benefited from information campaigns andwere especially receptive to messages because
oftheir appreciation ofthe microcredits. Anecdotal evidence should not, however, be
usedto draw firm conclusions about the project's impact, inthe absence of systematic
analysis oftrend data.

5.14       Egypt has been successful in its efforts to changeattitudes of women in Rural
UpperEgypt about desiredfamily size and the use of family planning services.
Between 2000and 2005 total ~antedfirti1it-y~'declined in Rural Upper Egyptfiom 3.7
to 2.6 children, a total decrease of 1.1children (Figure 5.1). This decline was greater
thanwhat was achievedduringthe previous five-year period inRuralUpperEgypt and
also more important thanoverall national declines between2000 and2005.                  -- Inequities

reflection ofthe realities ofwomen, who may desire many children for their economic
security.

5.15       Between 2000and 2005 the use of family planning became even more
acceptable. In 2005 85 percent o fever-married women residing inRuralUpper Egypt
consideredit appropriate to use family planningafter the first birth, a significant increase
over the level of 70 percent in 2000. This increase was faster thanthat for Egypt as a
whole (from 85 to 93 percent) (Annex H,Figures H-3,H-4 and H-5). Across education
levels, the biggest increaseinacceptanceof family planning serviceswas among women
withno education(fiom 78 to 88 percent).

 5.16       However, demandfor family planning (met and unmet) increasedonly very
 modestly in Rural Upper Egvpt. Between2000 and2005 demandfor family planning
 increasedfrom 60 to 63 percent amongwomen inRuralUpper Egypt, comparedwith an
 increaseof 68 to 70 percent for all of Egypt (Annex H,FiguresH-6 andH-7).

 5.17       Trendsin behavior have revealed an increase in the use of contraceptivesin
 Rural UpperEgypt. Contraceptive prevalencerate inRural Upper Egyptrose from 40
 (CI: 37-43) to 45 (CI: 44-47) percentbetween2000 and 2005. While this increaseis
 greater thanthe national increase (from 56 [CI: 55-57] to 59 [CI: 58-60] percent), it is not
 as dramatic as the 16percent increase(from 24 [CI: 22-26] to 40 [CI: 37-43] percent),
 which occurred duringthe previous five years (Figure 5.2 andAnnex H, Figures H-8and
 H-9). Contraceptiveprevalenceincreasedinall 8 ofthe governoratesinUpper Egypt,
 whose current (2005) levels rangefrom a low of 33 percent inSouhagto a highof 62
percent inGiza (Annex H, Figure H-10).

5.18      District-level data compiledfrom healthfacility datareveal mixed trendsin
contraceptiveprevalence rates in districtswheretheproject intervened (Annex J, Table
8). The three districts supported underPhaseI(2000-2003) together had an average
contraceptiveprevalence rate o f 30 percent in 1999,the year prior to the launching of
subprojects. Inthe ensuing years the rate climbed, reaching 38 percent in2001 andthen
gradually declined to the pre-project levelin2003 and2004. Under PhaseI1(2001-2004)
nine districts hada combined CPR of 17percentin2000, the year prior to
implementation. Duringimplementation the CPR hoveredbetween28 and29 percent,
risingto 33 percentin2004. DuringPhaseI11implementation(2002-2004), the CPR in
23 districts increasedonly slightly duringimplementation over the baseline of 39 percent,
risingto 42 percentbythe endofthat phase. Project supportto these districts was limited
inallphases, covering only oneto two villages perdistrict. Thesedatathus do not
provide saicient evidence ofproject impact.

                                              21


5.19      Project data collected in the villagesof interventionfor Phases 2 and 3 reveal
increases in the current use of family planning that appear to be considerably higher
than averagesfor the districtsin which the villagesare located. This would indicate
that the subprojects may havehadanimpact. However, these datamustbeinterpreted
with caution. While the dataare available for two consecutive years (2003 and2004),
they do not cover the entire implementationperiod, nor do they include apre-intervention
baseline. Furthermore, the methodology for collecting and compiling the dataon
contraceptiveprevalenceis not entirely clear. The household surveys to collect this data
were conductedbythe SCAs (who were supportedunder the project to work withthe
women who were the subject ofthe survey); andthis may have introduceda bias into the
questions andthe responses. Notwithstandingthese caveats, datafrom thesesurveys
show that between 2003 and 2004 in villages benefitingfrom project support the use of
family planning was higher than district averages and increasedfaster than it didfor
districts of interventionoverall. Between2003 and 2004, the CPR rose by 9 percentage
points (from 46 to 55 percent ofall women of reproductive age) innine Phase 2 villages
andby about 11percentagepoints (from 45 to 56 percent of women ofreproductive age)
in23 Phase3 villages (Annex H,TablesH-2andH-3). Anecdotal evidencecollected
through IEGfield visits anddiscussionswith beneficiaries, andthrough project
monitoring andreporting, corroboratesthis evidence. Beneficiaries from some target
villages have stated that microcredits, literacy training and family planning information,
andfacilitation, allprovidedthrough SCAs, have(i)      stimulated women's interest inusing
family planningand (ii)  prompted them to use contraception.

5.20      Thereisstrong evidence that thesynergy betweensuppt?y-side and demand-
side interventionswasan importantfactor in influencing increasedcontraceptive use.
Healthfacility staff interviewedby IEGnotedthat, over and above facility upgrading and
staff training provided by the project, which improvedthe quality anduser-friendliness of
the services, the SCAs playeda critical role inpromoting these servicesandtheir
utilization. Their accompanimentofwomen to facilities was notedby service delivery
staff by service delivery staffto have filled animportant void. An independent
assessment ofthe SCAs inthe project areanotedthat the SCAs overcamebarriersto
women's access to information and services, causedbythe traditional andcultural
environment, whichprohibits women from seeking health care ontheir own and
participating inhealtheducation sessions. SCAs were found to have: helpedwomen
increasetheir access to andutilization ofhealthcenters, influenced an increasein
acceptance (by women andtheir families) ofmale physicians as caregiversfor women,
and empoweredwomen to discusshealth issueswiththeir husbandandother family
members, including child spacing(GeorgetownUniversity, 2007). IEG's field visits to
communitiesandhealthfacilities andinterviews with SCAs andbeneficiary women
corroboratedthese findings.

5.21      Theshare of total demandfor family planning which issatisfiedincreased
slightly in Rural UpperEgyptfrom 69percent in 2000 to 73percent in 2005, whileit
remained virtually unchangedfor Egypt as a whole (84percent in 2000 and 85percent
in 2005) (Annex H,Figure H-11). Across Egypt's Regions, only Upper Egyptandthe
Frontier Governorateshaddocumentedimprovements inthe satisfactionofexisting
demand, risingfrom 74 to 78 percent and from 75 to 85 percent, respectively. Lower
Egypt registeredno change at all (at a constant 88 percent) andthe UrbanGovernorates

                                                     22


 experienced a slight decrease from 90 to 88 percent (Annex H, Figure H-12). The
 demand o f women with no education was the least satisfied (at 81 percent), while those
 with some, primary and/or secondary educationall fared better at 87,86 and 88 percent,
 respectively (Annex H, Figure H-13).

 5.22        District-levelMoHP data in districtswheretheproject intervenedshow an
 increase in the utilization of publicfamily planning clinics in theinitial years of
 subprojectimplementation,followed by a subsequent decline. Districts under Phase 1
 registered a utilization rate of 54 percent inthe first year o f implementation(2000), a
 doublingofthe 1998baseline of26 percent?2 Withslight fluctuations, the rate inthe
 final year of2003 was 56 percent, but this rate declined to pre-project levels (28 percent)
 in2004. Likewise, duringPhase11, froma pre-intervention baseline of32percent, rates
 increasedfiom 49 to 53 percent duringthe first three years, then fell to 31percent inthe
 finalyear o fimplementation(2004).

 5.23        On the other hand, datadrawnfrom the household surveysfor villages where
 theproject intervenedshow an increasein utilization of publicfamily planning clinics
 between 2003 and 2004from 55 to 61percentfor Phase11villagesandfrom 63 to 69
percentfor Phase111villages(Annex H, Tables H-5andH-6). Without the benefit of a
 baseline andtrend data for these villages over the entire implementation period (and
 preferably beyond), it i s notpossible to document systematically to what extent (a) the
 subproject supported increases inservice utilization; and (b) such levels were sustained
 beyond the last year o fthe subprojects. Duringits field visit to a family planningclinic
 inruralMenya, near avillage where the project intervened, IEGgathered evidence
 (througha quick review ofclinic data anddiscussions withfamily planningservice
providers, SCAs andclients) of increased service utilization, linkeddirectly to project
 support. Between 2003 and2006the proportionof women ofreproductive age served by
this clinic, who were usingsome kindof modern contraception, increased from 35 to 69
percent, an upwardtrend that transcends the project. Before the project (in2001) the
family planningclinic registered anaverage of about 50 visits per month. This rate
increased duringproject implementation to about 100per monthin2003 and increased
further after project completion (187 per monthin2007). Bothfamily planningservice
providers and clients interviewed attributed these increases to the work ofthe SCAs, who
were instrumental inconvincing women of the benefits of family planningservices andin
accompanying them to the clinic to ensure a positive, client-centered experience (para.
5.20).

5.24        Between 2000 and 2005the totalfertility rate (TFR)33in Rural Upper Egypt
declinedby 0.8 children,from 4.7 (CI:4.44-4.88) to 3.9 (CI:3.75-4.09). This
statistically significantdeclineisgreater than what was achievedfor Egypt as a whole
(0.4 childrenfrom 3.5 [CI: 3.43-3.621 to 3.1 [CI: 3.05-3.21) andfor Rural Upper
Egypt during thepreceding 5-year period (0.5 childrenfrom 5.2fCI; 4.98-5.401 to 4.7


32 Itis not clear why utilization of family planningservices doubled duringthe two years leadingup to the
start ofproject implementation. Datafor 1999 (the year prior to Phase 1 launch) were not available.
33Total fertility rate is the total numberofchildrena woman would have by the end ofher reproductive
period ifshe experiencedthe currentlyprevailingage-specificfertility ratesthroughouther childbearinglife
(WHO DefinitionofIndicatorsandDataSources, 2006).

5.25       Thegap between actual and desiredfertility appears to be growing in Egypt,
with the most rapid growth in UpperEgypt. This meansthat, while there havebeen
achievements instimulating the desire ofwomen for a smaller family size, women's
actual fertility to date does not reflect their desiredfamily size, In2005, women inRural
UpperEgyptexceededtheir desiredfertility by 1.3 children, anincreaseo f0.3 overthe
already substantial gap of 1.O child in2000 (Annex H, FigureH-16). For Egypt as a
whole, women exceededtheir desired fertility by 0.8 children, up from 0.6 children in
2000. The 2000-2005 trends representa reversalof trends for the previous 8 years (1992-
2000) during which the gap between desiredand actualfertility was narrowed. The
closing ofthis gap represents botha challenge andanopportunity for furthering Egypt's
populationagenda.


6. RATINGS

6.1        The outcome ofthe Populationproject is moderately satisfactory overall (Table
6.1). The outcome of the first objective is unsatisfactory, basedon its modest relevance,
efficacy and efficiency. The outcome ofthe secondobjective is satisfactory, basedon its
substantialrelevance, efficacy and efficiency. The overall outcome rating is a function of
the heavier weight appliedto the second objective, which is a core objective of Egypt's
population policy andto which the bulk ofproject financing was devoted.

6.3        The Bank's CAS for the periodFY06- FY09 is articulated around goals of
facilitating private sector development, enhancingthe provision o fpublic services, and
promoting equity. Public service provisiongoals include the decentralization o fpublic
servicesdelivery, with a greaterrole for private sector, local authorities and civil society.
Improving access to healthcare is an important component o fefforts to promote equity
andincludesobjectivesto increaseinvestments inpriorityunder-served regions andto
increasecontraceptive prevalencerates. However, the CAS focuses on supply-side
elementsofpopulation and family planning. Itdoes not link the issue ofpopulation
growthto the prospectso fEgypt's economic developmentandpoverty alleviation goals,
nor does it specify or support the goal o ffertility reduction to these ends. Furthermore,
the CAS does not mention the importance of continued demand-side stimulation. The
inclusion inthe CAS of a "Health andPopulation Sector Strategy" is aligned with CAS
supply-side goals of service availability, quality andefficiency. Inshort, the objectives
ofthe Populationproject are very relevant to GoE's goals o f achieving a TFR o f2.1
children by 2017. However, neither the Government's nor the Bank's strategies
encompass all the essentialelements to achievethis goal.

6.4        The relevance o fthe design of the capacity building component (supporting
the first objective) is modest. This component: was excessively focused (up untilthe
mid-term)on central-level capacity building; didnot specify any key performance
indicators andoutcomes around which project interventions would be implemented and
tracked; and failed to establish a clear results chain. The National Population Council,
withits mandatefor population policy formulation andresearch, was not involvedinthis

                                                    25


project. The relevance ofthe designof thePAP component, which addressedthe
project's secondobjective andaccounted for the bulk ofproject spending, is substantial.
The strategic focus ondemandstimulation made sense inlight of substantialplanned
investmentsinsupply-side support inUpper Egypt.34The targeting of pockets of high
fertility and low demandfor family planning withinthe Region o fUpper Egypt, whose
population indicators laggedbehindall other regions inEgypt, was rational and
consistentwith GoE andCAS objectivesto reduceregional inequities. Furthermore, the
stimulation of attitudes andbehaviorsthrough efforts bothto affect factors influencing
fertility (women's economic opportunities andempowerment, andfamily andchild
wellbeing) andto link women to project benefits and FP information andservices
through SCAs, all were basedon credible research, andvalidated through project
experience.

6.5         The efficacy of thefirst objective is modest. MoPHmanagementstrengthening
was not achieved at the national level (paras. 5.6 and 5.7), but some capacity building did
occur inselecteddecentralizedentities (paras. 5.3 -5.5). The efficacy o fthe second
objective is substantial and is weighted heavily given its importance, both strategically
and interms ofits cost. Data and information onkey population trends inthe 148
villages benefiting from subprojectsare incomplete. Two rounds ofproject survey data
do provide some evidenceofincreasedutilization of family planningservices and
increasedvisits to clinics inbeneficiary villages, but this is documentedonly for one year
(data sets havingbeencollected in2003 and2004, respectively). Anecdotal evidence,
includingIEGinterviewswith beneficiaries, corroboratespositive changes inattitudes
andpracticesbrought aboutbythe project. The project's innovative designinfluenced
other major demand-side interventions inRuralUpper Egyptandthus is likely to have
contributedto positive trends inpopulation indicators inRural Upper Egyptdocumented
inthis report, beyondits impactin148villages.

6.6         Thefirst objective's efficiency is modest. The Government failed to clarify the
institutional andorganizational framework for the managementand oversight of
populationandfamilyplanning, which was to havebeenthe basis for the project's
support underthe first component. The links between capacity buildinginputsand
outputs (training, technical assistance, study tours), onthe one hand, and intended
outcomes, on the other hand, were not well established, underminingthe full exploitation
ofproject outputs to improve sector management. Efficiencyofthe secondobjective is
substantial. Itstargeting of "hot spots" of highest fertility, lowest CPR and strongest
preferencesfor larger families, withinUpper Egypt, whose population indicators are
laggingvis-8-vis the rest of Egypt, constituted anefficient support to Egypt's national
goal of achieving replacement-levelfertility by 2017. The designwas also efficient inits
focus on demand-side interventions. It focusedon improvements to selected socio-
economic indicators for womenthat would stimulate their demand for smaller families
and for familyplanning services. Beneficiaries have confirmed that the microcredits,
literacytraining andthe development of marketable skills havebeeninstrumental in



34 The project design did raisethe inadequacy ofsupply inlight of increaseddemand as a potentialriskof
the project. It is, nevertheless,possiblethat amore in-depthreview ofplannedsupply-side investments
mighthaverevealedgapsthat couldhave beenaddressedbythe project.

                                               26


 influencingtheir attitudes, preferences andbehaviors with regardto family size andthe
 use of family planning services. The provision of information about family planning
 evolved during the project life from one of IEC to a more efficient andresults-oriented
 CBC. The project was also efficient inits use of SCAs. As trustedwomen ofthe
 communities, they were most effective inbringingproject benefits to the women. Cost-
 effectivenessanalysis of subproject interventions was not undertakenas envisagedunder
 the M&Edesign. Nevertheless, an economic analysis of subprojects undertakenas part
 ofthe Implementation Completion Report revealed that actual costsper beneficiary were
 slightlylower thanpredicted. Still, the cost-effectivenessofvarious approachesand
 subprojectsis not known, nor was it comparedwiththat of interventions financed by
 other partnersinthe region (as hadbeeninitially planned).

 6.7       The project was efficient insome o f its institutional arrangements. The
 contracting ofthe PAP component to the SFDputthese activities underthe responsibility
 of an agency with relevant experienceand a comparative advantagefor the management
 o f community-based activities. The support o f subprojectsmanagedby NGOs permitted
 aninterfacewiththe communities through community-based organizations. The
 partnershipsdevelopedbetweenlocal level MOWmanagersandstaff andthe SFD and
 NGOs and other civil society organizations helpedto ensurethat both supply anddemand
 elements ofpopulation andfamily planningactivities were incorporatedinto local-level
 planningandaction. Inefficiencies ofproject institutional arrangementsincluded: a
 centralization ofdisbursement authority andproject approvals at the level ofthe Prime
 Minister's Officewhichtook considerabletime to resolve andcausedimplementation
 delays; lack o fprocurement capacity inthe PIUinthe initialyears ofthe project; the
 failure on the part of Governmentto clarify the institutionaVorganizationalframework for
populationandfamily planning, which undermined efforts to strengthencapacity in
MoHPPS.

6.8        Riskto DevelopmentOutcome. The riskthat developmentoutcomeswill not
be maintainedor realized is signiJcant. After the closing o fthe populationproject there
was no follow-on financing from government or from external sourcesto sustain
activities or to expandthem to yet uncovered areas o f low contraceptiveuse andhigh
fertility.  Communities which hadbenefited fiom project supportdecided, withthe
supporting NGO, to raisethe interest rates o fthe microcredits that continueto be
available to women, inorder to support the costs o f a small compensationto the SCAs.
This is a clear indication o f the value the beneficiaries place onthese agents. However,
accordingto SFDpersonnel, the funds raised from these rateshaveallowed the financing
o f only about one third o f all SCAs initially engagedunder the project. Some informants
consideredthat this reducednumber of SCAs would still allow for a continuation of
critical operations inareas where subprojectsalready invested indemand-stimulation
activities. However, other informants, corroborated by IEG's field visits andreview o f
village-level data, suggestthat the number o factivities and gains inkey indicators have
beenreduced after the completion of subprojects. N o financing source hasbeen
identifiedto sustain andexpanddemand stimulation activities at a very criticaljuncture
inthehistory ofexternal financing ofpopulationactivities. USAIDispullingout ofits
traditional role of financing population and family planningactivities inEgypt. And now
that Egypt has graduatedto "Lower Middle Income Country" status, it is hesitant to

                                                 27


borrow from the World Bank Group to finance populationandfamily planning
investments at the rateso f IBRDloans.

6.9       The risk to development outcomes is also afactor from an institutional
perspective. Efforts to develop MoHPPS capacity to strategically managewere
underminedby apersistently unclear institutional/organizationalframework. At the local
level the regional offices of the SFD played a catalytic role inengagingNGOs in
demand-side interventions and inlinkingthe various local-level actors (communities,
social change agents, healthmanagers and service delivery staff, other sectors) inthe
design and implementationo f activities. With no further financing available, it is not
clear to what extent the SFD will continue to be engagedinpopulation a~tivities.3~

6.10      Thereis also atechnical dimension to the risks to development outcomes.
Egypt is inthe processof reforming its healthsector. Under the healthsector reform
program, launchedinthe mid-to late-1990s andpiloted thus far infive                          the
GoE is attempting to separatethree functions: service delivery, financing and
stewardship. This reformentails the integrationanddelivery ofarangeofbasic health
servicesthrough a family healthunit, deliveredby generalist family healthphysicians.
Incentive-basedfinancing aims to reinforce quality, efficienc andequity inthe delivery
ofthese services. Researchand studies undertakeninEgypt3 andIEGfield visits to
                                                                     7
reform andnon-reform areas have revealed that reproductive health andfamily planning
services were found to be dilutedinthe basic package. Familydoctors are not as well
trained as the specialistswho hadprovided these services prior to the reform. The
training they receive is much shorter. Assessments offamily planning knowledge of
physicians revealedthat those trained by the MoHP through vertical programs hadbetter
knowledge andcapacity infamily planningservice delivery thanthose who hadbeen
trained through the healthreform training modules. Beneficiaries andGovernorate-level
MoHP staff corroboratedthese concerns. They also expressedconcernthat under the
newfamily healthclinic designthere is no specialroom(s) designatedfor family planning
clients. They were, rather, seen inany one ofthe regular service delivery rooms. Many
believed that itwas important for these services to understandand respondto the
distinction betweenthe healthclinic patients andthe family planning clients. Others
revealedconcernthat there were fewer women physicians cateringto family planning
clients, which is an important factor to manyclients andtheir husbands. Any perceived
deterioration inthe quality andavailability o f servicesposesthe risk of a decline inthe
use of family planningservices.

6.11      Overall Bankperformancewas moderately satisfac?ory. The Bank's
performanceduringpreparation was satisfactory. Theproject was fully supportive of
the Government's national objectives, basedon a sound analysis of key population
trends, andwell targetedto the areas where population indicators were most unfavorable.

 Its readinessfor implementationwas supportedwith the production of an operational
manual, guidelines and selectioncriteria soon after effectivenessto guide the approval of
project sites andproposals. Moderate shortcomings ofthe Bank's preparationwork are
revealedinthe facts that: (a) these tools could havebeenpreparedprior to effectiveness,
giventhe very long delay betweenBoardapproval andeffectiveness; and(b)
implementationmight have beenfurther acceleratedandstreamlined hadproject
managementandNGOcapacity been more fully assessedand addressedprior to
effectiveness.

6.12        The Bank's performanceduringsupervisionwas moderately satisfactory. The
project director andothers involved inimplementation (both those from MoHP and SFD)
were unanimousintheir appreciation o fthe pedagogicalapproacho fthe Bank's team,
especially duringthe early years of implementation, when all actors were newto the
Bank's proceduresandthe innovative nature of project design. Capacities in
procurement, financial management, andreporting were builtwiththe close supervision
o fthe Bank andcarefbl review and feedback on project implementation. The Bank was
also flexibleinadjusting the project andthe allocation ofresourcesto respond to
evolving issues andneeds, including, among others, the procurement of contraceptives in
light ofUSAID's withdrawal from contraceptive financing andthe strengthening of
family planning servicedelivery inareas where increaseddemandwas not being
effectively met. Task team leadershipwas field based, which allowed for closer
supervision andmore frequent dialogue. There is evidence inproject documentation o f
some collaboration with other donors supportingpopulation, especially USAID and
UNFPA. However, this collaboration was not systematic or programmatic. Two
important shortcomings o fthe Bank's performance were: (a) its failure to make headway
on the critical elements o fthe capacity buildingobjective (improve strategic management
ofpopulation activities, overall program monitoring and evaluation, andmobilization,
coordination andallocation ofresourcesfor p~pulation);~~            and(b) the lessthanrigorous
follow-up, guidance and support onproject monitoring andevaluation. There i s also no
evidence ofa strong link inthe Bank`s work anddialogue onpopulation and family
planning, andthat onhealth sectorreform. Itisnoteworthy that (a) the current CAS
(FY96-09) does not raise the issue o fpopulation and its implications for Egypt's socio-
economic developmentprospects; and (b) the Bankhasnever carried out or supported a
Public ExpenditureReview (PER) onthe Population Sector.

6.13       BorrowerPerformancewas moderately unsatisfactory overall. With regardto
Government's performance, the project was developedincollaboration with the (former)
MinistryofPopulationandFamilyPlanning, whichwas mergedintothe Ministry of
Health (becoming MoHP) in 1996. While reduction ofpopulation growth remained high
amongnationalpriorities, populationpolicy implementation under MoHP was limited,


'*At the MTRit was agreedwith Governmentthat, since the institutionaYorganizationa1framework for
populationand family planninghadstill not beencompletely defined, capacitybuilding efforts would focus
on local (governorate, district andcommunity) capacity. There was still opportunity for the Bankto
support some ofthe buildingblocks neededfor the strategic management and financing ofpopulation. The
Bank's agreementto dramatically decrease the IDA allocationfor consultants' services (at the strong
requestof Government) may not havebeenan appropriatedecision, given the needfor technical assistance
and capacity building.

due to anabsenceof capacity ofelements ofthe policynotrelatedto family planning
service delivery. At the time ofthis mergerMoHP was launchingthe Health Sector
ReformProgram, which commandedthe time and attention o fthe MoHP leadershipand
staff. With the creation of the MoHP the NPC role inpolicy formulation and
developmentbecamemarginalized andfocused almost exclusively on researchactivities.
Government's failure to take decisionsto restructurethe institutional/organizational
framework for the population sectorunderminedits capacity to strategically manage its
entire program as well as the project therein. The MTRcalled for the collaboration ofthe
population sector with other sectors, especially the (central-level) Technical Support
Office and(governorate-level), withaview to implementing health sector reform. There
i s no evidencethat this was done. The holding up of contract approvals and
disbursementsat the level ofthe PrimeMinister's Office causedconsiderabledelays in
subprojects implementation, butthis was resolved after the MTR.

6.14      The PIU inMoHP played an important role incomplementing the subprojects.
It successfullymanagedthe contracts for the upgrading ofthe clinics, provisionof
equipment andsupplies neededfor improving family planningservicesinselected
villages. It also managedwell the contracting o fvarious consultants. The Population
Unitofthe SFDmadesoundcontributions to: the designofthe subprojects; the
monitoring ofthe phasesoftheir implementation; andthe technical backstoppingof
subprojects. The SFD also fulfilled its role as catalyst among many actors and
implementersfor formingpartnershipsintheplanningandimplementationofpopulation
activities. There also were anumberof shortcomings inproject implementation. The
Executive Committee didnot function duringmost ofthe project implementationperiod,
causingthe PIUto managepolicy decisionsthroughthe PS Director. PIUprocurement
capacity was weak initially, but improved over time withon-the-job trainingand
recruitment of specialized support. There were deficiencies inthe financial reporting and
monitoring of subprojects at the level ofthe implementingNGO andat the level ofthe
SFD.

6.15      For reasonspresented inChapter 4, the design and implementation of project
monitoringand evaluationandthe utilization ofdatafor decision-making were modest,
overall.


7. LESSONSAND FUTUREDIRECTIONS

LESSONS

7.1       Supply-side and dernand-side interventionssupportingpopulation andfamily
planning objectives can be tru& synergistic when they are deliveredthrough a well
defined and wellfunctioningpartnership of local actors. InRuralUpper Egypt the
partnershipbetweenthe SFDandthe MoHPdrew ontheir comparative advantages,the
former linkingwith communities, community development associationsandfocusing on
multi-sectoral interventions andthe latter bringingitstechnical expertisebothto service
delivery andto reproductive healthandfamily planningpromotionandeducation.
Together these two partners enlisted andinvolved local leaders, NGOs and community-
basedSCAs inthe planning, designandimplementation o f interventions supporting

                                             30


 sharedobjectives. SCAs forged improvedlinks betweencommunities andservices, and
 front-line serviceproviders becamemore client-focused, together resultinginincreased
 utilization of services by women fiom these communities and increasedsatisfaction of
 these clients.

 7.2       An important element of any investment in managementcapacity building is
 thesupport of monitoringand evaluation activities. However, when thefocus of M&E
 support isproject-specigc, rather thanprogram-wide, an opportunityis missed to learn
from experienceacrossprojects and to use evidencetofine-tune nationalpolicies and
 strategies. Thislesson is especially relevant whereinnovativeactivitiesare supported
 in thesame geographicarea by diffent externally-fianced projects. Demand-side
 interventions supportedunderthis project were innovative andlimitedintheir coverage,
 constituting ineffect a pilot approach. Duringproject implementation U SAID launched
 the TAHSEENproject, also inRuralUpperEgypt, which embracedmany of the demand-
 side approaches initiated under the Bank-financed project along with other innovations.
 While each ofthese projects was evaluated separately, the collective effects o f these
 interventions inRuralUpperEgyptwere not evaluated, nor was the cost-effectivenesso f
 these projects' approachescomparedand contrasted. Giventhat MoHP's recently issued
 population strategy emphasizescontinued efforts to encourage attitudes favoring smaller
 family size, suchcost-effectiveness analysis andevaluationwould appear to be critical.
 Anevaluation ofall demand-sideinterventions inEgyptwouldhavehelpedto determine
 what works "on the ground" andwithregardto institutional andorganizational
 arrangements.

 7.3      Demand-side interventions,thoughcritical to achievingpopulation and
famiIy planning goals, are not likely to be sustained or expandedin the absence of an
 institutionalhomefor theseactivitiesand a well-defined, evidence-basedprogram of
 activities. The demand-side interventions supportedunderthe project have beenpartially
 sustainedthrough communities' decisions to raisethe interest rate for microcredits, which
has coveredthe costs ofmaintaining one thirdto one halfof SCAs. The SFD has
 financed a few new community-driven population activities usingits own funds, butthere
are large areas inneedof suchinterventions that are not covered. There is no national
planor institutional hometo promote andsupportthe designandimplementationof
demand-side interventions. The "General Departmentfor FamilyPlanning Servicesin
the Private andNGO Sector" withinMoHP/PS appearsto focus onNGOs involvement in
services, not demandstimulation.

7.4       Efforts to ensureand improve the quality and client-orientation of famiIy
planning become all the more crucial when they are undertakenin the context of
health sector reform program (XSm). Fieldvisits to reform governorates (Alexandria
andMenoufia) andresearchhaverevealedthat reproductive healthandfamilyplanning
services are somewhat diluted withinthe basic packageofservicesdeliveredthrough new
familyhealthfacilities andoflesser quality. A recent study (Zaky, 2008) has
documentedthat family doctors are not as well trained as the specialistswho provide
family planningor reproductive health services. The training they receive is shorter and
less in-depth. The study tested the family planning knowledge ofphysicians trained by
MoHP vertical programs (reproductive healthandfamily planningspecialists) against
those trained underthe HSRP(reproductive healthand family planningmodules) and

                                                  31


found that the former were bettertrained andhadbetter knowledge o f family planning
thanthe latter. Governorate-level reproductive healthandfamilyplanningprogram
managershavepointedto feedbackreceivedby clients ontheir perceptionsof a possible
decline inthe quality of service, including: the absence of a special roodsection of the
family healthfacility for family planningclients; the frequent absenceof afemale
physicidspecialist to discuss family planningmatters; the perceptionthat family
physicians have less specializedtraining and lesstime to devote to family planning
clients. Opportunities withinthe healthsector reform program might beexploited to
address andcorrect these issues.

FUTURE     DIRECTIONS

7.5        The Government has recently issuedits National Strategy for Population and
FamilyPlanning (2007-2012)' whose goal is to reducetotal fertility to 2.4 by 2012
facilitating achievement ofthe national target of2.1 by 2017. Strategic componentsaim
to (a) improve the quality andavailability of reproductive healthservices within primary
healthcare; (b) change attitudesfavoring small family sizeandmeet growing demands
for reproductive healthandfamily planning services; (c) link population issues with
comprehensive development frameworks; and(d) ensure more effective monitoringand
evaluation.

7.6        The GoE i s faced with a number of challengesifit i s to implementthis strategy
successfully. Among these challengesare:

         The needto develop a financing planfor ensuringthe coverageofall population
         activities. This is especially important inlight ofUSAID'swithdrawal ofits
         assistance to the population sector andinlightof Government's hesitancyto
         borrow for population on IBRDterms;

         The importance ofmaintainingandcontinually improvingthe quality and
         availability o f reproductive healthand family planningservices inthe context of
         the healthsector reform program, under which there are indications ofa
         deteriorating quality ofthese service^;^' and

         The needto clarify the institutional home, roles andresponsibilities for sustaining
         demand-side interventions. Researchundertaken inEgyptindicates that the
         critical focus o f demand-side interventions mustinclude: continued efforts to
         stimulate desire for smaller family size inpockets of resistance; renewedefforts to
         encourage birthspacing; andthe closing ofthe gap betweendesired fertility and
         actualfertility.




39To this end, the Government hasnoted inits comments(Annex I)that MOW,with UNICEF support, is
currently funding a programentitled, "Strengthening Supply, Demand andUtilization ofReproductive
Health Services inthe Context ofHealth Sector Reform."

 Table D 1. Factors that influence lower fertility:

 Factors            IReason
 Demand-side:
 Reductionsininfant  Inthe short-termlower infantandchildmortality leadsto somewhat largerfamilies andfaster rates
 andchild mortality  of populationgrowth. But inthe long-term, with improved chances of survival, children receive
1                    more attention from their parents, and parentsare willing to spend more on their children's
                     education. Lower mortality not only helpsparentsto achieve their desiredfamily size with fewer
                     births, it leads them to want a smallerfamily as well.
 Increasein income   Inthe long-run,peoplewith more incomewant fewer children. It is not higher incomeitself, but
                     the changesit bringsto people's lives that lowersfertility: alternativeuses oftime, particularly to
                     women; desire for healthier andbetter educated, but fewer children; decreasingimportanceof
                     children's work to family welfare; opportunitiedentitlementsthat guard againstdestitutionin
                     emergenciesor inold age.
 Educatedparents     Inall countries(including Egypt) women who have completedprimary school havefewer children
                     than women with no education, and everywherethe number of children declines regularly (and
                     usually substantially) as the educationof mothersincreasesabove the primary school level, with
~                    largedifferencesbetweenthe highestand lowest educationalgroups.
 Women's             Employmentseems to have an independenteffect on fertility for women inwell-paid, modemjobs;
 employment and      morejob opportunitiesshouldaffect the fertility of all women indirectly by increasingthe incentive
 status              to educategirls. Once women are able to earn an income, women may acquire higher status inthe
                     home, thus enablingthem to talk more openly about birth control with their husbands, leadingto
                     longerandmoreeffective contraceptiveuse.
                     Urban dwellershave betteraccess to education andhealthservices, a wider rangeofjobs, and more
                     avenues for self-improvementand social mobility. They also face higher costs in raising children.
                     In 10of 14 developingcountriesstudied, the urbanwoman marries on averageat leastone and a
                     halfyears laterthan does the rural woman, and family planning information and servicesand their
                     acceptabilityare more available. As a result, urbanfertility is lower than rural fertility, on average
                     by betweenone and two births per mother.
                     Greater marketefficiency makes clearerthe logic of investing inchildren, especiallyintheir
                     education. Children also become less important as safeguards.
                     Later marriagereducespopulation growth by lengtheningthe interval betweengenerations; it also
 marriage            fosters a climatethat encourages women to expand their horizonsbeyondthe family (longer
                     schoolingand employment).
                     Breastfeedingreducesfertility by suppressingfecundity; it also reduceshigh infantmortality.

 Access to quality   Good services reduce fertility significantly by closing the gap betweenactual and desiredfamily
 family planning     size. By increasingthe supply of services, family planningprogramsreducethe (financial and
 information and     other) costs of using contraceptionto potential users. Ithas an immediateimpact where there is
 services            underlying demand.

    (2) 1998 is specified by Mom as the baselineyear, but it is more appropriateto use 1999 as the baselineyear, since

    Dear M s . Monika,

    Reference is being made to the Draft Project Performance Assessment
    Report on the Egypt Population Project (Cr. 2830-EGT). This is to
    acknowledge the professional work and effort exerted by the evaluation
    and assessment term, and to commend the insight included in Ihe report
    which will help the Ministry of Health in envisioning its future policies and
    strategies based on the lessons learned from the pastexperience.

    However, some comments a m e out after a thorough reading through the
    repoi-t. These are as follows:

    Page(1) Backgroundand Context:

    Please update this paragraph. Egypt is now 28 governorates aird Lnxoi
    City. Cairo became two governorates (Cairo and Helwan), nlso Giza
    became two governorates(Giza and 6th of October).

    Page (15) Outputsand Outcomes by Objectives

   5.6 First, the functions of the General Department Of Family Planning
       Services Of Nongovernmental And Private Sector cannot be judged only
       by its title. There is no evidence of possible neglect of the role of NGOs in
       planning and policy formulation or demand side stimulation. 'Infact, tlie
       MOHP/Population Sector through this General Dept. provided most of
       the NGOs having family planning clinics with the National integrated
       Standards oi Practice to improve the quality of services, it illso provides
       trained physicians to MGOs upon request. The NCO General Dept. is on
       its way to strengthen the process of partnership and networking with
       active NGOs, it conducted several workshops to identify NGQ needs, and
       to involve these NGOs in the process of population policy formulation and
       implementation including stimulating demand for family planning
       practice.

                                         83                                ANNEX 1




5.11 DHS 2005 of Egypt (sources for modern family planninf;methods)
shows an increase in the public sector contribution in methods dispensed
(from 48.6% in 2000to 56.6% in 2005). This may be an evidence of family
planning service effectiveness during this period, and not the opposite
mentionedinthis paragraph   .
Page(31)
7.6 FutureDirections

MOHP has observed some gaps in the application of the Family Health
Model as related to FP/RH seirices. As a response,and in order to bridge
this gap, the population & family planning sector          is currently
implementing a program funded by UNFPA eutitled "Strengthening
Supply, Demand, and Utilization of Reproductive Health Services in the
context of HealthSector Reform".
