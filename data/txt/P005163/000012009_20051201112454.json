Lessons are suggested as\n            follows. Project beneficiaries were more receptive to family\n            planning issues and reproductive health services that were\n            integrated into more comprehensive community-based services,\n            and this approach was also useful in empowering women, as\n            well as in convincing men of their role in family planning.\n            Additionally, where no single institution can adequately\n            address both demand and supply issues simultaneously,\n            effective partnerships at all levels of governance are\n            important to achieving stated goals. This is particularly\n            important for rural areas where the traditional approach of\n            improving service delivery alone, is not an effective\n            mechanism for reaching the poor. Social Change Agents (SCAs)\n            are a vital link between the community and the service\n            points for the poor, and are key to increasing demand for\n            services. Under this project, the SCAs facilitated\n            interpersonal communication, and effectively placed the\n            population issue within a wider socio-economic sphere of the\n            communities they served. Notwithstanding success, it is\n            suggested the Governorate rather than the national level of\n            administration would be a more effective level at which to\n            set population targets that are realistic, and sensitive to\n            cultural and economic realities. Furthermore, sub-project\n            cycles should be implemented over a longer timeframe of at\n            least 3 years, to allow adequate time for impact."}, "docdt": "2005-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
