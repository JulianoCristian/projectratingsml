Azerbaijan was identified as one\n            of the countries with the poorest road infrastructure in the\n            region, according to a study examining the impact of road\n            network quality on intraregional trade in Europe and Central\n            Asia (ECA). Road users, businesses and communities had to\n            bear ultimate burden of deteriorated roads with longer\n            travel time, costly vehicle maintenance, and higher accident\n            risks. The World Bank supported the government through\n            technical assistance to modernize road maintenance and\n            operation practices. Rehabilitation of the 106 kilometer\n            Ganja-Gazakh section of the major East-West transport\n            corridor was completed under the project resulting in 33\n            percent reduction of travel time along the road section. The\n            project had introduced international design standards and\n            institutionalized best practices in management and\n            supervision of road projects in Azerbaijan. Along with\n            physical infrastructure investments, the project had also\n            supported institutional modernization. One of the important\n            achievements was the adoption of the new land acquisition\n            law, prepared under the project, by the parliament of\n            Azerbaijan in April 2010. The project had also launched\n            major activities on formulation of the new road safety\n            strategy, development of road data base, preparation of road\n            master plan, and revision of design and maintenance standards."}, "docdt": "2010-10-20T07:49:01Z"}
