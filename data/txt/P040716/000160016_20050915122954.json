Within the\n            corridors of the two proposed bypasses, agriculture is the\n            predominant type of land use and structures or elements of\n            higher ecological importance have not been identified. Thus,\n            impacts will mainly consist of losses of farmland within the\n            existing right of way, and the loss of some few shrubs and\n            trees growing within the selected corridors. To mitigate\n            this impact, all land that has been temporarily used for\n            construction will be restored to the initial state. Work\n            site selection should avoid the removal of trees and shrubs\n            and topsoil will be covered with grass, or removed and\n            reused for embankments or site rehabilitation after\n            completion. During the construction period, exhaust fumes,\n            noise, dust, and potential spills of harmful substances\n            could affect human health. Confine sites for vehicle\n            maintenance and fuelling to contain spilled lubricants and\n            fuels; provide a secure, impermeably lined container to\n            store chemicals and oil at a designated distance from\n            surface waters; regularly separate and collect toxic and\n            harmful waste as well as used tires and dispose of them at\n            authorized site. Minimization of dust development may be\n            achieved by periodically watering the roads and by using\n            covered trucks. All construction debris should be removed\n            and disposed of properly. To help minimize the need of waste\n            disposal and reduce adverse impacts on the environment,\n            consider processing and reusing existing materials such as\n            sub-base and surface materials, or materials from demolished\n            bridges. Other impacts concern soil erosion and chronic\n            siltation from  borrow pit operations. Discharge\n            sediment-laden water construction water into settling ponds\n            or tanks prior to final discharge. Adopt a run-off control\n            plan to manage potential problems at source, including\n            measures such as slope protection, grass strips, temporary\n            sediment traps, silt fences, and diversion trenches. Comply\n            with relevant air pollution standards."}, "docdt": "2005-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
