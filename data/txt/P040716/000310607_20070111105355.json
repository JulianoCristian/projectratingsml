The Tovuz bypass is a section of\n            the existing east-west corridor between Baku and Tbilisi. It\n            is approximately 10.5 km long. The proposed bypass road will\n            have two lanes now (first phase), but will be widened in the\n            future to a 4-lane-road (second phase).  The land\n            acquisition in question will be done for both the first and\n            second phases. The number of property owners/farmers losing\n            land is exactly 399. Almost all of them lose less than 30\n            percent of their land. The number of farmers losing 30\n            percent or more of their land will be determined at the\n            public consultation that will be held in September 2005.\n            There is only one project-affected person (PAP) with a\n            building - a garage - which has to be demolished or moved\n            away. PAP in all categories are entitled to full\n            compensation for their loss. The farmers will either get\n            full money compensation or alternative land, where possible.\n            Land swap (alternative land) is possible according to\n            Azerbaijan legislation. The local authorities do not have\n            enough land reserve to be used as alternative land. On the\n            other hand the quality of the alternative land is much lower\n            than the land owned by people. Therefore money compensation\n            is preferred. In cases where more than 80 percent of a\n            farmer's land is expropriated, the government will also\n            buy the remaining 20 percent with full compensation."}, "docdt": "2006-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
