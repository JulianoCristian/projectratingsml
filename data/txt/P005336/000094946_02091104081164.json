Through the\n            implementation of the project, a number of lessons have been\n            reinforced. The nature of emergency operations requires\n            quick responsiveness to infrastructure rehabilitation in\n            general, and to investments, and procurement related needs\n            in particular, which can be accomplished through a timely\n            inventory of crucial investments, designed in light of the\n            damage assessment reports, but focused on initial modest\n            investments, so as to help mitigate immediate environmental,\n            and health hazards effectively, and, create a process which\n            can validate rehabilitation needs, as and when presented.\n            Therefore, it is not advisable to combine subsequent large\n            development investments, with emergency works for\n            implementing numerous, though small rehabilitation works,\n            since it is difficult enough in the initial prevailing\n            environment of capital, and skilled labor constraints. The\n            subsequent large investments in water, and wastewater at\n            Met'n Barouk, and Ba'albeck required a number of\n            extensions, thus delaying project completion, which should\n            have otherwise progressed fast, as the nature of emergency\n            operations so require. The effectiveness of the Council for\n            Development and Reconstruction (CDR) is highlighted, which\n            as an autonomous entity, streamlined, and coordinated the\n            rehabilitation efforts, and is continuing such a role, given\n            that emergencies caused by incidences of external\n            hostilities such as in Lebanon, cannot be ruled out in the\n            future. However, while emergency works are by nature limited\n            to bring about sectoral reforms, the initiation of cost\n            recovery, and maintenance costs of new investments could be\n            the focus, so that reforms may later rely on the financial\n            strength of sectoral institutions."}, "docdt": "2002-08-28T00:00:00Z"}
