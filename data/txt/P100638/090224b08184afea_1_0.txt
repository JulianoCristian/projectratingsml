                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this Project is to facilitate market-based farm restructuring through enhancing the ability of farmers, farm family members, and farm workers to manage
                         their assets and income. Under this overarching objective, the Project will assist the Government of Romania (GOR) in (i) completing the property title registration of
                         land assets in rural areas and (ii) improving the delivery of socio-economic guidance services to the agricultural population.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has made significant progress towards meeting its objectives after three and a half years since effectiveness. After a slow start, the project has started to show results on
                         the ground. The Government has demonstrated strong commitment to the project objectives, including the systematic registration campaign. This commitment was initially
                         demonstrated in June 2012 by the Parliament passing of critical and long waited amendments to the Cadastre Law 7/1996 (with provisions for systematic registration) and

                         furthermore on October 2012 by the adoption of new amendments to the same law. The successive amendments removed most legal and administrative hurdles from systematic
                         registration helping to speed up systematic registration contractors’ work in the field.

                         The systematic registration campaign by the project is on-going in 50 communes (UATs). The initially delayed work has picked up pace and the first UATs have passed the

                         community verification stage (Public Display) and now proceed to land book registration. Once these contracts have been completed 230,000 rural people will have had their 620,000
                         property rights sorted. During the mission the Board of the ANCPI adopted a plan to complete systematic registration in the 91 UATs supported by the project by June 2015 and to
                         complete another 125 UATs by the end of 2017 with government funding.

                         The provision of socio-economic guidance services to the agricultural population population slowed down once the consultant contracts signed in 2011 expired in summer 2012. The
                         start of the new contracting procedures was slower than expected for both the socio-economic guidance providers (SEGP) and for their training and the respective contracts are yet
                         to be signed. It is of critical importance that these contracts are signed urgently and the first session of training is delivered before the end of 2012, so that the consultants can start
                         their field activity in January 2013, to regain the good momentum reached in 2012 in relation with the benefitting farmers in the 45 communes. Once the first training session is
                         completed, the consultant selected (through a separate procedure) to review and update the training handbook will undertake the required revisions before the next session starts.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project needs restructuring, given the current status of implementation and the remaining time for completion of the activities that would support meeting the development
                         objectives.
                         Critically to the project restructuring, the Government will need to commit the necessary budget allocation to the project activities by December 20, 2012.
