                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this Project is to facilitate market-based farm restructuring through enhancing the ability of farmers, farm family members, and farm workers to manage
                         their assets and income. Under this overarching objective, the Project will assist the Government of Romania (GOR) in (i) completing the property title registration of
                         land assets in rural areas and (ii) improving the delivery of socio-economic guidance services to the agricultural population.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Following the partial extension agreed in June 2013, the project implementation continued under the two components implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
                         Development (MARD): Component 2 (Socio-Economic Guidance to Agricultural Population) and Component 3 (Policy, Strategy, Management). A new extension of the loan Closing
                         Date, by three months (until September 30, 2014) was granted.

                         The socio-economic guidance services (SEG) have been provided to the rural population in 45 communes (of which 31 overlapping with the 50 communes where the systematic
                         registration activities are being implemented) through over 430 general meetings attended by over 8,600 participants, and over 6,000 individual advisory meetings with over 3,000
                         participants, individuals (87%) and small businesses (13%). These meetings, general and individual, resulted in preparation of over 4,000 individual guidance plans improving the

                         ability of a large number of farmers, family farms and other rural population to better manage their assets and skills, larger than targeted. About 82% of the targeted population
                         expressed satisfaction with the agricultural guidance services. The number of farmers registered in the farms registry exceeded the target and is increasing, contributing to EU funds
                         absorption. In addition, the project contributed to improving the skills of the staff of the Paying Agency for Rural Development and Fishery (APDRP) on cost-benefit analysis and its
                         use in implementation of the National Rural Development Program (PNDR) 2014-2020 through a special training program requested by MARD management.

                         The three consultant services contracted under component 3 are in final stages of implementation and the final reports will be delivered in the last week of June 2014. The interim
                         reports delivered so far have supported the Managing Authority for Rural Development (MARD) in preparation of specific sections of the PNDR 2014-2020, particularly on “family farm
                         design”, “standard rural projects”, “suitability of fruit species in Romania”.

                         The implementation of the Land Management component (which closed in June 2013) led to substantial amendment of the Cadaster and Property Registration Law, enabled an
                         increase of the land transactions in the project area by 29% (15% targeted), and digitization of Land Books 56% of the communes in project area (50% targeted). However, with the
                         activities completed in six communes, the systematic registration process met only 9% of the targets. The contracts procured under the project continued with state budget financing
                         and it is expected that 20 communes would be finalized by the end of 2014, meeting about 25% of the targets (area and assets registered, population benefiting).
