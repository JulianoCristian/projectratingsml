                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this Project is to facilitate market-based farm restructuring through enhancing the ability of farmers, farm family members, and farm workers to manage
                         their assets and income. Under this overarching objective, the Project will assist the Government of Romania (GOR) in (i) completing the property title registration of
                         land assets in rural areas and (ii) improving the delivery of socio-economic guidance services to the agricultural population.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is making slow progress towards meeting its development objectives. Frequent political changes in sector governance and sector Minister / State Secretary
                         appointments continue to have a negative impact on the Project implementation and create disruptions in the activity of the two implementing agencies. Substantial delays in the
                         project financing prevented the Project from reaching its planned targets and, therefore, a review of the project development indicators is likely to be undertaken on the occasion of

                         While the pilot systematic registration in 19 administrative territorial units (UAT) is progressing with delays stemming from the difficulties encountered by the contractors to record
                         rights subject to the unfinished land reform agenda, procurement of new contracts for systematic registration of properties in 31 more communes has been completed and the

                         contracts are in the process of signing. In addition, about 63% of the land books in the project communes have been digitized. The consultants to provide the socio-economic
                         guidance services started getting familiar with the communities where they will operate, in all 15 counties subject to these activities. As a result, about 60% of the agricultural
                         population in the project area have positive views on the usefulness of these activities. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) finalized, in early March 2012, the
                         draft strategy to scale-up establishment of Integrated Agricultural Offices (IAOs) and a memorandum of understanding/ protocol is to be signed between the MARD and Ministry of
                         Public Administration and Interior (MAI) to allow procurement and deployment of equipment to the IAOs under project financing.

                         or financial decisions, such as allocation of budget for project implementation, signing the protocol between MARD and MAI (the latter was split into two ministries: Ministry of Interior
