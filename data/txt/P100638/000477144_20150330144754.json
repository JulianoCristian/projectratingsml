Complementing EU Support for\n            Agricultural Restructuring Project (CESAR) for Romania\n            received a moderately unsatisfactory outcome rating with\n            moderate risk to the development outcome. The Bank\u0092s\n            performance was rated moderately satisfactory while the\n            Borrower\u0092s performance was rated moderately unsatisfactory.\n            The project was restructured thrice during its life. The\n            first restructuring saw:  (i) a revision in activities under\n            all three project components, including modification of the\n            intermediate outcome targets; (ii) changes in some PDO\n            indicator targets, and (iii) a cancelation of EUR 4.3\n            million. The second restructuring extended to closing date\n            by one year, but only for components 2 and 3. This was\n            because of the uneven progress of the project components:\n            while the lack of the GOR\u0092s commitment to provide adequate\n            financing. The third restructuring extended the closing date\n            by 3 months to allow the implementing agency to review and\n            submit the final deliverables under all consultant contracts\n            to Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) for\n            approval. Several lessons were learned from this project and\n            are as follows: (1) a sound policy environment is a\n            necessary condition for effective farm restructuring, (2)\n            effective public displays are critical to efficient\n            systematic registration, (3) effective private sector\n            surveying requires strong local knowledge, (4) systematic\n            registration must be linked to affordable and accessible\n            legal services, (5) private sector competence and capacity\n            to deliver project outcomes, where required, should be\n            evaluated in the design process, (6) systems of publicly\n            financed rural advisory services must be tailored to\n            specific country, institutional and beneficiary\n            environments, (7) Government of Romania\u0092s (GOR\u0092s)\n            development policy should be thoroughly evaluated within the\n            design process, (8) a detailed analysis of the legislative,\n            institutional framework and socio-economic environment is\n            important for effective project design and implementation."}, "docdt": "2015-03-05T11:11:01Z"}
