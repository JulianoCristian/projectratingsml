                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this Project is to facilitate market-based farm restructuring through enhancing the ability of farmers, farm family members, and farm workers to manage
                         their assets and income. Under this overarching objective, the Project will assist the Government of Romania (GOR) in (i) completing the property title registration of
                         land assets in rural areas and (ii) improving the delivery of socio-economic guidance services to the agricultural population.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was implemented by the National Agency of Cadastre and Property Registration (ANCPI), in charge with the systematic registration of properties in rural areas, and the
                         Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), in charge with provision of socio-economic guidance services to the rural population. Until the approaching closing date, the
                         project managed to achieve a number of results to support its development objectives, although not entirely.

                         Under the systematic registration component, the lessons learned from practice during implementation led to several amendments to the legislation governing the cadastre and
                         property registration (Law 7 of 1996) and the regulations streamlining its implementation, amendments adopted by the Parliament, the Government or the National Agency of
                         Cadastre and Property Registration (ANCPI) in 2010 and 2012 (twice). These successive amendments removed most legal and administrative hurdles from systematic registration

                         helping to speed up systematic registration contractors’ work in the field and demonstrating a strong commitment to the project objectives.

                         The systematic registration campaign by the project started in 50 communes (UATs) to benefit, eventually, about 230,000 people (of which, about 16,000 Roma people) that will have
                         their about 620,000 property rights sorted. The systematic registration was completed so far in three communes (Valea Mare and Iancu Jianu [Olt county] and Saschiz in Mures
                         county), while it is in advanced stages in five more communes. In the rest of 42 communes the activities are in various stages but on hold until additional budget would be allocated
                         to these contracts.

                         The project also helped institutional development at ANCPI which led to a significant increase of the land transactions in the project area and exceeded the target while the
                         registration fees have been reduced, as well as the average time to produce certified land book copies. In the same time, the procedures for systematic registration developed under
                         the project facilitated a more transparent relation with the land owners so that their large majority participated in consultations with the contractors and ANCPI staff. To protect the
                         rights of vulnerable people, a social monitoring mapping concept was developed under the project. CESAR has been a pioneering project among the Bank-supported land
                         administration projects in the ECA region in terms of methodologically addressing vulnerable groups’ special needs in systematic registration. Due to its novelty among the ANCPI
                         and communities, the application of this vulnerability mapping/social monitoring approach experienced some difficulties in the beginning but the overall results have been good. The
                         project has fostered the participation of vulnerable groups in systematic registration, facilitated negotiations with the local government on regularizing property rights for Roma
                         settlements and resulted to recording of either possession or lease or ownership rights. 16 000 Roma people are expected to benefit when the systematic registration in all 50
                         communes would be completed.

                         The socio-economic guidance services (SEG) provided to the rural population in 45 communes (of which 31 overlapping with the 50 communes where the systematic registration
                         activities have been implemented) contributed to the increase of the percentage of agricultural land registered in the National Farm Registry to 72% of the project area. These SEG
                         services reached about 65% of the population in the project area, whereas 55% of the total population accessed the support programs. For these people, over 6,700 individual
                         guidance plans have been developed. The consultants providing SEGP services also benefited of training (based on a Handbook developed under the project) and 800 man-days of
                         training have been provided. However, because the second (and last) session of training was completed just before the project closing date, the certification procedures remained to
                         be completed further.

                         In parallel, the National Agency of Cadastre and Land Registration (ANCPI) pursued its strategy to scale-up the the systematic registration piloted under the project to a larger
                         number of communes and initiated negotiations with the European Union to get funding through the structural funds under the next programming period (2014-2020). In connection
                         with scaling up the registration activities, the World Bank and the ANCPI have signed an agreement for Reimbursable Advisory Services to strengthen the agency's capacity to
                         improve its policy, regulatory and institutional framework related to real estate registration.

                         Many other targets have been only partially met, most of them in direct relation with the incomplete systematic registration in the entire project area (50 communes).
