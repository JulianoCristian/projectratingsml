                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this Project is to facilitate market-based farm restructuring through enhancing the ability of farmers, farm family members, and farm workers to manage
                         their assets and income. Under this overarching objective, the Project will assist the Government of Romania (GOR) in (i) completing the property title registration of
                         land assets in rural areas and (ii) improving the delivery of socio-economic guidance services to the agricultural population.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following the partial extension agreed in June 2013, the project implementation continued under the two components implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
                         Development (MARD): Component 2 (Socio-Economic Guidance to Agricultural Population) and Component 3 (Policy, Strategy, Management). A new extension of the loan Closing
                         Date, by three months (until September 30, 2014) was granted in May 2014 to allow review and acceptance of the last deliverables under the ongoing consultant contracts. To date,

                         The socio-economic guidance (SEG) services, which have been provided to the rural population in 45 communes (of which 31 overlap with the 50 communes where the systematic
                         registration activities are being implemented), have been completed in June 2014. Overall, more than 1,030 general meetings and 29,200 individual advisory meetings have been

                         conducted, attended by over 25,600 and 14,400 participants, respectively. Most of the audience consisted of individuals (87%) but small businesses have also participated (13%).
                         These meetings, general and individual, resulted in the preparation of over 13,000 individual guidance plans, well above the target of 8,600, improving the ability of a large number of
                         farmers, family farms and other rural population to better manage their assets and skills. About 82% of the targeted population expressed satisfaction with the agricultural guidance
                         services. The number of farmers in the project area registered in the farms registry exceeded the target and is increasing, contributing to EU funds absorption, however, the
                         contribution of the project to this outcome could not be determined. In addition, the project contributed to improving the skills of 253 staff of the Paying Agency for Rural Development
                         and Fishery (APDRP) on cost-benefit analysis and its use in implementation of the National Rural Development Program (PNDR) 2014-2020 through a special training program
                         requested by MARD management. The project also financed a training program for 257 Agency for Payments and Intervention in Agriculture (APIA) staff to build capacity in: (i)
                         prevention of fraud and corruption in implementation of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) in Romania, and (ii) awareness of the changes in CAP.

                         All consultant services concerning the report preparation on “family farm design”, “standard rural projects”, and “suitability of fruit species in Romania”, contracted under component 3,
                         have been completed and accepted by the Managing Authority for Rural Development of MARD and used in preparation of specific sections of the National Program for Rural
                         Development (PNDR) 2014-2020. Ten Integrated Agricultural Offices (IAOs) have also been established in the counties Alba, Arges, Constanta, Dolj, Hunedoara, Iasi, Maramures,
                         Olt, Satu Mare, and Timis and staffed with specialists assigned by the two paying agencies (APIA and APDRP). The project also financed the procurement and delivery of office
                         equipment and vehicles to all IAOs enable their effectiveness.

                         The implementation of the Land Management component (which closed in June 2013) established a sound methodology for systematic property registration, led to substantial
                         amendment of the Cadaster and Property Registration Law, and enabled an increase of the land transactions in the project area by 29% (15% targeted), and the digitization of the
                         Land Books of 56% of the communes in the project area (50% targeted). As opposed to these achievements, the systematic registration activities have been completed in only six
                         communes out of the 50 communes contracted. The implementation of all contracts procured under the project are, however, continuing with state budget financing and it is expected
                         that 24 communes would be finalized by end 2014 while all communes are expected to be completed by end-2015. This demonstrates the commitment of ANCPI to the overall
                         objective to pursue systematic registration and has built EC confidence in the ANCPI capacity to implement a much larger program to be funded under the EC Regional Operational
                         Program (this is only the second case, after Greece, of EU financing cadastre activities from Structural Funds).
