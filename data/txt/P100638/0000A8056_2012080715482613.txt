                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this Project is to facilitate market-based farm restructuring through enhancing the ability of farmers, farm family members, and farm workers to manage
                         their assets and income. Under this overarching objective, the Project will assist the Government of Romania (GOR) in (i) completing the property title registration of
                         land assets in rural areas and (ii) improving the delivery of socio-economic guidance services to the agricultural population.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is making slow progress towards meeting its objectives. Frequent political changes in agriculture and cadastre sector governance and ANCPI affiliation have had a
                         negative impact on the Project implementation, while the substantial delays in the project financing during the past year have slowed down the Project activities. Given the short
                         remaining period before the Closing Date (June 2013), it is very likely that the proposed targets will only be partially met. A project restructuring will be required to set new, more

                         Implementation of the pilot systematic registration campaign in 19 administrative territorial units (UATs) has progressed and additional systematic registration activities have been
                         contracted in May 2012, covering 31 UATs. The 19 pilots have experienced substantial delays, but start to show positive results. with the first two UATs completed and others to
                         follow shortly. Several process shortcomings have been identified so far and are being addressed through a new instruction issued by ANCPI management, which separates the

                         systematic registration process from the implementation of the Law 18/1991 (law on land restitution). In addition, the Parliament passed several amendments to the Law 7/ 1996 and
                         associated regulations to remove many legal hurdles and costs from the systematic registration process, thus enhancing the mass approach nature of the work. This will greatly
                         simplify and speed up systematic registration contractors’ work in the field.

                         However, due to the earlier delays in project implementation, the systematic registration activities in the remaining 41 UATs can no longer be contracted and completed by project
                         closure and the government needs to revise the project implementation plans accordingly. The project's social monitoring activity has worked well as part of the systematic
                         registration activity and the topical issue of Roma property rights has been paid a particular attention. The land books digitization continues, with 46% completed.

                         The provision of socio-economic guidance services to the agricultural population through specialized consultants (SEGPs) is underway in 45 communes in all 15 target counties. The
                         Bank team repeated its recommendation to MADR to strengthen its quality monitoring regime, so to enable strict and stringent supervision of the quantity, quality, and types of
                         services delivered by participating SEGPs to final beneficiaries.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The government will develop by July 31, 2012 updated working plans for the relevant project activities, together with corresponding procurement plans and a clear budget situation
                         (both in terms of commitment credits and budgetary credits).

                         Based on the government's revised plans for the remainder of the project, options would be discussed during the next implementation support mission scheduled in October 2012. All
                         the agreements will be reflected in the restructuring package.
