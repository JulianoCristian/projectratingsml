This is an important\n            finding for the World Bank portfolio, which has shown a\n            trend towards decentralized execution of small contracts.\n            The project has also demonstrated that if the implementing\n            arrangements and processing requirements are made very\n            explicit in the Operations Manual and are disseminated\n            adequately at the beginning of the implementation, the\n            implementing parties will follow closely what is required.\n            In Vietnam, technical standards should be established first\n            and included in the design and bidding documents and ensured\n            through site inspections. With limited resources, there is\n            always a trade-off between adoption of high technical\n            standards and the need to cover more with lower standards\n            and related costs. Upfront efforts should be directed at\n            building ownership of design standards by government and\n            beneficiaries. The lack of systematic traffic data\n            collection in Vietnam hampers the ability to readily monitor\n            the impact of the project and inhibits prioritization and\n            identification of necessary interventions on roads."}, "docdt": "2002-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
