and to\n            maintain them on a sustainable basis; and c) encourage the\n            development of local contractors. To achieve the above\n            objectives, the project will help finance the following main\n            components: a) rural access road rehabilitation and\n            maintenance using the spot improvement technique; b)\n            institutional strengthening and training; and c) the study\n            of issues relating to rural transport development."}, "docdt": "1996-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
