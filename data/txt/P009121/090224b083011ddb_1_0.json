Ratings for the Bukhara and\n            Samarkand Water Supply Project were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: when designing\n            infrastructure and service provision projects within the\n            context of a regional environmental crisis it is essential\n            to minimize objectives and keep them focused on\n            interventions the borrower will support. In this case,\n            driven by the Aral Sea crisis, the Water Supply, Sanitation\n            and Health Project overly emphasized the need to mitigate a\n            range of ill-defined public health problems when even\n            provision of basic services like potable water supply was in\n            jeopardy. Adoption of community driven development models in\n            a country where the culture of community self-help lacks\n            prominence may require additional capacity-building efforts.\n            The practicality and realism of bringing about institutional\n            strengthening of a developing country\u2019s main utilities\n            through a performance-based management contract needs very\n            careful appraisal. Proper tariff setting and demand\n            management efforts are critical factors that lead to\n            expansion in customer base and increased revenues for the\n            utilities. The Buhkara and Samarkand Water Supply Project\n            managed to increase water metering significantly through\n            various measures, leading to enhanced collection of\n            revenues. However, due to lack of financial autonomy, the\n            utility is experiencing difficulty collecting the arrears\n            from government institutions. This is likely to adversely\n            affect the utilities\u2019 commercial performance if the\n            government does not address the utilities\u2019 autonomy issue soon."}, "docdt": "2015-06-24T00:30:04Z"}
