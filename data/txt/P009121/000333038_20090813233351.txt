H. Restructuring

The project was restructured on July 12, 2005 at the request of the Borrower primarily to cancel most of
the portion of the loan allocated for sanitation, health, and hygiene. At that time additional cancellations
were made to reflect actual expenditures on Component 4 (refinancing of the pilot project loan), and
component 6 (unallocated) was reduced from $7.5 million to $1.47 million. A total of $12 million was
cancelled. However, only the reallocation within loan categories was reflected in the amended Loan
Agreement. The Project Development Objectives were not revised.

                         Water Supply, Sanitation, and Health Project

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.      Uzbekistan was a slow reformer among the former Soviet Union (FSU) countries,
achieving independence in 1991 but not adopting a program of economic stabilization and
reform that could be supported by the World Bank and the IMF until late 1994. After severe
deterioration of macroeconomic balances in 1993 and into 1994, the Government initiated a
program in 1995 to stabilize and liberalize the economy. The program was supported by the
IMF's Systemic Transformation Facility (SDR100 million) and subsequently by a fifteen month
stand-by arrangement of SDR124.7 million, and an IBRD Rehabilitation Loan of US$160
million.

2.      As a result of tightened monetary and fiscal policies, 1995 and the first half of 1996
witnessed moderately successful stabilization performance. During the last half of 1996, both
stabilization and structural reform programs suffered reversal as poor harvests of grain and
cotton generated strong pressures on the exchange rate, foreign exchange reserves, and the fiscal
accounts. The Government responded by intensifying exchange and trade restrictions and by
expanding credit through the budget, leading to higher inflation and a widened fiscal deficit for
1996, and forcing depreciation of the official exchange rate by over 25 percent.

3.      The Government's objective and strategy. In the late 1980s, Government authorities in
Uzbekistan launched a program to improve the social and productive infrastructure in rural
communities, a major part of this being the provision of safe drinking water. Because of the
greater need for these public services and the large adverse effects of the Aral Sea crisis in the
Republic of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast, the Government allocated approximately 30
percent of its piped water program budget to this region, amounting to approximately US$130
million over five years. Good progress was made in achieving the Government's goals in Phase I
of this three-phase program, but the pace of construction slowed down considerably in the early
1990s. Concern over widening inequities between urban and rural areas led the Government to
seek ways of further accelerating the development of rural areas through the provision of social
and productive infrastructure. A resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers to this effect was passed
in January 1994, and a special working group chaired by the First Deputy Prime Minister was
created to prepare a development program up to the year 2000.

4.      This group's report, submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers in November 1994, concluded
that while Uzbekistan as a whole ranked favorably among comparable middle/lower middle
income countries, there were large geographical disparities due to the previous urban bias, and in
the rush to meet overall targets, the tendency of planners was to concentrate on areas where it
was easier and less costly to provide infrastructure. This situation applied particularly to water
supply and sanitation services in the western part of the country, which includes the Republic of
Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, Bukhara, and Navoi Oblasts. The UNDP's Uzbekistan Human

Development Report independently identified similar priorities for funding by international
donor agencies.

5.      In the health sector, the Government's objective was to improve the health status of the
population, with a special emphasis upon maternal and child health. At the same time, the health
sector was, like the rest of the economy, under unprecedented pressure to change its organization
and financing. Key elements of reform included the decentralization of management and
financing, and introducing privatization of some services. Early achievements included reducing
inefficient parts of the health sector and the initiation of re-training of general practitioners.
However, both the Sanitary-Epidemiology Services, responsible for water quality monitoring and
sanitation and hygiene surveillance, and the Centers of Health, responsible for health promotion
and education, were not reformed, maintaining the same structure and functions that they had
previously.

6.      Aral Sea Program. The Central Asian Republics of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan are involved in the Aral Sea Program, which was
designed in cooperation with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United
Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), and the World Bank to improve environmental, social,
and economic conditions in the region. The Bank has taken a leading role in the development
and implementation of the Program, including donor coordination, technical assistance to all
projects, and capacity building assistance to regional institutions.

7.      At a meeting of the Heads of Governments of the five Aral Sea states in February 1994, it
was decided to include the Uzbekistan Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project in the Aral
Sea Program and that the World Bank would take the lead in preparing the project focusing on
the two regions of Uzbekistan most severely affected by the Aral Sea crisis: the Republic of
Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast.

8.      Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Projects. The Aral Sea Basin Program included
the proposed Uzbekistan Water, Sanitation and Health project, as well as two other similar
World Bank-financed projects in Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. These projects involved inter-
sectoral cooperation and community participation strategies and were designed to complement
United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Japanese Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) activities
being carried out in the region. They were also coordinated closely with the activities of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The World Bank-financed projects focused on
distribution systems, rural water supplies, and utility management, while USAID funded water
sources, water quality and treatment plants. During preparation, the projects conducted needs
assessments, followed up by focus group discussions, as well as feasibility studies and pilot
projects.

9.      The proposed project was included in the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for
the period 1995 - 19982. This strategy was designed to: (a) support macroeconomic stabilization

along with structural and sector reforms; (b) strengthen market incentives, particularly in
agriculture and energy; and (c) protect vulnerable groups through establishment of an effective
safety net and more efficient service delivery. In addition, the Bank's strategy was to provide
support to ensure or expand access to basic social services which are largely poverty alleviation
focused. Bank support also was directed at strengthening the Government's institutional capacity
and acting as a catalyst for aid mobilization.

10.        The Bank's role in the social infrastructure sector was to support Government efforts to
improve the health of rural populations in the western regions of the country, which are most
severely affected by the consequences of the Aral Sea crisis and which are the most poorly
served with regard to water supply, sanitation and hygiene. As a result of these considerations
and priorities, the Bank responded with a Pilot Water Supply Engineering Project (approved by
the Board in September 1996 and declared effective in February 1997), to be followed by the
full-scale Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project, as agreed during the June 1994 donor
conference in Paris.

11.        Together with the Pilot Water Supply Engineering Project, this was the first lending
operation in the social infrastructure sector in Uzbekistan. Although the Pilot Project was
declared effective several months late (in February 1997), the experiences gained under the pilot
project were incorporated into the proposed project on an on-going basis and helped appreciably
in areas such as building local expertise in procurement and project management. Project design
was also underpinned by an extensive series of six social assessments.

12.        Bank lending for this project was complemented by co-financing from the Kuwait Fund
for Arab and Economic Development (KFAED).                           KFAED provided a parallel loan for
rehabilitation of the Nukus water treatment plant in Karakalpakstan and related infrastructure.

13.        Separately, the German development bank Kreditenstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW)
financed rural piped water supply improvements in Khorezm Region executed by Obi Hayet, a
national joint stock company. The KfW project was initially identified as a parallel co-financed
activity, but it was executed independently through the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations,
Investment, and Trade (MoFERIT).

1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

14.        The Project Development Objective3 was to improve the water supply, sanitation and
health in the project area through (a) the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation facilities,



3 The PDO stated in the SAR differs in wording but not in substance from that found in the Loan Agreement. The
Loan Agreement version is used here. The PDO in the SAR is stated as: (i) to provide safe drinking water along
with improved hygiene education and sanitation facilities for the Republic of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast,
and specifically to reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases, especially diarrheal diseases among children; and
(ii) to strengthen the institutional capacity for management, operation, and financial performance of the regional
water supply and sanitation utilities as well as the regional Centers of Health and the Sanitary Epidemiology
Stations.




                                                           3

and (b) strengthening the financial, operational, and managerial capacities of water supply and
sanitation utilities.

15.     Key performance indicators at approval were:

    a) Increased access to water through house and yard connections, public standpipes, and
        hand pumps;
    b) Quantity of water produced and distributed;
    c) Quality of water produced and distributed (percentage of water quality samples meeting
        bacteriological quality standards);
    d) Percentage of the rural population in the project area covered by hand pumps and low-
        cost sanitation;
    e) Improvement in knowledge, attitudes and practices related to water, sanitation, and
        health;
    f) Establishment of a set of key monitoring indicators on managerial, operational, and
        financial performance and training;
    g) Preparation of a plan for restructuring the water agencies by January 1998;
    h) Implementation of the restructuring plan according to a schedule agreed with the Bank.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

16.     The PDO was not revised. However, the PDO indicator (g) was formally revised by
mutual agreement between GoU and the Bank at the time of the Mid-term Review to reflect a
more realistic timetable for achievement in light of the comprehensive nature of the proposed
reforms and the limited operational and financial capabilities of the water agencies.      The
indicator was revised as follows:

    g) Preparation of draft Corporate Development Plans for the water agencies by January 31,
        2000.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

17.     The main beneficiaries of the project were expected to be about 1.12 million people
living in rural areas of the Republic of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast and 410 thousand
urban residents who would gain increased access to improved, adequate, safe, and reliable water
supply services. The project was also expected to provide about 50,000 rural and peri-urban
inhabitants with improved sanitation facilities. Improved health and productivity were expected
for these beneficiaries as a result of project activities.

             of ground water sources in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast (including the
             Chalysh well field in Khorezm); and (iii) expansion of demand-based rural water
             supplies in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast.
       (c)   Water Demand Management and Loss Reduction. (i) metering trials to test
             different approaches to metering water usage along with a consumer awareness
             program to provide practical advice on means of reducing losses and optimizing
             water use; and (ii) funds to define and implement the most economic means of
             leakage reduction.
       (d)   Equipment for Operation and Maintenance. This subcomponent provided
             equipment identified by the Institutional Strengthening Consultant and the
             Demand Management Consultant. There are two items in this subcomponent: (i)
             identification and purchase of small equipment, tools and spares; and (ii)
             identification and purchase of major equipment.

19.    Sanitation, Health and Hygiene Component (Estimated total base cost: US$11.2
million.  Actual cost:   US$2.27 million, of which IBRD financed US$2.27 million). This
component had three subcomponents:

       (a)   Rural Sanitation. This component promoted construction of improved latrines
             (elevated ventilated latrines) through the participatory approach developed during
             the pilot project, and installation of hand washing facilities in selected
             households, schools, primary health care services, canteens and public places in
             selected rural communities. The subcomponent was expected to provide around
             7,500 improved latrines and handwashing facilities, covering about 5 percent of
             the rural population in both regions. The subcomponent was to cover about 80
             percent of the construction costs, and beneficiaries would cover the remainder.
             This sub-component also provided equipment, transportation, consultant services
             and training for rural, community-based committee members and other staff in
             management and low-cost sanitation technologies.
       (b)   Health Promotion and Hygiene Education. This subcomponent financed health
             promotion and hygiene education of the urban and rural populations of
             Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast. It complemented the sanitation and hand
             pumps sub-components of the project, and was envisaged to be an integral
             element of the overall strategy for improving health and hygiene among the
             population through community-based approaches. The subcomponent also
             covered the costs of an inter-sectoral committee aimed at reviewing and assisting
             project activities.



                                                 5

       (c)     Water Quality Monitoring and Strengthening of Sanitary Epidemiological
               Services (SES). The principal objective of this subcomponent was to improve
               water quality monitoring, and sanitation and hygiene inspection of households
               and communal facilities in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast. In addition, the
               institutional and organizational efficiency of the SES was to be enhanced by
               improving the quality of health and water quality data collection, analysis and
               reporting, and integrating the data reporting for the region into the project's
               Geographic Information System (GIS) on a demonstration basis.

20.    Technical Assistance Component (Estimated total base cost: US$8.2 million. Actual
cost: US$5.64 million, of which IBRD financed US$5.64 million).

       (a)     Institutional Strengthening of Water Utilities and Bulk Providers. This
               subcomponent addressed the deficiencies in the six organizations involved in
               providing water and sewerage services to the project area. It included: (i) A
               program for carrying out regular preventive maintenance; (ii) A program for
               monitoring and reducing operating costs; (iii) A program for reduction and
               management of accounts receivable; (iv) Design and operation of a utility
               accounting system, including cost accounting; and (v) In-house and foreign
               training programs. The program includes consultancy services and training of
               trainers.
       (b)     Tariff Study. This subcomponent financed a water and sewerage tariff study,
               which would lay the foundation for the introduction of new water and sewerage
               tariff rates for the various consumers groups. It includes consultancy services for
               the formulation and implementation of the new tariff structure and office
               equipment.
       (c)     Refinancing of Feasibility Study. This subcomponent refinanced the Kuwait
               Fund's Project Feasibility Study.

21.    Project Management, Design and Supervision Component (Estimated total base cost:
US$8.4 million. Actual cost: US$9.35 million, of which IBRD financed US$8.9 million). This
component covered the costs of project management, project design, and construction
supervision by the Project Implementation Unit, with advice and assistance from foreign
consultants. Included in this component were consultant services, staffing of the PIU including
the Director in Tashkent, the regional representatives, the GIS section, and support staff.

22.    Refinancing of Pilot Water Supply Engineering Project Component (Estimated total
base cost: US$5.0 million. Actual cost: US$3.15 million, of which IBRD financed US$3.15
million). The pilot project components were refinanced by the project as agreed with the GoU in
the Pilot project. The Pilot project funded the construction of a self-managed water supply
scheme in the peri-urban areas of Nukus and the preparation of detailed designs and bid
documents by foreign consultants.

1.6     Revised Components

23.     No project components were formally revised through amendments to the Loan
agreement. However, see next section.

1.7      Other significant changes

24.     Change in organizational arrangements for the PIU: In early 2000 following protracted
difficulties in establishing an effective PIU, the Government entered into a technical and
administrative assistance agreement with UNDP to finance the establishment of the PIU. UNDP
provided a total of $ 450,000 for the PIU staff and equipment through April 2008.

25.     Scope and size of project components: In 2005, at the request of the Borrower the Bank
agreed to restructure the project and cancel a portion of the loan allocated for low-cost sanitation
and improvement in knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to water, sanitation, and health,
with the understanding that the key indicators would be achieved through domestic budget
allocations and financing from other internationally financed projects. In addition, other portions
of the loan were cancelled to reflect actual and revised projected costs. A total of $12,000,000
was cancelled, comprising $2,793,330 from Category 1 (civil works), $151,950 from Category 2
(equipment), $1,524,720 from Category 4 (refinancing of the pilot project loan), and $7,530,000
from Category 6 (unallocated).

26.     In 2003 a total of $1,672,800 of the loan was cancelled due to misprocurement of
equipment by the Borrower. The Loan Agreement was amended accordingly.

27.     Two extensions:     The project was extended twice.        The first extension was from
December 2005 to December, 2007 to allow for completion of ongoing contracts for civil works
and institution strengthening that had been delayed for reasons described in section 2.2. The
second extension, from December, 2007 to June, 2008 was granted to allow for completion of
the civil works contract #35 for the Urgench water treatment plant, and installation of
desalination plants that were already ordered under contract NDU-2.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

28.     Soundness of background analysis: The project concept and design drew extensively on
current global best practice at the time for participatory, community-based rural water supply and
sanitation projects, but these approaches were new and untested in Uzbekistan. The Project was
the Bank's first investment operation in Uzbekistan, and it was considered to be a "flagship"
project. It was designed as a health improvement project, funding least cost solutions ­ lowering
the cost of water supply and reducing water wastage through conservation and demand
management, along with support for improving sanitation and hygiene practices. It also aimed to
bring about a gradual reduction in government subsidies through tariff increases and an increase
in institutional efficiency. Sector reforms were explicitly excluded from the project but were
expected to be addressed under a follow-up operation in a more prosperous part of the country.



                                                  7

It was a large and complex operation, with two co-financing institutions (the Kuwait Fund and
KfW4), two implementing ministries, and six utilities involved in project implementation. The
size of the loan was partly determined by the donors' wish to assist the population in the Aral
Sea's impact area. The project design incorporated findings from several years of donor-assisted
studies and technical assistance activities that had been implemented on a very limited scale.

29.     Project identification in late 1994 led to the formulation of two concurrent project
preparation activities ­ an overall project feasibility study, and rural sanitation, hygiene and
health pilot projects to develop and test low-cost latrine designs and participatory methodologies
and define investment requirements. The results of the pilot projects were to form the basis of
the low-cost water supply and rural sanitation sub-component as well as the urban and rural
health and hygiene component. An extensive series of five social assessments were carried out
as a part of these pilot activities. However, implementation of the pilot projects was delayed and
this led to the project being appraised without these components being fully designed. A JICA-
sponsored team completed a detailed study of the water supply investment needs of six major
cities in the project area to the year 2015. The findings of the JICA study were used extensively
in the project's feasibility study for the urban water supply aspects.

30.     Adequacy of Government commitment and assessment of risks: Assessment of the
institutional capacity of regional and central government agencies for project management
appears to have been inadequate, particularly in light of the major policy shifts and innovative
approaches envisaged in particular for the sanitation, hygiene, and health components.
Furthermore, as this was the Bank's first social infrastructure loan in Uzbekistan, the executing
and implementing agencies were unfamiliar with Bank procurement guidelines. This led to long
delays and high transaction costs in connection with most procurement transactions through the
first half of the project life. Uzbekistan was in its first years of separation from the former Soviet
Union during project formulation. Institutions were in flux, and many were severely weakened
during the transition. This contributed to the very weak management of the project in its early
years by the implementing agency.

31.     In particular, the sanitation, health and hygiene component appears to have been prepared
with insufficient client participation or understanding, which led ultimately to the cancellation of
that component at the client's request. This may have been in part due to the fact that the
component was not fully designed at the time of appraisal and loan effectiveness and therefore
not fully understood by the executing agency.

32.     In addition to the institutional issues cited above, the project design's ambitious goals for
achieving financially sustainable water utilities did not adequately take into consideration the
extreme poverty affecting Karakalpakstan and the limited scope for recovering full costs through
tariffs.




4Although KfW was identified as a parallel co-financier of the project at appraisal, the KfW project in Khorezm
Oblast was separately executed through MoFERIT and was then not considered to be a direct co-financier of
WSSHP.

QAG assessment: No Quality-at-Entry assessment was carried out for the project prior to
Appraisal.

2.2      Implementation

33.      The loan became effective in October 1997. Weak institutional arrangements for project
management by the implementing agency led to delays in meeting some loan covenants5 and
unsatisfactory performance ratings by the second year of implementation. In 1998 there was a
change in the Bank's task team and only one member of the original team continued working on
the project.      Procurement of project management consultants for the PIU was delayed
extensively by the Bank's justified refusal to agree to a sole sourced $13.5 million management
consultant contract due to the size of the contract and non-specialized nature of the assignment.
Ultimately a competitive process was followed that resulted in a much lower contract price ($2.2
million). Starting in October 1998, even though disbursements were in line with appraisal
estimates, the project was rated unsatisfactory because of the difficulties facing project
implementation, in particular management weaknesses and delays in launching the rural
sanitation and hygiene component.            To address these concerns, an early mid-term review was
held in November 1999. The MTR resulted in a number of agreed actions to improve project
performance, including:

      Preparation of corporate development plans for the six water supply companies in
          Karakalpakstan and Khorezm by January 2000;
      Preparation of an implementation plan, inception report and operational manual for the
          rural sanitation project component by January 2000;
      Finalizing a technical assistance agreement with UNDP for the management of the PIU
          by end 1999 (this assistance was to provide equipment and local consultants for the PIU,
          in addition to the international project management consultants);
      Finalizing a contract for the project management and construction supervision
          consultant, and;
      Hiring auditors for a period of three years satisfactory to the Bank for the audit of the
          financial statements for 1999 and subsequent years.

34.      The task team also commissioned a Supervision Enhancement Review by QAG in early
2000 to address concerns about poor implementation. This review noted the high cost of
supervision during the project's first years and recommended more intensive use of local staff at
the resident mission. It also noted the likely continued need for intensive supervision in light of
the complex nature of the project design, and the need for an intensive process of social
assessment and stakeholder consultation. The review recommended seeking bilateral grant
financing to fund some of these latter activities, but this was not carried out.




5In late 1999, 7 out of 14 loan covenants were not in compliance. These concerned project audits and financial
management reforms within the water utilities.




                                                        9

35.     Despite these efforts and continued intensive supervision by the task team, the project
was fraught with implementation constraints, most of which were associated with procurement
as described in Section 2.4 below. Project implementation was chronically affected by long
delays in completing contracting procedures. In particular following a corruption investigation
in 2002, the Borrower's requirement for MoFERIT expert review of all contracts and
amendments led to extended delays in finalizing contracts for project activities.

36.     In 1999, as a part of the rural water supply component, a consulting firm (Binnies and
Partners) carried out field work and prepared proposals for implementing a handpump project in
Karakalpakstan. Inter alia, the proposals recommended extensive improvements to the design
and installation procedures for locally produced handpumps. It is unclear if these
recommendations were acted on by the project. Ultimately the handpump program was executed
by the Hydrogeological Survey of Karakalpakstan.

37.     The Sanitation and hygiene component was plagued by extensive delays caused in part
by lack of agreement within Government regarding the need for most of the activities that were
initially envisaged.    In late 1999 an international consulting firm, CarlBro International, was
contracted for a period of two years to implement the component. The task was ambitious and
was dependent, inter alia, on Government support for a highly participatory implementation
process and support for project investment in household latrine construction subsidies.
Ultimately, the consultant was unable to reach agreement with the Government on
implementation arrangements and the assignment was terminated in 2001.

38.     Implementation performance began to improve markedly following the appointment of
new PIU staff in 2004. The PIU functioned very effectively during the project's final years.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39.     M&E Design. The project's monitoring and evaluation (M&E) design was undertaken
before the Bank initiated a more robust approach to results monitoring. Nonetheless, the Project
Implementation Unit was able to monitor progress. Inadequacies in the project's original M&E
design include:

 Many of the indicators were poorly defined, which made it difficult to track them;
 The SAR's Results Framework included target values for only some of the outcome
    indicators. The output indicators with target values were almost exclusively focused on the
    performance of the six (later merged into three) water agencies;
 Despite the fact that health improvement was among the project's explicit development
    objectives, no baseline indicators of health status were provided in the SAR, and project
    impacts on health status were not monitored in any systematic way.
 Even though the sanitation and hygiene component was substantially altered during project
    duration, the project M&E indicators were not adjusted simultaneously, resulting in less than
    satisfactory results for this component. The restructuring was not used as an opportunity to
    revise the results framework more comprehensively in order to address its deficiencies. For
    example, some indicators related to activities that were no longer included in the




                                                10

    reconfigured project design (such as construction of latrines and hand washing basins) were
    not amended to reflect the change;
 Many indicators do not have a baseline value.             For instance, all agency performance
    indicators include target values but not baseline values;
 The Staff Appraisal Report mentions a process for setting up the M&E arrangements and
    their implementation to be formulated by 2000 ­ three years after the project became
    effective.

40.     M&E Implementation. Data was collected during project implementation on a regular
basis using appropriate methods. However, more emphasis was given to monitoring and less to
evaluation. The need to establish better information systems that can store the information that is
collected and manage it in a way to allow for comparative analysis over time, and ideally with
other projects is a lesson to be taken from this project. Such information systems would have to
be developed during project design to ensure that M&E arrangements are set up in a timely
manner, and responsibilities for M&E are clearly defined. Data to assess project impacts on
health were to be collected from government health statistics along with periodic knowledge,
attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys, but this was not done

41.     M&E Utilization. Although data was collected, the data was not systematically
evaluated. As a result, the M&E was used almost exclusively to respond to Bank and Borrower
supervision demands and needs for project monitoring data rather than for more in depth
evaluation that could have gleaned lessons and guided refinements to project implementation.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

42.     Environment and social safeguards: Preparation of the project included environmental
studies consistent with the applicable procedures of the Government of Uzbekistan and the
provisions of World Bank Operational Directive 4.01. The Project was assigned a category B
rating and the SAR included a separate annex on environmental analysis that describes the
impacts and mitigating measures to be taken for each project activity. In practice project
activities were in compliance with Bank environmental and social safeguards during
implementation. At negotiations is was agreed that the dam for the Tuyamuyun Hydro System
would be inspected annually in accordance with sound engineering practices by independent
experts and the report and recommendations of the experts forwarded to the Bank for review.
Annual inspection of the dam is in fact standard practice by the Borrower in any case, with
annual dam safety inspections being carried out by the State Inspection Agency of the Cabinet of
Ministers (Gosvodkhoznadzor).       An inspection report was provided to the Bank in 2000
following a detailed engineering and geodetic evaluation, which occurs every five years.      The
Government provided confirmation that inspections were carried out in subsequent years, but
copies of the reports were not provided to the Bank as they are considered to be of strategic
national security importance.

43.     The project involved no land acquisition or resettlement. Ex post analysis suggests that
social impacts have been positive, with project benefits directed disproportionately at poorer
communities in the rural components.




                                                11

44.     Financial management:         From a fiduciary perspective the financial management
arrangements within the PIU improved significantly during the latter part of the implementation
period. Nonetheless, the PIU maintained project financial management arrangements that were
rated marginally satisfactory as per the latest financial management supervision conducted in
March 2008. Financial management of the beneficiary water utilities ­ "Tuyamuyun Urgench"
(formerly OJSC Horezm "Suvokava") and "Tuyamuyun Nukus" (formerly Production Board
"Suuakaba"), in particular the accounting and internal control systems, remained unsatisfactory
throughout the implementation period. This is in spite of efforts made to strengthen accounting
and internal controls, based on the financial management action plan developed as part of
institutional strengthening.

45.     There was significant delay in submission of audit reports. For example, audit reports for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 were not submitted until July 2004, when combined
2002 and 2003 audit reports were received. There was progressive improvement in the timeliness
of audit reports during the latter part, with the 2005 audit reports being submitted after a four
months delay, while the 2006 audit reports were submitted within one month after the due date.
The entity audit reports for the year ended December 31, 2007 were submitted before the due
date.

46.     The project accounts audit report for the year ended December 31, 2007 was to be
submitted together with the last audit report covering the period January 1 ­ June 30, 2008 by 30
June, 2009. The Borrower submitted these two reports to the Bank in October, 2008, well before
the due date.

47.     Audit reports over the implementation period reflected the weak financial management
systems of both the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and the water utilities that were the main
beneficiaries of the loan. Although project audit reports improved, from a qualified opinion with
several internal control issues to an unqualified opinion with few internal control issues, entity
audit reports reflected serious weaknesses in accounting and internal control systems maintained
by the two water utilities. The last entity audit reports for the year ended December 31, 2007
contained a qualified (adverse) opinion, while during previous years the auditor issued a
disclaimer opinion, indicating significant weaknesses in accounting and internal control systems.

48.     Audited financial statements of the water utilities also show non-compliance with the
financial covenants contained in Section 5 of the Loan Agreement. The financial statements also
show non-compliance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement requiring the Borrower to
establish tariff structures for water and sewerage services at levels that would enable each water
agency to generate revenues sufficient to cover their operation and maintenance expenses,
working capital requirements and reasonable portion of the cost of investment program.

49.     Procurement: Procurement processes were a major weakness of the project and were a
major factor in delaying the achievement of project objectives from the outset. Significant
factors affecting procurement performance included:




                                                12

     A one year delay in 1998/9 in the procurement of project management consultants due to
        the Bank's justified refusal to agree to a sole sourced $13.5 million consultant contract
        due to the size of the contract and non-specialized nature of the assignment.
     A corruption investigation by the Borrower that resulted in replacement of all of the PIU
        national staff in May 2002. This resulted in a virtual halt to project implementation for
        nearly two years.
     Misprocurement of equipment (excavators and bulldozers purchased to mitigate the
        consequences of the drought) due to two contracts not being registered by MoFERIT
        because of a disagreement over the competitively selected prices. Misprocurement was
        declared in April 2003, and the related portion of the loan was cancelled.
     A case of fraudulent contracting by VNIIST (Russia) amounting to $11,259,046 for
        construction of the Urgench water treatment plant that was investigated by the Bank and
        the PIU in June, 2003, at which point the contractor had been paid $$4,116,504 of the
        total contract amount. After unilateral cancellation of the contract by the Russian party
        and a number of legal actions by the Borrower, GoU was reimbursed $2,983,532 by the
        contractor. The civil works were later re-bid and the plant was successfully completed in
        2008, about four years later than planned.
     Weak contract management capacity within the implementing agency led to many delays
        and conflicts in the implementation of contracts.

50.     The Borrower's requirement that all contracts must be registered and reviewed by
MoFERIT has led to frequent extended delays in procurement processes. The process also
involves verification of prices that have been established through competitive tendering
procedures that conform to the Bank's procurement guidelines. This has led to disputes over
pricing and has contributed to procurement delays and project management costs.

51.     In addition to the low capacity for procurement management within the implementing
agency, the Bank's procurement procedures were new to the institution. The Bank's supervision
task team recommended that the PIU employ a consultant procurement specialist, supported by
close advisory support and training in Bank procurement practices. This was done. Although
fundamental project management weaknesses continued to affect the implementing agency
throughout the life of the project, procurement management by the PIU improved considerably
during the latter years.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

52.     By the end of the project, the Nukus water treatment plant had been rebuilt and expanded,
a new plant was constructed for Urgench, over 109 Km of trunk pipelines were replaced and
peri-urban water distribution centers rehabilitated. Groundwater sources for four rayon centers
were rehabilitated as well. In rural areas, 300 desalination plants were replaced, 59 rural piped
water distribution centers were reconstructed, and 115 Km. of new pipe network was put in place.

53.     The three water companies that had been restructured and amalgamated from the original
six utilities at the start of the project had been strengthened considerably through the project's
institutional strengthening component.        A water metering and leak detection program is
established in both Urgench and Nukus. Modern computerized accounting software that is



                                                 13

compatible with national systems was installed, and training provided. The Urgench and Nukus
water treatment plants are managed by well-trained staff. Similarly, effective systems are in
place for the operation and maintenance of rural piped water distribution centers and desalination
plants. The Asian Development Bank through its parallel rural water supply and sanitation
project in Khorezm is providing the ongoing institutional support that was recommended in the
consultants' final report for the institutional strengthening component.

54.     The main risk to sustainability of the piped water infrastructure is the ongoing inability to
charge tariffs sufficient to fully cover operation, maintenance, and debt service. This will be
exacerbated in 2012 when the water companies will be required to assume repayment of loans
for infrastructure constructed under the project. An additional risk is the fact that water company
staff are paid low salaries, and payments are often delayed due to the fiscal constraints the
companies' experience. If more remunerative jobs are available elsewhere, it is likely that the
water companies will lose skilled staff for whom the companies have invested significant
resources for training.

55.     The hand pumps installed in rural communities during the early years of the project as a
part of the emergency drought assistance program are less likely to be sustained. The quality of
the shallow lift pumps procured is poor and the installation was inadequate. The pumps have
weak and small concrete platforms without adequate drainage. The ICR team visited some of
these pumps, all about five years old, and found them to be in very poor condition. Concrete
platforms were broken or missing and the wells' rising main pipes were often loose, allowing
contaminated surface water to drain into the well. The Hydrogeological Survey Department
estimates that about 50% of the hand pumps are no longer functioning. Nonetheless, those that
are functioning are heavily used as they provide better access to the same poor quality of water
used prior to the pumps being installed.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of the project objectives is high. Following approval, the project remained consistent
with Bank priorities through subsequent country assistance strategies (CASs). The first CAS,
covering 2002-2004 focused on supporting long-term actions that would enhance the efficiency
of resource allocation and use in social infrastructure and services, which is a key pillar of this
project. The Interim Strategy Note of 2006 maintained the focus on the improvement of basic
social services. The CAS for 2008-2011 presents several pillars to accelerate economic growth
by addressing the low quality of basic service delivery, and improved environment management.

56.     The project has also remained highly relevant within the Government of Uzbekistan's
overall development priorities. In 2008 the Government completed a national inventory of water
supply and sanitation services and has put forward an ambitious investment plan to improve
services over the next ten years. This plan includes specific requests for additional World Bank
lending and draws on lessons from this project. Furthermore, although the project was prepared
in advance of the declaration of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the project is
extremely well aligned with global priorities and targets set forth in the MDGs, most notably the




                                                   14

targets for improving access to safe WSS services. Despite the project's eleven year
implementation period, the development goals it prioritized have remained highly relevant.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

57.     The Project Development Objective was to improve the water supply, sanitation and
health in the project area through (a) the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation facilities,
and (b) strengthening the financial, operational, and managerial capacities of water supply and
sanitation utilities. Progress was made in achieving many of the indicators of achievement for the
PDO. However, because of the absence of baseline values for a number of these indicators it is
not easy to judge how significant this progress has been.

58.     Increased access to water through house and yard connections, public standpipes, and
hand pumps. Increased access to water supply has been partially achieved. Different sources
provide evidence that water supply access has increased significantly, but the number of
beneficiaries with access to safe water is not as high as was projected in the SAR. UNICEF
through its Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) for 2006 notes that 97.5 percent of the
population in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast had access to improved water sources.
Almost 55 percent of the population in Western Uzbekistan had access to piped water (up from
35% in 1997), whereas the remaining 42.5 percent depended on improved wells for their access.

59.     The increase in access is also reflected in the provision of services by the water agencies,
which saw their number of connected households and house connections increase. As can be
seen in Table 3.1, households in project areas have much higher access to higher water supply
service levels than households located in control areas.

60.     Quantity of water produced and distributed. The quantity of water produced and
distributed declined significantly in the years of project implementation due to reductions in
water losses and improvements in demand management. There is also increasingly less water
available for water production since the start of the project. The flow of the principle surface
water source in the project area, the Amu Darya River, is continuously decreasing because of


                                                 15

heavy withdrawals upstream, due in large part to the breakdown in coordinated water
management among national riparians that was in place during the soviet era.

61.     Water consumption in the project area has declined from the excessively high per capita
levels prior to the project. During project appraisal, a very small decline in consumption from the
high normative consumption levels of the Soviet era was foreseen (see Annex 3 of the ICR). In
actuality, the decline in consumption was much bigger than was anticipated.             Residential
consumption dropped significantly. Total consumption declined even faster due in part to
reductions in leakages and installation of water meters in apartments and private houses, but also
to commercial users developing alternative sources (private boreholes, pumps). The non-
residential (i.e. commercial) customers have almost disappeared in some of the utilities. As a
result of these resource and demand management factors, water production dropped by about 55
percent between 1995 and 2007 in the two main water utilities for the two regions.

62.     This decline in water consumption is a positive outcome of the project, as it indicates
more efficient management of increasingly scarce water resources. However, the increased exit
of non-residential consumers is not good for the utilities financially as the high tariffs paid by
commercial consumers provide cross-subsidies for low income residential customers.             The
reduction in commercial consumption jeopardizes the financial sustainability of the utilities.

63.     Actual (physical) water losses declined from 38 million cubic meters in the 3 utilities at
the start of the project to less than 23 million cubic meters per year by 2007. However, this
decline must be attributed to a number of concurrent interventions in addition to the activities
supported by the World Bank, KFAED, KfW, and UNDP through this project. USAID also
invested in improvements to the production capacity and physical efficiency of the
Karakalpastan water companies during the life of the project, and projects financed other
external agencies including the ADB, the European Union, and bilateral donors were also active
in the two regions covered by WSSHP during the period of implementation.

64.     Quality of water produced and distributed (percentage of water quality samples meeting
bacteriological quality standards). According to data from SES, the percentage of water quality
samples from piped supplies in the project area meeting national bacteriological quality
standards for drinking water was 99 percent in 2007.

65.     Percentage of the rural population in the project area covered by hand pumps and low-
cost sanitation. In the Staff Appraisal Report, data are available only for the percentage of rural
population with access to water supply services (irrespective of what type of service is provided
­ piped or non-piped). The 1995 social assessment determined that nearly 60% of households in
the project area used wells and/or hand pumps as their primary water source. By 2008, access to
piped water service in the project area had increased and only 42% of households in project
communities relied on hand or electric pumps or wells.            In comparison, 58% of control
communities used hand or electric pumps at the time of the impact survey in 2008. Overall,
access to improved water supplies in both project and non-project communities has increased
considerably, to 97% according to 2008 beneficiary survey data, but in project communities the
proportion of households using piped water sources has increased much more than in control
communities.

66.     The project had no significant direct impact on coverage with low-cost sanitation
facilities, since the component was cancelled in 2004 after only very few demonstration facilities
were completed, and the project's sanitation infrastructure targets were not met through the
project per se. However, 2008 beneficiary data suggest that use of latrines has increased over the
project life. This is likely due to a variety of interventions both internal and external to the
project and socio-economic factors, most of which are probably not directly related to project
activities and outputs.

67.     Improvement in knowledge, attitudes and practices related to water, sanitation, and
health. No project-specific baseline data are available to assess health or hygiene impacts.
Although hygiene education was envisaged to be a significant part of the project, in practice only
one health educator was provided with training in each region, along with limited support for
hygiene education in schools and production of radio broadcasts promoting good hygiene.
Project efforts pertaining to hygiene education were limited due to the cancellation of this
component of the project in 2004.

68.     The UNICEF MICS3 study for Uzbekistan found that hygiene practices are reasonably
well developed. In 2006, 97 percent of the population in Western Uzbekistan, the area where the
project was active, treated their household water ­ mostly by boiling water. Practices for
household water treatment are rather uniform among income class, education level or type of
settlement. The use of toilets is also very high. Nonetheless, the proportion of children whose
stools are disposed of safely stood at 46 percent ­ significantly lower than 59 percent for
Uzbekistan. Overall, hygiene practices tend to be satisfactory in the project areas, but attribution
to the project activities of any improvements is not possible.

69.     No attempt was made through the project to directly monitor health impacts.
Government health data suggest that the incidence water and sanitation-related diseases is
generally declining in the project area (see Annex 3, table 3.5), but a comparative analysis of
project and non-project areas was not possible.

70.     Establishment of a set of key monitoring indicators on managerial, operational, and
financial performance and training. A set of monitoring indicators was set out to assess the
performance of the water utilities, and this indicator was achieved. Compared to the assumptions
made in the Staff Appraisal Report, the performance of the water agencies improved
significantly. A good proxy for this is the level of operating subsidies that are being provided to
the sector. During project appraisal it was assumed that the Government would provide to the
different companies a total subsidy of about $60 million a year by the end of the project
compared to less than $450,000 that was provided in 2007 ­ even though inflation increased
significantly more than was foreseen during project appraisal.

71.     Preparation of a plan for restructuring the water agencies by January 1998. A plan for
restructuring the water agencies was prepared, although it was undertaken later than January
1998. This indicator was formally revised by mutual agreement between GoU and the Bank at
the time of the Mid-term Review to reflect a more realistic timetable for achievement in light of
the comprehensive nature of the proposed reforms and the limited operational and financial
capabilities of the water agencies. The indicator was revised to preparation of draft Corporate
Development Plans for the water agencies by January 31, 2000. This indicator was achieved in
mid-2000.

72.     Implementation of the restructuring plan according to a schedule agreed with the Bank.
The sector was restructured significantly during project implementation, with the six agencies in
existence at the start of the project being merged into three agencies.

Summary

73.     In summary, the evidence suggests that six of the eight key performance indicators were
fully met ­ some of the indicators exceeded their targets by a wide margin, especially those
related to water supply access and per capita water consumption. However, the total number of
beneficiaries is significantly less than originally anticipated. An estimated total of 1,136,000
people have directly benefited from the water supply improvements resulting from the project,
compared with 1,530,000 beneficiaries projected in the SAR. This may be a reflection of the
reduced investment in the project due to partial cancellation of the loan (68% of the original loan
amount was actually used), which led to more focus on rehabilitation of existing services and
fewer people gaining new access to safe water supplies.

74.     Improvements have also been made in putting the sector on a more sustainable financial
footing, but much work remains to be done. The large government subsidies of the past have
mostly disappeared, but two of the three water agencies have operating cost coverage ratios that
show they are unable to cover their operating costs with their operating revenues alone; the
situation is most critical for the rural water agency in Karakalpakstan.             The financial
performance of Tuyamuyun Nukus as measured by the operating cost coverage ratio indicates
that they are barely able to meet their operating costs with revenues. This is in fact rather good
financial performance in view of the sharply declining government subsidies while operating in a
high inflation environment. At the time of appraisal it was assumed that the utilities would




                                                 18

continue to receive large subsidies. In that light, the financial performance of the utilities is
better than originally anticipated. Nonetheless, financial sustainability remains a major concern.

75.     The improvement in knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding water, sanitation and
health is more mixed. Access to basic sanitation is universal, but this is most likely not
attributable to the project due to the very limited actual investment in the sanitation component.
Basic hygiene practices can be improved upon. As no baseline was set for these improvements
to be measured against, it is difficult to conclude whether this indicator was fully met. Coverage
with hand pumps in rural communities did not meet project targets, and the sustainability of the
pumps that were installed is questionable.

3.3 Efficiency

76.     Project efficiency. An ex-ante cost-benefit analysis was undertaken during preparation.
Replicating the economic analysis as laid out in the Staff Appraisal Report is fraught with
difficulties as is discussed in Annex 3. The economic analysis assumed a set of benefits that
essentially did not materialize due to major changes in the available supply of water and changes
in consumption patterns. One of the major benefits envisaged was increased consumption from
increasing access and improving service quality, but the projections underestimated the impact
that improved service efficiency and pricing would have on water consumption. Although more
households gained access to water, the actual consumption per household decreased substantially
over the project implementation period.

77.     A revised incremental financial analysis shows that the financial rate of return of the
project is 13 percent. The project has a positive net present value primarily due to cost savings.
Revenues from residential consumers have been relatively small due to the low willingness to
pay for water services. Even though water rates have increased rapidly over time ­ also in real
terms ­ the actual water rates are still very low. In addition, some of the investments were also
relatively expensive as will be discussed in the next section.

78.     Unit cost efficiency. The unit costs of preparing the investment subprojects were much
lower than expected. The projects total cost including contingencies was estimated at $117
million, of which $68.2 million was allocated for water supply investments. At the end of the
project, $58.4 million was used for this component. This has resulted in a decline in the number
of people served with water through new access or because of improvements to existing services.
This results in a per capita cost per water supply beneficiary of $44 both at project appraisal and
at the end of the project. However, this is achieved with a very different composition of the
actual water supply investment program. During project appraisal, it was assumed that most
investments would be allocated to rural water supply (about 73 percent). In reality, at the end of
the project, only 53 percent was used for rural water supply improvements. As urban water
supply ­ depending on networks ­ tend to be more expensive than rural water improvements, it
is likely that if the project composition had remained similar to that foreseen in the Staff
Appraisal Report, the cost savings would have been substantially larger.

79.    Overall, unit cost efficiency has turned out higher than estimated during project appraisal
despite a relatively higher number of people gaining access to services for the first time.

80.    Poverty Targeting. The project was efficient in targeting its interventions to low-income
areas and their residents. As described in Annex 5 and portrayed in figures 1 and 2 below, the
beneficiary survey results show that the project areas tend to have relatively poorer populations
than the control areas.

81.     Efficacy. The project's efficacy was measured by determining its leverage. The funding
proportions for the project changed during project implementation. The Bank's contribution
declined from $75 million to less than $59 million, while the proportions financed by KFAED
and KfW remained the same. A part of the lower costs was related to the high inflation and
consequent local currency devaluation that occurred during the period of project implementation
and led to lower costs in US dollar terms. As a result, the local component of the project was
less expensive than originally anticipated. As an example, the cost of refinancing the pilot
project was estimated at $5 million during project appraisal, while at the end of the project this
component's total cost was only $3.2 million.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating:         Moderately satisfactory

82.     The project was highly consistent with the previous two CAS/ISNs and remains relevant
in the context of the new CAS, each of which emphasize support for the provision of basic social
infrastructure for development and poverty reduction. It also fits and foreshadowed global
priorities for WSS and slum upgrading as represented by the MDGs. As such, the project has
remained highly relevant.

83.     The project was able to accomplish most of its expected outcomes as measured by the
attainment of its key performance indicators, and it did so in such a way that was effective in
targeting its interventions to predominantly poor areas, while being cost-effective.

84.     Nevertheless, substantial implementation delays and governance issues affected
implementation, and the PDO and performance indicators did not reflect the evolving nature of
the project, in particular the restructuring and cancellation of a major project component on rural
sanitation and health. This led to under-achievement of some PDO targets, and under-spending
of funds. The overall project outcome is therefore rated as Moderately Satisfactory.




                                                                        21

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

85.     Beneficiary survey results in 2008 suggest that households in the project areas tend to be
poorer than the households living in the target areas in both Khorezm Oblast and Karakalpakstan.
This suggests that the project has been relatively well targeted to the poor.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

86.     Against the four criteria aimed to improve cost efficiency, the three merged water
agencies actually made significant progress during the period of implementation.
Notwithstanding a challenging macro-economic environment, the utilities were able to improve
their efficiency despite a sharp reduction in the volume of water produced and sold and a
reduction in government subsidies.

87.     All three utilities were able to reduce their NRW losses as both production and
consumption of water has declined rapidly. This is largely the result of lack of available water
supply for water production as water losses decreased from 38 million cubic meters per year in
1997 to about 23 million cubic meter in 2007. Yet, rationalization of water demand due to tariff
increases and an increase in the efficiency with which water and wastewater are provided also is
likely to have had a major impact on the reduction of the losses;

88.     Operating cost per cubic meter of water in US dollar terms have increased according to
the projections made in the Staff Appraisal Report. Yet, even though O&M cost per cubic meter
increased, the actual cost per household connection fell significantly as more households use
much less water than forecasted.

89.     The number of water connections increased. Yet, the increase in water connections went
in tandem with a sharp decline in the per capita water consumption. This is a positive outcome
from the project as the rationalization of water demand is urgently needed in an area where water
is becoming increasingly scarce.

90.     The operating cost coverage ratio that describes the capacity of utilities to cover their
operation and maintenance costs with their operating revenues is showing that the short-term
financial sustainability of the utilities just as at the times of project appraisal remains an issue.
Unlike during appraisal, government subsidies today are much lower than forecasted and hence
some progress has made in making the utilities more self-sufficient.

91.     Despite the many improvements made, the financial performance of the utilities is still
unsustainable in the medium- to long-term. The trend of losses may actually be underestimated
due to the sharp decline in the utilities' non-residential customer base, low levels of depreciation
reserves, and the fact that debt service payments on the World Bank loan will soon be due.




                                                  22

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

92.     The most important unintended outcome of the project was the sharp decline in water
production and consumption. Although some small decline in per capita consumption was
foreseen during project appraisal, the overall production and consumption was supposed to
increase as a larger population would gain access to water supply and sanitation services. This a
positive impact in view of the water resource scarcity in the region and an indicator of improving
utility performance and effective demand management.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshops

93.     The beneficiary survey shows that households in project areas have greater access to
piped water supplies. Improving the quality of water was an important rationale behind the
project design, with two major civil works aimed at improving the water treatment plants in
Nukus and Urgench. Water quality monitoring data from SES show that the number of water
samples passing bacteriological and chemical standards has improved significantly.           Water
pressure is better in project rayons than in control rayons, and fewer households in project rayons
need to rely on electric pumps to get water supplied to their dwelling.

94.     In the control rayons, households have less access to piped water supply systems. In the
target areas, 58 percent of the households do not have access to a piped water supply system
compared to 66 percent in control rayons. Yet, when households do have access, households in
control areas tend to have more hours of supply per day than in project areas.

95.     Even though most households do not perceive the quality of their water supply improved,
satisfaction in the project areas seems relatively high. As a proxy for satisfaction the survey
team asked households whether they thought their water supply needed improvements. A higher
percentage of households in the project rayons thought no improvements were needed compared
to households in control rayons.

96.     Another indicator of consumer satisfaction is how much households pay for water. The
median monthly household payment for water is higher in project rayons than in target rayons.
While overall many customers do not pay for their services throughout the regions, project
households are much more likely to pay for water than households in the control group. About
54 percent of households in project areas state that they do not pay for water, compared to 79
percent in the control group. Households in project areas also tend to pay more for water than
those in control areas.

97.     Almost all households surveyed have access to basic sanitation. Less than 1 percent of
the surveyed households mentioned that they did not have access to a toilet. Although access to
basic sanitation is more or less universal, access to wastewater collection and treatment is much
less common. Only a very small percentage of households are connected to a sewerage system.
The majority depends on cesspits for wastewater collection, and discharge to streets in small
urban areas is still a common phenomenon.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

98.     Overall, the water supply improvements achieved by the project appear to be technically
sustainable. They employ technologies that are well understood by those who operate them, and
consumer satisfaction with services is high. There has been a substantial improvement in the
technical and administrative competence of the water utility staff and management and there
appears to be adequate political support for sustaining the project outcomes. Ongoing capacity
building support for the utilities that was identified during the final years of the project is now
being funded through an ongoing, parallel project financed by the Asian Development Bank.

99.     The principle risk to sustaining the achievements is financial. Although tariffs have been
raised considerably during the life of the project, two of the three utilities are unable to cover
operating costs with current revenues. Energy costs are increasing and the financial situation of
the third utility, which is currently just breaking even, is likely to deteriorate. Currently, the
utilities are not required to service their portion of the debt for project investments, but national
policy stipulates that all public utilities will be required to begin servicing this debt by 2013.
This will substantially increase the financial burden, but the scope for increasing revenues
through tariff increases is limited. Particularly in Karakalpakstan a large percentage of the
consumer population is poor and the scope for increasing cross-subsidies from commercial tariffs
is actually declining. A national policy decision to maintain a subsidy sufficient to allow the
utilities to cover all costs if they achieve and maintain certain performance benchmarks would
substantially increase the likelihood of project achievements being sustained.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance
(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

100.    The project preparation task team drew extensively on global best practice at the time for
designing community-based, demand-responsive rural water supply and sanitation programs, and
invested substantial resources in social assessments to gain an understanding of the situation and
needs in proposed benefiting communities.         However, the very large economic and social
changes extant in Uzbekistan during preparation and implementation of the project limited the
relevance of some global lessons to the design of this project

101.    The team underestimated the magnitude of institutional weaknesses in the project
implementing and executing agencies. Governance issues were also significant, and would have
been better addressed through a more extended period of piloting, building capacity, and
securing clear understanding and buy-in to all aspects of the project strategy and activities prior
to launching a full-scale investment project. Alternatively, a series of more focused and smaller
investments that would have progressively built on experience while institutional capacity
developed might have been a more effective approach.



                                                  24

102.     Finally, although the project was conceived as a part of the Aral Sea Program with the
goal to provide support in the areas most affected by the Aral Sea crisis, the project design did
not adequately take into consideration the continued impact of the crisis on water resources in
the project area.      The SAR assumed broadly constant availability of water resources and
consumption levels based on conditions in the mid-1990s. This was not consistent with the
project intent to develop sustainable services and systems.

(b)      Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

103.     Supervision efforts for this project have been very intensive and generally of high quality.
Supervision was particularly intensive in the early years of the project as the task team attempted
to address the project's considerable implementation challenges. Supervision costs were high,
running at more than $170,000 per year in FY99 and FY00, and averaging nearly $112,000 per
year over the life of the project.

104.     The team was highly pro-active in its attempts to improve implementation performance,
initiating an early mid-term review, followed by a Supervision Enhancement Review by QAG in
early 2000. The task team also initiated two studies funded through the Bank Netherlands Water
Partnership Fund to contribute to project performance and expand the lessons learned through
implementation. The project contributed to a global study of desalination systems for rural water
supply. Following the termination of the sanitation, health and hygiene component a "lessons
learned" study was undertaken to guide the design of sanitation and hygiene components of
possible future projects6.

105.     Supervision suffered somewhat from a high turnover of task team leaders. The project
had a total of seven task team leaders over the period of implementation. During the critical
years of 2002 ­ 2004 TTLs changed yearly. The supervision team also lost an important
opportunity to revise the PDO to reflect changes resulting from project restructuring and loan
cancellation in 2005.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

106.     Although project implementation and outcomes were significantly affected by
shortcomings in the project design, the project received intensive and generally high quality
supervision that was usually proactive in identifying and responding to project performance

issues. The variable level of Client ownership of aspects of the project, and frequent changes
among key national management and coordination staff within the Ministry of Economy
provided acute challenges for the Task Team. The chief shortcoming during supervision was not
modifying the project development objectives at the time the project was restructured in 2004.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

107.   Government ownership and commitment to the overall development objectives was
adequate, but commitment to the community-based strategy for achieving some of them was
inadequate. This may have been in part due to the attenuated period of project piloting prior to
appraisal and effectiveness. Lack of readiness or capacity for implementation, as demonstrated
by the extended delays in establishing an effective project implementation unit and the related
procurement issues severely impacted project performance over the first seven years of
implementation. Financial management and governance was weak during this period.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

108.   The regional water companies and other regional agencies that implemented the project
demonstrated a generally high degree of commitment to the project objectives and approaches.
Although institutionally weak at the outset of the project, these institutions effectively used
project resources to progressively develop capacity, rehabilitate infrastructure and modernize
their administrative structures.     Further improvements are needed to strengthen financial
management but progress, particularly during the project's latter years was substantial and in line
with the project's institution strengthening objectives.

109.   The project PIU, by the end of the project, had evolved into an efficient and experienced
management team, highly committed to achieving the project objectives. Performance during
the first half of implementation was poor, but improved following the establishment of the
technical assistance agreement with UNDP to administer project funds and maintain the PIU.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

110.   Although Borrower performance was weak during the first half of project implementation,
the key agencies involved ultimately responded effectively to address project shortcomings.
This resulted in a relatively high performing project in its later years, and successful achievement
of most project objectives.

6.      Lessons Learned

111.    The cost of "over age" projects: The project was initially designed with a seven year
implementation period to take into consideration that this was the Bank's initial investment in the
WSS sector in Uzbekistan and it also incorporated design innovations.                 Nonetheless,
implementation required two extensions of the Loan Closing date, leading to a total project life
of more than ten years, and parts of the loan were cancelled. The impacts of the delays and
cancellation include the following:

     Opportunity costs ­ funds that were eventually returned could have been used to extend
        project benefits through expanded implementation of project urban and rural water
        supply infrastructure and capacity building components that the client fully supported;
     Deferred benefits ­ Delays in completion of some project components of up to three
        years prevented project-affected communities from enjoying project benefits for that
        same period of time, resulting in some political costs for the borrower and somewhat
        reduced project impacts at the time of completion;
     High commitment fees - The borrower paid commitment fees on approximately $12
        million of the loan that was unused and eventually returned to the Bank, and;
     High supervision costs - Bank supervision costs for the loan increased due to the need for
        additional supervision missions and consultant inputs to address project design and
        implementation issues and to accommodate three additional years of implementation.

112.    Need for simplified project design that is clearly understood and endorsed by the
Borrower. These impacts would likely have been avoided or minimized through a simplified
project design with a reduced scope that focused on infrastructure improvements that were
clearly endorsed by the client and for which there was relatively high capacity for
implementation. Higher risk components could have been introduced as capacity and experience
accrued through repeater projects, or through a programmatic approach such as Adaptable
Program Lending.

113.    Ensure that development objectives and indicators reflect evolving project and national
priorities. The WSSH Project was implemented over an eleven year period during which
borrower priorities for the investment evolved, but the project's development objectives did not.
Projects executed in transition countries are necessarily being implemented in a dynamic milieu
in which priorities and investment objectives can change. Project supervision by both the Bank
and the Borrower needs to regularly review a project's development objectives, and adjust them
as may be required to ensure that they remain relevant and achievable throughout the life of the
project.

114.    Designing evaluation into the project. Developing a viable strategy for evaluating as
well as monitoring project performance needs to be anticipated and built into projects during
preparation. This project invested extensively in social assessments and pilot projects during
preparation, but these efforts were not reflected in a reliable, evaluable, and comprehensive
baseline for most performance indicators. Furthermore, a strategy for monitoring and evaluation
was only developed in the early years of implementation, when it was too late to establish
reliable bases for evaluation.



                                                27

115.    Bank procurement rules can result in major cost savings. Application of the Bank's
procurement rules in this project achieved cost savings that at times were unexpected and
allowed the project to be more cost efficient than originally anticipated. A precise understanding
of the actual investment costs may not be easy to achieve, especially in a high-inflation
environment. Nonetheless, better cost monitoring systems can help. Overestimation of project
budgets by as large an amount as in this project results in unnecessarily high commitment fees
that the Borrower must pay.

116.    Procurement capacity needs to be carefully assessed during preparation. This project
was one of the first Bank operations in Uzbekistan and the Bank's procurement practices were
new and unfamiliar to the Borrower. This resulted in very significant delays in implementation.
Task teams should give careful consideration to procurement capacity-building needs and
address them in project design with adequate resources allocated for procurement training and
monitoring for implementing agencies.

117.    Setting the project in the context of broader resource management issues. Water supply
projects need to take into consideration the broader water resources milieu in which they will be
implemented. Although the project formed a part of a global response to the Aral Sea disaster,
little consideration was given to the impact of the post-soviet breakdown in water resources
management by the Amu Darya riparian countries, and the resultant continued reduction in flows
in the river that is the chief source of water, either directly or indirectly, for most of the project
activities.

118.    Sector policies played an important role in achieving project objectives. Although policy
reform was explicitly omitted as a project objective, major changes in tariff policy and water
demand management led to markedly improved performance by the water utilities involved with
the project.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

119.    The borrower has stated that the experience gained from the project indicates it is
inappropriate to appoint as the implementing agency the organization that is the beneficiary of a
project investment and will therefore ultimately accept the completed infrastructure.

120.    The Bank considers that the project experience per se does not necessarily support this
view.    Benefitting institutions may require strengthening and technical support in order to
manage the implementation of specific investments, but they also have strong vested interests in
acquiring efficient, sustainable infrastructure as a result of the investment. The governance and
capacity issues that affected this project were not attributable only to the benefitting
organizations.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1 ­ Water supply and distribution. The following outputs were produced under this
component:

Main pipeline supply system - Rehabilitation of Piped Water Systems in Urban and Rural
Centers in Karakalpakstan and Rehabilitation of Piped Water Systems in Urban and Rural
Centers in Khorezm region.       Under these sub-components contract No.20/25, financed by
KFAED, was implemented for the US$10.21 million to replace piped distribution networks in
Nukus and Urgench towns. In Nukus 26.74 km of pipe was replaced, and in Urgench ­ 32.58 km
of pipe was installed. Also, works on detection and removal of leakages in water distribution
networks were carried out. As a result, the carrying capacity of water mains in the two cities was
improved. In micro-regions of Nukus high pressure zones were created to allow water supply to
all floors in multi-storey apartment blocks. In Urgench, new distribution pipes and connections
to the water distribution system were installed which improved water supply to additional micro-
regions. In addition, a new reserve main distribution pipe to Urgench was laid to connect the
network to the Tuyamuyun system. Satisfactory

Rehabilitation of Nukus Water Treatment Works (WTW). Contract No.30 was implemented by
the Contractor ASCO for the amount of US$5.22million. The production capacity of the WTW
was increased to 65 thousand m3/day. As a result the water supply for more than 185 000 people
in Nukus was improved. Satisfactory

Rehabilitation of Urgench WTW. This sub-component was not implemented, as it was replaced
by the construction of a new water treatment plant for Urgench with twice the capacity of the old
one. Not rated

Expansion of Urgench WTW. Contract No.35 for the amount of US$10.91 million constructed a
new water treatment works with a capacity of 100 thousand m3/day, with a surface water intake
from the Shavat channel. Water service for more than 140 thousand citizens of Urgench and
nearby areas is improved. Satisfactory

Provision of Additional Trunk Pipelines in Karakalpakstan. Works under the contract No.40
($8.08 million) included construction of (a) Water conduit from Water Distribution Center-1
(WDC-1) to Water Distribution Center-2 (WDC-2) in Nukus; (b) Water Distribution Center and
water conduit in Beruni with connection to the Tuyamuyun-Nukus water pipe, and; (c) Water
Distribution Center and water pipe in Turtkul with connection to Tuyamuyun-Nukus water
conduit. A total length of 15.8km of pipe connecting Beruny and Turtkul with Tuyamuyun-
Nukus was installed. Water towers, chlorination buildings, a pump station and water tanks and
related works were constructed in Beruni and Turtkul. In Nukus an 800mm diameter pipeline of
11.25 km in length connecting the north and south water distribution centers of the city and two
bridges across the Kyzketken canal were built. In the old part of Nukus approximately 14
thousand people are provided with a continuous supply of drinking water. Satisfactory




                                                3

Development of local water supply and distribution systems - Rehabilitation of Rural Water
Distribution Centers in Karakalpakstan Republic and Khorezm Region. Under Contract No.50,
59 water distribution centers were rebuilt, including 8 group and 20 local WDC in
Karakalpakstan, and 5 group and 26 local WDC in Khorezm. Water supply for 112,300
consumers in Karakalpakstan and 95,000 consumers in Khorezm was improved. This contract
was signed for US$3.5million and disbursed US$3.89million (US$2.13million in Karakalpakstan
and US$1.76million in Khorezm). Satisfactory

Rehabilitation of Existing Desalination Units in Karakalpakstan. Contract No.60-RP replaced
existing desalination plants that were put into operation in 1980-81 and had worked out their
service life. Groundwater, drawn from depths of 400-500 m with mineralization between 2.4 and
15g/l is the water supply source. Five desalination stations were installed and put into operation.
Water mineralization is reduced to 1g/l and is in accordance with the water quality standards of
the Republic of Uzbekistan. At the expense of the State Budget it is planned to construct check-
points, improve access roads, renovate outside lighting, and to do other necessary works. The
desalination units provide safe water for approximately 6,000 rural inhabitants in the northern
regions of Karakalpakstan. This contract was signed for US$0.69million and disbursed
US$0.62million. Under contracts NDU 1 & 2 and contract DU0G1 an additional 9 desalination
plants were constructed. The project also provided replacement parts to rehabilitate 300 existing
desalination plants. Satisfactory

Rehabilitation of Chalysh Groundwater Intake in Khorezm Region. Originally intended to be
implemented under contract No 70C, the activity was cancelled after the World Bank declared
misprocurement for civil works. Unsatisfactory

Rehabilitation and Development of Groundwater Sources in Karakalpakstan
Contract No.70D rehabilitated and expanded groundwater pumping and storage facilities for
Turtkul, Beruny, Kegeyly and Chimbay. 51 boreholes were drilled and water disinfection units
were installed. Capacities were expanded as follows: Turtkul well field ­ 7.2 thousands m3/day;
Beruny well field ­ 4.8 thousands m3/day; Kegeyly well field ­ 2.4 thousands m3/day; Chimbay
well field ­ 5.0 thousands m3/day. 75-80% of population (about 120,000 people) of the above
mentioned towns was provided safe drinking water. This contract was signed for US$3.87million
and disbursed US$3.54million. Satisfactory

Expansion of Demand-based Rural Water Supply in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm
Contract No.90 constructed new water distribution networks and water distribution centers.
115km of new distribution pipe was laid, house connections provided, three chlorination stations
were constructed, and automated systems for water distribution management were installed. Safe
water was provided for more than 26,000 people in rural Karakalpakstan. This contract was
signed for US$1.97million and disbursed US$1.56million. Satisfactory

Water demand management and loss reduction
Under this component Nukus and Urgench cities were divided into several zones and one zone in
each city was selected to demonstrate demand management and water loss reduction methods. In
the selected experimental zones manholes were installed for conducting measurement activities.
Monitoring determined sources of water losses in the distribution system and in apartment blocks.



                                                4

Water meters were installed for one block of flats in each zone, achieving a 50% reduction in
water losses. Water supplying organizations' personnel were trained in using leakage detection
equipment and trained on demand management and loss reduction techniques. In addition, repair
and maintenance vehicles were procured. Also public awareness materials and campaigns to
promote water conservation were produced (television advertisements and school programs).
Satisfactory

Equipment for operation and maintenance ­ Small Equipment, Tools and Spares
Stationary and portable ultrasonic flow meters, pipe and cable detector equipment, test benches
for domestic water meters, water quality sampling and testing equipment; ground water level
monitoring well points and suction hoses, and back-flow restrictors for domestic water meters
were procured for the three water utilities and SES offices. Satisfactory

Major Equipment. Misprocurement was declared by the World Bank on contracts for
procurement of cranes and excavators after MoFRIT refused to register them due to a
disagreement over the competitively negotiated prices. The contracts and the respective portion
of the loan ($1.7 million) were cancelled. Unsatisfactory

Minor Equipment. Based on technical documents prepared by consultants under this component
repair and maintenance equipment, including pumps and ground water level monitoring units
were procured for the three water utilities. Satisfactory

Component 2 ­ Sanitation, health and hygiene. The following outputs were produced under this
component:

Installation of Handpumps for drought relief in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm
Contracts HPUMPS G1 through G4 and Nedeco G(1) procured a total of 3,326 medium lift (up
to 7 Meters) hand pumps. These were installed on wells surveyed and developed by the
Uzbekistan Hydrogeological Survey. This output is rated moderately satisfactory due to low
quality of pumps and installation compromising sustainability and protection of water quality.

Rural Sanitation ­ Under this subcomponent executed by international consultants experimental
zones were selected in project regions and in these areas a pilot sanitation program was to be
introduced. Very limited demonstration of low-cost sanitation technologies was carried out
before the consultant contract was cancelled. Unsatisfactory

Health promotion and hygiene education ­ Institutional Strengthening of Regional Health
Centers; Training of Community Health Workers; Health Education Activities; Study of
Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Related to Water, Sanitation, and Health; establishment of
an Inter-sectoral Committee for Water, Sanitation, and Health.
Under this component the following activities were completed:
     In each project region one health worker was selected to for specialized training in
        hygiene and sanitation promotion;
     Training and educational materials were provided for specialists in regional health
        departments for use in mass media campaigns and in schools. Competitions were

       conducted among schools on school cleanliness and students' knowledge about hygiene.
       Winning schools were rewarded by local government authorities;
    Jointly with local authorities radio and television programs were prepared and broadcast
       promoting health and hygiene.
Greatly expanded health promotion and hygiene education activities along with health impact
monitoring were envisioned in the original project design and included in the international
consultant contract for rural sanitation. These activities were suspended and then ultimately
cancelled. Moderately unsatisfactory

Water Quality monitoring and strengthening of the Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations
­ Improving Water Quality Monitoring and Sanitation and Hygiene Surveillance; Upgrade SES
laboratories, and; Improving Health Data Collection, Analysis and Reporting
Under this component the following activities were conducted jointly with international
consultants:
-  Technical specifications were developed for equipment required for improved biological and
   chemical water quality analysis by SES;
-  Dedicated procedures for water quality analysis and monitoring were developed for water
   utility laboratories.
Satisfactory

Component 3 ­ Technical Assistance.         The following outputs were produced under this
component:

Institutional strengthening of water utilities and bulk water providers ­ Under this
component international consultants completed the following activities:
    Plus Soft Company completed training of water supplying organizations accounting staff
       in bookkeeping using a common database and also practical work with 1C accounting
       software. training included fixed assets accounting, materials accounting, salary
       accounting, cash assets accounting, accounting of receivables and bills payable, and
       Reporting. In addition, a computerized system of billing and receipt of payments was
       installed and training completed for the personnel at each water company.
    Through on-the-job training, recommendations for strengthening water quality
       monitoring were developed with staff from the water utilities and the regional SES
       offices. Areas covered included: (a) Internal and external control of the accuracy of the
       analytical results of drinking water samples, (b) monitoring of suspended solids in raw
       water, (c) Activity and doses of reagents used in chlorination and (d) Activity and doses
       of reagents used for coagulation. The Recommendations include procedures for quality
       control of laboratory work, error calculation and comparisons with standards. On-the job
       training was completed for laboratory specialists in internal control methods, completion
       of monitoring journals, error detection and correction when analyzing drinking water and
       sewage samples.
    MapInfo GIS software was installed at each water utility and their staff was trained in the
       use of the program.
    New departments on water demand and loss reduction management were established in
       water utilities. In addition, consultants prepared draft legal documents (draft contracts




                                                6

        between water consumers and water supplying organizations) and questionnaires to be
        used assessing consumer satisfaction.
     An assessment of additional equipment needs was carried out and equipment procured for
        the water utilities and SES offices, including computers and office equipment, materials
        for operation and maintenance, and sets of tools and portable laboratories for water
        chemical analysis.
Satisfactory

Tariff study ­ AHT Consultants completed a comprehensive review of current and needed
tariffs for the three water utilities in the project area. The report provides an action plan for
developing tariff structures for the utilities to achieve financial sustainability. The study was
submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and implementation. Water utilities in the
project area have raised tariff substantially, but not to the point where they are financially
sustainable without republican budget subsidies.
Moderately satisfactory

Component 4 ­ Project management, design, and supervision.

Binnie&Partners Overseas (UK) and later NEDECO/DHV Consultants (Netherlands) were
employed to carry out technical supervision of construction contracts. The firms submitted
monthly and quarterly reports on each supervised construction contract indicating completed
work volume. In addition, in the beginning of the project implementation both firms provided
management support for the PIU until a technical assistance agreement was established with
UNDP to support the Ministry of Economy in project implementation, financial administration,
and maintaining the PIU. In 2002 consultant contracts were cancelled and the entire PIU
government staff were subject to a corruption investigation, along with MoE staff who were
directly involved with the project. Several PIU and MoE staff were imprisoned and the PIU was
suspended for two years. In 2003 the Bank declared misprocurement of equipment under two
contracts and cancelled $1,673,200 of the loan. In 2004 the PIU was re-established with new
staff and functioned effectively through the remaining years of the project. The outcome of this
activity was unsatisfactory, but mitigated by progressively improved project management after
2004.

Refinancing of the KFAED-financed pilot water supply engineering project: The project
funded the construction of a self-managed water supply scheme in peri-urban area of Nukus
(Kizketken) and the preparation of detail designs and bid documents by foreign consultants. On
project effectiveness the Bank withdrew from the loan account all amounts required for
repayment of the principal amount of the pilot project loan withdrawn and outstanding and all
interest and other charges due thereon. Thereupon the pilot project loan was canceled. The pilot
project involved the connection of Kyzketken settlement to the Tuyamuyun-Nukus bulk water
supply along with the construction of water distribution centers, construction of two water tanks
with capacities of 1500m3, pump station and chlorination building as well as construction of 6.9
Km of water distribution pipe, eight km of additional pipe network, house connections, and
installation of 500 domestic water meters. In addition 380 settlement house estates (more than
2400 persons) are provided with the centralized water supply. Water supply for approximately
30,000 persons was improved. Per capita domestic water consumption increased from 40 up to

                            Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


Financial Analysis

Re-creating the financial analysis of the Staff Appraisal Report was not attempted for a number
of reasons:

 The consolidation of the six original water agencies into three utilities. In Khorezm Oblast,
    the bulk water supplier and the rural and urban water utilities merged into one.             In
    Karakalpakstan, two utilities remain; the bulk water supplier and urban utility merged into
    one company, while the rural water utility remained a separate utility;
 The period between 1997 and 2007 was characterized by very high levels of inflation. The
    GDP deflator index in this period increased by about 30 percent per year (compared to the 4
    percent assumed in the Staff Appraisal Document) which obviously has resulted in many
    changes in relative prices that have affected the performance of the utilities significantly
    through much lower levels of production and consumption (partly due to changes in available
    supply), and through much higher costs of imported goods and services. ;
 The diversion of water from the Aral Sea has continued unabated during the implementation
    of the project and has put increased pressure on the utilities in Khorezm Oblast and even
    more so in Karakalpakstan in delivering water services to the population. Although more
    households gained access to water supply services, the consumption per capita has decreased
    significantly especially in Karakalpakstan
 The quality of the financial data is an issue.         The quality of data was an issue during
    appraisal, and it is difficult to reconcile the data in different parts of the Staff Appraisal
    Document. Although data availability has improved since then, by 2007 only two of the
    three utilities produced (qualified) audit reports.

The Staff Appraisal Report already flagged the difficulties to achieve sufficient financial returns
from water supply and sanitation investments. The financial analysis at appraisal assumed that
the large subsidies that the Government was providing to the bulk water suppliers and to a much
lesser extent to the water utilities would continue over time. During appraisal it was estimated
that government subsidies would amount to UzS 2.2 billion (or in 1996 equivalent to US$ 60
million) a year by 2006. Most of the emphasis in the financial analysis focused on reducing
water waste by consumers, reduction of NRW and timely collection of bills, while controlling
and reducing operating expenses, but without expecting that all of these utilities would become
financially self-sufficient.

Against the four criteria aimed to improve cost efficiency, the three merged water agencies
actually made significant progress during the period of implementation. Notwithstanding a
challenging macro-economic environment, the utilities were able to improve their efficiency
despite a sharp reduction in the volumes of water produced and sold and a reduction in
government subsidies:




                                                  9

 All three utilities were able to reduce their NRW losses as both production and consumption
 of water has declined rapidly. This is largely the result of lack of available water supply for
 water production as water losses decreased from 38 million cubic meters per year in 1997 to
 about 23 million cubic meters in 2007. Rationalization of water demand due to tariff
 increases and an increase in the efficiency with which water and wastewater services are
 provided also is likely to have had a major impact on the reduction of the losses;
 Operating costs per cubic meter of water in US dollar terms have increased according to the
 projections made in the Staff Appraisal Report. Yet, even though O&M costs per cubic
 meter increased, the actual cost per house connection fell significantly as most households
 use much less water than was forecast at appraisal.
 Despite the fast pace of inflation, and the subsequent changes in real average tariffs, accounts
 receivable declined in Tuyamuyun Nukus, but increased in Tuyamuyun Urgench as
 customers adjusted to the tariff increases. Interestingly, real tariff increases were highest in
 Tuyamuyun Nukus, and lowest in Tuyamuyun Urgench;
 The number of water connections increased, but the increase in water connections went in
 tandem with a sharp decline in the per capita water consumption. This is a positive outcome
 from the project as the rationalization of water demand is urgently needed in an area where
 water is becoming increasingly scarce. The official norms of water consumption of 280 lcd
 for a house connection mentioned in the Staff Appraisal Document were essentially
 unsustainable in an environment where water is increasingly becoming a scarce resource, as
 is the case in Western Uzbekistan;
 The number of sewerage connections in Karakalpakstan have increased; the data on sewerage
 in Khorezm are hard to interpret due to the lack of data at Project Appraisal;
 The operating cost coverage ratio that describes the capacity of utilities to cover their
 operation and maintenance costs with their operating revenues is showing that the short-term
 financial sustainability of the utilities remains an issue, as it was at the time of appraisal.
 Unlike during appraisal, government subsidies today are much lower than forecasted and
 hence some progress has been made in making the utilities more self-sufficient. During
 project appraisal it was assumed that the Government would provide for the different
companies a total subsidy of about UzS 1.5 billion a year by 2003 compared to less than
UzS 0.6 billion (equivalent to US$ 0.4 million) per year actually achieved for the three
utilities (with most of the subsidies allocated to the rural water agency in Karakalpakstan).

Despite the many improvements made in terms of a decline in per capita water consumption,
increase in water rates, reduction in inefficiencies, the financial performance of the utilities is
still unsustainable in the medium- to long-term. The trend of losses is actually underestimated
due to the sharp decline in the utilities' non-residential customer base (the very high cross-
subsidies in the tariff system have resulted in a very sharp decline in non-residential/commercial
water use), the low levels of depreciation reserves, and the fact that debt service payments on the
World Bank loan will soon be due.

Economic Analysis

1.      Beneficiaries of the Project.

The project was expected to provide safe and reliable water supply services to 1.5 million
beneficiaries, comprising about 1.2 million people in rural areas and 0.3 million people in urban
areas. It was also expected that 50,000 inhabitants in rural and peri-urban areas would benefit
from improved sanitation facilities. Table 3.5 provides a breakdown of the beneficiaries by
region that benefited from the project. In total, about 1.2 million people were served by
rehabilitated or new, extended water supply services, representing 80% of the target figure for
water supply coverage.

2.    Economic Analysis during Project Appraisal

Replicating the economic analysis as laid out in the Staff Appraisal Report is fraught with
difficulties because the reduction of the inflow from the Amu Darya has continued to affect the
available supply of water in the region. This sharp decline in available water has had a direct
impact on the benefits that the project was assumed to deliver. At the same time, the GDP
deflator (as a proxy for inflation in the absence of inflation data) increased from 30 in 1995 to


                                                           12

1671 in 2007 which is a 56 fold-increase in price levels over an 11 year period. These high
inflation rates have had a major effect on relative prices in the project area.

The economic analysis assumed a set of benefits including (i) consumer surplus on increased
quantity of water used; (ii) costs of not having to boil water; and for those not yet connected
added to these first two benefits are the (iii) costs of not having to buy water from vendors; and
(iv) cost savings from not having to spend time fetching water. The economic analysis was based
on the premise that existing consumers would benefit as rationing would decline, new customers
would benefit from much higher water consumption levels than water vendors would be able to
provide. Actual trends have been quite different.

Supply of water, however, declined during project implementation. There is increasingly less
water available for water production since the start of the project; the flows of the Amu Darya
and Syr Darya rivers are still decreasing because of heavy withdrawals upstream and
subsequently the Aral Sea has shrunk further. As a result, water production dropped by about 55
percent between 1995 and 2007 in the two main water utilities for the two regions. In addition,
tariff increases resulted in a further decline in per capita residential consumption.                          Non-
residential water consumption almost disappeared due to severe reductions in water production
and the very high levels of cross subsidies that provided a serious disincentive for non-residential
users to consume water supplied by the three utilities. Yet, as a result the high levels of water
consumption foreseen in the Staff Appraisal Report did not materialize as can be seen in because
of the above described demand and supply trends as can be seen in Table 3.4

It should be noted that this decline in water consumption is actually a positive impact of the
project albeit completely unintended. The economic analysis carried out during project appraisal
adhered to water use standards that were very high (more than 200 lcd for house connections)
which are not necessarily very efficient. A lower level of water consumption is still sufficient to
ensure public health is not jeopardized. Infant mortality rates have dropped. Data provided by
the Sanitary and Epidemiological Services (SES) in infant mortality in Karakalpakstan declined
from 30.8 per 1,000 births in 1995 to 13.9 in 2007, while in Khorezm Oblast it decreased from
25.8 in 1995 to 13.4 in 20079. The project did not systematically assess more direct indicators of
health impacts, such as the incidence of water and sanitation-related diseases in project and non-



9These data are significantly lower than the data that were recently published in a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey
held in 2006 by UNICEF which estimated infant mortality at 65 per 1,000 births in western Uzbekistan (covering
Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast) ­ which constitute a decline since 2000 (no earlier surveys are available).

project communities, but government health statistics suggest that the incidence of these illnesses
generally declined during the project's life. Table 3.5 summarizes water and sanitation-related
disease incidence in Karakalpakstan over the five year period 2000 ­ 2004.

With regard to boiling water, some interesting patterns have occurred. The Staff Appraisal
Report, mentions that 70 to 80 percent of households boiled their water as a means to cope with
poor water quality in the mid-1990s. In 2007, the beneficiary survey shows that 54 percent of all
respondents boiled their water. However, there is little difference in water treatment practices by
people living in the project area and those that do not. This is because water quality is still an
issue for households in the project areas as discussed in Annex 5, even though the number of
water samples meeting bacteriological and chemical standards increased steadily during project
implementation.

Calculating the additional benefits of not using water vendors is not possible. A follow-up
survey undertaken in 2007 found that very few households depended on vendors. Essentially,
households did not refer to vendors when asked about their source of water. Use of neighbors'
water supplies is however still important.

Two more issues complicate the replication of the economic analysis. The first is the data
quality. Even basic data like exchange rates are not available in the Bank's databases (possibly
due to the use of multiple exchange rates during at least part of the implementation period, and as
such we relied on a UNDP database). In view of these exchange rate issues, an economic
conversion factor should be calculated; yet the lack of available data precludes the estimation of
such a conversion factor. The second issue is the fact that the economic analysis by sub-project is
an issue when many of the benefits of the project in the changing environment were related to
utility performance which can not be captured in a sub-project analysis. It is in view of the
relatively low willingness to pay for water unlikely that all these sub-projects will generate
benefits, without including the benefits of utility performance. Yet, such an analysis will require
a system-by-system approach of the total utility network to assign costs, for which the
information is lacking.

Because of the inherent problems in replicating the economic analysis under these circumstances,
it is suggested that the economic analysis as calculated during project appraisal will not be
replicated. Yet, there are clear benefits that the project has produced in terms of improvements in
efficiency, and increased access.

The increase in access is remarkable, especially in view of the decline in the production of water.
Water access has increased significantly, especially in Karakalpakstan. The total number of
people gaining access to new or rehabilitated water sources increased by 1.2 million, of which
825,000 are served through the three water agencies, and 457,000 through hand or electric
pumps. As the Bank project provided new access to 338,000 previously unserved people, the
project has made a significant contribution in rural water supply provision.

With regard to the three water agencies, investment was geared to rehabilitation.                          These
rehabilitation investments are likely to have had a positive impact on the efficiency with which
services can be supplied, and hence may have created opportunities to increase access. This is
especially true as the per capita consumption has declined significantly due to changes in the real
prices for water, and water scarcity affecting the water production.

3.     Methodology and Assumptions

An economic analysis is difficult to prepare in the absence of information on shadow prices, so
we will calculate an incremental financial analysis. In this analysis, we will determine the basic
incremental financial benefits (in 2007 prices) and compare them with the financial costs of the
projects.

Benefits of rehabilitation. These benefits are calculated as the number of customers benefiting
from rehabilitation in the project area who have revealed the incremental revenues of water as
measured by the difference in monthly household payment adjusted for non-payment. Piped
water has an incremental monthly benefit per household of UzS 1,247 in Karakalpakstan and
only UzS7 in Khorezm Oblast. For handpumps, the incremental benefit is based on a relatively
small number of observations, and we needed to combine data from the two regions with an
incremental benefit of UzS 113.

Benefits of new customers due to direct project interventions. These benefits are calculated as
the number of customers directly benefiting from the project as summarized in Table A3.1. The



10The data in the Staff Appraisal Document and the supporting materials is not always consistent. We used the data
from the SAR assuming that the definition of safe water sources includes piped water and groundwater with hand or
electric pumps.




                                                        16

actual willingness to pay for water from these new customers is assumed to be the monthly
payment for water per household adjusted for non-payment in the target areas where the project
intervened. The monthly household benefits for piped water are respectively UzS 3,391 in
Karakalpakstan and UzS 2,775 in Khorezm Oblast. For handpump water, the monthly household
benefits are significantly lower. Yet, because of the small number of observations of paying
customers, the benefits for this type of service are rather low at UzS567 in Karakalpakstan and
only UzS 73 in areas where the project was implemented.

Benefits of other new customers. Due to demand management policies, and real tariff increases,
the average consumption per household declined and even in an environment where production
decreased significantly, more people were served with water supply in 2007 than in 1997 as is
shown in Table A3.3. These additional customers were either provided with piped water or
handpumps, and have been included here as a benefit to this project. The same assumptions
apply for these new customers as for those directly benefiting from project interventions.

Subsidy savings. One of the largest benefits that the project has achieved is the reduction of
subsidies. This obviously has reduced the burden for government to the water sector. As
mentioned in 1997, the subsidies provided to the sector in 2007 prices was UzS 2.3 billion,
compared to UzS 578 million in 2007. We have assumed that these subsidies will not be
restored to their original levels, although some subsidies will continue to be provided especially
to the rural water agency in Karakalpakstan. Yet, the trends in the past few years show that at
times some subsidies are provided to the sector. For instance, in 2007 Tuyamuyun Nukus
received a UzS 200 million whereas it had no received any subsidies in the two years before
2007.

Investment costs. The investment costs include both the investments the World Bank made and
those that were provided through the Kuwait Fund, which were an integral part in the project.
The Kuwait Fund funded about $19 million, and was responsible for the rehabilitation of piped
water systems in rural and urban centers in both Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast, while they
also funded the improvements to the treatment plant in Nukus. It is assumed that the handpumps
have a lifetime of 10 years after which they have to replaced.           No further replacement
investments are included in the investment costs.

Operation and Maintenance Costs. The operation and maintenance costs are calculated as 5
percent of the infrastructure investments (these investments do not include technical assistance
components).

4.   Results

The incremental financial analysis results in an financial rate of return of 10 percent, and a net
present value of UzS 411 million. This is a respectable rate of return for a water supply and
sanitation project, and is just at the threshold of 10 percent as set for the discount rate. The
financial benefits are relatively small due to the low tariffs for water supply ­ despite that they
have increased significantly over time during project implementation; most of the benefits are
generated by the savings in subsidies. The high number of survey respondents who are not
charged or do not pay for water is an issue that needs to be addressed in the future. Yet, much
progress has been made compared to 1997 with customers paying significantly more for water in
real terms.     This process has come furthest in Karakalpakstan which is the region most
downstream from the Amu Darya river and hence the most affected by the water shortages in the
region. Not by coincidence, most of the project benefits were generated in Karakalpakstan
which was responsible for 75 percent of the financial benefits generated by the project, even
though this region received about 60 percent of the investments.

                              Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A survey was held in October 2008 to determine what the benefits were from the investments
that the project made in water supply and sanitation. As it is difficult to produce a before and
after analysis, the survey focused on comparing what has happened in the project areas compared
to control areas where the project did not intervene. A survey was conducted in the two project
regions ­ Khorezm oblast and Karakalpakstan. In each region there were selected target and
control rayons, and in each of these rayons households for interviewing were selected through a
sequential random sampling procedure.

During those years, water supply improvements projects financed by the World Bank were being
implemented in the target rayons. The total number of interviews conducted in each region is
shown in Table 5.1 below:

                        Table 5. 1     Number of interviews, by regions

Interviews were conducted in households with the use of a questionnaire specifically designed
for this survey.

A.      Main Sources of Water Supply

Khorezm Oblast. The main source of water for drinking and cooking in Khorezm oblast is hand
pumps within the household (less frequently ­ outside the household). This source is equally
important both for the target and control rayons. However, in the target rayons, the second most
importance source is piped water in the house or within the household (in the yard), while in the
control rayons this source can rarely be found (see Table 5.2 below). It should be noted that in
the target rayons water pipeline is a more important source of drinking water than in the control
rayons. In the target rayons water pipeline (in this or that form) was mentioned as a source of
drinking water by 36 percent households, while in the control rayons ­ by only 15 percent.

The situation with the use of wells as sources of drinking water is somewhat different: 15 percent
of the households in the target rayons and 21% of the households in the control rayons
mentioned a well as a source of drinking water. Most households use manual or electric pumps,
the percent of households that are using them in the target rayons was 54 percent, and in the
control rayons ­ 74 percent.

Karakalpakstan. The main source of water in Karakalpakstan for drinking and cooking purposes
is piped water, any form (within own household, or in a neighbouring household, or in the street).
Piped water is a more important source for the target rayons (58 percent of households) than in
the control rayons (49 percent). Manual or electric pumps are the next in importance source. It
should be noted that this source of potable water is not so important for the residents of the target
rayons as they are for the residents of the control rayons. And, at last, a small percent of the
households are using other sources of potable water (river, pond, lakes or other water sources).

    B.     Quality of Service of Water Supply

Quality of Water Supply. In view of the investments focusing on increasing drinking water
quality, one does not see major differences in how households perceive their water quality.

  Even though households do not perceive their water quality as improved, data measuring water
  quality show an improvement. According to the SES, 99 percent of the water quality samples
  meet bacteriological quality standards.     Monitoring data also show that chemical quality
  standards have improved.

  Water pressure. Table 5.4 shows that water pressure is better in target rayons than in control
  rayons ­ because fewer households in target rayons need to rely on electric pumps to get water
  supplied to their dwelling. In both Khorezm Oblast and Karakalpakstan, about 11 percent of
  households have to rely on electric pumps in target rayons compared to about 20 percent of
  households in control rayons.

  Regularity of Supply. This is a hard to interpret variable. In the control rayons, households
  have less access to water supply systems. In the target areas, 58 percent of the households do not
  have access to a water supply system compared to 66 percent in control rayons. Yet, when
  households have access, households in control areas tend to have more hours of supply. It has to
  be noted, however, that there is a wide variance in how households in control areas have access;
  they tend to have either no access or relatively good access. Household in project areas tend to
  have mediocre access ­ with most households having access no more than 10 hours a day.

  Satisfaction with Services. Even though, most households do not perceive the quality of their
  water supply improved, satisfaction in the project areas seems relatively high. As a proxy for
  satisfaction the survey team asked households whether they thought their water supply needed
  improvements. As can be seen in Table 5.5, most households in the target rayons thought no
  improvements were needed compared to households in control rayons.             Satisfaction among
  households in target rayons was significantly higher than in control rayons.

C.     Payments for Water Supply

One possible other indicator for satisfaction is how much households pay for water. As can be
seen in Table 5.7, the median monthly household payments for water are higher in control rayons
than in target rayons. Getting access to improved or rehabilitated services results in cost savings
for households.

However, the actual story is a bit more complicated because many customers do not pay for their
services. This low billing efficiency is a major issue, and jeopardizes the continuity of the service.
Yet, when looking at the numbers, households are much more likely to pay for water than
households in the control group. About 54 percent of households in target areas state that they
do not pay for water, compared to 79 percent in the control group. This non-payment behavior is
much more prevalent in Khorezm Oblast than in Karakalpakstan. In the latter region, 43 percent
of households pay for water compared to only 23 percent in Khorezm Oblast.
Because access to point sources (such as well, and handpumps) make it more likely that
households do not pay monthly charges, we also looked at the "billing efficiency" by utilities. In
general, 97 percent of households with piped water through house or yard connections in project
areas paid their water bill compared to 77 percent in control areas. Yet, piped water services that
include the use of standpipes or piped water from neighbors are more likely not to pay for their
water. In project areas, 79 percent of households with access to piped water provided through
standpipes or neighbors paid their bills compared to 69 percent in control areas. Adjusting
payments for the level of non-payment, households in target areas tend to pay more for water
than those in control areas. This higher willingness to pay for water can be significantly
dependent on the different source and service level provided. On average for piped water supply,
households (including non-payers) value the benefits of their supply at a little under UzS3,000
compared to UzS 2,300. Yet, as the overall charges for water are low at a little over US$ per
household per month, the overall additional benefit in project areas is small.

When the monthly household payments are adjusted for the high levels of non-payment, the
actual monthly household payment changes significantly as can be seen in Figure A5.1. As this
monthly payment adjusted for non-payment can be seen as "willingness to pay" for water, it is
clear that the interventions by the project were positive for those living in project areas as they
are willing to pay more for their monthly water bill than those that did not benefit from the
project. Yet, it also shows that the level of willingness to pay for water is still very low ­ even in
project areas.    In project areas in Karakalpakstan, where willingness to pay is highest,
households only spend UzS 2,000 per month for water. Willingness to pay for piped water is
higher in both regions at about UzS 3,000 but that is still very limited as it translates over $2 per
month.

D.     Sanitation and Hygiene
Almost all households surveyed have access to basic sanitation. Less than 1 percent of the
surveyed households mentioned that they did not have access to a toilet. Most households have

their toilet outside of the house. Although access to basic sanitation is more or less universal,
access to wastewater collection is much less common. Only a very small percentage of
households are connected to a piped sewerage system. The majority depends on cesspits or
septic tanks for wastewater collection, and discharge to streets is still a very common
phenomenon.

E.      Living Standards and Income

As can be seen in Figure 5.1, households in the project areas tended to be poorer than the
household living in the target areas in both Khorezm Oblast and Karakalpakstan. This suggests
that the project has been relatively well targeted to the poor.

The manager of regional PIU reported that the Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Health
Project performed a great scope of work to improve safe drinking water supply in the Khorezm
region, as well as sanitary status and human health, during 1998-2008. The Project achieved its
objectives. The Project objectives were to improve water supply for 563,000 people, while its
outcome had outdone objectives set as it covered more than 650,000 people. Over this period,
there were implemented several civil work contracts and plenty of equipment for operation and
maintenance of water supply infrastructure was procured, in Khorezm region. The material-and-
technical basis and institutional capacity of region's water supply organizations improved. All
services of these organizations were computerized and relevant software procured. Modern
equipment for water quality monitoring was provided to the laboratories of Tuyamuyun-Urgench
water company and Khorezm regional State Center of Sanitary Surveillance (SCSS). A great
scope of work was performed relating to rural sanitation, health promotion and public health
education.

Mr. Sapaev D., the representative from Khorezm region's SCSS said that quality of water supply
from the water treatment plant was in line with GOST standards and under continued monitoring
by SCSS.

Mr. Nuriev D., the chairman of mahalla #20, noticed that the water supply of population and the
quality of water had improved significantly. Population was satisfied with current levels of water
supply services and timely paid for services provided. Also he thanked all parties involved in the
implementation of civil works for their efforts towards commissioning the water treatment plant
in Urgench.

Mr. Kh. Karimi, the acting manager of Shimbar company, thanked the World Bank mission,
client (PIU under the MoE) and operating company (Tuyamuyun-Urgench water company) for
their continuous support to implementing contract #35 and their fruitful cooperation. At the same
time, he addressed the WB mission a number of questions, particularly, whether the general
contractor would recover a full cost of chemicals delivered to the WTP as specified in BoQ if the
latter did not specify amounts of aluminum sulfate and chlorine to be delivered. This question
was responded by Mr. Fasliddin Rakhimov, a WB procurement specialist, who said that the
general contractor would recover full costs in case that it provided the water treatment plant with
adequate amount of chemicals required for normal operations of the WTP during the warranty
period.

Mr. Tskhai L., the chief engineer of Tuyamuyun-Urgench water company, reported a successful
implementation of the Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project in Khorezm region.

Invited persons:             Engineering personnel of Tuyamuyun-Nukus Water Company; of
                             Karakalpakselkhozvodoprovod Company; a representative of the
                             mahalla committee, Kyzketken village

After the introduction of World Bank mission staff, Mr. Mamadvaliev T., in his opening
statement, briefed the participants on activities that had been carried out under Project 5.1
"Uzbekistan: Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Health".

Following exchange of views, Mr. Yusupov I. reported that the acutest water supply deficit of
safe drinking water was a manifestation of the Aral Sea ecologic crisis, especially in areas
neighboring the Aral Sea. The inadequate and deteriorated water distribution networks resulted
in reduced drinking water supply experienced even by the district centers. The area's ground
water deposits are deep and have a high mineralization level, which requires drilling deep
boreholes and installation of desalination plants. The mineralization levels of subsoil water
sources reach 35-100 g/l in deep aquiferous layers.

For further implementation of the Aral Region's Quality Drinking Water Supply Program the
Cabinet of Minister of the Republic of Uzbekistan issued a number of decrees, including "On
measures for implementation of a demonstration water supply project in Kyzketken village" #
421, dated August 29, 1997 in Nukus, and "On measures for implementation of the full scale
Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project" # 444 dated October 15, 1998.

Over the period of project implementation there were disbursed borrowed funds worth of
US$ 51.30 million, including US$ 36.29 million of the IBRD loan and US$ 15.01 million
provided by the Kuwait Fund. Water treatment facilities with a total capacity of 65,000 m3 per
day, 46.06 km of water mains, 152.37 km of water distribution networks, 4 water reservoirs, 6



                                               32

tank houses, 86 boreholes, 10 desalination plants, 10 water intake facilities, 9 chlorination rooms,
and 8 pumping stations had been constructed. Existing water supply infrastructure, 4 ground
water intake facilities, 28 water distribution facilities, 9 desalination plants, 21 chlorination
rooms had been rehabilitated, 9 desalination plants were installed for replacement of existing
ones, 3,600 hand pumps installed and 3,038 new household connections made. All this enabled
improved drinking water supply for 600,000 population in Karakalpakstan, of which 200,000
received new access to water sources. The successfully completed contracts enabled required
water head for apartment buildings and more consistent operations of water supply systems in
the settlements.

The water supply companies' institutional strengthening component procured supplies and
equipment worth of US$ 6.988 million.

Improved quality of drinking water and decline in water borne diseases incidence was reported
by Mrs. Mustafina A., head of the State Sanitary Surveillance Center, as a result of the project
implementation. Improved sanitary and technical conditions of water infrastructure and provision
with disparately needed equipment of agencies' laboratory services have yielded good results. In
2000, 76.2 percent of laboratory-tested water samples failed as they did not meet the standard
(UzDST 950-2000) due to substandard chemical contents, with 73.7 percent of failures in rural
area, compared to 30.6 and 30.7 percent respectively, in 2007. The number of samples failed due
to high chemical contents was half the number reported in 2000. An incidence of acute intestinal
diseases has declined in Ellikqala, Amudarya, Khojeili, Kandykol, Muinak, Kegeili, Chimbay,
and Takhtakupyr districts, as compared to 2000. An incidence of viral hepatitis "A" has reduced
in Amudarya and Kanlykul districts. And incidence of urolithiasis decreased by 612 cases as
compared to 2000.

In his speech, Mr. Aytjanov, the chairman of mahalla committee (Kyzketken village), criticized
insufficient water supply in the village. He called the water supply pipelines built under
implemented contract #10 (a demonstration project, where contractor was the Arab Contractors
company, Egypt) the "Arab pipeline" and acknowledged good quality of construction works and
requested for increased water supply in Kyzketken village.

In this regard, Mr. Dosnazarov A., the Chief Engineer of Tuyamuyun-Nukus Water Company,
explained that Kyzketken village had received reduced water supply (several hours a day) as
attributed to a low water level in the Amudarya River, this year. Generally, the Rural Water
Supply, Sanitation and Health Project increased water intake capacity. Commissioning works
under contracts #40 and #30 created opportunities to partially meet drinking water demand in
Nukus and district centers (Khalkabad, Kegeili, Chimbay, Karauzyak, Takhtakupyr, Khojeili,
and Takhiatsh) in case of emergency shutdown of Tuyamuyun-Nukus water main. With contract
#70D commissioned, Turtkul, Beruniy, Chimbay, and Kegeili districts have received improved
water supply.

Mr. Matmuratov D., deputy manager of Karakalpakselkhozvodoprovod, reported that Program
5.1 rehabilitated 28 water distribution facilities, replaced 19 desalination plants, 21chlorination
rooms, and laid 116 km of distribution network, and procured equipment and supplies worth of

US$ 3.929 million to strengthen material and technical basis. The project improved water supply
of 145,500 rural citizens, and granted new access to 30,000 people.

An issue of benefits due to installation of water meters in apartment buildings and private houses
was discussed with participants during the workshop.

each city was selected. In the selected experimental zones manhole were made used for
conducting measurement activities. After conducting measurements on water consumption it was
noted that loss had two main reasons: loss in the water distribution networks and loss in
apartment premises (1 l/day for apartment). Then in experimental zones in one of block of flats
water meters were installed, which gave complete elimination of loss in apartments and hence
the total loss amount was decreased twice.
Water supplying organizations' personnel were trained in using leakage detection equipments
and trained with knowledge of demand management and loss reduction. In addition repair and
maintenance vehicles were procured. Also several methods of education on under this
component were selected and successfully published (television advertisements and school
programs).

   II.     Comments of the Borrower on the Implementation Completion Report:

The Borrower has stated that the experience gained from the project indicates it is inappropriate
to appoint as the implementing agency the organization that is the beneficiary of a project
investment and will therefore ultimately accept the completed infrastructure.

In addition, the Borrower reviewed an earlier draft of the Implementation Completion Report and
provided detailed and helpful editorial comments on the text to the Bank in March, 2009. These
editorial comments have been incorporated in the final text in the Report.
