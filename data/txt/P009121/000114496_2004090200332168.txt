We refer to the Loan Agreement (Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project) between 
the Republic of Uzbekistan (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and

procured under International Competitive Bidding Procedures. 
 
We hereby confirm the Bank’s agreement to the amendment set forth below. 
 
Part B. 2 (a) of Section I of Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement is revised to read as 
follows: 
 
“(a)  
Preference for domestically manufactured goods and domestic contractors
The provisions of paragraphs 2.54 and 2.55 of the Guidelines and Appendix 2 
thereto shall apply to goods manufactured in the territory of the Borrower and works to 
be carried out by domestic contractors.”
