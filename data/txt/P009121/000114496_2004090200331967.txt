Dear Mr. Nurmuratov: 
 
Re:  Uzbekistan:  Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project

Amendment to the Loan Agreement
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project) between 
the Republic of Uzbekistan (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank), dated August 29, 1997, as amended.  We also refer to the letter from 
the Deputy Minister of Economy and National Project Coordinator, dated February 11, 2004, 
requesting an amendment to the Loan Agreement to allow for the application of a margin of 
preference to eligible domestic contractors during evaluation of civil works contracts being 
procured under International Competitive Bidding Procedures. 
 
We hereby confirm the Bank’s agreement to the amendment set forth below. 
 
Part B. 2 (a) of Section I of Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement is revised to read as 
follows: 
 
“(a)  
Preference for domestically manufactured goods and domestic contractors
The provisions of paragraphs 2.54 and 2.55 of the Guidelines and Appendix 2 
thereto shall apply to goods manufactured in the territory of the Borrower and works to 
be carried out by domestic contractors.”
