     IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the
borrower for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers'
comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an
assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
      IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, and Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to
which the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s
objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance.
Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension
generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome:
High, Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of
supervision. Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of two projects in the urban
and rural water and sanitation sectors of Uzbekistan supported by the World Bank and
other development partners.

The Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project was approved in August 1997 for a
total cost of US$ 117.00 million, and was supported by an International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Loan of US$ 75.00 million. The project was
restructured on July 12, 2005 at the request of the Borrower and some disbursements
also became ineligible for Bank-financing. In all, US$16.62 million of the Loan was
cancelled. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development provided parallel
financing of US$19.36 million equivalent. Total project cost was US$78.80 million and
the project closed in June 2008, two-and-a-half years later than planned.

The Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply Project was approved in March 2002 for a
total cost of US$62.33 million, and was supported by an IBRD Loan of US$20.00
million and an IDA Credit of US$20.00 million that grew to US$23.64 million due to
appreciation of Special Drawing Rights against the US$. It was supported also by
parallel financing from the Government of Switzerland in the amount US10.00 million
equivalent. At closing, three years later than planned in June 2010, US$0.52 million of
the Loan was cancelled and total project costs was US$ 58.79 million.

The assessment is based on a review of all relevant documentation, interviews of Bank
staff at headquarters and in the country office, and the findings of an Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) mission that visited Uzbekistan in October 2014. Project
performance was discussed with government, state and municipal officials engaged
with the projects, representatives of donors, staff of the Bank resident mission and other
stakeholders. The list of persons met during the mission is attached in Annex B and
their cooperation and assistance in preparing the report is gratefully acknowledged.

Lessons learned from this assessment will be used as inputs into IEG’s forthcoming
review of the World Bank Group’s assistance to the water and sanitation sector.

Copies of the draft PPAR was sent to government officials and implementing agencies
for their review and no comments were received.

Summary
        This report provides an assessment of two water supply projects located in
western and central Uzbekistan. The Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project was
implemented in the western part of the country over the period 1997-2008, including a
two-and-half-year extension, and there have been no follow-on projects. The Bukhara
and Samarkand Water Supply Project was focused on urban water supplies in those two
cities and was implemented over the period 2002-2010 including a three-year
extension.

        Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project objectives were to improve water
supply, sanitation, and health in the Project area through: (a) the provision of safe
drinking water and sanitation facilities; and (b) the strengthening of the financial,
operational, and managerial capacities of water supply and sanitation utilities. It had
five components and the primary focus and bulk of project expenditure was on
rehabilitating water supplies in three major cities and rural areas in western Uzbekistan.
A secondary focus was provision of demand-driven rural sanitation and a program of
hygiene education. These efforts were supported by technical assistance, support for
project management in the utilities and refinancing of the preceding pilot project.

        The relevance of objectives of the Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project
is rated High. Project objectives were straightforward and highly relevant to improving
social and productive infrastructure in rural communities and towns most adversely
affected by the Aral Sea environmental crisis. The objectives’ focus on service
provision, and building capacity to ensure sustainable infrastructure, wisely avoided the
more complex issue of systemic institutional reform of the sector that the government
was still formulating in the mid-1990s. Objectives remain highly relevant to the FY12-
15 Country Partnership Strategy that supports the government’s objective to reduce
regional and rural-urban inequities, including two of four priorities: providing more
accessible quality and sustainable health services, especially in the rural areas; and
continuing to improve the coverage and sustainability of potable water supply and
sanitation services.

        The relevance of design is rated substantial. The design included a results
framework that provided a logical sequence of inputs, activities and outputs required to
mostly achieve the intended outcomes. A Pilot Water Supply Project improved the
design and implementation arrangements for the project through a "learning by doing”
approach and testing cost recovery schemes. The community-driven development
(CDD) model used to design sanitation, health and hygiene component was relevant but
required more capacity building efforts for it to work in Uzbekistan. While design of
this component was based on the Bank’s experience in Nepal, India and Peru, it
overlooked the lack of a community self-help culture and state dominance in decision-
making. Thus there was insufficient attention to building capacity to enable inclusion of
CDD in the local institutions responsible for project implementation and their
coordination with the supply-driven approach of the implementing state organization
responsible for decision-making. Because of these problems, the hygiene and rural
sanitation components were effectively dropped in 2001 when the technical assistance
contract was cancelled by the government. Subsequently in 2005 the government
                                             viii


decided to utilize UNICEF and other grant financing instead of the relatively high-cost
IBRD Loan to finance these activities.

        The project substantially achieved its water supply objective but made little
progress on the sanitation and health objectives. The project provided improved water
supply and security to about 1.04 million people. This is a third less than the target of
1.5 million as a result of the reduction in expenditure due to cancellation of part of the
loan and the poor performance of the rural hand-pump program. About 0.2 million
people gained new access to water supplies and 0.8 million people had their water
supply rehabilitated. Some 80 percent of all beneficiaries were more securely supplied
with water either through pipeline distribution systems or from electrically pumped
wells. Rural access rates in the project area increased over the life of the project from
29 percent to 46 percent and urban access rates remained at about 76 percent. Since the
end of the project in 2008, rural access rates further increased to 55 percent.

        The sub-objective to strengthen financial, operational, and managerial capacities
of water supply and sanitation utilities was achieved. A parallel Asian Development
Bank (ADB) project (2002-2012) in the same region, with similar institutional
development objectives, contributed to the assessed outcomes. Although restructuring
of the six separate water utilities took place five years later than scheduled, it was fully
implemented by March 2005 at which time the six original water utilities were
reorganized into three with significant economies-of-scale. Unaccounted-for-water was
significantly reduced and this, with greatly increased water tariffs and improved billing
and bill collection systems, enabled the water utilities to increase their incomes.

       As a result of reforms and capacity-building, the urban water utilities are able
now to just balance operating income and operating expenses without subsidies. The
income-cost balance is much less sanguine for the rural water utility whose operating
income only covers 61 percent of its operating costs even with subsidies. When
depreciation is taken into account none of the utilities is financially viable in the
medium to long-term without central government support for operations, replacement
and new investment –support that the central government is able and willing to provide.

        On a per-capita cost basis actual costs were US$45 compared with the appraisal
estimate of US$58. The project’s financial rate of return is estimated at13 percent. The
impact of the corruption probes instituted by the government, replacement of the
project implementation unit’s staff in 2002 and enhanced vigilance on procurement
issues almost stopped disbursement for 2.5 years and required an extension of the
project’s closing date. While these implementation delays allowed governance and
procurement to improve and this enabled the disbursement to slowly accelerate from
2005, on balance, the overall efficiency is rated modest.

       The overall outcome of the project is rated moderately satisfactory. Risks to
development outcomes are rated moderate given the government’s strong and
continued support for the sector. Notwithstanding these good outcomes Bank
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory because of failure to enforce a Bank’s
safeguard policy and to restructure the project after cancellation of some of the Loan.
Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

         The Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply Project had three development
objectives: to rehabilitate and improve the efficiency of existing water supply facilities
and infrastructure in Bukhara and Samarkand; strengthen the institutional capacity of
these two cities; and strengthen the utilities’ financial capacity through improved
financial management and commercial practices. The bulk of project spending was on
rehabilitating water supply infrastructure and employment of a private sector Operator
under a service contract, and the project included technical assistance and support for
the government’s project implementation unit. A parallel Swiss Grant provided
additional consultants’ inputs to aid monitoring and also pumping plant and water
meter calibration facilities. Two follow-on projects continue, inter alia, to support
institutional capacity-building in those two cities, and have contributed to assessed
outcomes.

        The relevance of project objectives is rated substantial as they directly
addressed the technical and managerial challenges of reversing the rapidly deteriorating
water and sanitation services in Uzbekistan in the decade since independence. Project
objectives remain relevant to the government’s own strategies for the urban water
supply sector and the Bank’s current Country Assistance Strategy at appraisal and
currently. The project was also aligned with government’s strategic objective to
develop Bukhara and Samarkand into international tourist destinations.

        Project design was substantially relevant and logical but it made unrealistic
assumptions about the availability of baseline data, the institutional setting and local
buy-in to the employment of a foreign private sector Operator to catalyze management
reform. Specifically, design underestimated the importance of a learning partnership
approach in favor of an externally imposed one, and did not include means to change
local perspectives such as twinning and working with sister utilities in Europe or
elsewhere.

        The desired project outcomes were substantially achieved even though the
Operator’s service contract was made ineffective by the utilities’ legal problems
(unrelated to the project) that severely constrained cash flows and emoluments. While
the Operator’s service contract was not renewed in 2007 they had transferred enough
managerial knowledge, skills and computerized financial management and billing
systems to enable the utilities, albeit with some delay, to achieve most of the objectives
by 2010. Water distribution systems were successfully rehabilitated and the number of
connections increased. The targets for reducing unaccounted-for-water were met and
water loss per connection was reduced by 30 percent in Bukhara and 73 percent in
Samarkand. Energy efficiency targets were unrealistic and could not be achieved.

        Institutional and managerial performance was improved. Both water utilities
substantially achieved four of the five measures intended to improve their financial
capacity. There was an aggressive reduction of system inefficiencies (water losses,
energy inefficiency, low revenue collection, and water wastage) to reduce costs of
operations. A commercial strategy aimed at eliminating unregistered connections and
users, and building trust in the community through better water supply and customer
service was successfully rolled-out. A strategic and cost-effective metering policy,
linked with a customer relations plan and greatly increased water tariffs, boosted
                                             x


revenues. Modern financial management, accounting, and commercial systems and
procedures allowed the utilities to make better policy and tariff recommendations to the
Government and implement effective commercial actions. Although actions to collect
better information on the fixed assets were partially implemented, realistic valuation of
assets has yet to occur.

        The evidence indicates substantial improvement in management of operations
and revenue collection. Both Bukhara and Samarkand closed the gap between operating
costs and revenue, but Bukhara remains dependent on government subsidies to remain
financially viable in the short to medium-term. The utilities financial performance
remains heavily influenced by Government directives over which they have no control
but which adversely affect their commercial performance. Government directives
govern depreciation policies, foreign exchange losses, and interest on borrowings.
Thus, financial autonomy remains elusive since they cannot control or influence many
key financial parameters.

       The overall outcome of the project is rated moderately satisfactory. Risks to
development outcomes are rated moderate given government’s strong and continued
support for the sector.

       Bank performance suffered from the problems of poor project design,
exacerbated by very high turnover of headquarter supervisory staff that led to lack of
proactivity and delayed decision-making. Despite the extraordinary efforts of in-
country staff in the latter part of the project these were too late to redress earlier
problems. Overall Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory.

       Borrower performance was mixed, the lack of consistent implementation
support and proactivity of key issues before 2007 was latterly offset by the good
performance of the utilities and strong government support for tariff increases. Overall,
borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.

Lessons
The key lessons derived, based on the findings of this PPAR, are the following:

   When designing infrastructure and service provision projects within the
    context of a regional environmental crisis it is essential to minimize objectives
    and keep them focused on interventions the borrower will support. In this case,
    driven by the Aral Sea crisis, the Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project
    overly emphasized the need to mitigate a range of ill-defined public health
    problems when even provision of basic services like potable water supply was in
    jeopardy.

   Adoption of community driven development models in a country where the
    culture of community self-help lacks prominence may require additional
    capacity-building efforts. In the case of Uzbekistan, the well-established
    community-driven model for implementing the sanitation, health, and hygiene
    components, based on the experience in Nepal, India, and Peru experienced
                                              xi


    difficulties. This was due to the insufficient attention paid to building the capacity
    in the local institutions responsible for project implementation, especially since the
    community-centric culture did not exist in the country. The project however
    benefited from an extensive series of six social assessments, as these assessments
    clearly demonstrated that consulting communities in the design of pilot projects put
    pressure on authorities to give greater attention to the scale and cost of projects.

   The practicality and realism of bringing about institutional strengthening of a
    developing country’s main utilities through a performance-based management
    contract needs very careful appraisal. The Bank needs to adopt a flexible
    approach that can strengthen operating performance of the utility’s business in key
    areas without imposing unacceptable foreign management. In the case of the
    Bukhara and Samarkand, the foreign Operator (with hindsight) did have a very
    positive impact on modernizing and providing a commercial orientation to the
    utilities. However, socio-political factors ignored at appraisal, and exacerbated by
    the imposed Court judgment beyond the control of the implementing agencies,
    clouded judgment during implementation and at closing about the effectiveness of
    this arrangement. This is because the private sector model antagonized the
    implementing agencies and had left a lingering resentment on the value-added by
    the private sector. This is particularly egregious given that the municipality-
    appointed utility staff, following capacity-building through the operator, has
    subsequently demonstrated their ability to manage the utilities effectively and
    sustainably.

   Introduction of private sector or NGO participation in a new socio-political
    environment requires continuity of specialist Bank supervision and the right
    mix of skills. In the case of both projects the annual turnover of task team leaders
    led to a lack of proactivity on critical institutional issues that exacerbated delays and
    hindered the Bank’s effectiveness and efficiency.

   Proper tariff setting and demand management efforts are critical factors that
    lead to expansion in customer base and increased revenues for the utilities. In
    the case of Water Supply, Sanitation, and Health project, greater attention was paid
    to securing financial viability under the new decentralized arrangements. Activities
    included periodic water tariff increases proposed by the regional government for
    central government approval, and simplification of tariff structure. The project was
    also successful in demand management through physical actions to reduce water
    losses, creating and updating a water user database, metering, and financial
    incentives to conserve water. Once staff was trained, equipment procured and
    public awareness was raised, the demand management program was mainstreamed
    in all three utilities. As a result, the customer base was expanded and revenues were
    increased, leading to improvements in financial viability of the utilities.

   Financial autonomy is important for long-term sustainability of water utilities.
    The Buhkara and Samarkand Water Supply Project managed to increase water
    metering significantly through various measures, leading to enhanced collection of
    revenues. However, due to lack of financial autonomy, the utility is experiencing
    difficulty collecting the arrears from government institutions. This is likely to
    adversely affect the utilities’ commercial performance if the government does not
    address the utilities’ autonomy issue soon.

1. Background
Country Context
1.1     Uzbekistan’s population increased from 20.5 million in 1990 to 30.7 million in
2014 and accounts for about half of Central Asia’s total population. Following
independence in 1991, the Government of Uzbekistan’s development strategy has
delivered consistent economic growth and gradual reforms. In contrast to many other
former Soviet Union countries this approach has eased the social costs of transition and
reduced vulnerability to external shocks. Poverty has declined steadily, from 27.5
percent of the population in 2001 to 19.5 percent in 2010. Gross domestic product
growth has been robust since the mid-2000s—averaging 8 percent annually through
2011, thanks to favorable terms of trade for the country’s key export commodities
(copper, gold, natural gas and cotton), effective macro-economic management, and
limited exposure to international financial markets. Uzbekistan’s vision is to become an
industrialized, high middle-income country by mid-21st century.

Sector Background
1.2     Soon after independence the Republic of Uzbekistan launched a strategy in
1993 for economic reform in the public utilities sector and to rehabilitate decaying
public service infrastructure, particularly in its municipalities. Public infrastructure
assets had been systemically neglected by the centralized service providers that relied
on government to pay for capital programs and for operations and maintenance. The
strategy included sector reorganization, decentralization of responsibilities to the local
authorities, new pricing and cost-recovery mechanisms, and encouraging private sector
participation in developing the country's infrastructure.

1.3      As a result, the Ministry of Public Utilities was restructured into a State Agency
for Public Utilities (Uzkommunkhizmat) in 2000. Its goals were commercializing the
activities of municipal and rural service providers, coordinating reforms, establishing
itself as regulator and monitoring compliance of the local authorities and commercial
entities with sectoral legislation. Responsibility for water distribution has been
decentralized to local governments and their utilities (Vodokanals, VKs), and policies
have been enacted in pursuit of better availability, quality, and sustainability of
services. Management responsibility for long-distance and inter-provincial bulk water
transport and treatment remained with the central government, and inter-regional water
allocation remains the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Resources.

1.4      Uzbekistan has a predominantly desert climate and only 10 percent of the land
is cultivated, the majority in the fertile valleys of the Amu Darya and Syr Drya rivers
that flow some 1,200 km east from the mountains to the Aral Sea depression. Most of
the population live near these major rivers and inter-regional pipelines deliver potable
water to consumers in cities, towns and some villages. With few exceptions, the more
                                                           2


remote and thinly populated western rural areas rely on groundwater that in the west
becomes increasingly saline, thus making local desalination necessary.

1.5     The period 1990-2010 saw the proportion of people with access to improved
water supplies decline from 90 to 87 percent even though an additional 5.4 million
people gained improved access over that period.1 Most of the increased number was in
rural areas where access expanded from 12.3 million to17.3 million people. Even so,
access rates decreased from 85 to 81 percent of the rural population – as did the
proportion with piped household supplies that fell from 37 to 26 percent – because rural
population growth outstripped growth of improved water supplies and the ability to
maintain them. In contrast, urban access grew from 97 percent to 99 percent over the
two decades and household piped connections remained at the 85-86 percent level.
Those without household piped connections rely on tankers and wells for water.

1.6    In contrast to water supplies, access to modern sanitation increased in both rural
and urban areas. Nationally almost a third of the 2010 population gained access to
improved sanitation over the previous 20 years and coverage reached 100 percent.

1.7    Although the country was proactive in attending to infrastructure needs and
increased access, the limited capacity of sector institutions to maintain, renew, and
expand such assets had led to an effective degradation of access to good quality water
supply and sanitation services. The situation was particularly dire in rural areas where
previously served communities often have to cope with chronic service breakdown or
no service at all. Even when piped water supply is available it is often of low quality.

1.8    In response to these challenges, the World Bank has been active in the water
supply and sanitation sectors since the early 1990s mainly under the umbrella of the
Aral Sea Program.2 The two projects that are the subject of this PPAR were the first
two full-scale projects of six Bank projects to assist the sector, Table 1.

Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. The Program’s four objectives included stabilizing the environment of
the Aral Sea Basin, rehabilitating the disaster area around the sea, improving the management of the
international waters of the Aral Sea Basin, and building the capacity of institutions at the regional and
national level to advance the program. The project area of the Water Supply, Sanitation and Health
project lies adjacent to the southern parts of former Aral Sea

 2. Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project
2.1     The project planned to reach 1.6 million people who are located in two separate
provinces of Uzbekistan that have differing water supply institutions. About 60 percent
of the target population lives in the semi-autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan that
accounts for more than a third of the county’s area. Most of these beneficiaries are
located in Amu Darya delta at the southern end of the former Aral Sea. The remaining
40 percent of beneficiaries are located in and around the floodplains of the Amu Darya
River in the adjacent and relatively densely populated Khorezm Oblast to the southeast.
2.2    Half the population in the Republic of Karakalpakstan (RKKP) and three-
quarters of the population in Khorezm Oblast live in very small rural communities
associated with former state farms. Average family sizes are larger than the national
average of 6.9: ranging from 7.6 in the Republic to 7.1 in Khorezm.
2.3     The project was Component 5.1 of the Aral Sea Program whose aim was to
improve the health of the population in the region - 1.2 million people living in rural
areas and 0.4 million urban residents. The focus was on providing increased access to
improved, adequate, safe, and reliable water supply services. About 50,000 rural and
peri-urban inhabitants were to be provided with improved sanitation facilities.
2.4     Inter-regional and provincial bulk water supply was managed by two
independently managed agencies that sell their water to the urban and rural utilities for
distribution.3 Both bulk suppliers take their water from a common diversion point in the
Tuyamuyun reservoir on the Amu Darya River. While they share trunk pipelines, they
manage their own pumping plant and water treatment facilities. Tuyamuman Urgench
supplies water to Khorezm Oblast and was an organization supported by the
government budget within the then Ministry of Communal Services. Tuyamuman


																																																								
3. Bulk water utilities provided 70 percent of urban water supply and 96 percent of rural water
supply in Khorezm Oblast. In contrast, in RKKP bulk water utilities provided 55 percent urban
water supply only 13 percent or rural water supply. The balance of water supplies in both areas
was mostly from local surface water resources (rivers and canals) and groundwater.
                                              4


Nukus was the bulk water supplier to the Republic of Karalkapakstan (RKKP) and is
overseen by the Republic of KKP’s own Ministry of Communal Services.

2.5     The urban water distribution companies are overseen by the provincial governor
who is the first gatekeeper for tariff setting. At the time of appraisal, rural water supply
distribution utilities were the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture in RKKP and
the Ministry of Communal Services in Urgench.

2.6     Each bulk supplier received subsidies that covered about 70 percent of its costs
of operation. Bulk supply tariffs were subsidized to compensate for high pumping
costs, operation and maintenance (O&M), and normal depreciation, the latter being
based on historic costs despite rampant inflation. Payment for bulk water from the two
water utilities was supposed to make up the difference, but arrears meant that only
maintenance of essential plant was undertaken while routine maintenance was
postponed.

2.7     Unlike bulk suppliers, water distributors received no central government
subsidies. Distributors’ water tariffs were reviewed directly by provincial governors
before being approved in Tashkent. Special tariffs were levied for different user groups
such as teachers and those in the medical services, and for different types of
organizations. Universally the revenue from urban water sales was totally inadequate to
cover all costs, and this led to deferred maintenance and difficulty in expanding
networks to meet the demands of a growing customer base. Consequently, the inclusion
of a study to rationalize tariff-policy and introduce global knowledge on institutional
strengthening via international consultants was highly relevant.

Objectives
2.8    The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) states that the project has two objectives:
 "The first is the provision of safe drinking water along with improved hygiene
education and sanitation facilities for the Republic of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm
Oblast. Specifically, this objective would decrease the incidence of water-borne
diseases among the population, particularly diarrheal diseases among children. The
second objective is to strengthen institutional capacity for management, operation and
financial performance of the regional water supply and sanitation utilities as well as the
regional Centers of Health and the Sanitary Epidemiology Stations."

2.9    The Loan Agreement provides a less complex description of objectives:
"To improve water supply, sanitation, and health in the Project area through: (a) the
provision of safe drinking water and sanitation facilities; and (b) the strengthening of
the financial, operational, and managerial capacities of water supply and sanitation
utilities."

2.10 This assessment is made against the objectives described in the Loan
Agreement.

(a) Provide Rural Sanitation. Provide about 7,500 improved latrines and hand-washing facilities,
covering about 5 percent of the rural population in both regions. 20 percent of the construction
costs were to be contributed by beneficiaries. Provide also equipment, transportation, consultant
services and training for rural, community-based committee members and other staff in
management and low-cost sanitation technologies.
(b) Promote Health Promotion and Hygiene Education. This was to complement the community-
based sanitation and hand-pumps sub-components. It included also the costs of an inter-sectoral
committee to review and assist project activities.
(c) Improve Water Quality Monitoring and Strengthen Sanitary Epidemiological Services (SES)
for households and communal facilities. Institutional and organizational efficiency to be
improved through better M&E and integrating regional data reporting into the project’s
Geographic Information System on a demonstration basis.
3. Technical Assistance Component - Planned US$8.2 million; Actual US$5.6 million.
(a) Institutional Strengthening of Water Utilities and Bulk Providers. To enable a program for
regular preventive maintenance, monitoring and reduction of operating costs and reduction and
management of accounts receivable. It included design and operation of a utility accounting
system, including cost accounting, and local and foreign training programs.
(b) Tariff Study. Lay the foundation for the introduction of new water and sewerage tariff rates
for the various consumers groups through use of consultancy services and new office equipment.
(c) Refinancing Feasibility Study carried out by the Kuwait Fund.
4. Management, Design and Supervision – Planned US$8.4 million; actual US$9.4 million.
This supported the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), consultant services, and support staff.
5. Refinance Pilot Water Supply Project - Estimated US$5.0 million; Actual US$3.2 million.
The Pilot project had funded the construction of a self-managed water supply scheme in the peri-
urban areas of Nukus and the preparation of detailed designs and bid documents by foreign
consultants.

PROJECT FINANCING 

2.12 The project was restructured on July 12, 2005 at the request of the Borrower and
some disbursements also became ineligible for Bank-financing. In all, US$16.62
million of the Loan was cancelled and US$ 58.38 million was disbursed. Bank lending
was to be complemented by co-finance from the Kuwait Fund for Arab and Economic
Development and the German Development Credit Institution (KfW). However, KfW
executed its financing of US$19.36 million independently as parallel financing through
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investment, and Trade. The Kuwait Fund
was similarly managed. A parallel UNDP grant of US$0.45 million in 2000 supported
technical and administrative assistance for the Project implementation Unit when
recruitment of international consultants encountered delays. The Borrower contributed
US$15.76 million, 24 percent more than planned.

Relevance
OBJECTIVES 

2.13 The relevance of objectives is rated High. Project objectives were
straightforward and highly relevant to improving social and productive infrastructure in
rural communities and towns most adversely affected by the Aral Sea environmental
crisis.

2.14 The objectives’ focus on service provision, and building capacity to ensure
sustainable infrastructure, wisely avoided the more complex issue of systemic
institutional reform of the sector that the government was still formulating in the mid-
1990s. Subsequently, objectives have remained relevant to the government’s Welfare
Improvement Strategy – the equivalent of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper – for the
period 2007-2010. Objectives are currently relevant to the updated 2013-2015 Strategy4
prepared in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme, the World
Bank, ADB, and other international organizations. In 2008 the Government completed
a national inventory of water supply and sanitation (WSS) services that has made
investment to improve services a priority over the next ten years.

2.15 Project objectives remain relevant to Uzbekistan’s National Water Supply and
Wastewater System Development and Modernization Plan (2009–2020). This aims to
achieve 100 percent water supply coverage in most urban areas and 85 percent in rural
areas by 2020. Additionally, the Plan includes improved operational efficiency of WSS
services by reforming institutional structures, and operation and management of the
water supply and sanitation agencies. Presidential Decree 1446 (December 2010)
																																																								
4. Section 5.8 of the Strategy outlines the priority actions that include increasing accountability
of service providers, clear and accountable tariff setting, improvement of billing and collection,
introduction of incentives to improve efficiency by implementing public-private contracts
between local authorities and providers, and development of mechanism to provide targeted
support to the poor in regards to utility payments.

ordered an investment program involving 38 major water supply and sanitation
schemes with an investment requirement of over $300 million per year over the period
2011-2015.

2.16 The objectives were relevant to the World Bank’s 1998 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), the CAS FY02-04 and the Interim CAS FY06-07 that emphasized
supporting long-term actions that would enhance the efficiency of resource allocation
for social infrastructure and services with a focus on health, water supply and
education. The CAS FY09-11 gave priority under its second objective to improve water
supply and health. Objectives remain highly relevant to the FY12-15 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) Results Area 4 that is supporting the government’s
objective to reduce regional and rural-urban inequities, including two of four priorities:
providing more accessible quality and sustainable health services, especially in the rural
areas; and continuing to improve the coverage and sustainability of potable water
supply and sanitation services.

DESIGN 

2.17 Relevance of Design is rated Substantial. The results framework provides a
logical sequence of inputs, activities and outputs required to achieve the intended
outcomes.

2.18 A Pilot Water Supply Project sought to improve the design and implementation
arrangements for a follow-on project through a "learning by doing" approach; speed up
the implementation of the full-scale project through early completion of detailed
engineering designs and bidding documents; and develop and test cost recovery
schemes. The pilot included a technical assistance component to develop a management
and supervision arrangement and prepare detailed engineering designs for the full-scale
project. The pilot included also an investment component to rehabilitate a water supply
scheme in a peri-urban area.

2.19 The focus on improving organizational and institutional efficiency was highly
relevant. The organizational set-up was fragmented and inefficient. There were six
water supply utilities serving the two provinces, some centrally budgeted and overseen
and some where budgeting and management had been delegated to provincial/local
control. Rationalization into fewer utilities was expected to bring about more coherent
planning and management and increase efficiency through economies-of-scale.

2.20 The inclusion of engineering rehabilitation was highly relevant to increasing
distribution system efficiency, reducing costs and providing incentives to pay for the
full cost of water. The very large water distribution systems – 1,742 km for urban areas
and 4,680 km for rural – were in a poor state of repair due to deferred maintenance and
prone to excessive leakage that exceeded 30 percent. In many places, irregular water
supplies5 enable ingress of poor quality groundwater into pipelines adding to water
quality problems, as well as jeopardizing adequate metering. In urban areas, water

																																																								
5. Regular summer water supply averaged 17 hours per day in urban areas and 3 to 5 hours in
rural areas.
                                                           8


pressure was too low to service apartments above ground level, and taps left open to
capture water when it came exacerbated water losses. In addition, some rural
distribution networks (in one case up to 600 km) were not connected to the bulk supply
pipeline due to lack of financial resources and uncoordinated planning.

2.21 The problem of intermittent water supplies was compounded by lack of funds to
address the generally poor quality of water treatment facilities that were outdated and
difficult to maintain.6 While this was particularly the case for urban centers like
Urgench and Nukus, it was also true of the 300 Soviet-era small-scale desalination
plants that served small communities in the more isolated rural areas of RKKP.

2.22 The design of the sanitation, health and hygiene components using the
community-driven development (CDD) model was relevant given that this model had
been demonstrated through the Bank’s experience in Nepal, India and Peru. However, it
overlooked the lack of a community self-help culture and state dominance in decision-
making. Thus there was insufficient attention to building knowledge, capacity and
acceptance of CDD approaches within the formal water and sanitation utilities
responsible for project implementation.

2.23 Even so, the project design benefited from an extensive series of six social
assessments. These assessments clearly demonstrated that consulting communities in
the design of pilot projects put pressure on authorities to give greater attention to the
scale and cost of projects. Thus, for example, one pilot project demonstrated that when
asked to pay, beneficiaries requested that service provision be reduced from the utility
design of 350 to 150 liters per capita per day (lcpd). Another pilot, internalizing this
issue, chose the diameter of the tertiary network to be 100 mm instead of the official
design of 150-175 mm.

Monitoring and Evaluation
2.24 Design. The results framework in the Staff Appraisal Report included target
values for only some of the outcome indicators. Setting up the M&E arrangements and
their implementation was only scheduled to take place in 2000, some three years after
the project was expected to become effective. As a result, baseline data for agency
performance were very patchy making incremental improvements difficult to evaluate.
There were no baseline indicators on health status and desired health outcomes.

2.25 Implementation. Generally, once organizational reform was complete, the
various water supply utilities were assiduous in collecting input and output indicator
data driven by increasingly greater demand for accountability of state resources from
the central government agencies for planning, finance and economy. Data to assess
project impacts on health were supposed to be collected from government health
statistics along with periodic knowledge, attitudes, and practices surveys but this did
not happen.


																																																								
6. Satisfaction with urban piped water quality was 60 percent in RKKP and 49 percent in
Khorezm. It was higher for hand-pumped groundwater.
                                             9


2.26 In the final year of the project a beneficiary survey was designed to capture
some of the missing outcome data. This survey adopted a single-difference approach
given there were negligible longitudinal data. It used a two-stage sampling process to
select 400 sequentially selected random project households and 400 similarly sampled
control rayon households for comparative analysis. There is no discussion in either the
files or ICR Annex of what steps were taken to match the treatment and control groups
and it is not clear if there was selection bias. Households may have been randomly
selected for the survey but it is unclear if their assignment to the project was random.
While the surveys were utilized by the ICR it is unclear, given the above reservations,
how much reliance can be placed on the findings.

2.27 The IEG mission found in 2014 that the rigor of M&E implementation was
being maintained and that excellent records are systematically and routinely collected
on the engineering, efficiency and financial performance of the water supply utilities.
Similarly, the indicators on environmental standards and water quality are
systematically collected by the government’s Sanitary Epidemiological Services (SES).

2.28 Utilization. Although data were collected during implementation, they were
used almost exclusively to respond to Bank and Borrower supervision demands and
needs for project monitoring data. More in-depth evaluation that could have generated
lessons and guided refinements to project implementation was given less attention.

2.29 However, IEG found in 2014 that central government agencies routinely
scrutinize monitoring data provided by the utilities to inform national policy and
decision-making and provide feedback to utilities to improve their performance. SES is
very proactive in ensuring water quality problems at the utility level are being
addressed.

Implementation
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS 

2.30 The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was located in the State Committee for
Forecasting and Statistics (Goskomprogostat) under the Ministry of Economy. Given
weak local capacity and unfamiliarity with Bank project requirements, the PIU was to
be assisted by the internationally-recruited consultants. With this support it was
expected that the PIU would coordinate the consultants responsible for the Sanitation,
Health and Hygiene component, the Institutional Strengthening Program, and the
Demand Management Program.

2.31 In addition to overall coordination, the PIU was responsible for common
implementation functions such as project accounting, procurement, disbursements,
consolidation of quarterly and annual progress reports, annual work programs and
budgets. At the local level the PIU appointed directors and established two regional
offices (in Nukus, Karakalpakstan and Urgench, Khorezm) to act as local coordination
agencies and facilitate the coordination between different central, provincial and local
government agencies involved in water supply and sanitation.

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE 

2.32 The loan became effective in October 1997. However, weak institutional
arrangements for project management by the implementing agency led to delays in
procurement of key consultants to assist the PIU and failure to meet some loan
covenants, a process not helped by substantial turnover of Task Team Leaders and
changes to the composition of Bank’s task team.7 An early mid-term review was held in
November 1999 and this led to a technical assistance agreement with UNDP to assist
management of the PIU by the end 1999.

2.33 The task team also commissioned a Supervision Enhancement Review by the
Bank’s Quality assurance Group (QAG) in early 2000 and the Review recommended
more intensive use of local staff at the resident mission for procurement advice. Despite
these efforts, chronic procurement problems continued to plague the project and led to
long delays in finalizing contracts for project activities. Additionally, a
recommendation to seek bilateral grant financing to enable enhanced social assessment
and stakeholder consultation was not acted upon.

2.34 Lack of agreement within the Government on implementation arrangements for
the sanitation, health and hygiene (component 2), despite recruitment of an
international consulting firm, led to the cancellation of the consultant’s two-year
contract in 2001. Eventually, in 2005, the government requested the Bank to cancel this
component and reallocate the funds to other activities. Although this nullified
achievement of the hygiene education outcomes that were to support the health sub-
objective, and undercut achievement of the sanitation sub-objective, the project was not
restructured.

2.35 A corruption investigation by the government resulted in replacement of all of
the PIU national staff in May 2002, the cancellation of US$1.7 million of the Loan for
misprocurement in 2003 and a hiatus in project implementation for nearly two years. A
further case of fraudulent contracting involving US$11.3 million for construction of the
Urgench water treatment plant was investigated by the Bank and the PIU in 2003 and
led to the rebidding of civil works that were successfully completed in 2008, albeit four
years behind schedule.

2.36 Following the appointment of new PIU staff in 2004 implementation
accelerated. Even so, as a result of earlier implementation problems the project was
extended twice. The first extension was for two years to December 2007 to allow for
completion of ongoing contracts for civil works and completion of delayed institution
strengthening. The second extension of six months to June, 2008 allowed completion of
the civil works contract for the Urgench water treatment plant and installation of
desalination plants.

 . Only one member of the original team continued working on the project after 1998. Overall,
there were seven task team leaders over the period of implementation.
                                            11


Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
2.37 Safeguards. This was classified as a category B project under OP/BP 4.01
Environmental Assessment. According to Bank records, it complied with Bank
environmental and social safeguards during implementation. At negotiations it had been
agreed that the dam for the Tuyamuyun Hydro System would be inspected annually by
independent experts. A satisfactory inspection report was provided to the Bank in 2000
following a detailed engineering and geodetic evaluation. Subsequent reports were not
provided to the Bank as they were considered to be of strategic national security
importance - the main dam is located on the river Amu Darya and straddles the border
of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The Bank took no further action on this non-
compliance.

2.38 Financial Management. Project financial management arrangements were
rated marginally satisfactory in the last financial management supervision (March
2008). Financial management of the beneficiary water utilities remained unsatisfactory
throughout the implementation period in spite of efforts made to strengthen accounting
and internal controls. Reflecting serious weaknesses in accounting and internal control
systems, audit reports were frequently delayed and often qualified. Audited financial
statements of the water utilities and tariff structures also showed noncompliance with
the financial covenants.

2.39 Notwithstanding these problems, the fiduciary requirement was met by the
project audit that was conducted, covering the period up to the closing in June 2008.
The government’s PIU audit report was submitted in July 2009 and was satisfactory
and unqualified. Audit reports for the various water utilities and project financial
statements covering the period to December 31, 2007 and June 30, 2008, were
submitted. However, utility audit reports for the 2008 were overdue at closing as the
last unqualified audit report submitted was for 2007 when the loan was scheduled to
close, and before the six-month extension to June 30, 2008. As there was no possibility
of getting the utility audit reports for 2008 (since these audits were financed from the
loan) a permanent audit waiver for the two utilities (Nukus and Urgench VKs) was
granted by the Bank in December 2009.

2.40 Procurement. A corruption investigation by the Borrower resulted in
replacement of all of the PIU national staff in May 2002, and some national staff were
jailed. Misprocurement of earth-moving equipment was declared in 2003 and the
related portion of the loan was cancelled. A case of fraud was proved on another
contract. The Bank undertook investigation of these allegations of fraud and
misprocurement, the fraud issue was reported to the Bank’s Integrity Vice Presidency,
and part of the Loan was cancelled.

Achievement of Objectives
2.41 The outcomes discussed below, whilst mostly contributed by the Bank-assisted
project, were also boosted by the inputs of the first six years of the parallel and
overlapping 10-year (2002-2012) ADB-assisted Western Uzbekistan Rural Water
Supply Project that had almost identical objectives. In addition USAID invested in
                                            12


improvements to water production capacity and physical efficiency in the RKKP and
Khorezm Oblast. The EU and bi-lateral partners also engaged in activities affecting
governance and public health in the project area.

Objective: To improve water supply, sanitation, and health in the Project area.

2.42 Overall, this objective was substantially achieved. Safe drinking water and
sanitation facilities were provided and the financial, operational, and managerial
capacities of water supply and sanitation utilities were substantially strengthened. The
institutional improvements greatly increased cost-recovery and the financial viability of
service provision. Achievements of low-cost sanitation and health hygiene education
were less than expected but commensurate with the reduced resources following the
borrower’s cancellation of related technical assistance and financing. No discernable
health improvements can be attributed to the project because of the complexity of
factors affecting public health beyond the very narrowly-focused project activities.

OUTPUTS

Institutional Outputs

2.43 Restructuring/Reorganization. A Plan for restructuring of the six separate
water utilities was prepared and approved at the end of 2002, five years later than
scheduled. It was fully implemented by March 2005 at which time the six water utilities
were reorganized into three.

2.44 In the Republic of Karakalpakstan two of the three utilities, one the bulk water
supplier and the other distributing water to the major cities and towns, were merged
into one. The bulk water supplier Tuyamuyan-Nukus and the urban water distribution
utility Karakalpakstan Vodokanal merged to became the Tuyamuyan-Nukus (hereafter
Nukus) water and sanitation utility. The Karakalpakstan Agrovodokanal – now known
as Trest - remained responsible for rural water supplies. In 2014, at the time of IEG’s
assessment, the government of the Republic of Karakalpakstan stated that it planned to
merge the urban and rural water utilities into one. The Nukus and Trest utilities have
adopted common financial principles, operating standards, monitoring and accounting
systems and this harmonization will enable significant economies of scale when the
merger occurs.

2.45 In Khorezm Oblast the bulk water supplier Tuyamuyun-Urgench, the urban
water distributor Khorezm Vodokanal and the rural water distribution utility Khorezm
Agrovodokanal were merged into a single water and sanitation utility Tuyamuyan
Urgench (hereafter Urgench).

2.46 Institutional Strengthening. New departments on water demand, loss
reduction and a computerized system of billing and receipt of payments were
established in the water utilities, and these were linked to interactive GIS and
computer-based management systems. Knowledge and capacity was increased through
a wide range of technical assistance, including upgrading M&E systems and equipment
for water quality monitoring and providing improved legal procedures and
documentation of contracts between consumers and water supply organization. The
                                             13


planned Water Tariff Policy Study was completed by international consultants and
approved by the Ministry of Finance.

2.47 Governance. While the utilities were rationalized to achieve harmonization
and resulting economies-of-scale, their legal status remained essentially unchanged by
project interventions. The Cabinet of Ministers sets policy for water supply and
sanitation as well as other municipal services, while the Uzkommunhizmat establishes
technical and other norms and gives technical support. Regional and local governments
manage and regulate services that are mainly provided by regional government-owned
water supply companies. Overall sector regulation remains with Uzkommunhizmat that
is responsible for water supply standards, and financial regulation remains with the
Ministry of Finance.

2.48 Despite the reforms to policies that affect water supply and sanitation, and
decentralization to the local level, the water utilities do not have full autonomy on
finances. While the utilities have autonomy through their right to provide water supply
and sewerage services, and to bill and collect user fees for services provided, their
autonomy is still limited by their inability to set water tariffs, vary costs such as
depreciation, negotiate power costs from the government monopoly supplier, or to
access credit outside central government.

2.49 Water supply and sewerage tariffs remain in the control of Central government
although there is a process of consultation on tariff-setting that takes into account
locality, costs of supplying water and investment needs. In the first instance the local
government authority, in consultation with the utility, recommends a tariff. This tariff is
then submitted by the Regional government to the Ministry of Finance for review and
approval. Water tariffs were reviewed and reset once a year until 2009 but thereafter
tariffs have been reset twice a year in April and October.

2.50 Demand Management. The project addressed this directly through physical
actions to reduce water losses, creating and updating a water user database, metering,
and financial incentives to conserve water. Physical actions were undertaken on a
demonstration basis in each zone of Nukus and Urgench. Actions included installation
of manholes and network water flow monitoring equipment, metering of an individual
block of apartments in each zone, and repairing or replacing aged pipework and valves.
By this means water losses were halved in areas targeted. Once staff was trained,
equipment procured and public awareness was raised, the demand management
program was mainstreamed in all three utilities.

Engineering Outputs

Republic of Karakalpakstan

Urban water systems:
 The Republic’s capital, Nukus, was provided with11.25 km of improved trunk
   water pipeline connecting the north and south parts of the city. Within the city
   26.74 km of water distribution pipelines (target 24.5 km) were replaced and
   households connected. Work on leak detection and repair was carried out. As a
                                                        14


    result the water pressure increased allowing water supply to multi-story blocks of
    flats.
   Two rural towns south of the regional Tuyamuyun-Nukus transmission pipeline
    were connected via 15.8 km of pipelines and water storage, chlorination plants and
    distribution centers were installed.
Rural water supply:
 Eight group and 20 local water distribution centers were constructed connecting
   112,300 consumers.
 Small-scale desalination plants were replaced and an additional 9 were built and
   replacement parts to rehabilitate 300 existing desalination plants were provided
   (Figure 1). This benefited 6,000 consumers.

   51 wells were drilled in four district towns (Beruny, Chimbay, Kegeyly and
    Turtkul) along with water storage and water treatment facilities. This provided
    19,400 m3/day enough for 70-80 percent of the population or about 120,000
    consumers.
   Demand-based approaches led to the installation of 115 km of water supply
    network and household connections. Work also included water distribution centers
    and automation. It was expected to benefit 26,000 consumers.
   3,326 medium-lift hand pumps were installed on wells surveyed and developed by
    the Uzbekistan Hydrogeological Survey.
   A 105 km pipeline proposed to connect the Kungrad water treatment works to the
    town of Muynak and benefit 13,700 people located at the foot of the former Aral
    Sea was not constructed as it was not seen as cost-effective. Instead, the town relies
    on water tankers and local wells

Oblast Khorezm
Urban water systems:
 The provincial capital, Urgench, had 32.58 km of pipeline rehabilitated (target
   30.80), an unspecified number of new household connections were made and leak
   detection and repair were carried out.
 The rehabilitation of the old water treatment plant was cancelled and a new
   treatment complex drawing water from the Shavat Channel of the Amu Darya was
   constructed with a capacity of 100,000 m3/day (Figure 2.). Commissioned in 2007,
   when operating at 75 percent capacity it treats enough water to supply 140,000
   consumers. In 2014 it was operating at 75 percent capacity and is in excellent
   condition. Notably the old plant needed 48 staff to run it; the new plant uses 23. In
   addition energy use was formerly 500 kWh/day; for the same volume of treatment it
   is now only 400kWh/day.

Rural water supply:
       o 5 rural and 26 local water distribution centers were built benefiting 95,000
           consumers.
       o No demand-based rural water supply was built.
       o Construction of the Chalysh Groundwater Intake was cancelled due to
           declaration of misprocurement.
Provision of sanitation:
       o Improved access to low-cost sanitation was partially achieved - 38,000
           compared with the target of 50,000.

OUTCOMES

Water Supply Improved

2.51 Access to water increased. The project provided improved water supplies and
security to about 1.04 million people. This is a third less than the target of 1.5 million
as a result of the reduction in expenditure due to cancellation of part of the loan and the
poor performance of the rural hand pump program. It includes 0.2 million people who
gained new access to water supplies and 0.8 million people that had their water supply
rehabilitated. Some 80% of all beneficiaries were more securely supplied with water
either through pipeline distribution systems or from electrically pumped wells.

 2.52 About 239,000 people (or 20% of total project beneficiaries) were provided
 only with new hand pumps that drew on groundwater sources. At project closing about
 half of these hand pumps may have been non-operational due to their poor quality
 construction.8 At appraisal it was expected under component 1 that 220,000 people
 would be supplied from hand pumps to access groundwater, and another 592,000
 people were to similarly benefit under component 2. However, as most of component 2
 was cancelled, it is inferred that only 3% (about 19,000 people) of its access target was
 achieved.9 Thus the total beneficiaries with operable hand pumps may have been about
 139,000 people.

 2.53 During the 2014 mission IEG was unable to determine the number of hand
 pump beneficiaries at closing because all the wells had been handed over to the many
 local administrations. No systematic records were available in the apex
 agencies/utilities on their location, utilization or status. The few hand-pump wells in
 rural areas of KKP seen by IEG were being utilized. The rural utility explained that
 most people have access to very limited volumes (for human consumption and cooking)
 of desalinated water from very small-scale desalination plants, some of which were
 rehabilitated or replaced by the project. The balance of water needs for household tasks
 is provided from private or local authority wells.

 2.54 The project helped poor households. While most beneficiaries (618,000 or 53
 percent) lived in rural areas, this was less than the target of 73 percent.10 Even so,
 poverty targeting was successfully achieved. Random sampling of the project and
 control areas in 2007 found that project beneficiary households (HH) were generally
 poorer than in the non-project areas. In Khorezm the project's median HH income was
 Sum 150,000-200,000 compared with control HHs that were Sum 250,000-300,000. A
 similar difference in median HH income was found in Karakalpakstan.

 2.55 Household water connections increased. The share of the beneficiary
 population receiving piped water supplies (via house and yard connections, standpipes
 and neighbors) increased from 29% in 1995 to 46% in 2008. In comparison only 32%
 of the population in 'without project' randomly selected districts (raions) had access to
 piped water supplies in 2008. How much of the incremental difference of 16% is

attributable to the project is unknown because of deficiencies in project M&E and
baseline data.

2.56 Regularity of water supply. The ICR states that ‘households in project areas
tend to have mediocre access - with most households having access no more than 10
hours a day.’ In 2014 RKKP’s Nukus urban water utility stated that 7 districts had 24/7
water supplies while 9 districts received water 12-14 hours per day and never less than
8 hours per day. RKKP’s rural water utility reported that in 2014 typical supply for
piped systems was 5-6 hours per day mainly because power outages disrupted pump
operation. No data were made available for Khorezm Oblast.

2.57 Water consumption was reduced. For the utilities, the aim was to maintain ex-
ante residential supply volumes of 280 liters/capita/day (lpcd) plus an annual growth of
1% when conservation and pricing measures became effective. Water conservation
measures and pricing impacts, allied with the loss of industrial demand, were so
effective that total water consumption fell by 54% over the period 1994-2008. Even so,
per capita consumption levels were above the WHO basic consumption levels (basic
access is defined as equal to, or better than, 20 liters per capita per day (lpcd); 50 lpcd
is defined as intermediate access).
 Average urban residential consumption fell between 1994 and 2008 in the
    Khorezm’s Urgench utility from 551 to 121 lpcd. In 2013 the average consumption
    was 115 lpcd.
 In the Nukus utility urban demand dropped from123 to 74 lpcd In 2013 it was 96
    lpcd.
 Average rural consumption also registered a decline in Karakalpakstan.
    Availability fell from an estimated 98 lpcd in 1998 to 30 lpcd in 2008. The rural
    utility stated the average consumption of billed water was about 36 lpcd in 2013.

2.58 In districts targeted by the project the beneficiary surveys conducted in 2008
found that 72 percent of households sampled were satisfied with the water service
provided compared with only 55 percent in without-project control districts.11 The
beneficiary surveys also found that only 11 percent of all project households had to rely
on an electric pump to boost water pressure to supply them; in the without-project
control households 21 percent needed booster pumps.

2.59 Results on water quality were mixed. At the time the project was closed the
Bank’s ICR team could not access water quality information and relied on verbal
reports from the SES. On this basis the ICR rated 98 percent of water supplied 'safe' for
domestic consumption. This value is based on piped water supplies (that was treated, 43
percent of the supply) and pumped groundwater (that was desalinated), and hand-
pumped groundwater (that was not treated).

2.60 However, the beneficiary survey of 2008 found that 53 percent of all
respondents in both project and non-project households reported that they thought water
quality was a problem. At the Oblast level 48 percent of the all respondents in

Karakalpakstan thought that water quality was a problem compared with 58 percent in
Khorezm.

2.61 All households cope with drinking water quality problems by boiling water, a
practice enabled by the universal supply of cheap natural gas to households. In 2014
officials confirmed to IEG – as did inhabitants in the rural households visited – that all
sources of water (pipelines and wells) were boiled before drinking this is a universal
practice.

Utility Performance Improved

2.62 The managerial and operational capacities of water supply and sanitation
utilities was strengthened and their financial management was improved. There is
significantly more up-to-date information available on water utility performance in the
Republic of Karakalpakstan than in Khorezm Oblast. Accordingly, the outcomes are
discussed and assessed for each of these administrative areas separately.

2.63 Expanded Customer Base. The utilities have been successful in planning and
expanding their customer base both during the time of project implementation (1996-
2008) and in the period to 2013, Table 4.

Nukus and Trest water utilities in 2014. There are incomplete data on rural connections as piped supplies serve
individual consumers, communes and standpipes.

2.64 Improved management, whose capacity was built by the project, has enabled the
water utilities to continually increase the overall access rate to piped water. The number
of new urban consumers grew under the project by 1,273 a year; since project
completion until 2014 the rate was 21,667 a year. Even so, the connection rate has only
kept pace with population growth and the urban access rate, at about 76 percent,
remains constant. In marked contrast, new piped water supplies in rural areas not only
managed to keep pace with the growing population, they also steadily increased the
rural access rate from 41 percent in 1996 to 55 percent in 2014, a notable achievement
fully in line with the project’s and government’s poverty targeting strategy. The
                                                      19


increase in new rural consumers has remained fairly constant at 96,000 a year under the
project and 94,000 a year thereafter to 2014.

2.65 Water Production. Production of water declined during the project as physical
water losses were reduced and water demand decreased because of the impact of
economic restructuring, greater institutional and household accountability through
metering and contracts and increased water tariffs. It was only in 2009, in response to
population growth and distribution network expansion, that water production slowly
started to increase, Table 5.

2.66 Economic restructuring during the 1990s greatly changed not only water
demand but also its balance among consumers. In Nukus in 1996, for example,
domestic water users accounted for only 51 percent of demand, state and government
institutions 36 percent, and industry and farms 11 percent. The closure of many state-
owned enterprises and budget organizations was so substantial before and during the
project period that by 2013 domestic use accounted for 86 percent of demand, albeit
some of this demand during summer was for unmetered agricultural use. This change
had a marked effect on the utilities’ income because, in the past, the state and
government institutions and industries had always been poor at paying their water bills
even though their water use, unlike domestic consumers, tended to be more closely
monitored.

2.67 Accountability Increased. Before the project household water use was
determined through either block meters monitoring one or several apartment houses or
on the basis of the customer’s profile and family size. Estimated water consumption
was recorded in each customer’s water book and paid monthly to the water utility
offices. After the success of the water metering pilots, water metering became national
policy. By 2014 some 47 percent or urban and 30 percent of rural customers in
Karakalpakstan were metered. Unmetered customers pay a flat rate and a penalty
charge for not installing a water meter.

2.68 From December 2013 a Presidential Decree made water metering mandatory for
all consumers receiving piped water supplies. Unmetered customers have to pay a
penalty of 50 percent over and above the flat rate until a meter is installed. Customers
in the poorer rural areas having isolated village water supply systems or standpipes and
wells are exempt from the penalty charge but are still expected to pay the flat rate. The
cumulative impact of better customer registration and classification, metering,
computerized accounting systems and a vigilant and trained inspectorate is that water
                                                                      20


billings have improved (Table 6). Collection rates in excess of 100 percent include the
payment of earlier default billings.

2.69 On the basis of billed production, unaccounted-for-water was 27.5 percent and
23.7 percent for the Nukus and Trest water utilities respectively, slightly below the
appraised project target of 28 percent for the original Nukus urban water utility. There
was no target for the Trest rural utility.

Source: IEG 2015 based on SAR (1996 baseline), and updated operational data provided by the Nukus and Trest
water utilities in 2014. Data on rural billings and collection are not available pre 2009. a/ The reason for the
significant drop in production was not stated by the water utility.

2.70 Determining improvements in collection rate over baseline conditions is fraught
by the lack of comparable statistics.12 It is, however, clear that there has been only
modest improvement in unaccounted-for-water since project closure.

2.71 Water tariffs were increased. At the time of appraisal (1996) water tariffs
were very low, particularly for urban consumers. In Nukus, for example, the domestic
tariff was Sum 0.22/m3 (US$0.0004), and the commercial and industrial was Sum
9.64/m3 (US$0.18).13 Thus there was a high cross-subsidy from large-scale consumers
(who then accounted for almost half of all water use) to small-scale domestic
consumers. The average tariff for rural consumers was Sum 6.98/m3 (US$0.13).

2.72 During the project, greater attention to securing financial viability under the
new decentralized arrangements led to increased water tariffs to meet water production
and distribution costs and to induce water conservation in line with best international
practice. By 2007 the classification for tariffs was simplified from three to two: one for
domestic use, and one for others that included government, commerce and industry. By
the end of the project (2008) urban domestic water tariffs had increased by 522 times in
nominal terms. Other tariffs had increased 114 times and five-fold respectively.


																																																								
12
 . The SAR (Annex J) used cumulative days receivable for each of the six utilities; such data
was not made available to IEG for the three current utilities.
13
  . For urban consumers until 2004 there were three water tariffs, the lowest for domestic use at
60 Sum/m3 (US$0.06) the next at 750 Sum/m3 (US$0.71) for collectives and government
budget organizations, and the highest for commerce and industry, 915 Sum/m3 (US$0.86). A
similar tariff structure applied to rural consumers.

been increased in nominal terms between               	2,000
2007-2014 by over 400 percent in urban
and rural areas (Figure 3). In contrast,              	1,500

recovery and revenue is only part of the
picture as they also have to be offset by
containing costs through higher levels of
operational and managerial efficiency.

2.76 The cost structure of utilities changed. The structure of operational and other
cost data show a gradual improvement in some key indicators over the period 2009-
2013 for both urban and rural utilities (Figures 5 and 6). Before the project (1995),

  . As there are no tariff data for rural areas for 2008, the values for 2009 were taken as a proxy
for ‘end of project’ values.
15
  . The factors taken into account when setting water tariffs are not published and, as far as IEG
could determine, there is no open public consultation. Additionally, the government’s
regulatory methodology for establishing utilities costs, investment, level of depreciation,
financial margins – all of which will affect the setting of water tariffs – and are not publically
disclosed.

energy was 41 percent of total operating costs in Nukus16 and, since project closure in
2009, these costs decreased from 35 percent to 27 percent by 2013. In the rural utility,
while energy is a much smaller share of costs, it too has declined: from 39 percent
before the project, to 15 percent in 2009 and 9 percent in 2013.

2.77 Conversely, the share of urban social and staff costs have increased significantly
– from 8% before the project, to 33% at project end, and 46% in 2013. A similar
increase in the staff share of costs is seen in the rural utility. It is not known if the
apparent increase in staff costs is the result of increased compensation or for other
reasons. As with energy, there are no normative data. Notwithstanding these structural

  . This is the composite value determined from the joint financial information for the rural
water supply and the bulk supply pipeline company. This only refers to the share of total costs;
it is not known in normative terms if energy use efficiency improved; energy consumption data
were not made available to IEG.

changes in the cost mix, in the urban utility total income has marginally exceeded
operating costs since 2006 and the working ratio has improved significantly since the
project started and has been maintained.17 Under pre-project conditions, the working
ratio was 1.32 and it improved to 0.96 at project end and to 0.94 in 2013. While ideally
the ratio could be smaller, the changes during and after the project indicate significantly
improved water utility management. A more realistic measure is the operating ratio
taking into account depreciation and financing costs, thus showing the actual net
income that can be used for O&M, Table 7.18

2.78 The main finding is that despite much improved management in the urban
utility (that indicates that there is little short-term risk to sustaining the current status of
water supplies), there is insufficient income to provide investment that ensures longer-
term sustainability. There is also no spare finance to cover improvements to operational
efficiency. Recent research has recommended that the operating ratio should exceed 1.2
(with depreciation) and 1.5 (without depreciation) to ensure sufficient funds to cover
daily expenses, debt service, capital replacement costs, emergencies, and unexpected
revenue shortfalls.19

2.79 The income-cost balance is much less sanguine for the rural utility and it does
not cover its costs even with government subsidy. Its working ratio was only 0.61 in
2013. With depreciation more than half of other costs it is not financially viable in the
medium to long-term without central government support for operations, replacement
and new investment.

2.80 Depreciation is an issue. Currently, the amount of depreciation is set by central
government, and the amount varies in an unpredictable way from year-to-year that
makes its funding difficult. The financial balance sheets for the water utilities do not
include a line item under current assets for the value of inventory or short-term
investments, and as far as IEG could determine, there has been no systematic
assessment of the value or age of sunk investment. Thus the technical basis for
depreciation calculations is unclear. There is the problem also that even the historically

																																																								
17
     . The working ratio = operating expenses/operating revenues. The target is to keep this <1.0.
18
     . The operating ratio = operating expenses/(revenues – depreciation and finance payments).

large 2013 amount of depreciation (Annex C) would value sunk assets at less than
US$81 million, and this is clearly far too low.20

2.81 The Urgench water utility provides water to both urban and rural water and also
exports a very small volume to the Karakalpakstan inter-regional pipeline. Since the
reorganization became effective in 2007 the utility has decreased its volume of
production, modestly decreased water losses, substantially increased its customer base
and become very modestly more energy efficient (Table 8). Comparisons with pre-
project indicators are not possible because data were not made available at appraisal;
there is also a potential problem with double-counting.21

No reason was given for the halving of the water production in 2012.

2.82 No financial or managerial data for the Urgench utility were made available to
IEG, and thus any impacts of the project on improved managerial and financial
performance cannot be determined.

Sanitation
2.83 There were no data at closing on the utilization of the few sanitation facilities
provided by the project. However, officials assured IEG that most households with low
cost sanitation utilized it; this was certainly the case for the few random households in
rural areas visited by IEG.22


																																																								
20
  . Urban water utility composite annual depreciation rates in the USA are of the order 2.0% to
2.5%. At these rates the 2013 depreciation of Sum 3.9 billion (less than US$1.6 million) would
value the sunk investment at only US$ 81million. See Wisconsin Public Services Commission
(2009). Rates for individual parts of a water supply system vary from supply mains (1.8%);
pumping plant (3.2-4.4%); water treatment plant (3.2-6.0%); transport 13.3%; to computers and
communications (15.0-26.7%). http://psc.wi.gov/utilityinfo/water/depreciationBenchmark.htm
21
  . Before the project the bulk water pipeline company sold water to both the urban and rural
water utilities, and each of those utilities also produced their own water, added it to the bulk
supply, and sold this to consumers. Only after 2007 did the Urgench water utility harmonize the
database and report aggregated net annual production.
22
  . Sanitation facilities, be they low or high cost, are essential given the intense winter cold and
high summer heat and almost all households have access to some
                                                           25


Health
2.84 There are no data on the health impacts that may have resulted from improved
water and sanitation facilities provided by the project. The hygiene education
component was not implemented. There were also no analyses at appraisal during
implementation to determine potential linkages between improved water supply,
sanitation, hygiene education and health outcomes, and there is no counterfactual.

2.85 There are limited data on health statistics. At project closing government health
statistics showed the incidence of diarrhea in the project raions (districts) was 2,903 per
100,000 in 2000 and 2,551 in 2004 with significant annual variation in between.
Incidence of Hepatitis A also showed annual variation going from 1,575 in 2000 to 653
in 2003 and 1,721 in 2004. During the IEG 2014 mission, SES officials in Nukus
showed IEG routinely collected RKKP health data for later years but did not provide it.
No data were made available for Khorezm Oblast.

2.86 Independent data indicates that the health objective was probably not
achieved.23 In RKKP the incidence of diarrhea was 3,017 per 100,000 people in 2004
and 3,439 in 2011. However, the incidence of Hepatitis A was reduced: the baseline
incidence was 1,926 and the value in 2011 was 1,005 (target 385). There were no data
on Typhoid incidence.

2.87 In Khorezm Oblast the 2008 baseline for diarrhea was 1,278 and in 2011 it was
1,518. Incidence of Hepatitis A decreased slightly over the same period from 1,151 to
1,043.

Efficiency
2.88 Economic and financial efficiency. The economic analysis at appraisal
assumed a set of benefits that did not materialize. One of the major benefits envisaged
was increased consumption from increasing access and improving service quality, but
the projections underestimated the impact that improved service efficiency and higher
water tariffs would have on household water consumption. Although many more
households gained access to water, the actual consumption per household decreased.
Reduced water consumption, however, is not an adverse outcome. As in this project,
the majority of former Soviet Union states increased attention to the efficiency of water
delivery and introduced higher tariffs – together these measures generally reduced per
capita consumption as wastage and leaks were eliminated.

2.89 At completion the project has a positive net present value primarily due to cost
savings. Revenues from residential consumers have been relatively small due to the low
																																																								
23
  . The 2012 ADB Rural Water Supply Project Completion Report provides data for its parallel
and overlapping project. The health indicators in the PCR apply to the whole of the RKKP and
Khorezm Oblast, not just to the communities assisted by ADB. Therefore these data also
include the impact of the Bank’s project. The incidence data are spot data – a better test of
efficacy would be a time series showing a secular downward trend and a multi-factoral analysis
to include other parameters affecting disease incidence.
                                             26


willingness to pay for water services – although this has increased since 2013 by
changes to government incentive policy. Even though water rates have increased
rapidly over time – also in real terms – the actual water rates are still very low. The ICR
presents a very thorough economic analysis that yielded a financial rate of return (FRR)
of 13 percent. And on a per-capita cost basis actual costs were US$45/capita compared
with the appraisal estimate of US$58/capita.

2.90 Administrative efficiency. The period 1998-2002 was problematic because of
the procurement problems and unfamiliarity with Bank procedures, but disbursements
were made as planned such that 59 percent of the loan was used by early 2002. The
impact of the corruption probes instituted by the government, replacement of the PIU
staff in 2002 and enhanced vigilance on procurement issues almost stopped
disbursement for 2.5 years and required an extension of the project’s closing date.
Better trained staff enabled disbursement to accelerate from 2005, albeit at a slightly
slower rate than planned.

2.91   On balance, efficiency is rated modest.

Ratings
2.92 The overall outcome of the project is rated moderately satisfactory. The
relevance of objectives is high and design relevance is rated substantial. The objective
to increase safe water supply was achieved and the water and sanitation utilities have
greatly improved their operational and financial efficiency. These achievements,
backed by guaranteed government subsidies, assure water supplies. While there were
shortcomings in achievement of sanitation and health objectives, overall efficacy is
rated substantial. Efficiency is rated modest. In combination these ratings lead to an
overall moderately satisfactory outcome.

Risk to Development Outcomes
2.93 Risk is rated as Moderate. At the time of the IEG mission project water tariff
issues had been fully internalized by government and are acted upon with increasing
attention to closing the financing gap between O&M expenditures and revenues. The
Government remains very strongly committed to subsidizing utilities’ debt servicing.
Even so, while water tariffs are being substantially increased they are still well below
costs, and utilities have difficulty in meeting all maintenance needs. Financial risks
arising from non-payment of bills by government entities are substantial but backlogs
are periodically cleared following government intervention.

2.94 Utility reorganization and consolidation has been successful and utilities’
management is working well and delivering accountable water services. Attention to
routine monitoring and reporting on performance by all the utilities and SES is
assiduous.

2.95 Provision of adequate maintenance of water supply and delivery networks
remains problematic. The main constraints are budgets that are too small, insufficient
                                            27


and outdated equipment for maintenance, and lack of spare parts, particularly for
equipment imported by the project that requires access to foreign exchange.

2.96 Staffing ratios may be an issue. There is no use of international staffing norms
for the WSS utilities so there is no way of knowing if the greatly increased staffing
costs are a drag on commercial efficiency. This needs to be addressed.

Bank Performance
2.97 Quality-at-Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The Bank
underestimated the magnitude of institutional weaknesses in the implementing and
executing agencies and the governance challenges. Financial and procurement risks
were seriously underestimated. The Bank misjudged the government's support for
community-driven development and for sanitation and hygiene education. Given that
this was the first operation in this subsector, a more extended period of dialogue,
piloting and capacity-building on these challenges may have secured a higher level of
government buy-in. A single focus on rehabilitation of water supply infrastructure,
utility reorganization and tariff policy – all of which were very thoroughly appraised –
would have been more pragmatic.

2.98 While environmental and social safeguard issues were satisfactorily appraised,
arrangements for M&E were unsatisfactory, baseline for the utilities were uneven there
were no baseline indicators on health status and desired health outcomes.

2.99 Supervision is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. A high turnover of task team
leaders (7 in all) made efficient supervision difficult, slowed decision-making and
contributed to the failure to enforce agreed safeguard policy. These shortcomings were
compounded by variable level of Borrower ownership and frequent changes among key
national management and coordination staff within the Ministry of Economy.
Recognizing some of these problems one of the Bank's Task team leader (TTL)
requested a Supervision Enhancement Review by QAG in early 2000 and also initiated
two studies funded through the Bank Netherlands Water Partnership Fund to improve
project performance and lessons learning from the experience. This operation was
classified as a problem project in the periods 1998-2000 and 2003-2004. As a result,
supervision missions were increased to 3-4 per year and total supervision costs became
very expensive, totaling US$1.28 million. Despite this increased attention, supervision
missed the opportunity to revise the development objectives to reflect changes resulting
from project restructuring and loan cancellation in 2005. It should be noted that the last
TTL initiated significant improvements to M&E to inform project completion
reporting.

2.100 Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance
2.101 These ratings relate to Borrower performance during appraisal and
implementation. As such, they do not include the improvement in the enabling
environment and government’s more aggressive policies on water sector regulation,
                                                           28


increasing water tariffs and cost recovery since project closure. Judging from the ability
of the two water utilities in Karakalpakstan to produce detailed accounting information
for IEG, and Regional government’s detailed knowledge of their financial and
operational affairs, the performance of these utilities has improved. The same cannot be
said of the Urgench water utility where there was a lack of transparency on financing
and accounting issues that occurred during project implementation and subsequently.

2.102 Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The
government was fully committed to rehabilitating and building new water supply
infrastructure. Its subsequent decision to utilize UNICEF and other grant financing for
the sanitation and health aspects of the project was pragmatic given the cost of the
IBRD Loan. Government was strongly supportive of rationalization of the six water
utilities serving the project areas and facilitated their merger into three agencies.

2.103 Lack of readiness or capacity for implementation led to extended delays in
establishing an effective project implementation unit (PIU).24 Financial management,
reporting and attention to non-routine M&E were also weak. Subsequently, following
government’s request for assistance in1999, UNDP technical assistance improved the
performance the PIU substantially. Procurement was initially fraught with difficulties
and government disbanded the PIU following corruption allegations; several PIU staff
were jailed in addition to some in the responsible Ministry of Economy. While the
consequent delays adversely affected implementation, government’s actions improved
governance and accountability, and the project was successfully concluded.

2.104 Implementing Agencies performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
The regional water utilities that implemented the project demonstrated a high degree of
commitment and technical competence and all the desired utility outputs were
achieved, and most of the outcomes, albeit with delays as a result of government
procurement problems. However, the financial management of the two urban water
utilities’ accounting and internal control systems remained unsatisfactory throughout
implementation. This is despite the financial management action plan developed as part
of institutional strengthening inputs.

2.105 Overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. 25

	                                                      	




																																																								
24. The PIU was operated by government staff and was effectively a part of government:
therefore, the Government performance rating embraces the PIU.
25. According to the OPCS/IEG Harmonized Evaluation Criteria if one rating is in the
satisfactory range and the other in the unsatisfactory range, the outcome rating determines
which one applies to overall performance.

 3. Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
3.1     The project was expected to benefit 650,000 people living in the cities of
Bukhara and Samarkand located in central Uzbekistan on the former Silk Road between
China and Europe. Bukhara and Samarkand have been among the main centers of
world civilization from their early days in 6th century BC and, more recently, for being
Islamic centers for scholarly study. The cities have carefully preserved their unique
architecture and traditions; both are on the UNESCO World Heritage List and they are
important tourism centers.

3.2    Topographically, the cities pose different challenges for water supply systems.
Bukhara is located across a former dried-up and drained wetland and lake in the River
Zeravshan valley and has only modest (20 m) topographic variation. In contrast,
Samarkand, some 230 km upstream, is built across a number of tributaries that have
considerable topographic variation (100+ m). Both cities are in competition for scarce
and distant water resources, and operational costs are greatly increased by the need to
maintain and operate large diameter pipeline water import systems, particularly
Bukhara.

3.3      At appraisal, piped water supply systems, serving 260,000 people in Bukhara
and 390,000 people in Samarkand, were facing a rapid deterioration of quality and
reliability of their services. Major problems included deferred O&M that was causing
accelerating deterioration of the water supply and distribution systems, high
unaccounted-for-water, and energy and institutional inefficiencies.

3.4     It was expected that the project would bring about noticeable improvements in
the quality, reliability, efficiency and sustainability of water services. A particular aim
was to utilize private sector participation to introduce quickly commercial operating
principles and modern management approaches.

Objectives
3.5     The Project Appraisal Document stated that the project’s development
objectives were:
        “to improve the safety, quality, reliability, efficiency, financial viability and
        sustainability of the water supply services in Bukhara and Samarkand.

3.6    The Development Credit Agreement (Schedule 2) gave a more precise
description of the objectives:
       “to (a) rehabilitate and improve the efficiency of existing water supply facilities
       and infrastructure in Bukhara and Samarkand; (b) strengthen the institutional
       capacity of BVK and SVK; and (c) strengthen BVK’s and SVK’s financial
       capacity through improved financial management and commercial practices.”

3.7     This Assessment uses the Development Credit Agreement’s objectives.
                                                 30


COMPONENTS AND COSTS 

3.8      The development objectives were to be achieved through: (a) strategic
rehabilitation and efficiency improvement of existing facilities in critical condition; (b)
institutional strengthening of the Bukhara and Samarkand Water Utilities (Bukhara City
Vodokanal - BVK and Samarkand City Vodokanal - SVK) through a performance-
based management contract with an internationally experienced water utility operator
(the Operator); and (c) strengthening of the financial capacity of the two urban water
utilities through improved financial management and commercial practices. Table 9
gives the component details and costs.

Table 9: Project Components and Costs
Investment Fund. Planned cost: US$46.88 million; Actual cost US$49.19 million.
         This component financed essential short-term expenditures (such as materials,
         equipment, vehicles) and a least-cost capital investment program (including associated
         engineering and construction supervision services) aimed at improving the operations of
         the water supply system and the services to the population by achieving the performance
         improvement targets in the service contract. The Operator, together with BVK and SVK
         staff, was to propose the investments that are required to optimally re-structure and
         rehabilitate key components of the systems (such as sections of the water distribution
         networks and block distribution systems, specific components of the treatment plants,
         pumping stations), implement a demand management program, and set up financial
         management, accounting and commercial systems.
2. Service Contract. Planned cost: US$5.20 million; Actual cost US$2.14 million.
        This component financed the costs related to the Service Contract. These costs included a
        base fee and a performance-based fee to be paid to the private Operator based on
        achievement of targets defined in the contract. The Operator was to have full
        responsibility for managing the investment program, operating the water supply system,
        and developing and implementing the demand management program and the commercial
        (billing and collection) and financial management departments.
3. Consulting Services and Project Coordination Unit (PCU). Planned cost: US$1.05 million;
actual cost US$5.64 million.
        This component financed: (a) PCU operations (including salaries, incremental operating
        expenditures, travel, training, and related expenses) with skilled staff to facilitate project
        implementation, coordinate project activities between the private operator, the
        Municipalities of Samarkand and Bukhara, and other government agencies, in addition to
        supervising the private operator's performance; and (b) project-related consulting
        assignments on technical, legal, and financial aspects.
4. Swiss-Financed Component. Planned cost: US$9 million; Revised cost: US$11.23 million;
Actual cost US$10 million).
        The Government of Switzerland provided a US$9.0 million grant to provide parallel
        financing to the World Bank-financed project. This grant financed two activities. First,
        an investment fund (goods and services of Swiss origin) with uses to be determined in
        parallel to those of the Investment Fund under Project Component 1. Second, it also
        financed independent technical and financial auditors that would monitor the Operator's
        performance and prepare the financial project and water utility audits, as well as
        complementary consulting services to support the PCU.
                                            31


PROJECT FINANCING 

3.9     The Bank provided an IBRD Loan of US$20.00 million and an IDA Credit of
SDR 15.90 million equivalent to US$20.00 million. The Swiss Development
Corporation provided as parallel financing the equivalent of a US$9.00 million grant.
By project closing exchange variations had increased the IDA Credit to US$25.32
million. Similarly, the Swiss grant for equipment had increased to US$11.23 million
and its closing date was extended to December 5, 2010. Total Bank disbursements
amounted to US$43.80 million and US$0.27 million of the Credit was cancelled at
closing.

3.10 At appraisal the Borrower agreed to contribute US$13.33 million, in practice
this was reduced to US$8.00 million. In 2003, BVK’s and SVK’s contribution of
US$5.33 million was omitted due to inability to pay. Eventually, however, SVK
contributed US$5.33 million or 42 percent of the amount originally agreed.

3.11 According to the government, the total project costs in Bukhara was US$21.82
million plus a Swiss Grant of US$2.30 million. In Samarkand the total project cost was
US$28.03 million plus a Swiss grant of US$6.25 million. The larger allocation of the
Swiss Grant to Samarkand was because of its greater need for new pumping equipment.

Relevance
OBJECTIVES 

3.12 The relevance of Project objective is substantial. They were highly relevant
to the technical and managerial challenges of reversing the rapidly deteriorating water
and sanitation services in Uzbekistan in the decade since independence. At
independence infrastructure and centrally supported services were well developed. But
in the ensuing decade, highly inefficient operations, poor service levels, creeping
disrepair of facilities, financial shortfalls, weak human resource and institutional
capacity, lack of adequate information, and local scarcity of water resources threatened
service provision and public health.

3.13 Project objectives remain relevant to the government’s own strategies for the
urban water supply sector (paras 2.13 and 2.14) and the Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategies at appraisal and currently (para 2.15). The project was also aligned with a
strategic government objective to develop Bukhara and Samarkand into international
tourist destinations.

DESIGN 

3.14 Design relevance was modest. The project was designed to change the
government's role in infrastructure development and public service provision in these
two cities, accompanied by greater autonomy and decentralization of the management
of services. The critical problem to be addressed was to improve the capacity of the
water utilities so that they could manage the water system more efficiently, and induce
people to pay their water bills by providing a reliable service of good quality water.
                                                           32


3.15 If water tariffs were adequate to cover costs, and collection of billings was
efficient, it was expected that the utilities would generate enough income to cover
operational and maintenance costs and provide a surplus to invest for longer-term
replacement investment, thus ensuring system sustainability. A key aim was to improve
institutional capacity quickly and at the same time improve water supplies. Given the
substantial weaknesses of the utilities in areas other than supply management, and their
lack of knowledge of commercial practices and Bank procurement, project design
adopted a four-track approach:
    1. Support the first steps of an institutional reform under which BVK and SVK
         would be able to carry out their responsibilities in accordance with their original
         charters as autonomous municipal enterprises, following commercial principles,
         and with greater technical and financial efficiency and improved customer-
         orientation;
    2. Use a Private Operator to manage key parts of the BVK's and SVK's operation
         through a Service Contract with the aim of initiating the reform of the operating
         practices and the improving managerial and technical capacity of BVK and
         SVK;
    3. Implement a financial recovery plan with a view to have BVK and SVK
         collect sufficient revenues to cover their operational costs, to ensure a basic
         level of maintenance of their assets at the end of the project and service their
         debt; and
    4. Change the criteria and approach used to select investments in the water and
         sanitation sector. This aimed to broaden the focus from only capacity
         expansions to include support for adequate maintenance, improvements in
         operational efficiency, and reduction of wastage.

3.16 The Operator was to have responsibility for management, operation and
maintenance of the water supply system in the service area and the commercial
operations and financial management of BVK and SVK, including their staff, as
specified in the service and incentive appendices of the contract. The Operator’s
Service Contract included also the authority to recommend hiring and firing of
employees. The Operator was expected also to procure, on behalf of BVK and SVK
and with their involvement, goods, works and services in accordance with Bank's
Procurement Guidelines and to support these clients in contract signature.

3.17 Although this design was substantially relevant and logical, it made unrealistic
assumptions about the availability of baseline data, the institutional setting and local
buy-in. Specifically, design underestimated the importance of a learning partnership
approach in favor of an externally imposed one, and did not included means to change
local perspectives, such as twinning and working in sister utilities in Europe or
elsewhere. This was based on the appraisal view: “At present BVK's and SVK's very
weak managerial and technical capacity prevents the companies from addressing even
the most urgent operational problems and would not allow them to implement the
project.”26

                                              33


3.18 The local technical and financial information available on the water supply
system and its operating condition was poor and proved to be an inadequate basis for a
results-based Service Contact. Subsequently, and long after the award of the service
contract, the state of pumping systems was very thoroughly appraised under the Bank’s
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program in 2005.27

3.19 Appraisal of the utilities’ institutional base and staffing was weak, and targets
set at launch were too ambitious and lacked knowledge of the sector. In particular, a
sound baseline against which to judge the Operator's performance and financial
remuneration was not available at the start of the project - and measuring incremental
performance of the Operator proved to be a significant problem during implementation.

3.20 Finally, while financial autonomy of the water utilities was essential for the
achievement of objectives, there were no components or conditionality in the project to
ensure that central government was made aware of the importance of this concept.
Instead it was delegated to the Regional Governments who lacked the ultimate
authority for its implementation.

Monitoring and Evaluation
3.21 Design: There were only partial baseline data and even they needed correction
during implementation as better knowledge emerged. A monitoring framework was in
place at the start of the project, and was rated by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group
as moderately unsatisfactory. Its design proved ineffective in terms of indicator
availability and measurability, and there were several reported problems, including
flaws in the indicators covering (1) safety and quality, (2) reliability, (3) efficiency, and
(4) financial viability. The methodology for each indicator was not clearly identified or
defined and the project results framework was not linked to the Borrower’s M&E. The
M&E design relied entirely on one entity, the Operator, for implementation, a move
that proved problematic when the Operator left the project prematurely.

3.22 Implementation of M&E: Delays meant that the Operator was not in place to
initiate measurement until more than two years after approval, which undermined and
delayed M&E. The Borrower’s own M&E framework was largely missing, and M&E
was only partially embraced by the VKs, as some indicators were not typically
documented in Uzbekistan’s water sector and exceeded the VK/PIU capacity to monitor
them effectively. After the service contract termination, the VK/PIU entrusted M&E
reporting to consultants, who were not fully integrated in VK operations. As part of
supervision also, the Bank and the Client agreed to revise some Key Project Indicator
definitions, as well as some target values deemed too ambitious. Key performance
indicators were audited four times out of the originally planned eight. No final key
performance indicator audit was undertaken at closing. Key performance indicator
definitions and indicator reporting quality suffered unexplained trends and anomalies,
and measurement and data harmonization flaws. Beneficiary surveys were not
incorporated for assessment during implementation. However, at the end of the project

impact assessment studies were undertaken. This sampled 120 households in Bukhara
and 175 in Samarkand split between ‘with’ and ‘without’ project areas.

3.23 Utilization of M&E. Systematic use of the incomplete and unreliable data
produced by the M&E was overshadowed by the chronic project management problems
and changing demands from the Bank.28 These issues are discussed below.

Implementation
3.24 The project was approved in March 19, 2002 and came into effect in January
2003. The Credit closing date was extended twice for a total of 38 months and closed in
June 2010.29

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS  

3.25 At appraisal the Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics had the lead role in
the reform of the water supply sector. Oversight and coordination of the project at the
national level was to be the responsibility of a Project Coordinating Committee that was
headed by the Ministry. The Committee included key representatives from relevant
central government agencies and provincial and local governments. The Ministry had
not formed the Committee when government decided to shift project responsibility to
the Public Utilities Agency, effective from January 2003.

3.26 A Project Coordination Unit, reporting to the Committee, had day-to-day
responsibility for overseeing and implementing the Operator’s service contract and
coordination with the two municipalities, their water utilities and other service
providers, and M&E.

3.27 BVK and SVK operate as legally separate government-owned enterprises and
their operations are overseen by the Khokimiyat. The Khokimiyat is an executive body
of state power at the level of oblasts, raions and towns of the republic, and is headed by
a Khokim (Governor) who ensures implementation of acts of legislation including those
related to provision of water supply and sewerage. The VKs, in turn, were the
contracting party for the private sector Operator. It was expected that the Operator
would manage the water supply services of both utilities under a four-year
performance-based Service Contract.

  . The ICR reports (page 10): "WB supervision of the project M&E was questionable since no
specialist was part of the project team over the eight-year period of implementation, which
made it difficult to audit or monitor information received from the technical auditor and the
PCU/PIU/BVK/SVK. As a result, project M&E could not comprehensively, accurately, and
effectively report on the KPI results."
29
  . The first extension was in 2007 for 25 months to June 30, 2009, and second for 13 months
in May 2009.

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE 

3.28 Project implementation departed significantly from that planned and went
through three phases.

3.29 In the first two-year phase, the Public Utilities Agency’s limited prior
experience in handling World Bank projects and lack of capacity on procurement and
contracting slowed award of the Operator’s contract. The Service Contract that took 16
months to come to closure was awarded in February 2004.30 However, before it could
be signed, a Court Order made in May 2004 seriously undercut the water utility’s
autonomy and ability to finance their operations, including the Service Contract.

3.30 The Court Order blocked 80 percent of the revenues of SVK and 75 percent of
BVK's revenues for the period 2003-2006 in order to pay backlogs of taxes, energy and
other liabilities following an independent Economic Court decision in 2003. Obviously
this block on revenues significantly curtailed the sound operation of the utilities and
compounded the difficulty that Uzbek counterparts had in working with the Operator.
The lack of adequate revenues caused the VKs to cease paying salaries and provide
counterpart funding. These actions, in turn, led to a depletion of stocks to sustain
operations and throttled technology transfer and capacity-building.

3.31 In the second phase a Service Contact was signed and implemented for three
years from June 2004, rather than the four years planned. After appointment, the
Operator found that the lengthy registration and review of import contracts, which
delayed work commencement by three to six months after the contract award, was not
mitigated by Committee interventions. The Operator performance was harmed by the
high turn-over of international staff which contributed to delays in meeting the terms of
the Service Contract, as did lack of baseline information, clients’ unwillingness to share
some information, difficulties in collecting billings as a result of the Court Order and
resultant inadequate cash flows to pay creditors. In addition there were continuous
management changes in the VKs, poor oversight of technical design and works, all of
which led to growing distrust and miscommunication between the Operator and Uzbek
counterparts. While a Presidential Decree led to the unblocking of SVK’s accounts in
August 2006, and BVK’s accounts in February 2007, this was too late to undo the
damages done to the relationship between the utilities and the Operator, and latter’s
ability to perform satisfactorily. The Service Contract was not extended or renewed.

3.32 With the exit of the Operator in June 2007 and the first extension of the closing
date, the VKs’ operations were focused on implementation of the infrastructure
component, not institutions and capacity-building. The second project extension of 13
months enabled the implementing agencies to complete the infrastructure component
that required an acceleration of civil works in the last three months.


																																																								
30
  . The Service Contract was originally signed in December 2002 but was cancelled when the
original Operator’s consortium lost a key member and failed to meet pre-qualification
requirements. The under-bidder was too expensive and it was retendered.
                                              36


Safeguards and Fiduciary
3.33 Environmental issues: The project was classified as a Category B based under
OP 4.01: Environmental Assessment.31 An Environmental Management Plan was
prepared and approved at appraisal. Environmental Safeguard monitoring was instituted
as part of the service contract. Compliance with environmental safeguards was
supervised only twice by a Bank specialist during the eight years of implementation.
After departure of the Operator, Bank supervision downgraded the rating for the
Environmental Safeguards from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory until project
closing. Main issues were management of waste and debris; exercise of appropriate
safety measures; fencing/securing of construction sites; and provision of essential
safety equipment for workers. Due to the Bank team’s supervisory insistence, by
project closing improvements in contractor compliance with the EMP were noted,
particularly regarding the occupational health and safety of workers.

3.34 Social issues: A social assessment was undertaken as part of project
preparation. The findings contributed to project design but were not adopted fully
during implementation. Recommendations from a 2007 independent social beneficiary
assessment for the project were also not integrated in implementation.

3.35 Financial management issues: Financial management arrangements were
inadequate and internal control systems were weak. Staff were too few and poorly
trained. There was poor and non-transparent documentation of contractual work
expenditures. Reconciliation of project accounting records with Statements of
Expenditures and Expenses was frequently unacceptable to the Bank. Project and VK
external audit reports for financial years 2009, 2010 and 2011 were qualified and Bank
management letters consistently reported significant weaknesses in accounting and
internal control systems.

3.36 Procurement. Procurement was generally problematic. In early 2010 an
Independent Procurement Review of Bank projects in Uzbekistan assessed a few
project contracts as part of a sample spanning several sectors of Bank intervention. Its
findings indicated poor governance and transparency for the PCU, PIUs and VKs. The
most egregious findings were extensive and unjustified use of the Small Works
procedure that deviated from the legal agreement, procurement packages that were
improperly managed by splitting contracts without justification, and confidentiality
issues and conflict of interest among technical evaluation and tendering committee
members. Filing or availability of procurement documents was found to be weak.

Achievement of the Objectives
Objective	1:	Rehabilitate and improve the efficiency of existing water supply
facilities and infrastructure in Bukhara and Samarkand

3.37 This achievement of this objective is substantial. This objective focused on
two aspects of water supply efficiency: engineering and financial accountability.
																																																								
31
  . At appraisal invocation of OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways was considered but
rejected as water withdrawal from the Amu Darya River would not be increased.
                                                                   37


Engineering measures aimed to cut unaccounted-for-water (UfW) 32 by reducing water
losses caused by leakage and wastage improvements; to reduce energy use per unit of
water produced, treated and pumped; and to improve reliability of water supply and its
quality. Financial accountability aimed to reduce the administrative portion of UfW
through metering; updating and maintaining a register of all consumers; identifying and
stopping unauthorized water diversion and uses, and improving water management
accounting and billing systems. Only physical improvements are assessed under this
objective, managerial and accounting achievements are assessed under objective 2.

Outputs

3.38 Rehabilitation of existing water distribution facilities in critical condition was
fully accomplished. Worn out networks were replaced. Pipeline rehabilitation and
replacement focused on the primary and secondary water distribution networks.

3.39 The Swiss grant financed drainage pumps, water meters, welding units, and
valves in Bukhara, and energy-efficiency services, water meters, switchboards, and
pumps in Samarkand. The grant also supplied independent technical and financial audit
services. This component was well-managed and well-supervised, contributing
successfully to the rehabilitation of facilities, Figure 7.

leakage and administrative losses (illegal connections, tampered meters, non-billing). UfW is
generally expressed as a percentage of the total water produced, but also in volume loss per km
of pipeline, or volume loss per connection.

project completion the system served 120,000 people, many benefitting from the
reconstruction of the Shokhrud water treatment plant after two horizontal sedimentation
tanks and a semi-automatic filtering plant with capacity of 100,000 m³ per day were
installed. An automatic Chlorine electrolysis plant enabled water treatment to potable
standards. The number of water connections increased from 56,891 in 2006 to 60,359
in 2010. The number of new meters installed is not known.

3.41 Samarkand. The target of replacing 130 km of worn-out water mains in 147
streets was met and 22 wells, a water-balancing reservoir and replacement of electro-
mechanical pumping plant were completed. This then served 392,000 people. Water
quality improvement included upgraded testing laboratories and renewing chlorination
supplies. The number of water connections increased from 92,657 in 2006 to 102,528
in 2010, and 48,312 water meters and 30 electrical energy meters were installed.

Outcomes

3.42 Reducing Unaccounted-for-Water. In 2002 the annual volume of water
produced was found to be about 100 million m3 per year in Samarkand and 71 million
m3 per year in Bukhara (or about 850 and 660 lpcd). Water networks suffer from
excessive leakage and non-domestic use because of the large number of detached
houses with gardens, particularly in Samarkand. The annual volume of total water loss
was:
 Samarkand was about 48 million m3 per year or 48% (37% of network losses and
   11% of apartment plumbing losses);
 Bukhara was about 28 million m3 per year or about 39% (26% from network losses
   and 13% from apartment plumbing losses).

3.43 Current data show that while the number of water connections increased, the
total volume of water production decreased in both utilities, and continued to do so
after project completion, as did absolute water losses, Table 10.

3.44 The targets for reducing UfW were met. In Bukhara the baseline for UfW
was 39 percent and the volumetric target value of 30 percent was achieved before 2006
- but it has remained about 29 percent since then. The Samarkand baseline was 48
percent and, while the 2010 target of 35 percent was only just missed, the target was
achieved the year after and water losses continue to decline. Utility staff in Samarkand
explained that most of the 28 percent is physical losses (24-25 percent), the balance of
about 2 percent being administrative. In both utilities, much longer and more numerous
tertiary pipes and household links accounted for most of the leaks. And in Bukhara
water losses by the district hot water company’s water softening and distribution
systems accounted for about 20 percent of its water use.

3.45 The number of water connections has increased by about 7 percent in both
cities, mostly by registering former illegal users and some as a result of system
expansion to new users. Before the project, water supply coverage in urban areas was
98 percent in Bukhara and 100 percent in Samarkand and reduced water loss per
connection –30 percent in Bukhara and 73 percent in Samarkand – is a good indicator
of the effectiveness of system rehabilitation and greater accountability.

3.46 Reliability of water supply and its quality improved. Before the project,
reliability of supplies was 87 percent in Bukhara and only 48 percent in Samarkand.
The main reasons were decayed water distribution systems and defective pumps, and
low pressure caused by unmetered users leaving water running for irrigation purposes
in the summer. The number of hours of daily supply is not reported by the VKs. The
ICR’s impact survey of project beneficiaries found that water supplies to both cities
were almost 100 percent reliable in 2010.33 In 2014 Bukhara VK had a 24/7 supply but
some beneficiaries in Samarkand reported unverifiable disruptions.

3.47 Water quality. In Bukhara in 2005, only 70 percent of water samples met
quality standards. By April 2007, 100 percent of samples met the quality standard.
Between then and 2010 it varied between 96.0 and 90.5 percent. At project closing that
target was 95 percent. In Samarkand in 2005 only 80 percent of water samples met
quality standards. By April 2007 this had risen to 97.8 percent. Between then and 2010
it varied between 98.8 and 99.9 percent. At project closing it had met the target of 100
percent. The SES in Bukhara reported that tested water samples there had better quality
than national standards in 2014; there was no updated report for Samarkand.

3.48 Energy use and efficiency outcomes are mixed. While energy use by
Samarkand VK declined significantly since 2007 and continues to do so, in Bukhara it
declined until 2009 after which it has gradually increased (Table 11).

3.49 The appraisal expectation was that there would be a 20 percent reduction in
energy use in Samarkand and a 15 percent reduction in Bukhara. However, the
baseline was not specified. Even so, over the period 2007-2013 the overall energy use

 . The ICR cautions: "Survey results were, however, received late in the ICR process and
certain data anomalies could not be fully reconciled.”

in Samarkand was reduced by 31 percent. In Bukhara the reduction 2007-2009 was 21
percent but over the period 2007-2013 the net reduction was only 4 percent.

There were no reliable energy data before 2007.

3.50 In both utilities energy efficiency did not improve. The ESMAP (2005) study
calculated that over 95% of all of the energy use is related to the pumping plant, and
other energy uses and inefficiencies are relatively minor. Indeed, the biggest problem
faced by the utilities is the large number of Soviet-era pumps still in operation – for
example some 130 in Samarkand where declines in energy efficiency have been
greatest.

3.51 Importantly, ESMAP found that at energy tariffs prevalent in 2005, with the
exception of the refurbishment of the pumps at Ku Mazar, none of the other pump
investments could be justified financially on the basis of improving energy efficiency
(Table 12). Given the dire financial straits of the utilities before and during
implementation, the ESMAP findings underscore the lack of realism when setting the
project’s energy targets at appraisal.

3.52 A small number of pumping units were replaced, some with frequency invertors
and remote control valves.34 Individual plants so renovated have shown much improved
energy efficiency – up to 50 percent energy saving was reported in Samarkand. At the
Shorud WTP, new pumps allied with filter redesign, reduced energy use per unit of
water treated by 30 percent. At the Bukhara’s Charkin well field, replacement of old
pumps with Grundfoss pumps reduced energy use by 70 percent.




																																																								
34
  . The head and discharge of old pumps is controlled by valves that waste energy. Frequency
invertors control the pumps by regulating their power supply and speed and thus save energy.
Automated valves in the distribution system save energy by being able to respond to pressure
changes remotely and avoid pipe blowouts (caused by slow manual response); energy invested
in water is thus not wasted. Remote regulation of water flows saves a lot of manual labor too –
at Bulhara’s Shorud WT plant 25 people now do the work of the former 96 staff.

Objective 2: Strengthen the institutional capacity of BVK and SVK

3.53         The achievement of this objective is substantial.

3.54 Some of the institutional outcomes assessed in this report may not be fully
attributable to the project because of ongoing institutional support and capacity-
building by two follow-on Bank-financed projects.35 Even so, the water supply project
initiated substantial improvements that have been sustained and built upon.

Outputs

3.55 Despite difficulties over the Service Contract, the knowledge and experience of
the Operator established modern engineering and financial management systems in
both utilities, and these accomplishments were effectively utilized by the utilities.
While state-of-the-art Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA)
were planned in 2008, their installation and commissioning was not yet complete in
late-2014.

3.56 Leak detection units equipped with ultrasonic equipment were established.
Departments for water billing, inspection and enforcement were trained and upgraded.
Registers for all consumers were updated and linked to GIS network management and
maintenance systems installed by the project. A formal complaints system operating
through Community Center and Housing Association chairpersons was activated in
parallel to increasing rates of meter installation and water use monitoring. The Swiss
Grant installed a test facility for meter calibration and it started issuing meter
certificates in October 2014.

  . The Bukhara and Samarkand Sewerage Project (P112719) for US$ 66 million was appraised
and approved in 2009 and it included modest support for upgrading institutional capacity of the
two utilities. The Alat and Karakul Water Supply Project (P118197), appraised in 2012 for
US$113 million, is being implemented by Bukhara VK and aims to expand the VK to include
the two towns
                                                           42


3.57 A community-based urban water conservation pilot project for Bukhara and
Samarkand, initiated in 2005, was successfully implemented in collaboration with
Housing Owners’ Associations for selected low-income apartment buildings.

Outcomes

3.58 The most easily identifiable outcomes of improved institutions were the rapid
increases in metering, identifying and stopping unauthorized water diversion and uses,
and increasing rates of bill collection. These outcomes were the result of the Operator’s
modernization of engineering and financial management systems that were
mainstreamed before their departure in 2007. Local efforts by BVK and SVR to
improve metering and revenue collection continued after project closure.
Government’s consistent improvement of sector policies raised expectations of utilities’
performance as well their ability to increase revenues (Box 1.)

Box 2: Institutional Improvements increased accountability for water use
Metering and bill payment was increased through administrative measures and changing staff
incentives. At appraisal, the VK’s had block-metering agreements for volumetric use with
House Owners’ Associations and most large non-domestic consumers.
Staff incentives improved. The first reform introduced was to provide incentives for meter-
readers to improve monitoring and collections. Salaries of operators and inspectors in 2006-07
was Sum 35,000 a month and by 2014 salaries were Sum 2.5 to 3.0 million a month; corruption
and collusion with customers has been reportedly eliminated.
Legislation provided strong incentives to meter domestic water use. The second reform in
2009 was the termination of all block metering agreements and making individual households
responsible for water bills. Under a recent government order, customers are responsible also for
installing meters and the cost of recalibrating meters.36 Each customer’s meter is registered and
meter status is listed in the database. And in 2013, a government order set the consumption
norm for unmetered household connections to be 50 percent more than the flat rate metered
norm. An additional surcharge is applied if the household has irrigated a garden or has livestock
or vehicles. Together these measures provided a strong financial incentive to become metered.
A good example of the project impact on consumer behavior is the Shaifulalam apartment
complex in Bukhara which houses 504 people in 214 apartments in 24 blocks. A major problem
was irregular water supply and insufficient pressure to service the upper floors. Metering
started in 2007 when the Housing Association facilitated pilot metering of the first two blocks
accounting for 8 percent of households. According to utility Inspector Mrs. Garurova Zulhumor
the high financial penalties for not being metered has increased metering in 2014 to 85-90
percent of the whole apartment complex, the shortfall being empty or vacant apartments. A
major impact of metering was to induce repair to interior plumbing, particularly valves in WCs,
and dripping faucets. The aggregate impact of metering on the supply system is a 24/7 supply
and enough pressure to service all floors most of the year – but sometimes in summer supply
cannot meet demand due to home irrigation diversions.

Sum 7,000 (US$2.80.)
                                                   43


Metering reduced household costs. In 2014 the flat rate bill for a family of three was about
Sum 200,000 per household per year (US$ 80) for a norm of 300 lcd. The 2013 decree would
have increased this to almost Sum 300,000 a year (US$120). The Palatova family of three, for
example, after opting for metering, reduced annual billed water consumption in 2013 to 100 m3
(91 lcd) and paid, in advance, Sum 70,000 (US$ 28) - a fifth of what they would have paid.
Thus the family cost was 30 percent of the old, or only 20 percent of the new (2013), unmetered
norm.
Billing systems and enforcement were improved. Inspectors visit households to ensure bill
payment and in Bukhara the billing system can send bill reminders by telephone. Payments can
be made electronically by credit card, at the VKs office or to the Inspectors at the household.
There is also a facility to debit the worker’s wage packet at their place of work.
The penalty for non-payment of domestic water bills is rigorous. Following a year of non-
payment the VK is authorized to submit a claim to court after10 days, and the court generally
issues a warrant for seizure of property to pay the debt. Special circumstances like illness are
taken into account and sometimes the community comes to the rescue.
Source: IEG field interviews, October 2014. In Bukhara the water bill includes a sewerage charge; there
is no sewerage in Samarkand.

3.59 Prior to appraisal, none of the two water systems had bulk meters, though
Samarkand had installed bulk meters in 2002. Consumers, households, industry and
public agencies were not accustomed to water conservation, water tariffs were
extremely low and heavily cross-subsidized by commerce and industry, and all
consumers wasted significant amounts of water. Most public institutions, industrial
firms and commercial customers were supposed to have meters, but poor maintenance
and repair had jeopardized accuracy and reliability. By 2014 it was reported that all
non-domestic consumers were reliably metered.

3.60 At appraisal very few households were metered - only 2 percent of the total
number of customers in Samarkand and 4 percent of those in Bukhara. By the end of
2013, in response to changing incentives, metering of domestic use had increased
significantly to include three-quarters of all households in Bukhara and slightly under
half of all households in Samarkand. This allied with the leak prevention, better
inspection and financial incentives, increased administrative accountability and the
collection of water bills, particularly for Samarkand as illustrated in Figure 8.

3.61 The differences between the two VKs were substantial in 2006 but narrowed by
the end of the project, and continued to do so thereafter. Samarkand shows the greatest
incremental improvement and by 2013 it was on a par with Bukhara in terms of the
collected billings ratio for domestic and budget consumers.

 Source: IEG 2015 based on financial data provided by the Bukhara and Samarkand VKs in 2014. Bukhara bills
 includes water and sewerage; there is no sewerage in Samarkand. Ratios more than 100% indicate payment of
 billing backlogs from earlier years.




3.62 The major difference is in securing repayment of bills from ‘service water’
users in Bukhara and ‘commerce and industrial’ users in Samarkand. Bukhara’s bulk
sales of untreated ‘service water’ to the towns of Mubarek and Kagan accounted for 47
percent of water sales in 2013 and, as Figure 8 shows, there is typically a period of
reduced payment alleviated by periodic payments (courtesy of the central government)
that clears the backlog. Even so, this is clearly a major institutional problem given that
the supplies for public use and small state industries cannot be cut off. Thus the VK’s
leverage is small no matter how efficient their billing and collection system has
become.

3.63 The situation in Samarkand is worse in that ‘commerce and industry’ – mainly
public sector district heating and district hot water utilities that accounted for 21 percent
of water sales – show a long-term downward trend in repayments. While these debts are
relieved periodically by central government, it does not clear the backlog and leaves
Samarkand VK in the same position regarding leverage as Bukhara.

3.64 The largest institutional shortfall, despite the notable progress on progressive
regulation of water metering and water tariffs by the central government, is the lack of
progress towards financial autonomy of the VKs . This aspect was neither in the project
objectives nor the Loan/Credit conditions. Thus the apparent institutional shortcoming
on securing payment for water from a substantial share of protected public sector
consumers is not possible without central government support, and is not shortcoming
of water utility management.

Objective 3: Strengthen BVK’s and SVK’s financial capacity through improved
financial management and commercial practices

Outputs

3.65 The achievement of this objective is substantial. The project (through the
Operator) introduced improved financial and commercial practices that strengthen the
financial capacity of each VK. It is clear from the sustained results (after departure of
the Operator) that modern financial management principles and good record-keeping
were established. During IEG’s mission, for example, VK staff were able to produce a
whole range of up-to-date detailed records on demand. How reliable these data are is
uncertain (see para 3.35).While the VKs strengthened their financial capacity this is
within the continuing constraints imposed by central government policy.

Outcomes

3.66 On the basis of forgoing discussion it is clear that both VKs substantially
achieved four of the five measures intended to improve their financial capacity:37
   o Aggressive reduction of system inefficiencies (water losses, energy
       inefficiency, low revenue collection, and water wastage) to reduce costs of
       operations;
   o Implementation of a commercial strategy aimed at eliminating unregistered
       connections and users, and building trust in the community through better
       water supply and customer service;
   o A strategic and cost-effective metering policy linked with a customer relations
       plan to increase revenues and reducing wastage; and
    o Establishing financial management, accounting, and commercial systems and
       procedures that provide indispensable information about costs, revenues, and
       customers, and allow BVK and SVK to make better policy and tariff
       recommendations to the Government and implement effective commercial
       actions.

3.67 The fifth enabling measure was only partially completed:
    o Collection of better information on the fixed assets and current operational
      situation of the water supply system. This was an essential first step to realistic
      assessment of the maintenance and rehabilitation needs, and to making informed
      recommendations in the tariff reviews during project implementation.

3.68 The current information on the operational state of the water supply system is
excellent with extensive GIS locational data linked to data bases showing inventory and
working status. These systems are used to plan and schedule repairs and upgrades in a
cost-effective and timely way. While there is readily available information about the
physical assets of each utility there does not appear to be matching information about

                                                46


the value of each fixed asset and thus the amount of depreciation investment required to
keep the systems running.

Outcomes

3.69 BVK’s and SVK’s financial capacity was strengthened through greater
accountability and increased water tariffs, both of which led to increased incomes and
improved financial capacity. Achievements for each VK are assessed separately below.

Bukhara

3.70 Water tariffs and revenues increased substantially during the project and after
project completion, and this lead to rapidly increasing income, Figure 9.

Figure 9: Bukhara - Tariffs, Income and Operational Expenditure




 Source: IEG 2015 based on financial data provided by BukharaVK in 2014.


3.71 Although revenues from water sales grew very rapidly, particularly after 2010,
the growth in operational costs was almost equally rapid and the utility could not cover
its costs. However, there does appear to be convergence between income from water
sales and expenditure in the last three years. Only when other utility income and a
government subsidy (that started in 2009) are included does the utility cover its basic
operating costs. This is not the case, however, when other financing costs and the
servicing the World Bank debt are taken into account.

3.72 In 2010 water revenue with subsidies was Sum 9 billion, and all expenses
including financing costs (but without the Bank debt) were Sum11.8 billion. Adding the
World Bank debt increased expenditures to Sum 12.3 billion or a third more than
                                                47


income. The situation in 2013 was worse, as total income was Sum 16 billion and total
expenditures Sum 27 billion. While this shortfall in income could be potentially
alleviated by collecting outstanding water debts, in 2013 accounts receivable were Sum
4.2 billion and current liabilities Sum 6.5 billion. Unless revenue can be increased
through higher water tariffs and costs reduced, the debt of the VK will continue to
increase.

3.73 Bukhara VK is well aware of these problems and has various means to address
the problem. One of the most critical is that the ‘service water’ tariff is extremely low –
half the domestic rate and one fifth the rate of budget organizations – even though it
currently accounts for 47 percent of water sales. If all this water were sold at the budget
organization tariff it would raise Sum 16 billion and solve the problem. The current
tariff is low because it is sold untreated to the two towns (Mubarek and Kagan) that
provide their own treatment – this despite the more than adequate excess capacity of
Bukhara’s water treatment plant. Such a move requires central government approval
and is indicative of inattention to the economies-of-scale possibilities that could be
derived from integrated planning.

Samarkand

3.74 Samarkand is in a much better financial situation than Bukhara even though
some of its water tariffs are much lower (Figure 10). One of the main reasons is that it
sells 26 percent more water but has very similar operational costs. Revenue collected
has outpaced basic operational costs since 2010 and just about break even when modest
depreciation is included. Unlike Bukhara, Samarkand does not receive a central
government subsidy. Also Samarkand has not borrowed appreciably in foreign
exchange and does not have the heavy accounting charges that Bukhara incurred under
the project and a credit from Spain. Even so, when interest payments and debt are
considered the financing gap is large – in 2013 total revenues were Sum13 billion and
total expenditure including debt servicing was Sum 20 billion.

3.75 The evidence indicates that the VKs have made substantial improvement in
management of operations and revenue collection. However, the VKs' financial
performance remains heavily influenced by Government directives over which they
have no control but which adversely affect their commercial performance. Government
directives govern depreciation policies, foreign exchange losses, and interest on
borrowings. Also, they cannot obtain financial autonomy since they cannot control or
influence some key financial parameters:
     The Central government controls their water supply and sewerage tariffs.
     The VKs must charge for depreciation on fixed, operating assets according to a
        schedule that is considerably faster than the rate of economic and technical
        obsolescence.
     They have experienced considerable losses on their foreign exchange
        borrowings and have no authority to apply mitigation measures.
     Some cost items, such as electric power tariffs, are fixed by the Central
        government and VKs have little authority to renegotiate them. Thus, they are at
        the mercy of accrued costs over which they have little control and incur
        substantial accounting losses without much autonomy to protect themselves.

Efficiency
3.76 Efficiency is rated Modest. A largely speculative cost benefit analysis was
undertaken at appraisal, and the Operator was to collect data and update the analysis.
However this did not occur. Nor was an updated analysis performed after the
Operator’s termination. The estimated financial internal rate of return at appraisal was
18%. No new cost-benefit analysis was undertaken at project closure because of the
flaws in the financial model used at appraisal.

3.77 Administrative efficiency over the life of the project was low. The ministry
finally given responsibility for the project was inexperienced in the water sector and
there were long government delays in awarding the management contract and
procurement. Four years into the five-year project only 14 percent of the Bank
financing had been disbursed and the project had to be extended and this increased
management costs. Delays in civil works and system management meant water losses
continued longer than they should and connecting potential tariff-paying customers was
delayed: both represented lost revenue. Both utilities lost significant income because of
the delay in implementing the water metering program.

Ratings
OUTCOME	

3.78 Project objectives have substantial relevance of objective, but relevance of
design is rated modest. There was substantial achievement of both objectives leading to
a rating of substantial rating for efficacy. Efficiency was modest. The overall outcome
is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
                                            49


RISK	TO	DEVELOPMENT	OUTCOME	

3.79 Overall risks to development outcomes are assessed as Moderate. The
concern at project completion that project benefits may not be sustainable because of a
lack of institutional capacity-building and technical knowledge transfer proved to be
unfounded. Current VK management is competent and forward-looking and is
delivering reliable water services.

3.80 High levels of inflation continue to erode the positive impact of water tariff
increases and this will jeopardize generation of revenues sufficient to ensure sound
maintenance. In consequence, there will be increasing reliability on government
subsidies.

3.81 While government has pressed forward aggressively with raising water tariffs
and tightening the regulations on water metering, the VK’s financial performance is
hindered by lack of autonomy that does not allow them to take a more commercial
stand on utility financing and management. A consequence of this is that utilities’ debts
are increasing and there appears to be inadequate provision for long-term planning,
depreciation and systematic replacement investment.

Bank Performance
3.82 Quality-at-Entry. The Bank was over-ambitious and unrealistic in the context
of weakened sector governance and capacity. There was limited government ownership
to the introduction of a Private Service Contract service contract, and limited market
interest given the commercial risks from potential foreign operators. Local institutional
capability was underestimated and the overall approach was not participatory. Project
design failed to establish a rudimentary indicator baseline before project initiation,
leading to unachievable or unrealistic target values for many the key performance
indicators. Given these risks, a performance-based management contract was
premature. The risk of termination of the service contract/Operator was not assessed
during project design and thus no exit strategy was prepared. Quality-at-entry is rated
Unsatisfactory.

3.83 Supervision. There were eight Task Team leaders in the eight-year life of the
project and this led to inconsistent attention to key issues, lack of consistent quality,
continuity, and internal compliance and delayed responses to requests for “no
objections.” Generally, supervision was not proactive in resolving implementation
problems that were left to fester. As a result there were major shortcomings in
supervision. Attention to assessment of progress, constraints, implementation problems,
and monitoring of key performance indicators was weak. Supervision effectiveness was
also hindered by lack of critical specialist inputs including M&E, institutional
development and engineering. Eventually some inputs did add value (such as the
ESMAP study) but they were too late to be effective.

3.84 The project underwent two Quality of Supervision Assessments (QSA) by the
Quality Assurance Group (QAG), the first in 2004, the second in 2006. Both rated
supervision as Moderately Satisfactory. Following QAG recommendations, both the
                                            50


formal objectives and Key Project Indicators should have been revised as part of a
formal project restructuring when the service contract ended in 2007 ahead of project
closing.While a technical restructuring was agreed with the implementing agencies and
enacted by the government, it was not submitted to the Board.

3.85 The Bank was insufficiently proactive also on discussing/introducing mitigating
measures with government during the period 2003-2006 when the performance of the
Operator was seriously undermined by the Court decision to block access to 80 percent
of revenues. It was only in 2006 that the project was classified as problematic.

3.86 The country-office staff played an invaluable role in ensuring continuity and
responsiveness of supervision and of client relationship. Important day-to-day
supervision support was provided by the Bank team in the last three months of
implementation, facilitating the completion of the critical but lagging contracts for the
Mulyion Reservoir in Samarkand and Shokrud water treatment plant in Bukhara. Under
the circumstances, there was uncommon commitment and skill deployed by supervision
teams but it was too late to make up for earlier problems. Supervision is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

3.87   Overall Bank performance is rated Unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance
3.88 Government Performance. The government lacked consistent implementation
support and proactive responses to problems for the first half of the project. Several
issues within the government's control caused delays in implementation. It transferred
project responsibility from one ministry to another, and the new group had limited prior
experience in handling World Bank projects. The lengthy registration and review of
contracts for imports, which delayed work commencement by three to six months after
the contract award, might have been mitigated by the government but was not. The
government was also weak on ensuring sound sector governance (allowing external
agencies to interfere with project management) and paid inadequate attention to
fiduciary oversight.

3.89 A court decision (not under the direct control or competence of the government)
blocked water and wastewater utility accounts in Samarkand and Bukhara.
Government was slow to mitigate the impact of the court decision on the project and it
was only in 2005 that actions were taken to solve the problem - a process that took
another 19 months to fully resolve.

3.90 More positively, in the second half of the project central government
significantly improved sector policies particularly on water tariffs and revenue a
process that has continued at an ever-increasing rate. Government performance is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

3.91 Implementing Agency Performance. Initiation of the project was delayed by
almost 24 months and the Court Order blocking the revenues of the VKs over the
period 2003-2006 significantly curtailed the sound operation of the utilities. The lack of
                                           51


adequate revenue led to the VKs ceasing to pay salaries and providing counterpart
financing. When the Operator came on board the financially strapped water utilities
could not provide support effective operations impeding technology transfer and
capacity-building. Until 2007 there were continuous management changes in the VKs
and poor oversight of works and technical design, problems accentuated by high
turnover of the Operator's staff that compounded the difficulty that Uzbek counterparts
had in working with the Operator. The feedback from the VKs about this period is that
managerial staff felt they were treated as second-class citizens and that their local
technical knowledge and expertise was bypassed in favor of foreign consultants.

3.92 With the exit of the Operator and repeal of the Court Order, the implementing
agencies demonstrated their new competence and completed the infrastructure
component, including an acceleration of works achieved in the last three months.
Performance since project closure appears to have continued to improve with good
results being delivered. Implementing agency performance is rated moderately
satisfactory.

3.93 Overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory according to the
Harmonized Evaluation Criteria. If one rating is in the satisfactory range and the other
in the unsatisfactory range, overall performance is determined by the outcome rating
which, in this case, is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

4. Lessons Learned
4.1      The key lessons derived, based on the findings of this PPAR, are the following:

     When designing infrastructure and service provision projects within the
      context of a regional environmental crisis it is essential to minimize objectives
      and keep them focused on interventions the borrower will support. In this case,
      driven by the Aral Sea crisis, the Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project
      overly emphasized the need to mitigate a range of ill-defined public health
      problems when even provision of basic services like potable water supply was in
      jeopardy.

     Adoption of community driven development models in a country where the
      culture of community self-help lacks prominence may require additional
      capacity-building efforts. In the case of Uzbekistan, the well-established
      community-driven model for implementing the sanitation, health, and hygiene
      components, based on the experience in Nepal, India, and Peru experienced
      difficulties. This was due to the insufficient attention paid to building the capacity
      in the local institutions responsible for project implementation, especially since the
      community centric culture did not exist in the country. The project however
      benefited from an extensive series of six social assessments, as these assessments
      clearly demonstrated that consulting communities in the design of pilot projects put
      pressure on authorities to give greater attention to the scale and cost of projects.

     The practicality and realism of bringing about institutional strengthening of a
      developing country’s main utilities through a performance-based management
      contract needs very careful appraisal. The Bank needs to adopt a flexible
      approach that can strengthen operating performance of the utility’s business in key
      areas without imposing unacceptable foreign management. In the case of the
      Bukhara and Samarkand, the foreign Operator (with hindsight) did have a very
      positive impact on modernizing and providing a commercial orientation to the
      utilities. However, socio-political factors ignored at appraisal, and exacerbated by
      the imposed Court judgment beyond the control of the implementing agencies,
      clouded judgment during implementation and at closing about the effectiveness of
      this arrangement. This is because the private sector model antagonized the
      implementing agencies and had left a lingering resentment on the value-added by
      the private sector. This is particularly egregious given that the municipality-
      appointed utility staff, following capacity-building through the operator, has
      subsequently demonstrated their ability to manage the utilities effectively and
      sustainably.

     Introduction of private sector or NGO participation in a new socio-political
      environment requires continuity of specialist Bank supervision and the right
      mix of skills. In the case of both projects the annual turnover of task team leaders
      led to a lack of proactivity on critical institutional issues that exacerbated delays and
      hindered the Bank’s effectiveness and efficiency.
                                            53


   Proper tariff setting and demand management efforts are critical factors that
    lead to expansion in customer base and increased revenues for the utilities. In
    the case of Water Supply, Sanitation, and Health project, greater attention was paid
    to securing financial viability under the new decentralized arrangements. Activities
    included periodic water tariff increases proposed by the regional government for
    central government approval, and simplification of tariff structure. The project was
    also successful in demand management through physical actions to reduce water
    losses, creating and updating a water user database, metering, and financial
    incentives to conserve water. Once staff was trained, equipment procured and
    public awareness was raised, the demand management program was mainstreamed
    in all three utilities. As a result, the customer base was expanded and revenues were
    increased, leading to improvements in financial viability of the utilities.

   Financial autonomy is important for long-term sustainability of water utilities.
    The Buhkara and Samarkand Water Supply Project managed to increase water
    metering significantly through various measures, leading to enhanced collection of
    revenues. However, due to lack of financial autonomy, the utility is experiencing
    difficulty collecting the arrears from government institutions. This is likely to
    adversely affect the utilities’ commercial performance if the government does not
    address the utilities’ autonomy issue soon.
