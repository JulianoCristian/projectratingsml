Republic of Karakalpakstan\n            and Khorezm Oblast in Uzbekistan,  reducing water-borne\n            diseases, particularly diarrheal diseases among children;\n            and to strengthen institutional capacity of the regional\n            water supply and sanitation utilities, and the regional\n            health centers and sanitary epidemiology stations. The\n            project has four main components: 1) The water supply and\n            distribution component has four subcomponents, consisting of\n            a) replacing and rehabilitating sections of the distribution\n            systems, water treatment plants, and ground water sources,\n            and building more trunk pipelines; b) developing the local\n            water supply and distribution systems, including providing\n            spare parts for desalinization units; c) water demand\n            management and loss reduction, including metered water\n            usage, consumer awareness, and leakage reduction; and d)\n            equipment for operation and maintenance; 2) the sanitation,\n            health, and hygiene component will a) build improved\n            latrines and handwashing facilities, and provide equipment,\n            transportation, and consultants and training; b) promote\n            health and hygiene education in selected rural and urban\n            communities; and c) improve water quality monitoring and\n            sanitation and hygiene inspection of households and communal\n            facilities, and improve the institutional capacity of\n            related agencies; 3) the technical assistance component will\n            institutionally strengthen water utilities and bulk\n            providers, finance a water and sewerage tariff study, and\n            refinance a feasibility study; and 4) the last component\n            will fund project management, project design, and\n            construction supervision."}, "docdt": "1997-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
