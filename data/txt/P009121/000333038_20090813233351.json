development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            application of the Bank's procurement rules in this\n            project achieved cost savings that at times were unexpected\n            and allowed the project to be more cost efficient than\n            originally anticipated. A precise understanding of the\n            actual investment costs may not be easy to achieve,\n            especially in a high-inflation environment. Nonetheless,\n            better cost monitoring systems can help. Overestimation of\n            project budgets by as large an amount as in this project\n            results in unnecessarily high commitment fees that the\n            Borrower must pay. This project was one of the first Bank\n            operations in Uzbekistan and the Bank's procurement\n            practices were new and unfamiliar to the Borrower. This\n            resulted in very significant delays in implementation. Task\n            teams should give careful consideration to procurement\n            capacity-building needs and address them in project design\n            with adequate resources allocated for procurement training\n            and monitoring for implementing agencies. Although policy\n            reform was explicitly omitted as a project objective, major\n            changes in tariff policy and water demand management led to\n            markedly improved performance by the water utilities\n            involved with the project."}, "docdt": "2009-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
