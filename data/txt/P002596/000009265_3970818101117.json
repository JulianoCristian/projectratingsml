Power Rehabilitation Project will\n            help to ensure the efficient utilization of existing power\n            facilities, improve power supply reliability, and assist in\n            financing of urgently needed additions of capacities and\n            immediately required rehabilitation works to meet the\n            growing power demand at least cost to the economy. The\n            project will contribute to institution building and\n            strengthening of power subsector organization, establishment\n            of long-term development policy, tariff reforms, load\n            management and energy conservation, and subregional power\n            system interconnections. The project will include: (a)\n            addition of 2 x 10 MW diesel units at Burri; (b)\n            rehabilitation of units 1 and 2 at Roseires hydropower\n            station; (c) spare parts for the Sennar hydropower station;\n            (d) rehabilitation of the Blue Nile and the Eastern Grid\n            installations; and (e) consultancy services for supervision\n            of project implementation and coordination of management\n            improvement, and for carrying out studies and feasibility reports."}, "docdt": "1985-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
