The lessons learned indicate that the use of\n            local processing staff based in the Bank's field office\n            is an advantage for projects which require frequent\n            monitoring and evaluation. A clear orientation to the\n            project objectives and a statement of project\n            responsibilities should be provided to all participants in a\n            project. Project designs should include planned activities\n            to quickly collect and organize good baseline data. When\n            co-financed projects are associated with a Bank project, it\n            is important to have clear understandings and\n            linkages/relationships well documented for both projects.\n            Where faculties have similar or related academic interests,\n            careful attention should be given to options for integration\n            and sharing of equipment and other resources.
