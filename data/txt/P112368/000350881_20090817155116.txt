      SECOND ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND RECOVERY GRANT (EGRG II)
                   GRANT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

Recipient:           Republic of Côte d`Ivoire.

Implementing         The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) will be responsible for overall
Agency:              implementation of the proposed Second Economic Governance and Recovery
                     Grant, in close cooperation with line Ministries.

Financing Data:      IDA Grant

Operation Type:      This Development Policy Operation consists of a single tranche of SDR 96.4
                     million (US$150 million equivalent) to be disbursed upon grant effectiveness.

Main Policy Areas:   The EGRG II focuses on continuing and deepening policy reforms to improve
                     public financial management, and governance, transparency and efficiency in three
                     key sectors of the economy ­ energy, cocoa and finance.

Key Outcome          (i) The rate of transposition of WAEMU guidelines and international standards in
Indicators:          the national procurement regulatory framework improving to 100 percent (from 80
                     percent in 2008), and SIGFIP extended to the remaining 10 departments (from 49
                     in 2008); (ii) operating costs of the four cocoa sector entities reduced to CFAF 16
                     billion (from CFAF 23 billion in 2008), and a roadmap for the preparation of a new
                     strategy for cocoa sector reform is in place and being implemented; (iii) completion
                     of the EITI draft annual report for 2006; and (iv) a decrease in the ratio of insider
                     lending to BNI net worth to 250 percent (from 315 percent in June 2008).

Program              The key objective of the proposed EGRG II is to support government-owned
Development          reforms to improve governance, transparency and efficiency in public expenditure
Objectives and       management as well as advance structural reforms aimed at strengthening
Contribution to      governance and transparency in key sectors. Specifically, it would focus on
CAS:                 supporting the Government`s efforts to restore the normal budget cycle and
                     strengthen budget preparation, execution, controls and accountability, and help
                     enhance governance and efficiency in the energy, cocoa, and financial sectors.

                     The grant is an integral part of IDA`s Interim Strategy Note for Côte d`Ivoire for
                     the period FY08-FY09 as it directly supports its third pillar, i.e., government-
                     owned reforms for economic recovery. The proposed reforms are essential to the
                     Government`s ability to use public resources effectively to support the country`s
                     economic and social recovery. These actions will be followed by a more
                     comprehensive medium-term program of reforms that the Government has
                     developed in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper which was adopted in February
                     2009. The operation would provide financial support to the Government whose
                     annual debt service to the World Bank will remain considerable until attainment of
                     the HIPC completion point. The grant is closely coordinated with assistance
                     provided to the Government`s reform program through the ongoing Governance
                     and Institutional Development Grant (US$13 million), the Enhanced HIPC
                     Initiative, the AfDB budget support planned for March 2009, the IMF EPCA and


                                                  vi
                   the expected three-year PRGF program.

Risks and          The proposed operation is of high risk. The principal risks are: (i) political risk
Risk Mitigation:   stemming from the fragility of the peace process, the upcoming presidential
                   elections, delays in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and possible
                   changes of reform-minded ministers after the presidential elections; (ii)
                   macroeconomic risk, if the government fails to adhere to a responsible medium-
                   term macroeconomic framework (the expected three-year PRGF program) or
                   exogenous shocks negatively affect its performance (notably weather, commodity
                   prices and exchange rate volatility); and (iii) governance and fiduciary risk,
                   arising from vested interests and political intervention, notably in the cocoa, energy
                   and finance sectors, which remain strong and could stall reforms. These risks could
                   be further aggravated by the current global economic slowdown which has
                   already had a major negative impact on key commodity exports, although so far
                   mitigated by the overall economic rebound from the socio-political crisis.

                   While addressing the peace and security risks falls outside the scope of this
                   operation, continued international support for the peace process, including through
                   the ongoing IDA-financed Post-Conflict Assistance Project (US$120 million),
                   should help mitigate this risk. To broaden and deepen the coalition for overall
                   reform, IDA, IMF, AfDB, EC and other donors are working together to ensure that
                   (i) top priority is given to the proposed reforms in discussions with Government;
                   (ii) key basic services are improved; (iii) targeted interventions such as for
                   demobilization and reintegration continue; and (iv) Government implements an
                   effective communication strategy, with help through the IDA-financed Governance
                   and Institutional Development Grant to better inform the public and help build
                   demand for transparency. IDA and other donor partners have also actively
                   supported the preparation of a PRSP which provides a medium-term strategy based
                   on extensive participation. There is currently a broad-based constituency for reform of
                   the cocoa sector, including external and domestic stakeholders, which has prompted
                   Government to remove the leadership of the entities managing the sector and launch a
                   process of substantive reform. Since August 2007, the Government has implemented
                   the macroeconomic program supported by two IMF EPCAs and a three-year PRGF
                   program is expected to be presented to the IMF Board in March 2009. The
                   Government is also committed to rapid attainment of the HIPC completion point
                   and to adjust the macroeconomic program as needed to address exogenous shocks.
                   Governance and fiduciary risks are mitigated through the focus on measures to
                   improve public financial management and transparency, supported by the recently
                   completed PEMFAR and technical assistance and capacity building provided by
                   IDA and other donors. Also, this risk is mitigated by the continued intensive
                   attention of the international community on budget processes and frequent broad-
                   based consultations with stakeholders, including civil society organizations, to
                   strengthen the case for reforms and Government`s commitment to them. Finally,
                   the support provided by the Bank through the proposed operation as well as an
                   emergency electricity project and a new private sector development operation will
                   help to stimulate private sector growth and mitigate some of the risks posed by the
                   global slowdown.

           SECOND ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND RECOVERY GRANT

                                     1. INTRODUCTION

1.1     This program document proposes a Second Economic Governance and Recovery
Grant (EGRG II) for the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire in the amount of SDR 96.4 million
(US$150 million equivalent). This one-tranche Development Policy Operation supports the
Government`s efforts to pursue the implementation of governance reforms initiated under the
EGRG approved by the Board in April 2008. Specifically, the EGRG II focuses on continuing
and deepening policy reforms to improve public financial management (PFM), and governance,
transparency and efficiency in three key sectors ­ energy, cocoa and finance. The operation
would provide financial support to the Government whose annual debt service to the World Bank
will remain considerable until attainment of the HIPC completion point. After this transition
operation, and in the context of the new CAS, a PRSC series (PRSC-1 to 3) would be considered
to support the Government`s follow up reforms in these areas under the strategic directions
defined by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper which was adopted in February 2009. The
grant is an integral part of IDA`s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Côte d`Ivoire for the period
FY08-FY09 and is closely coordinated with assistance provided to support the program of
Government`s reforms through the ongoing Governance and Institutional Development Grant
(US$13 million), the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, the AfDB budget support operation, the IMF
EPCA and the expected three-year PRGF program. Since Côte d`Ivoire is at high risk of debt
distress, IDA resources are provided on grant terms, per the stipulations of the grant allocation
system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 15 period (FY09-FY11). Côte d`Ivoire is also
eligible for annual exceptional post-conflict allocations from IDA. Given the fiscal pressures on
the budget, notably on account of high debt service obligations, the amount of the proposed grant
has been increased from the level indicated in the ISN.

1.2     Following the signing of the Ouagadougou Peace Accord of March 2007, Côte
d'Ivoire is gradually emerging from political crisis. The Government is making progress
towards the reunification of the country and preparation of presidential elections in 2009. With
the deterioration in governance and transparency during the conflict, the Government is pursuing
efforts started in 2007 to restore public financial management processes and procedures
throughout the country, effect a fast and visible improvement in the governance and management
of the energy and cocoa sectors, the country`s two main export and public revenue sources, and
restructure the financial sector to ensure its soundness.

1.3    A rapid and visible improvement in public financial management and governance
and transparency in the energy, cocoa and financial sectors is critical to sustain the ongoing
peace process and recovery of the economy. Specifically, the Government needs to ensure that
scarce public resources are utilized efficiently and transparently to provide essential public
services and that the cocoa sector is restructured to ensure that the farmers obtain a higher share
of the world price. The Government has already implemented a number of initial governance
reforms, and intends to pursue and deepen these efforts as it seeks to rebuild the country and
ensure a sustainable peace. These reforms would lead over time to strengthened fiscal

sustainability, improved economic governance and transparency, and enhanced efficiency of
State institutions and processes--critical elements for the country`s economic and social
recovery and for stability and stronger growth in the sub-region.


       2. CÔTE D'IVOIRE'S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS

2.1     Côte d'Ivoire, a medium-size country with a population of 18.5 million, is the largest
economy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and is critical to
the overall development of the sub-region. Côte d`Ivoire has an important economic influence
over the rest of the region, given its size (accounting for 40 percent of GDP in the WAEMU), its
relatively high income per capita (US$960 in 2007 as per the Bank`s Atlas methodology), and its
role in transit trade for landlocked neighboring countries. With its large immigrant population,
Côte d`Ivoire has also been an important source of worker remittances for other countries in the
sub-region. The country is the largest exporter of cocoa in the world, and its level of total goods
exports is the fourth largest in sub-Saharan Africa (after South Africa, Nigeria and Angola). It
has a relatively diversified agricultural economy as well as significant manufacturing and
services sectors. However, the civil war in 2002-03 and subsequent years of stalemate in the
peace process have taken a heavy toll on the economy and social outcomes.

2.2     Côte d'Ivoire's prolonged period of political instability and conflict resulted in, and
was fueled by, a deterioration of governance and transparency. With frequent changes in
government, political and security concerns dominating daily life, and the absence of an
approved budget often until mid-year, the standard budget cycle was disrupted and public
financial management processes and procedures suffered. An increasing share of public
expenditures (over 50 percent in 2006) was executed outside regular budget procedures using
discretionary treasury advances, some oil revenue stayed off-budget, the cocoa sector was heavily
taxed and quasi-fiscal levies on cocoa were not used to benefit producers as intended.
Corruption and lack of transparency have been associated with cocoa regulatory agencies, the
Government`s procurement methods for some large public/private sector contracts and the
management of petroleum revenues. Also, with weakened accountability, expenditures
increasingly focused on meeting wages and crisis-related expenditures, including financing
armed forces on both sides of the conflict at the expense of expenditures for the achievement of
longer term economic and social objectives.

2.3     The years of crisis led to a substantial increase in poverty and deterioration in living
standards. Real per capita GDP fell by a cumulative 15 percent during 2000-06. The World
Bank`s 2007 poverty diagnostic1 estimates that poverty incidence (based on a national poverty
line) increased from 38.2 percent in 2002 to 43.2 percent in 2006. The recently completed
household survey estimates that poverty climbed to 48.9 percent in 2008. The country`s ranking
in the UN Human Development Index deteriorated from 154th (out of 174 countries) in 1999 to
166th (out of 177) in 2007, considerably lower than what would be expected given the country`s

is based on a simulation and not a new survey.

income level. Since the late 1990s, the gross primary school enrollment stagnated at about
70 percent, mortality rates of children under 5 increased from 175 to 195 per thousand, and life
expectancy at birth declined from 49 in 1995 to 47 in 2006, while these indicators continued to
improve in most sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Basic health and educational services
have been severely affected in the North of the country, where the official public administration
was absent for over five years. It is estimated that 60 percent of cocoa producers fall below the
poverty line. The households supported by these poor cocoa farmers represent some 28 percent
of all poor in Côte d`Ivoire.

2.4     The government has started efforts to reverse the deterioration in basic service
provision by redeploying public services throughout the country and progressively rehabilitating
education, health, and village water supply infrastructures. Beginning with the 2007/08
academic year, the education system has returned to normal throughout the country. With
teachers and education administrators redeployed, enrollment rates are up nationwide at all
educational levels. In the health sector, a mission to assess requirements in the CNW zones
identified urgent needs which the government has begun addressing. As a result, 2,417 new
health officials have now been redeployed, while approximately 1,700 additional health officials
have been recruited in 2007 and 2008. The rehabilitation of health care facilities is in progress
and vaccination programs have resumed with help from multilateral agencies.

2.5     Despite the above and due to the severe constraints to budget allocation and
execution in the social sector during the crisis, achievement of the MDGs by 2015 will be a
major challenge. The crisis has had a considerable negative effect on the implementation of
poverty targeted activities, as security and defense spending emerged as top priorities during the
conflict. As a result, service quality remains well below pre-crisis levels. Re-deployment of
qualified educational personnel remains incomplete and health facilities, which have largely
reopened, continue to function with reduced personnel and services. Gender equality suffered
during the conflict with massive human rights violations and abuses. With gradual political and
economic recovery since the signing of the Ouagadougou Political Accord in 2007, the
Government has committed to increase social sector expenditure and take further steps to
improve substantively MDG indicators. The Government`s commitment is reflected in the full
PRSP which was adopted in February 2009.

                                RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

2.6     After more than a decade of civil strife and economic hardship, Côte d'Ivoire is in
the process of economic recovery and political normalization. The March 2007 Ouagadougou
Political Accord, which received the support of the international community, set out a roadmap
for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, the dismantling of militias, reunification of
the country, and preparations for elections for 2008.2 A new transition Government, with Forces
Nouvelles leader Guillaume Soro as Prime Minister, was formed in early April 2007; later in
2007, an integrated command center for the army and rebel forces was set up, the     confidence
zone was eliminated, and prefects for all districts and judges for the nationality identification

2
 Supplemental Ouagadougou Accords in November 2007 and December 2008 have been signed to reinforce
implementation of the roadmap, especially the reunification of the army.


                                                    3
hearings were appointed. Progress has also been made in the re-installment of prefectural
authorities and the re-deployment of public administration and service provision in the Western,
Northern and Western regions, formerly held by the rebels. In addition, the security situation has
steadily improved and military roadblocks and racketeering have been significantly reduced in
recent months.

2.7     Following initial delays, especially in the identification of the population and voter
enrollment, the key political leaders agreed that the originally-scheduled November 30 date
for elections was unrealistic. It was also agreed that a new date should be set, taking into proper
account the steps still required (including completion of enrollment operations). The electoral
commission plans to complete the voter registration process in February and the new date for
elections is expected to fall in the second half of 2009. Although the disarmament of militias and
the reintegration of rebel forces into military or civilian life have only started, the continued
presence of around 7,000 UN and 2,000 French troops should help improve security for the
elections, though risks remain.

                                 RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.8     As the political normalization process continued during 2007, the economy
registered a modest recovery (see Table 2.1). The Ouagadougou Accord gave new impetus to
political normalization and the economy began gradually to respond to a more stable
environment. A modest increase in private sector confidence and the ongoing rehabilitation of
public infrastructure contributed to an estimated real GDP growth rate of 1.6 percent in 2007.
Weather conditions adversely affected cotton and cocoa production and oil production declined
in volume, but that was partly offset by higher oil and cocoa prices. The 2007 external current
account balance (excluding official transfers) turned into a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP as
import volumes rose faster than real GDP. Inflation remained at 1.9 percent in 2007.

2.9      The fiscal outcome in 2007 was broadly in line with the budgetary program targets
supported by the IMF Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA).3 The primary basic
surplus was 0.6 percent of GDP. However, operating spending, especially that of national
institutions (including sovereignty outlays and military premia), exceeded budget allocations,
while post-conflict related and investment outlays were lower. Revenue was broadly on target,
but only because of large recourse to advance tax payments, especially on cocoa export duties.
The government also made progress in clearing arrears to external creditors and domestic
suppliers thanks to exceptional efforts to mobilize resources on the regional financial market.
The stock of domestic arrears (including on subsidies to private schools) declined from 4.5
percent of GDP at end-2006 to 2.7 percent of GDP at end-2008. The Government also stayed
current on debt obligations to several multilateral creditors and repaid its share in arrears
clearance to the World Bank Group in early 2008 (one-half of arrears or 1.1 percent of GDP).
2.10 The economic recovery which started in 2007 accelerated in 2008, but inflation
increased. Output growth in 2008 is estimated at 2.3 percent, driven by a recovery in oil and gas

 In August 2007 the IMF Board approved an Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance for Côte d`Ivoire in an amount of
SDR 40.6 million (about US$62.2 million).


                                                      4
output from the technical problems in the previous year, favorable rains and prices for food and
export crops, and the further reunification of the country. The value of exports is estimated to
have increased by 8.3 percent in 2008, after declining by 5.7 percent the previous year. The
current account balance (excluding official transfers) is estimated to have improved to 1.0
percent of GDP. Twelve-month CPI inflation, which fluctuated at around 2.5 percent in recent
years, reached 9.0 percent at end-2008, reflecting the mid-year surge in world food and oil prices;
however, with prices falling toward the end of the year, annual inflation moderated to 6.3 percent
for 2008. In April 2008, the government temporarily suspended or reduced taxes on essential
food items, such as rice, wheat, sugar, and edible oil, to offset the rising cost of living.
2.11 There was good progress under EPCA 2 in 2008, except for a fiscal slippage in the
form of extra-budgetary spending. At end-September 2008, revenues exceeded the EPCA4
target, helped by higher oil and cocoa prices. However, the fiscal space was used for higher
current spending related to the wage bill, gas subsidies for the electricity sector, and extra-
budgetary spending regarding the transfer of the capital (0.7 percent of GDP against 0.2 percent
in the budget). As a result, the EPCA targets for social spending and domestic arrears repayment
were missed. Delays in donor disbursements for crisis-exit programs and in budget support,
combined with difficulties in mobilizing funds on the WAEMU market, led the government to
make only a partial arrears repayment to the AfDB and accumulate new domestic arrears.
2.12 The authorities implemented a set of corrective measures to offset the extra-
budgetary spending and put in place safeguards to avoid such spending in the future. These
included expenditure cuts while protecting social spending. The government approved a revised
2008 budget to capture all spending related to the transfer of the capital and agreed to limit such
spending in 2009 to one-half the level incurred in 2008, in light of the significant increase in pro-
poor spending needed under the PRGF program and HIPC. A plan for clearing the remaining
domestic arrears was adopted in November 2008 for implementation during 2009-10, although
targets for domestic arrears clearance by end-2008 were not met. As fiscal performance at end-
2008 was otherwise close to EPCA targets, Côte d`Ivoire is expected to be considered for a
PRGF arrangement, with the IMF Board date in late March 2009. The proposed PRGF includes a
continuous performance criterion requiring zero extra-budgetary spending.
2.13 The government repaid its share in arrears clearance to the AfDB Group in
February 2009. On this basis, the remaining arrears clearance and a budget support operation
(US$125 million) are expected to be discussed by the AfDB Board in early March 2009.

April 2008.

                   MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

2.14 The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is based on the assumption of a steady
recovery after years of civil conflict. Real GDP growth is projected to increase to 3.7 percent
in 2009 and 4.2 percent in 2010, and to surpass 5.0 percent over the period 2011-13, as
productivity and investment return to their pre-crisis growth path. Longer­term growth is a
projected at 5.1 percent per annum, which is below the averages of the post-devaluation 1994-99
period (6.6 percent per year) and of the 1960-80 boom years (6 percent a year). Growth during
the recovery phase would come from renewed private sector confidence and investments, the
return of capacity utilization in industry to normal, normalization of the situation in the central,
northern and western parts of the country, the rehabilitation of public infrastructure, and expected
reforms in the cocoa, energy and financial sectors. Rehabilitation of public infrastructure
(especially roads to the North) will be particularly critical to help domestic and external trade and
re-launch nontraditional exports and agricultural processing industries. Restoration of capacity
of the electricity sector will also be critical for the country`s economic recovery. Longer-term
growth would be sustained by diversification of the economy, increased investment, and
expanded trade to regional and global markets.

2.15 After peaking at 9 percent in December 2008, CPI inflation is expected to drop in
early 2009 and return to trend levels as commodity prices stabilize or fall. The current
account deficit would gradually increase as import growth (driven especially by investment but
supported by greater access to foreign financing) outpaces export growth. The volume of exports
of goods and nonfactor services, mostly in agriculture and mining, is expected to increase on
average by about 6 percent annually over the longer term. Imports are expected to follow a
similar trend after slightly lower growth in 2009.

2.16 Fiscal policies aim at further fiscal consolidation and prudent debt management
under a three-year PRGF-supported program for 2009-2011 whose IMF Board discussion is
scheduled for March 2009. For 2009, the program targets a primary basic surplus of 0.9 percent
of GDP. Total revenues (excluding grants) are projected to remain fairly constant at 19.0 percent
of GDP in 2009. Expenditures would also remain roughly constant at 21.0 percent of GDP (from
20.5 percent in 2007, and 21.1 percent in 2008) and rise only modestly in the next few years.

2.17 In the medium-term, the Government plans continued primary basic surpluses
above 1 percent of GDP, which would help it to remain current on debt service. Fiscal space for
pro-poor spending should come from a modest increase in the revenue/GDP ratio, containing the
wage bill in line with the WAEMU criterion, reducing sovereignty and other non-essential
spending, and an increase in concessional project financing. Total revenues (excluding grants)
are projected to reach 20.5 percent of GDP in 2013. Government expenditures are projected to
increase to 24.9 percent of GDP in 2013. The wage bill is expected to stabilize at 6.3 percent of
GDP from 2012 on, reaching 36 percent of total revenue, almost equal to the WAEMU criterion
of 35 percent. Public capital spending would reach 6.8 percent of GDP in 2012 - in part reflecting
increased foreign-financed investment.

2.18 In the short term, expenditures related to post-conflict recovery (including
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, redeployment of the administration,


                                                 8
identification, elections and reunification of the country) will absorb a considerable share of
budgetary expenditures, while the share devoted to the social sectors and the rehabilitation of the
economic infrastructure will gradually increase. External grants, mainly for projects, are
expected to average 1.1 percent of GDP over the period. Project loans are expected to gradually
increase from 0.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 2.5 percent in 2012 and stabilize thereafter.

2.19 The medium-term fiscal challenges facing Côte d'Ivoire remain large. The financing
gap for 2009 is projected at some 26 percent of GDP, largely reflecting regularization of arrears,
but should return to approximately 3 percent in subsequent years. Non-reschedulable post cut off
date Paris Club arrears amount to 9.4 percent of GDP and reschedulable arrears and current
maturities during 2009-11 to the Paris Club and London Club amount to 10 percent and 4
percent, respectively. Debt service will rise in 2009-11 to an average of some 3 percent of GDP
after the country reaches the HIPC Decision Point, in order to stay current on its outstanding
obligations, but some of this may be covered through further negotiations on the treatment of
Paris Club and perhaps London Club debt. Financing assurances that creditors will not require
immediate repayment after the HIPC Decision Point is reached, notably from the Paris Club and
London Club, are expected to be in place before approval of the PRGF and the proposed grant.
The potential for using the Debt Reduction Facility is being explored although this may have
limited impact since commercial creditors have already provided relief exceeding their normal
share. Support from multilateral agencies will help meet the financing gap but the authorities will
need to maintain a fiscal surplus and higher economic growth if they are to remain current on
external and domestic debt service.

2.20 Failing progress on the political and security front, however, the country would
likely remain in the current state of stagnation with GDP growth at a modest 1-2 percent per
year, driven mainly by oil production, but with per capita incomes falling. This could result from
further delays in the election process, creating frustration in parts of the population which feel
disenfranchised, and a fall in investment. The political maneuvers surrounding the elections may
complicate the process of developing a consensus around reforms. After elections are held, the
results could be contested by the losing parties and some of the key reformers in Government
could be replaced.

2.21 The unstable world economy poses other significant risks. The existing financial
market turmoil and related global economic slowdown could adversely affect foreign direct
investment and other capital flows necessary to rebuild the economy. They are also likely to
affect commodity prices. The price of oil has already fallen by half from its peak in mid-2008,
reducing the value of the government`s share of oil, as well as cutting into dividends and taxes
from PETROCI. Cocoa prices have remained remarkably robust, aided by the strength of the US
dollar. However, a further drop in oil and cocoa prices (currently still at their pre-financial crisis)
would reduce government revenue and the fiscal space for reconstruction spending. If cocoa and
oil prices in 2009 were 30 percent below World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections, Cote
d`Ivoire`s growth would be 1-1.5 percentage points lower, and government revenue would fall by
0.4 percent of GDP. Together with possible delays in moving to the HIPC decision and
completion points, this would raise the risk of renewed arrears.

2.22 The Debt Relief Analysis presented in the Enhanced HIPC Initiative Decision Point
Document prepared by IMF and IDA staffs shows that Côte d'Ivoire meets the HIPC
Initiative indebtedness criterion under the fiscal window based on end-2007 data. Côte
d`Ivoire`s public and publicly-guaranteed external debt was estimated at US$14.3 billion as of
end-December 2007 (US$12.8 billion in NPV terms after assuming full application of traditional
debt relief mechanisms).

2.23 Côte d'Ivoire could reach the HIPC decision point in March 2009, as fiscal
performance at end-2008 was close to EPCA targets and Côte d`Ivoire is moving to a PRGF
arrangement with the IMF at the same time.5 Côte d`Ivoire has cleared outstanding arrears with
multilateral creditors or reached an agreement to clear them during the program period. Possible
HIPC Initiative debt relief is estimated at US$3,005 million in end-2007 NPV terms, based on a
common reduction factor of 23.6 percent. Côte d`Ivoire has already received about 55 percent of
its estimated HIPC debt relief including pre-2002 excess debt relief provided by the Paris Club
and London Club creditors. The NPV reduction embedded in the concessional arrears clearance
operation undertaken by IDA (in April 2008) and by the AfDB Group (expected in March 2009)
has also been counted as HIPC debt relief. Upon reaching the HIPC completion point, Côte
d`Ivoire would qualify for relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, which is estimated
to reduce debt service on debt to IDA, the IMF, and the African Development Fund by
approximately US$2,014 million (in nominal terms), as well as additional debt relief from
bilateral creditors.

                       3. THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM

3.1      The broad objectives of the Government's post-conflict program, as detailed in its
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,6 focus on: (i) implementing the key elements of the
Ouagadougou Accord to restore peace and security and promote national reconciliation and
reunification of the country; (ii) restoring basic infrastructure and social services in the country;
(iii) restoring fiscal and debt sustainability; and (iv) sustaining an incipient economic recovery
through structural reforms in the key energy, cocoa and financial sectors.

3.2     Achieving these strategic goals requires improving governance, transparency and
economic efficiency and strengthening the basic functions of government, based on
accountability and the rule of law. This will involve: (i) continued and deeper reforms to
strengthen public financial management to improve efficiency and effectiveness in public
resources and hold the Government accountable for the appropriate use of public funds; and (ii)
enhancing transparency, accountability and efficiency of state institutions and processes in the
cocoa, energy and financial sectors, which are the two key generators of exports and public
revenues.


5
  Following missions in June and October 2008, and February 2009, a new three-year PRGF program is expected to
be presented at the IMF Board in March 2009.
6
   The Government prepared in 2002 an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). Implementation of the
I-PRSP could not take place due to conflict which erupted in September 2002 and the crisis that ensued. The
Government adopted a full PRSP in February 2009.


                                                     10
3.3     Since 2006, the Government has taken noteworthy steps in implementing reforms in
the areas of public financial management and in the cocoa, energy and financial sectors
under the support of the first Economic Governance and Recovery Grant and the IMF EPCA.
With respect to the first EGRG`s targeted results, budget execution has improved to reduce
discrepancies between approved budgets and planned actual operating expenditures, although
there was significant under-spending on planned investments to offset extra-budgetary
expenditures. The SIGFIP public finance management system is being rolled out to the regions
formerly controlled by the FN. The Government has committed to more transparency in the
management of oil and gas revenues by joining the EITI. Four of the commercial banks with
negative equity have submitted recapitalization plans to the Banking Commission and two of
them were considered acceptable. The Government has remained current on its payments to the
World Bank and full arrears clearance to the AfDB is expected for early March 2009. Further
details on the outcomes identified in the first EGRG, and the progress made to date can be found
in Annex 4.7

3.4     The Government intends to pursue and deepen reforms and institutional
development efforts in these areas. The remainder of this section highlights the salient features
of the current situation in these areas of reform as well as the Government`s main policy efforts
and the specific measures supported by the proposed grant. The policy matrix in Annex 3 details
the Government`s program of reforms with specific activities in each reform area.

                  IMPROVING GOVERNANCE, TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY IN
                            PUBLIC EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT

Current issues

3.5     Building on past public expenditure management reforms will be important to
improve efficiency and transparency of expenditures and support policy fundamentals for
economic recovery. As noted above, public expenditure management has suffered from a
distorted budget cycle, worsening transparency, and expenditure execution problems. Since
2006, the Government has implemented public expenditure management reforms targeting the
return to the normal budget cycle, improvements in the execution of expenditures, the
strengthening of financial management and procurement practices and regular preparation of
budget execution reports. Reforms recently implemented by the Government or on-going
include: (i) return to a normal budgetary cycle with the adoption of the 2008 and 2009 budgets in
late December of the previous years and, since the second half of 2007, publication of budget
execution statements each quarter; (ii) regularization in 2007 and 2008 of previous treasury
advances for the execution of expenditures (with more than 70 percent of advances already
regularized) and reduction in their use (most importantly since early 2008); (iii) rolling out to
additional departments of the computerized integrated public expenditure management system
(SIGFIP), bringing the total to 49 (from 37 in 2007) and on-going efforts to further improve the

Results Report.

accounting system with ASTER software;8 (iv) designing another computerized integrated
system for monitoring of State-owned enterprises and decentralized entities; (v) strengthening of
the capacity of the administrative and financial directorates that had deteriorated in the previous
years; and (vi) transmission, at end 2007, to the Chamber of Accounts of the final draft budget
execution laws for the years 2003 and 2004.

3.6     Progress has been made in the area of public procurement although challenges
remain. Building on the findings and recommendations of the 2004 CPAR, the Government
established a Steering Committee to coordinate and monitor a procurement reform strategy
focused on: (a) improving the legal framework; (b) changing procurement procedures and
practices; (c) increasing the expertise of personnel; (d) clarifying rules and setting up a complaint
process that fairly applies the law and inspires confidence; and (e) introducing measures to fight
corruption. In 2006, a new Procurement Code became effective which eliminates discriminatory
procedures, increases competition, and establishes a regulatory framework to fight against
corruption and fraud in public procurement. Also, a website has been launched to disseminate
information regarding public procurement and a computerized system (SIGMAP) was completed
and launched in Abidjan.

3.7     However, the Government recognizes the importance of addressing remaining PFM
weaknesses that have emerged as a result of the country's political crisis. A Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), carried out
jointly by the Bank, the IMF, the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the European
Commission (EC) and completed in May 2008, identified a number of critical shortcomings and
related recommendations for policy reforms and institutional development in the areas of budget
comprehensiveness and transparency, budget preparation and execution, dissemination, controls
and procurement. Budget comprehensiveness and transparency is compromised by inadequacies
in the budget nomenclature and classification, inadequate consolidation of public entities in the
global budget, and lack of clear rules for budget transfers to local governments. In budget
execution, there are long lags in the cycle of approvals and processing through the SIGFIP
system, which have a negative impact for both the private sector and externally funded projects;
also, budget execution reports produced through the SIGFIP are not fully reliable due to
infrequent reconciliation with the ASTER accounting system. In dissemination, the information
on budget allocations and execution is not easily available to the public. Internal controls are
inadequate and the external controls do not operate effectively: the Chamber of Accounts is not
entirely operational and there are significant delays in the Chamber`s reviews of the budget
execution laws. In procurement, and despite the advances introduced by the new code, the
current legislation and regulations are inadequate for the fight against corruption and allow too
many public procurement contracts to be concluded without competitive bidding; there is no
clear separation between procurement regulation, control, and execution; there are insufficient
ex-post controls of the procurement process; and public dissemination is still inadequate.

The Government's reform program

3.8     In response to the above weaknesses, the Government is committed to implement a
medium-term PFM reform program based on the recommendations of the Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability Review. While highlighting the progress made to
date, the PEMFAR characterizes the PFM system as in need of significant reform and capacity
development. The analysis in the PEMFAR also suggests a clear action plan for the reform of the
PFM system beginning with the revision of the legal and regulatory framework. This framework
needs to be developed in a comprehensive manner to specify organizational structures with clear
roles and responsibilities. Following workshops held in June 2008 and January 2009 to review
the PEMFAR findings, which were presented to a broad range of stakeholders, the Government
adopted a PFM reform program detailing a broad range of reforms.

3.9    Key elements of the Government's PFM reform program, which are supported by
the above donors, include efforts to:
       Continue to ensure the normal budget cycle with the timely approval of the yearly budget,
       regular publication of budget execution statements and limited use of treasury advances.
       Enhance capacity for budget preparation, including by enhancing public investment
       planning, setting up of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and improving
       macro-economic modeling.
       Improve budget classification and nomenclature, by reviewing the current budget
       nomenclature in accordance with the WAEMU and international norms. This will also
       enable identifying poverty related spending in the context of the HIPC process.
       Improve budget execution, including through the preparation of an institutional audit and
       the development of a manpower plan for strengthening capacity of the MEF.
       Develop an interface between the budget execution system (SIGFIP), procurement system
       (SIGMAP), treasury accounting (ASTER) and payroll (SIGFAE); and the pursuit of the
       deconcentration of the budget execution (SIGFIP) system to the remaining 10
        départements in the country.
       Improve the MEF's production and dissemination of economic and financial information
       to make the information on budget allocations and execution more easily available to the
       public, including improvement in the design and implementation of quarterly budget
       execution reports.
       Strengthen audit and control functions, by catching up with the transmission to the
       Chamber of Accounts of the budget execution laws, reviewing the de-concentrated
       control procedures for budget execution and producing a manual for this function;
       streamlining and harmonizing the expenditure control procedures; and designing and
       implementing a monitoring and evaluation system in the MEF.
       Enhance transparency and efficiency of public procurement, by (i) improving the existing
       regulatory and institutional framework; (ii) developing capacity of the public and private
       sectors in public procurement and management; and (iii) strengthening the public
       procurement control systems. Specific actions include the setting up of an independent


                                              13
       public procurement regulatory entity with representatives from the private sector and civil
       society; preparation of a procurement manual, standard contracts and of a code of ethics;
       the conduct of external audits to ensure conformity of public procurement procedures;
       and the dissemination through the internet of public procurement information and
       statistics generated by the existing SIGMAP system.

3.10 The above efforts are complemented by Government measures to improve revenue
collection which include: (i) improving tax and customs administration, including in the North;
(ii) enhancing the revenue contribution from national oil/gas companies; (iii) reducing tax
exemptions; and (iv) ensuring that public enterprises transfer to the treasury all social
contributions on wages.

Prior actions under the proposed EGRG II and follow-up reforms

3.11 The proposed EGRG II would support four policy actions critical to deepening
PFM reforms and aimed at ensuring the normal budget cycle, strengthening audit and control
functions, and enhancing transparency and efficiency of public procurement. The first is the
approval by presidential ordinance no later than December 31, 2007 of a budget for the year 2008
and making public the Cabinet`s communication on the budget in the Official Gazette and the
major daily newspaper. The second is the submission of the draft budget execution bills (Lois de
Règlements) for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 to the Chamber of Accounts. The third is limiting the
use of treasury advances to less than 15 percent of current cumulative expenses excluding wages
and salaries, debt servicing, and expenditures financed through the revolving fund cash account
mechanism (    régies d'avances) and from external resources, for the year 2008. The fourth is
the adoption by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of a time-bound road map aiming at
separating policy functions from execution and control ones in public procurement.

3.12 After this transition operation, a PRSC series (PRSC-1 to 3) could support the next
stage in the Government's PFM reform program. Policy measures that will be considered for
PRSC-1 would be: (a) approval of a budget for 2009 by presidential ordinance, satisfactory to
IDA, before the beginning of 2009, and making public the Cabinet`s communication on the
budget; and (b) submission of the draft budget execution bill (Lois de Règlements) for fiscal year
2007 to the Chamber of Accounts. The Governance and Institutional Development Grant, a
US$13 million investment project currently under implementation, is supporting the broader
program of PFM reforms detailed in para. 3.9, in close coordination with the support provided by
other donors.

3.13 Other critical PFM actions have been identified as HIPC completion point triggers,
aimed at further enhancing transparency in budget execution and reporting, including on poverty-
reducing spending, and strengthening the institutional set-up for public procurement.
Specifically, these are: (1) quarterly publication of budget execution statements (including
revenue; expenditure by type, function, and administration/type and by different stages of budget
execution; and the identification of poverty-reducing spending) within six weeks after the end of

                  IMPROVING GOVERNANCE, TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY
                                IN THE ENERGY SECTOR


Current issues

3.14 Sustained by growing regional demand for electricity and high oil prices, the energy
sector has experienced a strong growth in recent years. Côte d`Ivoire relies on oil, natural gas
and hydropower to satisfy internal energy demand. Furthermore, it has been one of the three
largest providers of electricity in West Africa, servicing Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin and Togo in
the recent past. However, lack of spare capacity and rising domestic demand have led to reduced
exports, and these are unlikely to recover until 2010-11. Meanwhile, the electricity sector has
incurred significant financial losses in 2007-08 due to rising fuel costs, greater reliance on
thermal power and unchanged power tariffs. The electricity sector`s drain on the budget in 2008
is projected to be about CFAF 60 billion.

3.15 An efficient and adequate provision of electricity will be critical for the country's
and the sub-region's economic growth but this service is threatened by years of minimal
maintenance and an investment freeze, which has resulted in growing technical losses due to
overloaded equipment and increasing outages. The sector also faces serious financial and
institutional weaknesses. Gas prices continued to increase during 2007 and 2008 since, under the
existing contract, they are directly linked to international oil prices. Continued difficulties in bill
collection, in particular from the Government sector and clients in the North, contributed to the
current financial deficit of the electricity sector. In March 2007, the Government signed a
protocol with the CIE to settle all outstanding cross-arrears and avoid accumulating any new
arrears, but new cross-arrears soon accumulated. An increase in electricity prices (by 10 percent
on average) to bring them closer to energy prices in the region and reduce the budgetary subsidies
(0.4 percent of GDP in 2007) was implemented in July 2008.

3.16 On the other hand, oil exports remain strong and represented, in 2007, 28 percent of
the country`s total export revenue. Oil exports now exceed cocoa exports, which traditionally
have been the mainstay of the economy. The oil sector`s contribution to government revenues is
projected at FCFA 385 billion, or 18.8 percent of the total, in 2008. In 2007, Côte d`Ivoire
produced an average of 48,000 bbls/day of oil and 140 MMBTU of gas. Although technical
problems have affected the level of production, output is expected to increase over the medium
term thanks to the coming on stream of new fields, as well as on-going field enhancement and
planned maintenance work. However, the country has been relatively less successful than its


                                                  15
neighbors in attracting sizeable investment for the development of its deep-offshore potential,
and the monetization of its gas reserves.

The Government's reform program

3.17 As part of its efforts to enhance governance and transparency in the energy sector,
while improving the efficiency of its operations, in 2007 the Government commissioned
three audits, financed by the World Bank, in the areas of: (i) oil and gas exploration,
development and production; (ii) oil refining; and (iii) electricity. The first audit included a
review of the organization of PETROCI and its relationship with the Ministry of Mining and
Energy. It was completed in December 2007 after a workshop was held to review its findings.
The audit provides several key recommendations to improve the effectiveness and transparency
of the Government`s management of the upstream hydrocarbon sector, and increase the level of
revenues and other benefits derived by the Government and PETROCI from the exploitation of
the country`s hydrocarbon resources. The second audit, a financial, technical, and operational
diagnostic of the SIR oil refinery was completed in September 2008 and found SIR to be one of
the best run refineries in the region and the industry. The audit also led to practical
recommendations on how to maintain its competitive advantage and improve its operational
efficiency through targeted measures in technical areas as well as enhancement of its
management and capacity building of its workforce. The third audit, covering the electricity
sector, was also completed in September 2008 and adopted by the Government the following
month. Among other things, it proposed streamlining the number of agencies involved in the
sector and strengthening regulation and transparency.

3.18 The results of the audits provide the basis for developing a strategy and action plan
to strengthen the efficiency and management of the energy sector at large and to improve
the transparency of the related physical and financial flows. To that end, the Government
                                           Oil
has already made fully operational the  Committee to monitor energy production as well as
the revenues generated and their allocation. This committee, which reports to the Minister of
Mining and Energy and to the Minister of Economy and Finance, is responsible for monitoring:
(i) the management of oil and gas flows to optimize production and the technical and economic
life of the country`s assets, as well as the government`s share of revenues; and (ii) the production
and marketing of petroleum products. The committee has been preparing quarterly reports on the
physical, financial, and tax flows in the sector for the Ministers concerned and for information to
the Cabinet. These reports have been forwarded to World Bank and IMF staff.

3.19 Planned Government reforms to enhance the transparency of petroleum revenue
and maximize its generation over time in a socially and environmentally sound manner
include: (i) the review and update of the existing legal, contractual and fiscal framework for
upstream petroleum activities; (ii) the development of a financial model and related operating
procedures to support the Government`s capacity to forecast and back-cast petroleum revenue;
(iii) the establishment of attractive and transparent procedures for the promotion of the country`s
sedimentary basin; (iv) improvement of the Government`s capacity to negotiate and supervise
petroleum contracts; and (v) measures to strengthen the social and environmental aspects of
petroleum operations by reviewing environmental regulations and standards, establishing a



                                                16
system for monitoring the implementation of the environmental management plans, and building
capacity for and performing a social and environmental assessment.

3.20 In addition, the Government has taken steps to adhere to the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative (EITI). On September 19, 2007, a conference was held in Abidjan
under the auspices of the World Bank Oil and Gas Policy Division for the launching of the EITI
process, in accordance with the Initiative`s internal rules and regulations. A Joint Council
chaired by the World Bank, which included 18 representatives from the Administration, Industry
and Civil Society attended the Conference. They were immediately constituted into the EITI
Office for Côte d'Ivoire for the year 2007 and adopted their agenda. The Joint Council was
charged to prepare the Charter of the EITI, elect the members of their council and a President,
prepare the Agreement of Adhesion (Membership Agreement), identify the means of
communication with civil society, and prepare the work program for the year 2007 and the 2008
budget. The Council met in November 2007, during which it approved unanimously the text of a
decree formally establishing the National Committee; the decree was subsequently approved in
January 2008 by the Cabinet and signed by the President in February 2008. The National
Committee has been established and an action plan was prepared with the objective to publish
the first two EITI reports in 2009, and achieve full validation in 2010. Financing of the action
plan has been partially secured through both a multi-donor trust fund, managed by the World
Bank, and the ongoing IDA-financed Governance and Institutional Development Grant.

3.21 The government also intends to adopt a restructuring plan to improve the electricity
sector's long-term efficiency and restore its financial viability based on the recommendations
of the audit of this sector. This plan includes: (i) streamlining the entities functioning in the
electricity sector, by clarifying their role, eliminating overlapping responsibilities and, thus,
reducing their operating costs; (ii) transfer of the sector`s assets to SOGEPE`s accounts; (iii)
strengthening the regulation of the electricity sector by changing the role and status of the
regulatory agency ANARE, with the aim of developing its autonomy and granting it real
regulatory authority; (iv) setting up a shared financial model and transparency in the tariff
adjustment procedures; and (v) reviving rural electrification and accelerating improved access to
energy, by establishing an entity dedicated to securing access to concessional funds and carbon
financing. The Government`s medium-term strategy for electricity is spelled out in a letter of
sector policy adopted in February 2009.

3.22 In addition to the above policy measures, the Government intends to further
strengthen and develop the sector with the technical and financial support provided by the
planned IDA-financed Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (US$50 million) and other
donor support for:

       Upgrading, expanding and restructuring the distribution network in Abidjan and other
       urban areas to reduce losses and increase availability and security of power supply.
       Preparatory studies for priority generation and transmission projects as well as energy
       efficiency projects in order to bring them to a bankable` stage of preparation, allowing
       the Government to catch up with demand growth and the needed upgrading of power
       infrastructure in the zones previously controlled by the Forces Nouvelles.


                                               17
       Institutional studies and capacity building to improve sector organization, regulation and
       management.

3.23 To increase generation capacity, the World Bank Group is also exploring the possibility
to participate, through a partial-risk guarantee and IFC support, in an expansion of the Azito gas
power station which would increase production by 150 MW.

Prior actions under the proposed EGRG II and follow-up reforms

3.24 The proposed EGRG II would support two policy actions judged to be critical to
advance reforms in the energy sector, namely: (i) completion of the audit of the electricity
sector and submission to IDA of a letter of sector policy, satisfactory to the Association,
reflecting the key recommendations of the audit and aiming to improve the efficiency and restore
the financial viability of the sector; and (ii) making operational the National Committee for EITI
and adoption by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of a work program and budget for this
committee for 2008-09. The letter of electricity sector policy will provide a roadmap for reforms
and facilitate the return to the sector of other development partners, whose support in tackling the
massive investment backlog is urgently needed.

3.25 A new PRSC series would support the next stage in the Government's energy sector
reform program. Policy measures that will be considered for PRSC-1 would be: (i) taking
actions needed to clarify SOGEPE's legal status as the electricity sector asset holding company
and issuing a decree confirming the transfer of all state-owned electricity sector assets to
SOGEPE; and (ii) recruitment of the EITI administrator, and finalization and publication of the
EITI report for fiscal year 2006. In addition, the Governance and Institutional Development
Grant is supporting the Government`s broader program of petroleum reforms, and the planned
Urgent Electricity Development Project will help improve electricity supply, as described in
paras 3.20 and 3.22.

3.26 Two additional energy sector actions have been identified as HIPC completion point
triggers aimed at improving transparency on financial flows in the mining, oil and gas sectors:
(a) regular public reporting of payments to, and revenues received by, the government for the
extractive industries (mining, oil and gas) in line with the EITI criteria, with a recent annual
report during at least the year immediately preceding the completion point; and (b) annual
publication, within seven months of the end of the fiscal year, of the certified financial
statements, in accordance with international standards, of PETROCI for at least the year
immediately preceding the completion point.

              STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE, TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY
                              IN THE COCOA SECTOR


Current issues

3.27 The cocoa sector has long been saddled with excessive taxation and significant
governance problems and has been in need of a thorough reform and improvement in


                                                18
governance and transparency. Côte d'Ivoire is the world`s largest cocoa producer, with about
40 percent of total world production; cocoa accounts for one quarter of its exports and roughly 17
percent of public revenues. Approximately 700,000 small holder families (about 4 million
people) depend on the sector for their main source of income. However, inadequate producer
incentives and poor management of the sector`s agencies have limited cocoa`s contribution to
rural growth and poverty reduction. Following the demise of the Government`s Price
Stabilization Board in the late 1990s, a number of entities with uncertain legal status and
overlapping responsibilities were established to manage the sector. Between 2001 and 2007, it is
estimated that a staggering CFAF 3.2 trillion (US$6.4 billion equivalent) were extracted from the
sector as fiscal (US$5.0 billion) and quasi fiscal levies (US$1.4 billion). In relative terms,
overall taxation represented about 35-40 percent of the CIF price leaving a small share - 35 to 40
percent of the CIF price ­ to farmers. As a result, roughly 60 percent of cocoa growers now live
below the poverty line according to the PRSP, and these households accounted for some 28
percent of the poor nation-wide. Action to improve incomes among cocoa producers could have
a significant impact on poverty reduction. For this reason, reducing cocoa taxation is a major
focus of this operation, in combination with broader cocoa sector reforms supported by the IDA-
financed Governance and Institutional Development TA Grant and other donors. (See Annex 9
for an analysis of the impact of a reduction in cocoa taxes on poverty.)

3.28 The entities responsible for investments in the sector have failed to provide a
complete account of their capital expenditures. It is estimated that about half of the
investments have been used to acquire companies unrelated to the sector and substantial amounts
were also diverted to the Government for security related expenditures. The entity responsible
for compensating the producers for declines in world cocoa prices fell far short of its objective
when prices fell in 2003. The entities` combined budget was over three times as much as the
budget of the old Price Stabilization Board, even though they only had 43 percent of the
employees (430 as compared to about 1,000).

3.29 The cocoa sector has been remarkably resilient during the recent crisis. Despite
mounting difficulties, cocoa has continued to provide badly needed incomes in the Southern
region of the country as well as critical revenues for the government. Cocoa output has been
relatively stable throughout the crisis (fluctuating between 1.3 and 1.4 million tons over the last
four years), not including volumes smuggled out to neighboring countries. This resilience is
remarkable considering the prevailing adverse conditions: (i) insecurity/violence and the forced
displacement of a significant portion of the labor force due to land and ethnic disputes
exacerbated during the conflict; (ii) the widespread prevalence of rackets at roadblocks on the
main transport routes; and most of all; and (iii) the compression of farm-gate prices due to the
very high level of taxation, which is undermining production incentives and driving large
volumes of Ivorian cocoa to be smuggled into Ghana and other neighboring countries where
prices are higher.

3.30 The negative impact of the current adverse institutional environment has so far
been mitigated by favorable prices on the international market (cocoa prices surpassed
US$3,000/tonne in June 2008 for the first time in over 20 years, and were still holding at
US$2,700 in February 2009). International prices are projected to remain high over the medium
term, only gradually declining thereafter as future global supply is expected to increase more


                                                19
rapidly than demand. The longer term prospects of the sector in Côte d`Ivoire are a source of
growing concern. Yields are low (400-500 kg/ha), due to poor maintenance of plantations and the
steady deterioration in the quality of cocoa beans (due to problems in fermentation, drying and
storage at farm level), resulting in a lower price on the world market. Also, plantations are
rapidly ageing as planting/replanting incentives are dwindling and competition from other crops,
such as rubber, is increasing. An estimated 50 percent of total plantations is more than 30 years
old. It is thus urgent to address the major constraints ­ agronomic, economic, institutional and
social -- that threaten the sector`s future development.

The Government's reform program

3.31 In 2006-07, the authorities took initial steps to streamline cocoa sector management
by: (i) gradually reducing fiscal and quasi-fiscal levies from CFAF 53.15/kg for the 2005/06
season to 46.46/kg for 2007/08; (ii) channeling part of the quasi-fiscal levies to a rural
investment fund (Fonds d'investissement en milieu rural, FIMR), which was established to help
finance rural infrastructure (feeder roads, water supply, schools and health centers) to benefit
cocoa farmers, and whose disbursements require joint approval by the Ministers of Economy and
Finance, and of Agriculture; (iii) creating a Cocoa/Coffee Committee in February 2006 to review
and monitor programs and projects financed with the bulk of these levies, and report to the
Ministers concerned; and (iv) communicating the budgets for key cocoa entities (ARCC, FRC,
BCC and FDPCC) for 2007 and extracts from their accounts certified and closed for 2006 to the
Cabinet, the IMF and the World Bank and making them public.

3.32 However, subsequent developments have underscored the need for more
fundamental reforms and created the necessary pressure to achieve them. In 2007, the
purchase by one of the cocoa entities (FRC) of a cocoa processing plant in New York State in
2004 was identified by the US authorities as a possible instance of money-laundering,
implicating the heads of the FRC. Also, a growing number of farmers began to openly question
the management of the sector, even threatening drastic action if their demands were not met. In
October 2007, these mounting pressures led President Gbagbo to take the unprecedented action
of ordering an official judicial investigation into the management of the cocoa and coffee
organizations. A number of senior managers of these organizations were subsequently arrested
and are currently in jail. Thus, it appears that there is, for the first time in recent times, a
constituency for substantive change.

3.33 The government is committed to comprehensive cocoa sector reforms. The
Government announced in September 2008 that the four cocoa entities would be placed under
new temporary management by a transitional committee (Management Committee for
cocoa/coffee) to handle the current campaign, rationalize the four entities, and reduce their
operating expenses. It has also developed a program to improve the quality and quantity of
production. A second committee has been formed to coordinate the reform of the cocoa sector
and define the appropriate permanent institutional set-up. Internal audits have been conducted for
all four entities, and external audits will be completed to permit their reorganization or
liquidation, the possible recovery of funds and help define the new organizational structure of the
cocoa sector. The Government is also dealing with the inadequacies of farmer representation in



                                                20
sector governance by conducting a comprehensive census of cocoa farmers. This will enable the
election of leaders who represent the farmers and are accountable to them. A letter of sector
policy has been adopted by the authorities with support from the World Bank; a sector strategy
will next be formulated to define the roles and responsibilities of all the stakeholders and the
rules of the game, including the definition of the sector`s institutional set-up. Only in this way
can farmers be empowered and competition among traders improved so that an increased share of
the world price is passed on to producers.

3.34 The Government is also committed to further reducing taxation (fiscal and quasi-
fiscal levies). The Government issued an indicative farm-gate cocoa price of CFAF700/kg for the
2008-09 season, a 56 percent increase from the CFAF 450/kg in the previous season. Following
modest earlier reductions, the Government has reduced the total amount of quasi-fiscal levies
collected on cocoa by CFAF 15.2/kg from CFAF 46.46/kg in 2007/08 to CFAF 31.26/kg for the
2008/09 season. To improve transparency and financial management, the component of these
levies allocated to the FDPCC (CFAF 5/kg) is being held in a fund for investments in the sector,
with strict reporting requirements. With the elimination of the FRC fund and the improved
oversight of the utilization of FIMR and FDPCC funds, the accountability for the use of quasi-
fiscal levies has been strengthened.9 The Government also intends to reduce the export tax
(DUS) on cocoa from CFAF 220/kg in 2008/09 to CFAF 210/kg, and to reduce quasi-fiscal
levies from CFAF 31.26/kg to CFAF 26.26/kg for the start of the 2009/10 season. The
government will also consider allocating at least an additional CFAF 5/kg to investment in the
cocoa sector, with strict and transparent governance arrangements involving multiple
stakeholders. Because of the increase in the international cocoa price and to alleviate its fiscal
position, the Government temporarily increased in 2008 the registration tax from 5 to 10 percent
of the CIF price, which amounts to about CFAF 120/kg at current prices. This increase was
required to meet exceptional needs resulting from the costs of holding elections, clearing arrears,
and implementing the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program. However, this is
a one-off event for the current cocoa campaign and the Government intends to reduce the
registration tax to 5 percent of the CIF price for the 2009-10 season. In addition, the Government
also plans to incorporate into the budget all quasi-fiscal investment levies to increase
transparency in their use.

3.35 Over the next two or three years the government is committed to major reforms
which would have a direct positive impact on the income of cocoa farmers. It has already
agreed to reduce total indirect taxation of the cocoa sector to no more than 22 percent of the CIF
price, from the current level of approximately 32 percent. This change is informed by the analysis
of recent studies by the World Bank and the EC on cocoa taxation in Côte d`Ivoire and would
bring the country closer to the practice in other major cocoa exporters. The conversion to
uniquely ad valorem taxes will also ensure that the impact of any decline in the international
price does not fall exclusively on the producers. This reform has been accepted as a HIPC
completion point trigger (see para. 3.39). The authorities also plan to examine the level of
competition in the sector and introduce appropriate measures that would increase the bargaining
power of producers, including the rehabilitation of rural roads and the strengthening of farmer

9
  In the medium term, it is expected that a new, more accountable, inter-profession will be established which will
create its own fund through voluntary contributions, thereby replacing some or all of the quasi-fiscal levies.


                                                       21
organizations. However, even more important will be the interventions proposed to raise farmer
productivity, both through increased output and improved quality.

3.36 The sector will therefore require a set of more fundamental institutional reforms
that IDA would support under the ongoing Governance and Institutional Development Grant and
a follow-up PRSC series. The Government will launch the participatory preparation and
implementation of a strategy for the development of the sector, which would need to include: (i)
a clear definition of the Government`s responsibilities and limits in the management of the
sector; (ii) building a viable interprofession` enabling transparent management by the
stakeholders of the sector`s common goods (pricing, policy, research, quality, traceability
including for social issues); (iii) increasing competition in marketing; (iv) introduction of
marked-based instruments for managing risk, in particular at the farmer level; (v) promotion of
economically efficient local transformation of the cocoa bean into higher value added products;
(vi) environmentally sustainable rehabilitation of ageing orchards; and (vii) improved quality.

Prior actions under the proposed EGRG II and follow-up reforms

3.37 The proposed EGRG II would support three actions judged to be critical to improve
governance, transparency and efficiency in the cocoa sector. First is a further reduction in the
total amount of quasi-fiscal levies on cocoa during the 2008-09 campaign by CFAF 15/kg
relative to the amount collected the previous season. Second, quarterly reports on investment
projects, approved for 2008 under the Rural Investment Fund, or FIMR, the FDPCC-Investment
Fund, and the FRC-Prudential Reserve, including the status of their implementation, for the first
three quarters of 2008, are communicated to IDA. Third, draft internal audit reports of the
ARCC, BCC, FRC and FDPCC have been prepared, a committee has been put in place to
manage the restructuring of the sector, and a letter of cocoa sector policy, satisfactory to the
Association, has been adopted by the Government to launch the restructuring of the sector.

3.38 The medium-term reform agenda in cocoa would be pursued in future development
policy operations. In advance of a prospective PRSC-1, and by the start of the 2009/10 season,
the Government would be expected to (i) reduce the registration tax from 10 percent to its 2007-
08 level of 5 percent of the CIF price, with no increases in other taxes and mandatory levies in
the cocoa sector, reduce the export tax (DUS) from CFAF 220/kg to CFAF 210/kg, and reduce
quasi-fiscal levies from CFAF 31.26/kg to CFAF 26.26/kg; (ii) complete and make public an
external audit of FIMR`s operations and use of resources for the period 2007-2008; and (iii)
complete and make public an external financial and organizational audit of the four cocoa entities
(FRC, BCC, ARCC, and FDPCC), and complete and publish the inventory of their assets and
various obligations/debts.

3.39 Other cocoa sector reforms have been identified as a HIPC completion point trigger
to improve the efficiency of the sector and the living standards of the many Ivorians who depend
on it. These are reduction in the overall indirect taxation of the cocoa sector to no more than 22
percent of the CIF price, adoption by the government of a new institutional and regulatory
framework for the cocoa/coffee sector, and satisfactory implementation of the functions under
the government`s responsibility for at least six months immediately preceding the HIPC
completion point, based on its new strategy for development of the sector.

                 STRENGTHENING FINANCIAL SECTOR SOUNDNESS AND TRANSPARENCY

Current issues

3.40 The financial sector was adversely affected by the crisis and needs substantial
restructuring. Banking activities in the Center, North and West of the country ceased after the
crisis began. Institutions with heavy exposure to small and medium-sized enterprises and weak
sectors, such as transport, were the hardest hit. Credit risk increased, but after peaking at 26
percent by end-2004, the share of nonperforming loans to total credit fell to about 17.7 percent by
end 2007. Larger, mostly foreign-owned banks refocused their operations on large enterprises to
strengthen their balance sheets. However, compliance with prudential norms worsened, and, as
of end-2006, 9 out of 18 banks did not respect the capital adequacy ratio, six banks were not
observing the minimum liquidity ratio, and five smaller banks had negative equity. Since March
2007, banks have begun to reengage in the Center, North and West of the country and are
gradually increasing their activities.

3.41 The current situation10 of the financial sector is characterized by: (i) a mixed
performance in the banking system, with some large banks in good financial standing, and other
banks not in compliance with the prudential standards; (ii) a savings bank (CNCE) in a difficult
financial situation; (iii) the National Investment Bank (BNI), which depends for its liquidity on
significant payments from the State and needs to redefine its objectives; (iv) a microfinance
sector in disastrous condition (net worth is negative for the sector as a whole); and (v) heavily
overdrawn pension schemes, with high deficits both on a cash and actuarial basis. In addition,
the judicial system does not contribute to the respect of contracts or debt recovery. There are
also weaknesses in the level of supervision of the financial institutions.

3.42 Five small commercial banks had negative equity in June 2008 and were in need of
recapitalization. Four of them submitted recapitalization plans to the Banking Commission of
the BCEAO but only two of these plans were approved. These two banks implemented these
plans and regained a position of positive net worth by January 2009. A third bank has also
attracted sufficient new capital to eliminate its deficit situation. However, it still needs to submit
a recapitalization plan for approval by the Banking Commission, as do the remaining two banks.

3.43 The main institution in the microfinance sector is the National Union of Savings and
Credit Cooperatives (UNACOOPEC). It is an important institution in Côte d`Ivoire, because of
its weight in the financial sector and its role in providing services to the low-income population.
It represents 92 percent of the microfinance sector, with CFAF 81 billion in deposits as of July
30, 2008, and 160 savings institutions. UNACOOPEC has 817,077 members/accounts which is
more than for all 18 commercial banks (804,555). The average deposit in UNACOOPEC is low
(CFAF 99,000) compared to the average deposit in the banks (CFAF 277,000), reflecting the low
incomes of most of its members. Given its importance for poor households, reforms to recover its
delinquent loans and eliminate its negative equity should be accelerated and implemented by the
authorities as soon as possible.


10
     The analysis is based on a financial sector review conducted jointly by the World Bank and the IMF.


                                                           23
3.44 The Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne (CNCE) is the dominant savings
institution in the country. The commercial banks are not keen to expand their services to small
towns and rural areas in light of the significant costs that this entails and the limited volume of
activities. CNCE, because of the size of its network (180 branches and service outlets across the
country), could fill that gap. There is an initiative to strengthen CNCE`s role in promoting access
to financial services, including its transformation into a bank with supervision by the Banking
Commission. However, at present, the CNCE is in a "vicious circle" characterized by limited
investments and the preponderant role of the State, which leads to poor quality in its financial
services and a declining market share.

The Government's reform program

3.45 Some progress occurred over the last few months and the authorities intend to build
on this to reform the sector. Three out of the nine commercial banks whose equity levels did
not comply with the risk coverage ratio are being recapitalized. A new Nigerian bank, UBA, has
started operations and a second one, Access, has acquired 75 percent of the capital of an Ivorian
bank. The entry of the new foreign banks, significantly more capitalized than the Ivorian banks,
will change Côte d`Ivoire`s banking landscape. In addition, the BCEAO increased the minimum
capital of the commercial banks from CFAF 1 billion to CFAF 5 billion for new banks starting
from January 2008, with existing banks given three years to reach that level. BCEAO turned
back the application of the CNCE for a banking license, requiring a more in depth analysis. This
is an occasion for the authorities to re-examine the future of the savings bank. A development
strategy for the microfinance sub-sector, together with an action plan, was discussed with the
parties concerned in September 2007 and approved by the Cabinet in October 2008. Finally, the
actuarial studies of the Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance Sociale (CNPS) and of the Caisse
Générale de Retraite des Agents de l'Etat (CGRAE) have been completed and parameter reforms
to bring the pension system closer to equilibrium are under discussion.

3.46 In its pursuit of financial sector reform, the Government is planning the following
actions:

       Development, in liaison with IDA and the IMF, of a short and medium term action plan
       for financial sector reform. Such an action plan will include two phases: (i) financial
       stabilization, including banks and microfinance restructuring; and (ii) financial deepening
       reforms, aimed at improving access to financial services (for small and medium sized
       enterprises, rural zones, long-term resources), including supply side measures (new
       instruments, institutions, mechanisms) and demand side measures (improvement in the
       transparency of the companies, including through reliable financial statements).
       Launch of an in-depth restructuring of the microfinance sector. This will be done on the
       basis of the national microfinance sector strategy which has been approved by the
       Cabinet. Particular attention will be given to UNACOOPEC to bring its net worth back
       into positive territory through intensive loan recovery. It is expected that management
       can recover 25 percent of nonperforming credits per year. Over two years, this would
       recapitalize UNACOOPEC. This target is considered realistic given that most of
       delinquent borrowers are members of the mutual. Recapitalization of UNACOOPEC is


                                                24
       of critical importance given its overwhelming weight in the sector, its systemic
       importance, and the crucial role to be played by the microfinance sector in growth and
       poverty reduction. In case the objective is not achieved, management should be changed.
       Parameter reforms in the Government employee pension fund (CGRAE) to contain the
       growth of its structural deficit, which remained at some 0.5 percent of GDP in 2007. The
       authorities also intend to amend the law regulating CGRAE with, inter alia, the objective
       of putting into decrees the modification of parameters (contributions and calculation of
       benefits).

Prior actions under the proposed EGRG II and follow-up reforms

3.47 The proposed EGRG II would support the following policy actions judged to be
critical to strengthen financial sector soundness and transparency, namely: (i)
recapitalization plans, satisfactory to the Banking Commission, for two commercial banks with
negative equity as of December 31, 2006, as per the report of the Banking Commission, have
been finalized; (ii) a financial and operational audit of BNI has been completed; and (iii) a
microfinance strategy, satisfactory to the Association, has been completed, and approved by the
Cabinet.

3.48 Policy measures that would be considered for PRSC-1 would focus on the following:
(i) the three commercial banks with negative equity in 2008 and no approved recapitalization
plan by October 2008 have submitted such plans to the Banking Commission and have
implemented them; (ii) the Government has overseen the implementation of the restructuring
plan established after the inspection of UNACOOPEC, including the recovery of at least 25
percent of non-performing loans; otherwise, the Government will impose appropriate sanctions
on UNACOOPEC (including the replacement of its management); and (iii) the Government has
finalized a revised application for a banking licence for CNCE, incorporating the write-off of
unrecoverable debt, and submitted it to the Banking Commission.


   4. WORLD BANK GROUP'S SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                           LINK TO THE INTERIM STRATEGY NOTE

4.1    The Interim Strategy Note (ISN), discussed by the Board in April 2008, sets out the
Bank Group's support to the Government's reform program for the period FY08-FY09.
The ISN has three main objectives: (i) supporting the government in the implementation of the
Ouagadougou Accord; (ii) assisting war-affected populations through community rehabilitation
and support for the provision of basic social services; and (iii) strengthening economic recovery
by supporting governance reforms and transparency, capacity building, and closing infrastructure
gaps. The ISN foresees the use of development policy operations, investment projects and trust
fund resources, and the undertaking of analytical and advisory activities. Given the fiscal
pressure on the budget, notably on account of high debt service obligations, the amount of the
proposed grant has been increased from the level indicated in the ISN.



                                               25
4.2      The proposed EGRG is an integral part of the ISN as it directly supports the third
pillar, i.e., government-owned reforms for economic recovery. The EGRG`s focus is specifically
on improving governance, transparency and efficiency in public expenditure management as well
as advancing structural reforms aimed at strengthening governance and supporting sustained
growth in key sectors of the economy (energy, cocoa and financial sectors). The proposed
reforms are essential to the Government`s ability to use public resources efficiently and
effectively to support the country`s economic and social recovery. These actions will be followed
by a more comprehensive program of reforms that the Government has developed in its Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper, which it adopted in February 2009. The reforms could be supported
by a PRSC series focusing on continuing and further deepening reforms in the areas covered by
the proposed EGRG II.

                     COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANK ACTIVITIES

4.3      The proposed EGRG II is closely coordinated with and is complementary to
Government's reforms supported by several IDA-financed ongoing or planned operations
and advisory services in the areas of its focus. The Government`s program of reforms in the
PFM, energy, cocoa and financial sectors is supported by IDA under a well integrated and
sequenced series of instruments. The Governance and Institutional Development TA Grant
(US$13 million approved by the Board in June 2008) is providing financial and technical
assistance for institutional strengthening and governance reforms beyond the horizon of the
EGRG II. Specifically, it supports efforts to strengthen Government`s capacity to: (i) enhance
efficiency and transparency in the use of public resources; (ii) manage the development of its
hydrocarbon resources in an environmentally and socially sound and sustainable manner; and
(iii) foster governance and efficiency in the cocoa sector. Following the EGRG II, future
Government`s reforms in these areas could be supported by a follow-up PRSC series. The HIPC
Initiative also supports reform progress in these areas by focusing several completion points on
critical PFM, cocoa and energy sector reforms (see Section 3).

4.4      Other complementary support is provided by IDA under a LICUS Trust Fund
recovery package of US$6.4 million approved in June 2006 which includes support for
strengthening governance and post-conflict planning. The LICUS program also includes support
for civil registry modernization and the national identification process jointly designed with the
EC (approved in May 2008) and for helping finance employment creation for youth at risk.
Recently, new LICUS funding of US$1.5 million was approved to support the PRSP process and
facilitation of the Ouagadougou Accord. Third, the ongoing Post-Conflict Assistance Project
(US$120 million) provides support, among other things, for the redeployment of the public
administration in the Center-West-North areas of the country. Fourth, the Rural Land and
Community Infrastructure Development Project­­Projet National de Gestion des Terroirs et d'
Equipement Rural - with US$28 million of undisbursed funds, is being reactivated and
restructured in support of the post-conflict recovery of agricultural activities and the
strengthening of rural sector institutions. Fifth, an Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project
currently under preparation is expected to support improvements in the sector`s operational
efficiency, through the reduction of technical and non-technical losses.




                                               26
           COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNER PROGRAMS

4.5     The proposed EGRG II complements or leverages the support of other development
partners. The specific areas of IDA support have been identified in close collaboration with the
IMF and in consultation with other development partners, in aiming for synergy with their
respective interventions and building on IDA`s comparative advantage in these areas. It is
expected that these institutions will continue to collaborate closely during implementation of the
program supported by the proposed EGRG II, especially through joint dialogue with the
authorities, and joint missions and analytical work.

4.6     IMF and IDA staffs have coordinated closely on the identification of the respective
institutions' areas of focus and have worked together on the HIPC process. In August 2007
the IMF Board approved an Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) for Côte d`Ivoire in an
amount of SDR 40.6 million (about US$62.2 million). A second EPCA in an amount of
SDR40.6 (about US$66.2) was approved by the IMF Board in April 2008. These EPCAs are a
bridge for IMF support under a three-year PRGF program expected to be presented to the IMF
Board in March 2009. The IMF and IDA staffs have coordinated closely their advice on
governance and other economic issues and reforms, and arrears clearance, and have collaborated
closely on the HIPC process. Also, both institutions supported the preparation of the
Government`s Poverty Reduction Strategy. The IMF also participated actively in the PEMFAR
and is providing technical assistance in the area of revenue administration.

4.7    The AfDB and IDA staffs have also coordinated closely in supporting the
Government's governance reform program as well as arrears clearance and the HIPC
process. Côte d`Ivoire`s arrears owed to the AfDB Group stood at US$536 million equivalent at
December 31, 2007, with US$523 million equivalent for AfDB and US$13 million equivalent for
ADF loans. Full arrears clearance to the AfDB Group is expected for March 2009 through an
operation under the framework for assisting fragile states. Grants amounting to two-thirds of the
amount of the arrears would be provided by the AfDB Group under its Fragile States Facility
(FSF) while the remaining one-third has been financed by Côte d`Ivoire. Shortly after the arrears
clearance, the AfDB Group would disburse new budget support under the FSF. The AfDB is
also providing assistance for strengthening of Government capacity in the area of governance
reforms.

4.8     Bilateral donors are also supporting various elements of the authorities' efforts
towards post-conflict recovery. The European Union and France are supporting the post-
conflict and governance and transparency agenda, including in the area of preparation of the
recently completed PEMFAR. Also, the European Commission has an allocation for possible
budget support.

                                 ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

4.9    The design of the EGRG II has benefited from recent or ongoing analytical Bank
reports, as well as close policy dialogue on the key sectors covered by the operation. These
include a study of cocoa taxation in 2002, analytical papers prepared in 2004 documenting long-
term growth performance and competitiveness, a 2006 analysis of poverty including the impact


                                               27
of cocoa taxation, experience from a series of LICUS grants in 2006-08 in support of the social
dimensions of the peace process and a recently completed post-conflict Social Assessment. A
2006 EC report on optimal taxation in the cocoa sector has also been useful. The Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review, completed in May 2008, has
provided: (i) a diagnostic analysis of the current strengths and weaknesses in the country`s public
financial management system and practices; (ii) input for the design and preparation of the next
phase of the PFM reform strategy, including a time-bound sequenced action plan of priority
reforms; and (iii) a rating of all key components of the PFM system against international
benchmarks which can be used to judge future progress of PFM reforms.

4.10 In addition, Bank's recent analysis and dialogue with the authorities in the energy,
cocoa and financial sectors, as part of recent missions, have laid the basis for the proposed
grant. Also, the country`s macroeconomic performance and planned policies have been analyzed
in the context of recent, joint missions of the Bank and the IMF and the joint preparation of the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative Decision Point Document. Underlying this exercise is a shared Bank
and IMF understanding of recent and post-conflict growth prospects.

4.11 The Bank has also assisted the Government in updating its knowledge of the status
of poverty in the country. A poverty diagnostic study was prepared jointly by the Bank, the
National Statistic Institute (INS) and the PRSP preparation team and, in May 2007, the Bank
sponsored a seminar in Abidjan to disseminate the findings. A household budget survey was
completed in August 2008 and its results have been an important input for the preparation of the
poverty reduction strategy.


               5. THE PROPOSED SECOND ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE
                           AND RECOVERY GRANT

                                DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION

5.1      The Government's broad economic recovery program is outlined above in Section 3.
This program constitutes the reference framework behind the Government`s Letter of
Development Policy (LDP) attached as Annex 2 and its policy matrix in Annex 3. Through its
LDP, the Government has requested that IDA support an important subset of the reforms outlined
in its strategy, primarily in the economic governance and transparency area.

5.2     Given the complex post-conflict environment and past governance and transparency
issues facing the government, the key objective of the proposed EGRG II is to support
government-owned reforms to improve governance, transparency and efficiency in public
expenditure management as well as advance structural reforms aimed at strengthening
governance and transparency in key sectors of the economy. Specifically, it would focus on
supporting the Government`s efforts to restore the normal budget cycle and strengthen budget
preparation, execution, controls and accountability. In addition, it would contribute to enhancing
private sector confidence, investment and growth recovery through improved governance and
transparency in the energy, cocoa, and financial sectors. This strategy would lead over time to
regularized financial relations with the country`s creditors, strengthened fiscal sustainability, and



                                                 28
improved economic governance and enhanced transparency of State institutions and processes in
the key sectors, and, together with other elements of the Government`s strategy that commit it to
pro-poor spending and support for economic growth, prepare the stage for anticipated debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI.

5.3     The proposed grant would support selected reforms in the government's program
described in Section 3 and in its LDP that are deemed essential to its successful implementation.
The table below details these prior actions. The rationale for their selection has been discussed
in Section 3, namely their importance to the program and expressed government commitment
and feasibility. The prior actions for EGRG II are derived from indicative policy measures that
were identified during the preparation of EGRG I. There have been some limited adjustments to
take into account exogenous factors not under the control of the Government (notably delays in
the completion of the electricity sector audit) and the need for more time to prepare a
comprehensive and participatory strategy for the development of the cocoa sector, given the
significant institutional overhaul of the sector which the Government has committed to
undertake, and for financial sector restructuring. It should also be noted that these prior actions
are part of a well integrated and sequenced series of reforms whose implementation would
continue to be supported by the Governance and Institutional Development Grant, a PRSC series,
the HIPC Initiative and the IMF three-year PRGF program. Compliance with these prior actions
as defined in the Financing Agreement forms the basis for IDA to proceed with the proposed
operation. Annex 3 details the full Government`s program of reforms in the governance area,
including the prior actions in the table below.

                      FURTHER ACTIONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM

5.4     In addition to the actions taken prior to provision of the proposed grant, other
policy measures will be considered, and the results evaluated, for possible future budget
support from IDA through the first of a PRSC series. These measures, which would aim to
further improve governance, transparency and efficiency in public expenditure management as
well as in the key sectors of the economy (energy, cocoa and financial sector), include:

                          Box 5.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership

The proposed EGRG II is fully aligned with the Government`s reform program focusing on improving public
expenditure management and strengthening governance and transparency in the key energy, cocoa, and financial sectors.
This broad program of reforms also underlies the policy dialogue with the Bank, IMF, and the AfDB, which closely
coordinate their activities. The unit responsible for the EGRG program within the Government is the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, which has championed these reforms. In order to reinforce ownership at the sectoral level, the
Ministry of Economy and Finance has coordinated the dialogue with working groups and teams including other
government agencies and organizations (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Mining and Energy, and the
BCEAO).

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework

The Government`s reform program supported by the EGRG II is summarized in the policy matrix in Annex 3. The core
of the program was developed during intensive policy dialogue with the authorities during 2008 and builds on the earlier
findings of the PEMFAR, LICUS grants, the two IMF-supported EPCAs, and the Social Assessment. The program has
been closely coordinated with and supported by other development partners such as the IMF, AfDB and bilateral
donors. The expected results of the program supported by the proposed grant are detailed in para. 5.5.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances

The policy matrix is customized to the country circumstances. Elements of its reform program are drawn from existing
country analytical work, the recently adopted PRSP and the ongoing preparation of sectoral strategies (e.g., cocoa
sector).

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

The policy matrix uses a limited set of ten prior actions for Board presentation. The chosen policy measures were
identified jointly with the Government and in close consultation with other development partners (notably the IMF and
AfDB). Conditionality is focused only on key actions which would help move the Government`s agenda forward. The
conditionality of EGRG II is also coordinated with and is complementary to the program of Government reforms
supported by other IDA instruments (see para. 4.3-4.4), the EPCAs and expected three-year PRGF program.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support

IDA staff has worked in close coordination with the IMF, AfDB and bilateral donors in supporting the Government`s
reform program. Going forward, IDA staff will continue to coordinate closely with these institutions to support and
monitor program implementation, which contributes to more predictable and performance based financial support in the
future.



                                  ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF THE PROGRAM

 5.5    The supported program targets the underlying structure for long-term reforms.
 Within this structure, there are specific results that are expected by the grant closing date of
 December 31, 2009. These include:

                           6. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                     COUNTRY OWNERSHIP

6.1      The proposed operation is supported and owned by the authorities, as indicated in
the Government's Letter of Development Policy (LDP). The specific reforms it supports are
critical elements of the Government`s strategy to re-launch growth and enhance governance and
transparency in public sector resource management, and the energy, cocoa and the financial
sectors. These reforms were designed with the broad involvement of the Government`s relevant
ministries and agencies under the championship of the Minister of Economy and Finance. They
also emerge as key elements in the PRSP, and that process has provided an opportunity to foster
national consensus across the Ivorian society and among Government representatives on a
medium-term reform agenda.

                                      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

6.2     Strengthening Government systems. The fiduciary standards in Côte d`Ivoire have
suffered from the crisis but remain strong relative to those in other WAEMU countries in some
respects, notably in the preparation of budget execution bills and in financial management
systems. Nevertheless, there is need for further improvements in fiduciary standards. This is a
central objective of the public financial management component of the proposed operation and
the Government has made encouraging progress in implementing measures to enhance public
resource management and transparency. These early measures provide a platform for deeper
reforms in the context of the proposed operation and complementary ongoing and planned IDA
and other donors` interventions (see Section 4).

6.3     These measures include the full reinstatement and application of normal budget
preparation and execution procedures; a significant reduction in the use of treasury advances;
regular publication of budget execution reports; clearance of the backlog of outstanding draft
budget execution bills to the Chamber of Accounts; and implementation of public procurement
reforms aiming at separating policy from execution and control functions as provided by the
WAEMU's procurement directives. Building on the PEMFAR findings and recommendations,
the authorities plan to adopt shortly a reform program to further strengthen budget formulation,
implementation, reporting, cash management and control. These measures are accompanied by
ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and efficiency in the energy sector, notably through the
follow-up of the recommendations of the financial, technical and operational audits of the energy
sector (completed during 2008), including financial relations between the Government and
oil/gas producers and other agencies. The authorities have already joined the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The authorities have also reduced quasi-fiscal levies in
the cocoa sector, increased the allocation of levies to rural investment, and strengthened
government oversight of such resources.

6.4   In 2005, the IMF staff carried out an on-site safeguards assessment of the Central
Bank of the West African States (BCEAO), the common central bank of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union, which includes Côte d`Ivoire. The assessment found that



                                                35
progress had been made in strengthening the BCEAO`s safeguards framework since 2002 when
the last safeguard assessment was undertaken. The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited
financial statements and improvements have been made to move financial reporting closer to
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IMF staff noted that the BCEAO has
improved the explanatory notes to the financial statements and further changes are scheduled for
the next fiscal year, with a view toward a gradual alignment with International Accounting
Standard, as adopted internationally by other central banks. Furthermore, an internal audit
charter has been put in place, mechanisms for improving risk management and risk prevention
have been established and follow-up on internal and external audit recommendations has been
strengthened. The assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help
solidify the progress made in recent years. The main recommendations relate to: (i) improving
the external audit process by adopting a formal rotation policy and further enhancing the
transparency of the financial statements by adopting IFRS in full; and (ii) enhancing the
effectiveness of the internal audit function by further strengthening the reporting to management
of the BCEAO. The status report of the implementation of recommendations, received from the
Bank in March 2007, indicates that some progress was achieved.

6.5     Technical Assistance. Durable gains in transparency, effectiveness of the financial
management systems, and accountability will require sustained and coordinated engagement of
Côte d`Ivoire`s international partners in support of the Government`s reform process. The IMF,
through West Africa AFRITAC, is providing technical assistance in public financial management
and tax administration to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The PEMFAR, including a
CFAA and CPAR components, has generated knowledge and identified areas in particular need
of remedial action and supported the preparation of a comprehensive Action Plan by the
Government. Also, establishment of a baseline of current PFM and procurement practices using
the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Initiative and OECD/DAC
guidelines will enable evidence-based monitoring of improvements in the near future. As a result
of the PEMFAR, which was jointly prepared with the IMF, the African Development Bank and
other donors such as the European Union and France, priority technical assistance to strengthen
public financial management was identified for additional coordinated donor support. IDA is
providing financial and technical assistance in this area through a LICUS Trust Fund and the
Governance and Technical Assistance Grant approved in June 2008 (see paras. 4.3 and 4.4).
Donor assistance will help the Government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are
applied to provide reasonable assurance that government resources are used for the intended
purposes. An important objective is to achieve compliance with international standards of
financial management, such as those agreed under the PEFA Initiative and the OECD/DAC
guidance on quality and performance of national procurement systems.

                  GRANT ADMINISTRATION, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

6.6     The proposed operation would consist of a single tranche grant of SDR 96.4 million
(US$150 million equivalent) to be available upon effectiveness and disbursed on the basis of a
withdrawal application. The Grant will follow the Bank`s disbursement procedures for
development policy operations. Once the Grant becomes effective, the government of Côte
d`Ivoire will submit a withdrawal application to IDA requesting that the proceeds of the Grant be


                                               36
deposited in the BCEAO into a dedicated account that forms part of the country`s official foreign
exchange reserves. Within five working days upon the deposit of the Grant into said account, the
Borrower shall ensure an equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower`s budget management
system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank and to finance management expenditures, and the
Borrower will also report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account
and credited to the budget management system. Disbursement would not be linked to specific
purchases. When the funds are disbursed from the dedicated account in order to finance
government expenditures, the official exchange rate for that day will be used. If the proceeds of
the Grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will
require the Recipient to refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA promptly
upon notice from IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

6.7     The account designated by the Recipient into which financing withdrawals will be
deposited will be agreed at negotiations and reflected in the agreed minutes of negotiations.
An amount equivalent to the amount of the financing so deposited will be credited to an account
of the government to finance budgeted expenditures. The specific mechanism for accounting for
such amount in the Recipient`s budget management system will also be agreed at negotiations
and reflected in the minutes.

                                   ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

6.8     The specific reforms supported by the proposed development policy grant are not
likely to have significant negative impacts on the country's environment, forests and other
natural resources. The reforms supported aim primarily to strengthen economic governance at
the national government level. However, the operation touches on two sectors, energy and
cocoa, that have very significant associated environmental risks.

6.9    A Social and Environmental Assessment (SEA) is being launched with support from
the ongoing Governance and Institutional Development Grant. It will identify potential negative
impacts of the energy sector, with particular emphasis on offshore petroleum developments, and
determine their likely size and probability. It will also examine the institutional capacity to deal
with such impacts, and propose regulatory, procedural and institutional improvements for the
prevention and management of the potential social and environmental impact of petroleum
operations. Draft terms of reference for the SEA have been agreed upon with the Government.

6.10 The Bank is also supporting the preparation of a Strategic Environmental
Assessment of the cocoa sector. This is being prepared under the ongoing post­conflict Country
Environmental Analysis (CEA) and will analyze the impact of cocoa sector reforms being
considered by the Government on forestry, biodiversity, and more broadly on land use. The
assessment reviews the sector`s institutional and legislative framework for the management of its
environmental impacts. Also, the forest cover analysis taking place under the CEA will provide
the basis for assessing the impact of cocoa sector expansion/rehabilitation on the forest resource.
In addition, the assessment examines the need for improvement of environmental impact
assessment procedures for investments in processing factories. It is expected that the findings of
the assessment will be reflected in the Government`s cocoa sector strategy.

                                      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

6.11 The proposed EGRG II is expected to have a significant positive direct impact on
poverty reduction. The EGRG builds on the findings of the June 2006 World Bank report
 Côte d`Ivoire ­ Contributions to the analysis of poverty11 that found poverty increasing against
the backdrop of continued decline in per capita income, and the recently completed Social
Assessment. The emphasis on cocoa reforms is particularly important given the large number of
poor rural households producing cocoa, which are estimated to account for 28 percent of the poor
in Côte d`Ivoire (see Annex 9). Both partial and general equilibrium analysis confirms that
reduced cocoa taxation will improve the incomes of cocoa producers.12 By one estimate, a 10
percent reduction in cocoa taxes would increase the value of cocoa output by 16 percent.
Furthermore, improvements in the cocoa sector will raise the rural wage, thereby benefiting rural
laborers who are generally among the poorest and most difficult to assist.

6.12 Other elements of the proposed grant are also pro-poor. There are likely positive
distributional effects from the improved public financial management and key reforms in the
energy and financial sectors. Specifically, efforts to improve the capacity of the State to
implement its budget priorities and strengthen public financial management would enhance
efficiency, transparency and accountability in public resource use, and increase the country`s
absorption capacity for external resources. Improving governance and transparency in the energy
sector should strengthen Government revenues and increase pressure to ensure that they are used
for enhanced expenditures for basic social services. Reforming the financial sector would help
re-launch small and medium enterprises, which have been severely affected by the crisis;
strengthening the microfinance institutions should benefit the poorer and more vulnerable part of
the population.13 The grant would also help increase the fiscal space to fund the provision of
basic public services with a beneficial impact on the poor.

6.13 Planned ESW and TA will reinforce the impact on poverty reduction. Studies will be
financed under the IDA-funded Governance and Institutional Development Grant to support the
cocoa reform agenda. These will include specific analysis of the degree of competition in the
cocoa sector and concrete measures to improve the bargaining power of producers. A Financial
Sector Assessment will incorporate poverty implications in its analysis of the status of, and
reforms required in, financial institutions.

                                     MONITORING AND EVALUATION

6.14 In line with the arrangements under the first EGRG, the Ministry of Economy and
Finance will be responsible for overall implementation of the proposed EGRG II. Day-to-
day monitoring and evaluation of the program will be the responsibility of the General Director
of the Economy (DGE), the General Director of the Budget and Finance (DGBF), and the
11
   Report No. 36625-CI.

   The emphasis on reducing non-performing loans in UNACOOPEC (as a future prior action) should not have an
undue impact on the poor as many of the delinquent borrowers are urban non-poor. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of
UNACOOPEC would have a far greater negative impact on the poor.

General Director of Planning (DGP). This economic team will be placed under the supervision
of the Cabinet Director of the Minister of Economy and Finance. This arrangement was dictated
by the strength and continuity of the economic team and the dialogue on policies carried by them.
The arrangement proved satisfactory under the first EGRG.

6.15 The MEF economic team will also be responsible for monitoring the results of the
reform program supported by the proposed grant. The Government will provide quarterly
reports to IDA on implementation progress measured against the agreed performance indicators
detailed in para. 5.5. The overall reform effort will be reviewed by the Government in close
coordination with regular IDA missions to ensure continued implementation of the program
within an adequate macroeconomic policy framework.

                                   RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

6.16 In the current environment of the country emerging from conflict, the proposed
operation presents significant country and fiduciary risks. The Bank`s active engagement in
Côte d`Ivoire during this period of recovery is a high-risk, high-profile and potentially high-gain
enterprise. The greatest risk, however, is failing to support the peace and recovery process and
missing a window of opportunity for helping to stabilize a key country in an unstable region.
Thus, while there is no guarantee that conflict will not erupt again or that the process of inter-
Ivorian dialogue will not lead to a Government that has limited commitment to development, the
risks of inaction are much greater. The specific risks that could jeopardize the expected outcomes
and benefits of the proposed grant relate to political, governance, macroeconomic performance
and fiduciary matters.

6.17 Political risk. Possible political tensions related to the upcoming elections could lead to
delays in implementing the authorities` reform program and the reforms supported by the
proposed operation, jeopardize the attainment of program objectives, dampen donor support, and
provoke a resurgence of political instability. Specifically, resurgence of new rebel activity not
controlled by the current, unified government could undermine the peace and reengagement
process. Also, slow progress in addressing the most pressing social and economic problems
could lead to instability in volatile areas and adversely affect security conditions, the business
climate and macroeconomic management. The Government is pursuing efforts to improve
security. Notably, it has launched a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program and
 audiences foraines to address the identification problem underlying the conflict. While
mitigation of the security risk falls outside of the direct scope of this operation, it is expected that
continued international support for the peace process, including through the ongoing World Bank
Post-Conflict Assistance Project (US$120 million), would help mitigate this risk. Elections are
planned for 2009. When they do take place, and regardless of the results, changes may
subsequently occur in some government institutions, in particular the Ministry of Economy and
Finance, Mining and Energy, and Agriculture, who are directly involved in the activities and the
reforms supported by the proposed grant. The fact that there is an inter-ministerial coordinating
committee, and that this committee has been involved in the design of the operation since its
inception, has facilitated the buy-in of key governmental entities into the objectives of the
supported reforms and will help ensure continuity and commitment. Also, as indicated in para.



                                                  39
3.32, there is a broad-based constituency for substantive change in the cocoa sector, including
external and domestic stakeholders.

6.18 Governance and commitment to reform risk. Vested interest and political intervention
in the cocoa and energy sectors remain strong and could stall the reforms supported by the
proposed operation. The influence of these interests has become entrenched due to poor
governance and limited internal and external oversight that characterized the period since the
civil conflict in 2002. The coalition nature of the Government also means that it is difficult to
develop a consensus on some reforms. However, through the actions it has already implemented,
the Government has expressed its commitment to pursue and deepen the reforms launched.
There is now a broad-based constituency for substantive reform in the cocoa sector, including
external and domestic stakeholders. This has prompted Government to remove the leadership of
the four entities responsible for managing the sector and to launch a process of fundamental
reform. The proposed grant, as well as other IDA and donors` interventions, focus on advancing
and deepening reforms in the key sectors of the economy (PFM, energy, cocoa and financial
sector). Also, this risk can be mitigated by the continued intensive attention of the international
community to budget processes and frequent broad-based consultations with stakeholders,
including civil society organizations, to strengthen the case for reforms and Government`s
commitment to them. In this respect, intensive communication efforts on the Government`s
reforms and activities in the above areas will be supported by the Governance and Institutional
Development Grant to better inform the public and help build demand for governance and
transparency reforms. Trust funds are also being requested from the State- and Peace-Building
Fund to finance demand-side governance activities which will aim to strengthen the capacity of
the media to cover economic reforms and conduct investigative reporting. Furthermore, the up-
coming elections should help facilitate consensus-building by leading to a unified Government.

6.19 Macroeconomic risk. The country`s macroeconomic performance represents another
important risk to the operation. Economic recovery will depend critically on the Government`s
adherence to the medium-term macroeconomic framework elaborated in collaboration with the
IMF and the World Bank. Also, delay in moving to the HIPC completion point would raise a
risk of renewed arrears. In addition, the Ivorian economy is vulnerable to the vagaries of
weather, commodity prices and exchange rate fluctuations. The existing financial market turmoil
increases the risks of volatility in commodity markets for oil and cocoa and could put pressure on
the Euro to which the CFAF is pegged at a fixed rate against the US dollar and dampen export
demand and financial flows due to a possible deeper-than-expected global downturn. Since mid-
2007, the Government has implemented the macroeconomic program supported by two IMF
EPCAs and a three-year PRGF program is expected to be presented to the IMF Board in March
2009. The Government is committed to a rapid attainment of the HIPC decision and completion
points and to adjust the macroeconomic program to address possible exogenous shocks. The
IMF and IDA will continue to closely monitor the Government`s macroeconomic performance.

6.20 Fiduciary risk. The financial management assessment has concluded that fiduciary risks
are substantial mainly because of political instability and governance issues. This risk is
mitigated by the focus of the proposed grant on the improvement in fiduciary standards and
continued IDA assistance in public financial management and public administration which will
help to improve budget execution processes over time. In this respect, the PEMFAR has


                                                40
identified areas in particular need of remedial actions and technical and financial assistance
provided under the ongoing Governance and Institutional Development Grant is expected to
facilitate the amelioration of fiduciary standards.

6.21 In IDA's assessment, the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDA`s assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize
the sustainability of the reform agenda.

Mr. Robert B. Zoellick
President
The World Bank
Washington DC

Reference: Letter of Development Policy

Mr. President,


1.      This Letter of Development Policy (LDP) presents Côte d`Ivoire`s socio-economic
situation in 2008 and its prospects for 2009. It sets out the specific objectives and policies that
the authorities intend to implement in the context of the Government`s program in 2009. To
finance this program, the Ivorian Government is seeking the support of the international
community, including the World Bank, in the form of the Second Economic Governance and
Recovery Grant.

I. The Political and Economic Context

2.      Since 1999, Côte d'Ivoire has experienced a political crisis that led to an armed conflict in
2002 and the partition of the country. This crisis has significantly worsened the socio-economic
situation: real GDP per capita has declined significantly; basic social services have deteriorated,
particularly in the North, Central and Western (NCW) areas of the country, and the number of
displaced persons has exceeded one million. However, over the last years, the security situation
has gradually improved, and economic growth resumed modestly thanks to the maintenance of
economic fundamentals. In terms of public finances, in spite of a strong revenue performance,



                                                 43
the pressure generated by crisis-related expenditures and the prolonged suspension of foreign aid,
resulted in a significant accumulation of domestic and international arrears.

3.      Political Situation. The Ouagadougou Political Accord (OPA), signed on March 4, 2007,
by the President of the Republic, His Excellency Laurent GBAGBO and the General Secretary of
the Forces Nouvelles, Mr. Guillaume SORO, current Prime Minister, contributed to the gradual
normalization of the sociopolitical situation. To consolidate these gains, complementary
agreements have been signed to provide more details on the modalities for executing certain
points. The most recent, the 4th supplementary accord, came into effect on December 22, 2008
and covers: (i) the process of identification and elections, (ii) the defense and security forces, (iii)
the restoration of the authority of the State and the redeployment of the public administration
across the entire national territory, and (iv) financing the process of crisis-exit. The application of
this agreement will eventually permit the definitive end of the military crisis by the reunification
of the country, the establishment of a new army, and the organization of free and transparent
elections.

4.      The Government has thus established a roadmap and an action plan for the
implementation of the Agreement. The roadmap emphasizes the acceleration of the process of
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reinsertion (DDR); as well as the dismantling of militias, the
unification and restructuring of the army, identification of the population, organization of
elections and of public services across the entire country. Hearings have enabled the delivery of
686,755 substitute judgments. In September 2007, the prefectures were reinstated and local
government is becoming progressively operational in all 22 departments of the Center, North and
West (CNW) zones. The gathering of ex-combatants in designated sites, the dismantling of
militias and the process of identification have begun and are making good progress. The process
of enrolment for the electoral list and the identification of the population in Abidjan finished in
November 2008 and registered more than 2 million people.

5.      The Government has made progress in normalizing the socio-political situation and hopes
to benefit soon from the financial support of its development partners, notably the World Bank.
To this end, the government cleared all its arrears with the World Bank and partially cleared
those accumulated with the African Development Bank in 2008. The latter will be totally cleared
in early March 2009.

II.      The status of reforms in 2008
6.      The Government is committed to measures in the areas of public finance, the financial
sector, the energy sector and coffee-cocoa.

      a. Reforms in public expenditure management
7.      The return to orthodox budgeting has resulted in the reduced use of treasury advances, the
respect of monthly allocations, and monitoring of delays in handling files in the Integrated Public
Financial Management System (SIGFIP). Government has improved its three-monthly reporting
on budget execution to the Cabinet (including as of June 2008 the status of payments) and their
publication, including on the internet. To improve private sector confidence, the Government


                                                  44
took an inventory of domestic arrears as of end-2007 and adopted, in 2008, a plan to clear these
arrears over the period 2008-2010, in consultation with the private sector. The draft budget
execution bills for 2005 and 2006 were submitted to the Chamber of Accounts in September
2008. Concerning public procurement, a roadmap has been adopted in December 2008 which
elaborates on the separation of the functions of regulation, execution and control.

8.       Reforms pursued over the recent past have enabled the modernization and
computerization of fiscal administration and budget execution. SIGFIP covers all those involved
in the public expenditure process, and the decentralization of the system will be pursued in 58
localities serving as administrative centers of regions or departments, and will thereby enable
coverage of the entire territory.

9.      The Government has made efforts to improve revenue collection. It has tightened controls
on exemptions, reinforced customs (notably through the introduction of a scanner) and, on the
domestic front, introduced normalized bills. However, to combat fraud, the Government intends
to put in place a plan to redeploy financial and tax administration in the zones formerly held by
the Forces Nouvelles, notably customs posts on the borders, effectively enabling a single state
account across the whole territory.

10.     To improve financial management, the Government, with support from the World Bank,
the AfDB, and the European Union, conducted a public expenditure management and financial
assessment (PEMFAR). The results presented in January 2009 proposed immediate and medium-
term actions. In the short term, it proposed the separation of the regulatory, control and
execution functions in public procurement, the preparation and improvement of budget execution
and the reinforcement of the systems of internal and external control of budget execution. The
Government is committed to adopting an action plan based on the recommendations of the final
report.

   b. Energy Sector Reforms
11.     Since the beginning of 2008, the Government has undertaken a series of measures: (i) the
production and publication of quarterly communications to the Cabinet on physical and financial
flows in the sector; (ii) the compensation of debts and offsetting credits between the State and
CIE in 2007 ; (iii) the reduction of the k factor (protection of SIR) from 6 to 5% in May 2008;
and (iv) increases in July 2008 of the gasoline price at the pump by an average of 25% followed
by another reduction of 10% on average in November 2008, in response to the evolution of world
prices. The social problems generated by the last action and the conflicts related to the increasing
cost of living constrained the Government from introducing the automatic pricing mechanism for
petroleum products in 2008. As for adhesion to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI), the report for 2006 on the physical and financial flows in the extractive industries is
expected in the first quarter of 2009 and that for 2009 in the third quarter. Concerning the sub-
sector of electricity, the Government proceeded with an average tariff increase of 10% and began
negotiations with external clients, with a view to indexing tariffs to world markets. Due to
delays in starting the audit of the electricity sector, the action plan for the energy sector, taking
into account the recommendations of the three final audit reports (PETROCI, SIR and electricity)
has not yet been completed, but a letter of electricity sector policy has been approved.


                                                 45
   c. Reforms in the cocoa sector
12.     The Government has pursued its efforts to improve transparency and good governance in
the coffee/cocoa sector. Quarterly communications to the Cabinet are produced and published. At
the end of 2007, the Fund for Investment in the Rural Milieu (FIMR)--supervised by the
Committee for the Evaluation and Follow-up of Projects and Programs in the coffee/cocoa sub-
sector (CESPPCC)--began to implement social projects (health, education, village water supply
and rural roads) for the benefit of the rural population. Moreover, the Procurer of the Republic
took action to clarify the past management of resources in the sector and concluded by arresting
the principal managers of the sector. In September 2008, the former structures were relieved of
their mandates and put under the control of the Committee for the Management of the Coffee-
Cocoa sub-sector (CGFCC ), whose goal is to manage the 2008-09 campaign, and define--with a
consultative entity representing the sub-sector--a new strategy for the sector. The 2008-09
campaign saw a reduction in quasi-fiscal levies from 46.46 FCFA/kg in 2007/2008 to 31.26
FCFA/kg in 2008/2009, of which 12.5 FCFA/kg was for FIMR, 5 FCFA/kg was put in a special
account for investment, and the rest was for operations.

   d. Reforms in the financial sector
13.     The reform of the banking sector progressed in spite of certain delays. Three of the five
banks with negative equity at the end of December 2007 began the process of restructuring and
recapitalization and now have positive equity; the other two establishments are in the process of
completing their plans or seeking technical and financial partners in order to submit their revised
dossiers for approval by the Banking Commission. As for the BNI, the financial and operational
audit, including its role in the financing of the economy, has been completed. Following an
actuarial study of the CNPS, for which the old age branch is currently in deficit, draft legal
amendments of the Social Security Code have been prepared, with the objective of restoring
financial equilibrium and introducing complementary retirement. Concerning the CNCE, a plan
for partial absorption of its deficit before the end of the year has been concluded with the State
and an audit of the accounts and the information system was completed in July 2008.

   e. Other structural reforms
14.     The Government pursued its efforts in other structural reforms. The organizational,
judicial, operational and financial audit of CGRAE, the review of the legislative and regulatory
framework, as well as the actuarial study, were finalized in March 2008. They propose a
corrective scheme, in order to assure the long-term financial viability of the structure. For the
Autonomous Port of Abidjan (PAA), the draft conclusions of the financial audit, launched in
August 2008, have been received.




                                                46
       f. Program to clear arrears with the World Bank and the ADB
15.     In agreement with these Institutions, the Government totally cleared its arrears with
respect to the World Bank. As agreed with the World Bank, the Government reimbursed 50
percent of its arrears, an amount equal to 112.1 billion FCFA. The Government is getting ready
to clear the rest of its arrears (about 110 billion FCFA) with the ADB in early March 2009 at the
latest.

III.      The 2009 Program

                                         A. General Objectives

16.     The principal objectives of the program are to accelerate reconstruction and growth,
combat poverty and move toward the MDGs in a unified country with a climate of peace. The
objectives are consistent with our PRSP, which will serve to guide the coordination of the
program with civil society and development partners. The program for 2009 aims to: (i) achieve
real GDP growth of 3.7% ; (ii) reduce the rate of inflation to 3% and ; (iii) stabilize the overall
budget deficit (including grants, excluding the reduction of external arrears) to 1.2% of GDP.
The Government is determined to finalize with the IMF a medium-term program supported by a
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), which permits it to attain the decision point for
the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC), by end-March 2009.

17.     To reach these objectives, the Government will: (i) reduce macroeconomic and financial
disequilibria; (ii) assure the viability of debt; (iii) accelerate structural reforms; and (iv) create a
suitable institutional framework for the private sector. The improvement of the management of
public resources will be pursued in order to create the fiscal space necessary for social services
and basic socio-economic infrastructure and to ensure a greater transparency. The Government
also intends to pursue: (i) restructuring of the coffee/cocoa and energy sectors; (ii) reform of the
public administration for improved effectiveness; (iii) reform of social security for financial
equilibrium; and (iv) reinforcement of the financial sector. A special emphasis will be placed on
the promotion of good governance and the deepening of reforms of the judicial and regulatory
framework to strengthen the rule of law and guarantee the security and free movement of goods
and people.

                       B. Governance, transparency, and structural reforms

       a. Governance and transparency
18.     The Government has placed good governance and transparency at the center of its
economic program. It intends to implement its action plan for the management of public
finances. These actions focus on the harmonization of fiscal systems and public financial
management with the guidelines of WAEMU, a reinforcement of controls and the systematic
publication of budget execution reports and reports on other public resources, notably from the
coffee/cocoa and energy sectors. Moreover, the Government intends to adopt a national plan to
fight corruption and illicit wealth before the end of 2009, as well as a code of ethics in the
ministries.


                                                  47
19.     During 2009, the Government will emphasize the implementation of structural measures
which have an impact on the economic environment and the transparency of public finances.
These measures should permit, in the long term, the creation of the basis for more profound and
extensive structural reforms. The Government will focus notably on: (i) the strengthening of the
capacity and accountability of managers in financial administration and parastatals; (ii) the
reinforcement of controls; and (iii) the improvement of communication (including the
publication) of the results of public policies.

   b. Reforms in public expenditure management
20.     The 2009 budget aims to pursue the consolidation of public finances while responding to
exiting the crisis, in the context of normalization of financial relations with the external partners.
Thus, a primary fiscal balance of 0.9% of GDP is projected, which will permit progress toward
debt sustainability and the reduction of domestic arrears. Moreover, the budget will incorporate,
as of 2009, the quasi-fiscal investment levies for the Fund for Investment in the Rural Milieu
raised from coffee-cocoa, as well as all dividends from parastatals.

21.      Budget management and accounting systems (SIGFIP and ASTER) will be fully
exploited to control and monitor budget execution and generate reports on budget execution at
least once every quarter. To achieve this objective, existing budget execution procedures will be
strictly respected, and reliance on treasury advances will be reduced. The Government has taken
measures to ensure the training of credit administrators. Deadlines for handling expenditures will
be established for the different actors involved in budget execution and this will be monitored by
SIGFIP. The Government also envisages an increase in 2009 of the number of audits carried out
by the General Finance Inspector (IGF), as well as the number of independent audits of the major
public enterprises. To this end, the staff and technical capacity of the IGF and the Department of
Shareholding and Privatization (DPP) will be strengthened.

22.    To improve the framework for managing resources and public spending, the Government
intends to elaborate and implement a reform plan based on the conclusions of the PEMFAR
conducted by the international financial community, notably the World Bank, the African
Development Bank and the European Union.

   c. Reform of the energy sector
23.     The Government is determined to pursue its efforts on transparency and reform of the
energy sector to improve effectiveness and the contribution to government revenues, with
support from the World Bank. For the hydrocarbons sub-sector, it intends to reinforce the legal
and regulatory framework, and to apply international accounting norms for the oil and gas
production sector, strengthen negotiation capacity and the surveillance of contracts and, on the
basis of the financial audit, formulate an action plan to increase state revenues. Following
membership in EITI, the state has committed itself to pursue the steps needed to conform to EITI
validation, notably the production and publication of annual reports which are consistent with
EITI criteria. In the electricity sub-sector, it intends to adopt and implement a restructuring plan
based, among other things, on the audit of the sub-sector, to reestablish its financial equilibrium,




                                                 48
reinforce public-private partnerships, increase electricity supply and improve interconnectivity in
the sub-region.

   d. Reforms of the cocoa sector
24.     The Government plans to pursue its efforts of institutional reform in the coffee/cocoa
sector in order to raise farmers` incomes. By the end of 2009, it will adopt, with the support of
the World Bank, a sector strategy including a new institutional, regulatory and legal framework.
The strategy will emphasize improvements in marketing, and intermediation in order to ensure
that planned reductions in taxation largely benefit the farmers. To this end, the strategy will aim
to reinforce both the marketing power of the farmers (through rural investments) and competition
between buyers (through obligatory posting of domestic and world prices); while preserving
those small and medium export enterprises (PMEX) and COOPEX which are efficient.
Moreover, the Government will budgetize the revenues from quasi-fiscal investment levies
(FIMR) on coffee­cocoa, reduce the registration tax from 10% to 5%, reduce the DUS by CFAF
10, and reduce quasi-fiscal levies by at least 5 FCFA/Kg for the 2009/2010 campaign.

   e. Reforms of the financial sector
25.     The Government will continue to support the efforts of the WAEMU Banking
Commission, to ensure that banks conform to prudential norms and apply the recommendations
of the Commission. It will oversee, in the context of the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) of the IMF and the World Bank, the recapitalization and/or restructuring of banks in
difficulty. The authorities will reinforce the financial services provided to small enterprise and
the rural operators through better supervision of microfinance institutions (of which the largest
will be supervised by the Banking Commission as soon as the revised banking law is in effect),
as well as a restructuring and/or consolidation, based on the National Microfinance Strategy
(SNM). The framework for fighting money laundering (LBC) is in place and adoption of the law
against financing terrorism is expected in early 2009. The National Unit for Managing Financial
Information (CENTIF) is already operational and will follow up on adherence to the two laws,
and will emphasize in particular the sensitization and training of actors, among other ways,
through its Internet site.

26.     The Government will pursue reforms of public financial institutions. Concerning the
CNCE, the Government plans to progressively reduce the implicit subsidy, in the context of a
change in its status. As for BNI, it plans to implement the recommendations of the financial and
operational audit, finalized in November 2008, before the end of 2009. With regards to the
CNPS, the Government plans to launch reform using the actuarial study, in order to reduce the
deficit of the retirement branch as of 2009; it will respect the due dates for the state`s debt service
toward the CNPS.

   f. Reforms of the business environment and the promotion of good governance
27.   To reaffirm its commitment to the creation of a general climate of good governance, the
Government intends to implement specific actions with a view to improving the business




                                                  49
climate, to promote ethics in the civil service and effectively fight corruption and promote good
governance. More specifically, this will involve:

       Improvement of the business environment : (i) training of judges and their auxiliaries
       in the laws of OHADA (100 judges, 35 court clerks, 10 bailiffs, 12 lawyers, 12 notaries in
       2009) ; (ii) the restructuring and computerization of offices of the court clerks and the
       commercial registry and real estate credit (revision and application of the status of court
       clerks, optimization of the functional organization of services, computerization and
       implementation of OHADA management software before the end of 2009).

       Ethics in the civil service: (i) elaboration and adoption by Cabinet of the Ethics Code for
       Ministries, before the end of 2009; (ii) the reinforcement of transparency and
       accountability in the public administration, in 2010.

       Combating corruption and promoting good governance: (i) ratification of United
       Nations and African Union Conventions on fighting corruption, before the end of 2010;
       and (ii) elaboration and adoption of the National Plan for Good Governance and the Fight
       against Corruption, before the end of 2009.

   g. Social programs
28.     The Government is committed to reversing the deterioration of the social situation
resulting from the crisis. As described in the PRSP, poverty and social indicators have declined
badly. The Government`s strategy in the social area and the reduction of poverty elaborated in the
PRSP is defined around measures focused on more and better targeted interventions favoring the
priority sectors of education, health, security and basic infrastructure. The Government plans to
develop a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) with priority given to the sectors of
education and health, and to increase the budget allocations for these sectors from 4,5% and
0,9% of GDP respectively in 2008 to 4,7% and 1% of GDP in 2009.

29.     With the aim of achieving education for all by 2015, the Government has elaborated a
post-crisis plan for education. This plan aims, among other things, to increase access to
education, while improving quality and maintaining students in the education system. To this
end, the Government envisages an increase in the number of teachers and classrooms (faster than
the rate of growth of the school-age population) to reduce class size and increase teaching
capacity. For health, the Government has laid out the second National Plan for the Development
of Health (PNDS) for the period 2009-11. It aims to improve access to the health system on the
one hand and its efficiency and effectiveness on the other hand. The Government will rehabilitate
and construct the health infrastructure of all the health centers and improve the accessibility of
essential medicines.

   h. The PRSP and HIPC process
30.    The Government has finalized its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in January
2009. It adoption by Cabinet is expected in February 2009. The Government expects to achieve
the decision point in March 2009. To achieve this objective, it is committed to: (i) clearing its



                                               50
arrears to the ADB; (ii) conducting satisfactorily the Emergency Post-Conflict Program (EPCA);
and (iii) taking the necessary measures to obtain approval of an IMF program supported by the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).


IV.    Monitoring and evaluation

31.     The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for the implementation of all
programs concluded with the World Bank. Daily monitoring and evaluation of the program will
be the responsibility of the technical steering committee for the post-conflict program, chaired by
the Director General of the Economy (DGE).

32.     I hope that the orientations and commitments taken by the Government will permit a
much more vigorous re-launching of financial cooperation with the World Bank and all other
multilateral and bilateral partners, and thus enable us to benefit from the EGRG II budget support
operation in 2009.




                                         Yours sincerely

CÔTE D'IVOIRE - Assessment Letter by IMF Staff for the World Bank
February 27, 2009

Overall performance since mid-2007 under two programs supported by Emergency Post-
Conflict Assistance (EPCA) has been broadly satisfactory, except for important fiscal
slippages and delays in implementing structural measures. The authorities improved revenue
collection, achieved primary basic surpluses, made large repayments to the World Bank and
AfDB (totaling 3 percent of GDP during 2007­08), and made progress on structural reforms,
especially to improve governance in public resource management. These results were
achieved under difficult domestic and global circumstances, including the surge in world
food and fuel prices. A Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement and the
HIPC Decision Point are scheduled to be considered by the IMF Board in late March 2009.

Background
1.      Since mid-2007, Côte d'Ivoire has implemented two programs supported by
EPCA, approved by the IMF Board in August 2007 and April 2008. The programs aimed
at removing constraints to post-conflict recovery, addressing fiscal imbalances while creating
fiscal space for social services and crisis-exit programs, and relaunching structural reforms,
with a focus on governance. Under the two EPCAs, the IMF disbursed a total of SDR
81.3 million (25 percent of quota). During the period, Côte d`Ivoire completed arrears
clearance with the World Bank, made progress in becoming current on debt service to the
AfDB, and initiated discussions on debt restructuring with Paris Club and commercial
creditors.

2.       IMF missions in October 2008 and February 2009 reviewed macroeconomic
developments and performance under the 2008 EPCA-supported program and held
discussions on a new PRGF arrangement. The mission found that progress toward political
stability and reunification had contributed to a modest economic recovery and to a consensus
building on key structural reforms. GDP growth has picked up to 2.3 percent in 2008, thanks
to a reversal of output declines in many industrial sectors. In 2009, assuming further progress
on political stability and reunification, growth could rise to 3.7 percent, despite the global
slowdown and lower commodity prices. Due to surging world food prices and adjustments in
domestic petroleum prices earlier in 2008, 12-month CPI inflation rose to 9 percent in 2008,
but is expected to decline to a path of 3 percent in 2009.

Performance under EPCA-supported programs
3.     There has been overall progress in implementing fiscal policies in 2007­08, but
the composition of spending improved less than planned. In both years, revenue
performance was close to target thanks to strong collection efforts on non-oil revenue and, in
2008, to favorable oil revenue which partly offset revenue shortfalls from food tax
exemptions introduced in April. In both years, total primary spending was broadly on target,
sovereignty spending (discretionary spending by the Presidency and Prime Minister`s Office)


                                              68
was contained, and social spending targets were met. However, in 2008, extra-budgetary
spending on large public works (0.7 percent of GDP) and overruns on electricity sector
subsidies (0.2 percent of GDP) occurred at the expense of rehabilitation investment and
crisis-exit programs, and contributed to missing the targets for the primary basic balance and
domestic arrears at end-2008. The extra-budgetary spending for large public works (mainly
for the new capital in Yamoussoukro and the renovation of a state-owned hotel) was executed
without public tender and paid for directly from the excess oil revenue, which should have
been used for reducing net domestic financing needs as envisaged under the program. While
in response the authorities made significant spending cuts in the last quarter, these efforts
proved insufficient to offset the overruns and the higher-than-expected revenue shortfalls
from food tax exemptions, and the 2008 target for the primary basic surplus was undershot by
0.4 percent of GDP.

4.     Financing of the 2008 program has been a challenge. The payment obligations for
large external (AfDB and World Bank) and domestic debt service required mobilization of
substantial domestic and WAEMU market financing. In the event, the lower primary basic
surplus, the tightening liquidity situation on the WAEMU market, and delays in donor
disbursements for crisis-exit programs and budget support (in part due to problems in
meeting donor requirements) created treasury difficulties. As a result, the government
postponed payment of its share in AfDB arrears clearance to early 2009 and accumulated
unplanned domestic arrears of 1 percent of GDP in 2008.

5.      There has been progress in structural reforms in public finance although a few
EPCA measures were implemented with delays. The authorities continued their quarterly
reporting on budget execution and on physical/financial flows in the energy and cocoa/coffee
sectors. They improved budget preparation and significantly reduced the use of treasury
advances; however, in the face of treasury difficulties, they resorted to borrowing from
domestic cocoa exporters, other enterprises and banks at very high interest costs. The
government adopted--and started implementing--a public financial management action plan,
based on the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR) undertaken jointly by World Bank, AfDB, European Commission and IMF. With
a half-year delay past the programmed dates, the authorities adopted a domestic arrears
clearance plan in November, and are expected to introduce the automatic petroleum pricing
mechanism at end-February. Regarding extra-budgetary spending, they established--by
Prime Minister`s instruction--safeguards to prevent it in the future and to ensure full
transparency of all oil revenue and investment spending.

6.      There was progress in other governance-related reforms. In the energy sector, the
authorities completed audits of the oil extraction, refinery, and electricity sub-sectors, and of
the distribution of petroleum products, and made progress in preparing Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI)-compliant reports for 2006 and 2007. They also completed
financial audits of the state-owned oil company (PETROCI), the Autonomous Port of
Abidjan, and the national investment bank (BNI). In the cocoa/coffee sector, they launched a
reform of the institutional framework by appointing a new committee--de facto replacing the
four existing structures--to manage the 2008/09 campaign and help prepare a new strategy
for the sector, and further reduced quasi-fiscal cocoa levies to enhance producer incentives.

Possible new PRGF arrangement and HIPC Decision Point
7.      IMF staff has reached agreement in principle with the authorities on a program
for 2009-11 that could be supported by a PRGF arrangement. This agreement is subject
to review by IMF management, before the arrangement is presented to the IMF`s Board for
consideration. The program`s broad objectives are to create fiscal space for pro-growth and
pro-poor spending; establish debt sustainability; make progress toward meeting the WAEMU
convergence criteria; enhance public financial management; pursue civil service reform;
further improve transparency and efficiency in the energy and cocoa/coffee sectors; and
enhance the environment for private sector development, including financial sector reform
(an FSAP mission is scheduled for late April and will also look at the ongoing restructuring
of six banks). The revised 2009 budget, agreed with IMF staff and expected to be adopted by
early March, reflects these objectives, especially a shift toward pro-poor and reconstruction
spending as well as strengthened tax and public expenditure management measures. The
program draws on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper that was adopted in February 2009.

8.      When considering the preliminary HIPC document in mid-December 2008, the
Boards of the IMF and World Bank found Côte d'Ivoire eligible for HIPC debt relief
under the revenue window. Based on 2007 data, showing NPV of debt-to-revenue of
327 percent compared with the 250 percent threshold, debt relief is estimated at about
US$3 billion of which US$1.6 billion was already received in debt relief beyond traditional
terms from Paris Club and London Club.

9.      A PRGF arrangement and HIPC decision point is scheduled to be considered by
the IMF Board in late March 2009, subject to the remaining prior actions being
implemented. The main remaining prior actions are: adoption of the revised 2009 budget and
implementation of the automatic pricing mechanism for petroleum products. In addition, the
authorities are expected to provide full information on the framework agreements for large
public works. Approval of a PRGF arrangement is also subject to Côte d`Ivoire obtaining
financing assurances for 2009, and reasonable expectations that the gap in subsequent years
can also be covered; a gap of 30 percent of GDP projected for 2009­11. Given the country`s
very fragile financial and debt position, coordinated donor support would be critical for the
successful implementation of the program, especially in the form of debt restructuring
(including for arrears totaling 20 percent of GDP) and program and project financing.
Risks
10.    There are risks related to policy implementation and the global financial crisis.
There is a risk of spending overruns related to the presidential elections (now expected to be
held by October) and crisis-exit programs, which could lead to curtailing pro-poor spending
and to domestic arrears. The domestic consensus to pursue structural reforms is fragile and
the modest progress on the governance front may stall. Also, a further decline in oil and
cocoa prices and a fall in trade flows could worsen the growth outlook and lower government
revenue. On the upside, international support for the program and the prospect of debt relief
could accelerate the recovery and provide a boost for the reform process.

              Annex 9: Cocoa Production, Taxes and Poverty in Côte d'Ivoire

1.      Export and other taxes on primary commodities produced in developing countries may
have substantial negative effects on producers. Export taxes can be explicit but they can also be
implicit, for example when prices paid to producers by state-controlled monopsonies are below
market value as determined by international commodity prices due in part to various levies
imposed by the monopsonies. Once fairly common in Africa, export and other taxes on
commodity production have been gradually reduced or terminated in many countries through the
implementation of trade and privatization reforms. In Côte d`Ivoire however, taxation of the
cocoa sector remains high. To some extent, because of its market power (the country accounts
for about 40 percent of world cocoa exports), there is a rationale for some level of export and
other taxes on cocoa production in Côte d`Ivoire. But at the same time, it is likely that much of
the burden of these taxes falls on producers who tend to be much poorer than the population as a
whole, and there is a consensus that the current level of these taxes is too high in comparison
with the limited benefits provided to producers using some of the proceeds from them.

2.     In this annex we rely on household survey data to assess whether we could expect a
reduction in poverty and an increase in social welfare with a reduction in export taxes and a
compensating increase in other taxes (such as the VAT) so as to leave total government revenues
constant. We focus on a few simple results. The analysis is based on data from the latest
nationally representative household survey conducted by the National Statistical Institute (INS)
in 2002. The survey sampled 10,800 households in five strata. It suggests that there were
700,000 cocoa producing households at that time, so that a population of close to four million
people was directly dependent on cocoa production.

3.      The key to assess whether an increase or decrease in export and other taxes on
commodity production will affect the poor consists in estimating the share of total production of
cocoa accounted for by poor households. The poor can be considered as being represented by the
bottom four deciles of per capita consumption (the poverty headcount measure in 2002 was 38.2
percent of the population). Table 1 indicates that 48.9 percent of the cocoa-producing population
falls in the bottom four deciles and is therefore below the poverty line. It also suggests that
cocoa farmers represent 28 percent of the poor in Côte d`Ivoire.

4.      Thus, cocoa taxes are likely to be regressive, and more so than other taxes such as the
VAT or a range of import taxes. The data suggest that a balanced budget tax reform that would
reduce cocoa taxes and increase other taxes to compensate for the loss in revenues from lower
cocoa taxes is likely to be pro-poor if the compensating taxes target goods consumed more by
better off households.

5.      The next question to be answered is what could be the impact on poverty of changes in
producer prices or a reduction in taxes. An answer to this question can be provided using fairly
strong, but also straightforward assumptions: we measure the income obtained from cocoa
production by households, assess the difference in income that would follow alternative producer
prices or a reduction in taxes, and assume that this difference in income translates into an
equivalent difference in the consumption per capita of households used to measure poverty.
More sophisticated methods could be used to measure the     general equilibrium effect of a drop
or increase in cocoa producer prices or taxes. The estimations given here provide only      first
round likely poverty effects from lower or higher producer prices paid to households, or taxes
implicitly paid by them.

6.      Results from the simulations are provided in Table 2. To interpret the data, note that in
2002 producers were receiving around 500 CFAF/kg according to the survey (median price per
kg among all producers). The baseline poverty headcount among producers in 2002, at 48.9
percent, was higher than the level of poverty in the country as a whole, 38.2 percent, suggesting
that cocoa producers are poorer than other groups of the population. The 2008 household survey
came to a similar conclusion, with poverty among cocoa producers estimated at 60.8 percent
compared to a national average of 48.9 percent. Table 2 shows that if the prices were to decrease
by 50 FCFA, the headcount index of poverty among cocoa producers would increase to 50.9
percent. If prices were to increase by 50 FCFA, the share of producers in poverty would decrease
to 46.6 percent. The increases in the poverty gap and the squared poverty gap are proportionately

larger, which suggests that the impact on poverty is large (the poverty gap and squared poverty
gap are better measures than the headcount index because they take into account how poor the
poor are, as opposed to only whether households are poor or not). The changes in poverty
measures for the population as a whole are always lower than the changes in poverty observed for
producers because only a subset of households are producing and selling cocoa. The impact of a
change in taxes could be assessed at least approximately (assuming pass-through from taxes to
producer prices) using the same data. For example, if a reduction in taxes would mean that
producer prices would increase by 25 FCFA/kg, we would use the data in Table 2 to assess
poverty impacts.

7.      This is only a partial equilibrium analysis, so it does not capture the second round effects
of the increased spending which would result from higher incomes for cocoa farmers. As these
farmers would likely spend a significant share of their increased income on rural goods and
services, the impact on other rural poor could be substantial.

8.      Because cocoa marketing has been liberalized in Côte d`Ivoire, there is no guarantee that
reduced taxation or increased world prices will automatically be transmitted to the producer. This
depends on a variety of factors including the producers` access to market information, the
strength of producer organizations, road access and the degree of competition in the sub-sector,
which will vary by region and village. No formal study has yet been conducted of price
transmission in the sector, but observers generally agree that there is significant competition at
least in readily accessible areas. For the 2007/08 campaign, there were roughly 100 certified
exporters (41 companies, and 60 small and medium enterprises and cooperatives), and over 500
buyers. Farmer access to market information is also strengthened by the Government`s practice
of announcing an indicative price at the start of the campaign, which is widely reported.

9.      The 2007/08 campaign provides some evidence on price transmission as the international
spot price rose steadily during the course of the season. As shown in Chart 1, the average price
paid at farm-gate did rise as the world price rose, and was eventually higher than the indicative
price of CFAF 450/kg) announced by the Government at the start of the season. The maximum
price paid in more accessible regions rose even more. While a more detailed study is needed,
there is good reason to believe that a significant share of the benefits from a tax reduction would
accrue to the farmers.
