The Bank's interactions were\n            highly valued. The Ministry of Health (MOH)'s\n            performance during the early stages of the project was\n            clearly affected by the lack of an experienced person as\n            deputy project coordinator, the person who had\n            responsibility for day today monitoring of activities.\n            Despite external training early in the project and efforts\n            by each supervision mission to assist the Project\n            Coordinating Unit (PCU) in utilizing project monitoring\n            systems for tracking activities as well as expenditures,\n            there was little practical follow-up. More serious, however,\n            is the fact that several project objectives were not met\n            either because anticipated activities never took place, or\n            the Government failed to follow-up as required. The major\n            lesson learned is that the project would have benefited a\n            lot from a strong start up foundation which would have\n            entailed a project launching, strong PCU with management\n            systems in place and frequent and consistent missions,\n            especially in the first two years of the project. Finally a\n            well established project documentation system to assist\n            during staff changeovers for both the Bank and the Borrowers."}, "docdt": "1994-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
