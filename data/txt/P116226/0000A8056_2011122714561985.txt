                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to (i) initially preserve and later expand the Popular Health Insurance's coverage of people without social security and (ii)
                         strengthen the capacity of the Commission (for social protection in health) and state health systems to effectively administer the entitlements of the Popular
                         Health Insurance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards the Project Development Objectives and Project implementation remains satisfactory. Most importantly, the National Commission of Social Protection in Health
                         exceeded the end-of-project target for Popular Health Insurance coverage. As of June 2011, 48.5 million people have been enrolled and covering practically 100% of people without
                         social security, exceeding the end-of-the-project target of 41.1 million.

                         the Project’s progress and did not modify the original project development objectives (PDOs) or the associated outcome targets.
