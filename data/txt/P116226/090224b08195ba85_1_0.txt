                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project was approved on March 25, 2010, became effective on December 17, 2010 and is closing on December 31, 2013.The original loan amount is US$1,250.0 million of
                         which approximately US$1,165.9 million or 93.3 percent of total loan amount has been disbursed.

                         Progress towards the Project Development Objectives and Project implementation remains satisfactory. The National Commission of Social Protection in Health exceeded the end-of-
                         project targets of three out of its four outcome indicators, including Popular Health Insurance (PHI) coverage. As of October 31, 2011, 52.8 million people have been enrolled in the
                         Popular Health Insurance (PHI), covering practically 100 percent of people without social security. With this, universal health coverage has been reached.
