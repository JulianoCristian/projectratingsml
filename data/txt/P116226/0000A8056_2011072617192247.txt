                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to (i) initially preserve and later expand the Popular Health Insurance's coverage of people without social security and (ii)
                         strengthen the capacity of the Commission (for social protection in health) and state health systems to effectively administer the entitlements of the Popular
                         Health Insurance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards the Project Development Objectives and Project implementation remains satisfactory. Most importantly, the National Commission of Social Protection in Health
                         exceeded the end-of-project target for Popular Health Insurance coverage. As of April 30, 2010, 46.3 million people have been enrolled and covering 95.7% of people without social
                         security (compared to the end-of-the-project target of 41.1 million or 85 percent).
