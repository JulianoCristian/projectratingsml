                         Progress towards the Project Development Objectives and Project implementation remains satisfactory. The National Commission of Social Protection in Health exceeded the end-of-
                         project target for Popular Health Insurance coverage. As of December 31, 2011, 51.8 million people have been enrolled in the Popular Health Insurance (PHI), covering practically
                         100% of people without social security and exceeding the end-of-the-project target of 41.1 million. With this, universal health coverage has practically been reached.

                         In addition to affiliation, other important achievements include: (i) a prominent increase in the number of affiliates receiving a health risk screening (Consulta Segura),(ii)
