1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.        In an effort to expand health care to those without social security and improve
health inequities, the Government of Mexico (GOM) revised the General Health Law and
established the Social Protection System in Health (Sistema de Protección Social en Salud --
SPSS) and its main pillar the Popular Health Insurance (PHI), also called Seguro Popular.1
The 2003 health reform had several objectives: (a) to increase funds earmarked to the public
health system and decrease the inequities in public expenditures across subsystems and states, (b)
to improve health outcomes and reduce out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for health services and
provide protection against catastrophic health expenditure, 2 and (c) to reform the organization
and functioning of the state health system to ensure better PHI management, and establish
incentives to promote equality, technical efficiency, and responsiveness. (Kurowski and Ortiz
2012)

2.        By 2009, the PHI had produced a number of positive results in Mexico’s health
system. An increase in public health expenditure, from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2003 to 3.0
percent of GDP in 2009, raised health spending on the population lacking health insurance,
reduced the differential on public expenditure between those covered by formal insurance
schemes and the uninsured (from 2.1/1 to 1.2/1), and narrowed differences across state spending.
(Bonilla-Chacín and Aguilera 2013) Investment in public health care reduced financial barriers
to health service access, increased utilization rates, and reduced catastrophic and impoverishing
health expenditures in new affiliates.

3.        Nevertheless, the PHI faced some important challenges regarding coverage
expansion and beneficiary entitlement awareness. The 2009 economic crisis, which resulted
in a brief though deep contraction of over 6 percent of GDP, and A/H1N1 influenza outbreak
threatened the health gains achieved in the country, increased poverty and put pressure on the
finances of poor and vulnerable families. An expansion or at least maintenance of the PHI was
necessary in order to protect the health and finances of new affiliates relying on the system and



1
  In 2002 only half of the Mexican population benefitted from social insurance protection, largely via their employment
condition: the formal private sector workers through the Mexican Institute for Social Security (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro
Social - IMSS), and federal public sector workers through the National Institute for Social Security and Services for Civil
Servants (Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado -- ISSSTE). The self-employed,
underemployed and unemployed workers accessed health services through the State Ministry of Health or paid for private care.
Public health care, through the State Ministry of Health was funded from uncertain, residual budget allocations lacking explicit
entitlements. (Knaul et al. 2012)
2
  Unequal access to health care reduced equality of opportunity for a large portion of the population and left the majority of the
uninsured vulnerable to health care shocks. Unequal access to services partly reflected an unequal distribution of public health
spending across different institutions and among states. Public resources allocated to social security institutions were more than
double per capita of those assigned to those without social security. (Pueblita 2013) Furthermore, more than half of all health
expenditure in Mexico was financed OOP, much of it paid by poor and uninsured families. (Secretaría de Salud 2004) High out-
of-pocket costs reduced health care access and utilization for those with the highest need and exacerbated inequality.

                                                                1
those still lacking health insurance coverage. At the same time, beneficiary surveys in Mexico
revealed that many PHI affiliates lacked knowledge regarding their entitlements.

4.        The PHI also faced important challenges regarding the effective administration of
entitlements. The rapid increase in coverage did not automatically translate into the availability
of quality health care services. The limited number of pre-approved medical interventions,
fragmented nature of the Mexican health care system, combined with the lack of portability and
service convergence between health insurance programs and between states restricted the benefit
to affiliates and hindered the system’s performance. To improve administration capacity,
organization and managerial changes to the State Health Systems were necessary, in particular
expanding autonomy of the State Regimes of Social Protection System in Health (Regímenes
Estatales de Protección Social en Salud – REPSS) and strengthening their functions. The lack of
accountability regarding PHI federal funds also suggested stronger performance management
arrangements between the Commission and State Health Systems.

5.        The Project was aligned with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) 2008 - 2013 (Report No. 42846-MX) discussed by the Board of Directors on
March 4, 2008, with the Government’s National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2012 and
supported progress on health-related Millennium Development Goal (MDGs). The Project
was closely aligned with two of the strategic development challenges identified in the CPS:
sustainable growth through investment in human capital and institutional strengthening. The
World Bank’s experience with the Mexican health sector and with health insurance programs
worldwide made it a natural partner in expanding PHI coverage and strengthening entitlement
administration. Further, across the globe, World Bank projects had begun to co-finance health
insurance premiums. The Project was a logical extension of this practice, financing the insurance
premium of the developing world‘s largest (both in terms of population and benefits) and highly
visible health insurance for people without contributory social security.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.       The PDO was to (i) initially preserve and later expand the PHI’s coverage of people
without contributory social security, and (ii) strengthen the capacity of the Commission 3 and
State Health Systems to effectively administer the entitlements of the PHI. The Project’s results
were measured via four PDO indicators and 15 intermediate results indicators. 4

The Project’s PDO indicators were: 5
   • PDO Indicator 1: Number of individuals affiliated with the PHI as a percentage of the
      total number of individuals that are not affiliated with a contributory social security
      system.


3
  National Commission of Social Protection in Health (CNPSS or “the Commission”).
4
  The numbering and sequence of indicators used in the ICR are the ones from the 2011 restructuring paper and are different from
the ones in the Project Apraisal Document (PAD). For the sake of brevity, the ICR uses “PDO Indicators” for “PDO Level
Results Indicators” and “Intermediate Indicators” for “Intermediate Results Indicators”.
5
  PDO indicators two and three were adjusted almost one year after Project effectiveness. See Section 1.3.

                                                               2
       •     PDO Indicator 2: Number of State Health Systems that collect information on system
             results (including beneficiary satisfaction and number, quality and cost of services
             delivered) that is validated, widely publicized and used for performance improvement
             recommendations by the Commission.
       •     PDO Indicator 3: Number of individuals affiliated with the PHI who have received a
             “Health Risk Screening” as a percentage of the total number of individuals affiliated with
             the PHI.
       •     PDO Indicator 4: Number of individuals affiliated with the PHI that report having
             received enough information to know their rights and obligations as a percentage of the
             total number of individuals affiliated with the PHI.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

7.       The original PDO remained valid and unchanged throughout Project
implementation. However, two PDO indicators were revised in November 2011 during the first
Project Restructuring (See Section 1.7).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.         The Project’s intended beneficiaries were individuals not affiliated with a
contributory social security system. For this population, the Project specifically intended to
benefit (i) 31.1 million individuals already covered by PHI: by preserving their coverage; (ii) 10
million individuals not yet covered: by providing new PHI coverage; (iii) 10 million PHI
affiliates (new or existing): from health risk screenings; and (iv) all 41.1 million PHI affiliates:
from improved information about and understanding of their rights under the PHI.



6
    The original indicator lacked baseline information and targets, which were established for the revised indicator.

                                                                   3
9.       The Project’s actual beneficiaries included: (i) 31.1 million individuals already
covered by PHI: by preserving their coverage; (ii) 24 million new affiliates who joined the
PHI during Project implementation; (iii) 22.8 million affiliates (new or existing) who
received a health risk screening; and (iv) 55.6 million (i.e. all) affiliates who benefited from
improved information about and understanding of their rights under the PHI. In addition,
both new and existing PHI affiliates benefitted from improvements in entitlement administration
and from enhancements in PHI performance and capacity. As shown in Section 3.2 and in Annex
2, the majority of new PHI affiliates were members of vulnerable groups in Mexico.

1.5 Original Components

10.       The Project consisted of two components, with the following initial loan allocation
(final expenditure in parentheses) and main activities (Annex 2):

11.        Component 1: Popular Health Insurance’s Coverage of People without
Contributory Social Security. US$1,239 million (US$1,250 million). The component aimed to
initially preserve and later expand the PHI’s coverage of eligible beneficiaries. Specifically,
Component 1 financed 70 percent of the federal social contributions to the PHI premium as
referred to in Article 77 of the General Health Law.

12.       Component 2: Capacity of the Commission and of State Health Systems to
Administer the Popular Health Insurance Entitlements. US$7.875 million (US$0.00). The
component aimed to (i) support enhancements in performance management in the administration
of the PHI, and (ii) support State Health Systems in preparing and carrying out reforms in the
administration of the PHI. The activities under the component were technical assistance
including, inter alia, the review and refinement of the federal monitoring and audit system
(including Coordination Agreements), assessments of the capacity of State Health Systems to
monitor the delivery of health services to different groups of affiliates (including vulnerable
groups), the development of instruments to capture and validate information, the development of
performance benchmarks, the design of a disclosure policy for the PHI, the development of
platforms to transfer experiences and knowledge across State Health Systems, and the
development of financing mechanisms for technical assistance to State Health Systems to
effectively carry out key health system functions, and specifically, their responsibilities as the
administrators of the PHI.

1.6 Revised Components

13.      The components were not revised during implementation. However, their financing
was revised as described in Section 1.7.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

14.       The Project had two Level II restructurings. The first restructuring (November 22,
2011) modified the Monitoring Framework in order to allow for more accurate measurement of
Project progress and impact. The modifications helped fill some gaps in the original monitoring
framework, took advantage of improvements in data availability, corrected for inadequate
                                                4
sources of information and simplified some indicators. The second restructuring (February 28,
2013) reallocated loan proceeds from Component 2 to Component 1. While the Commission
initially planned to use loan proceeds to finance Component 2 activities, after Project approval it
received sufficient own budget funds to carry out the activities without the loan proceeds. Using
own resources allowed the Commission to avoid duplicate procurement processes. 7

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15.       The Project responded to the Government’s policy and priorities for the health
sector. The Mexican Government and the Commission were highly committed to the Project, as
the previous administration aimed to make the right to healthcare a concrete entitlement. The
Project supported the Government’s 2007-2012 National Health Sector Program (Programa
Sectorial de Salud - PROSESA), which aimed to increase health service utilization, reduce out-
of-pocket expenditures and reduce mortality. It was also aligned with the National Development
Plan (NDP) 2007-2012, which focused on reducing inequalities and providing equal
opportunities. In addition, the Project supported progress on health-related MDGs.

16.      The Project represented one of the largest health loans ever made by the World
Bank and one of the largest in the country. As reflected by the Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) crisis response analysis, IEG, The World Bank Groups’ Response to the Global Economic
Crisis, Phase II (2012), the large amount of lending to Mexico was a reflection of country
demand and the existence of a mature social protection program.

17.      The World Bank provided technical expertise, policy advice, convening services,
and supported a number of studies in Mexico, focusing on coordination, regulation,
supervision, prevention and beneficiary empowerment in the public health system. 8 The
World Bank’s extensive experience in designing, implementing and strengthening health
insurance programs, in particular aimed at coverage expansion for the poor, informal workers
and other vulnerable groups and their families, provided relevant and timely information.

18.     Two essential lessons served as a backbone to Project design: the importance of
empowering affiliates of insurance systems serving the poor and vulnerable, and the need
for comprehensive incentive and support systems to foster reform in highly decentralized


7
  When using loan funds for procurement of studies and technical assistance, the Commission had to use the internal clearance
and approval processes as well as the World Bank review process. The use of a financial agent/intermediary also implies
additional processing, which added to the overall administrative burden.

  At the time of Project implementation, the World Bank was supporting the introduction and scale-up of non-contributory or
subsidized-contributory health insurance schemes in more than 40 countries, including Argentina, the Dominican Republic,
Honduras, Paraguay and Nicaragua. The World Bank assisted the documentation and dissemination of information regarding PHI
in national and international workshops, seminars and conferences in and outside Mexico. The World Bank arranged workshops
and high-level consultations, such as the December 2009 Workshop – Strategies for Continued Success: Taking PHI’s
Achievements Forward, which provided an opportunity for the exchange of ideas and experiences for further strengthening of
PHI, and the World Bank Knowledge Exchange: Friend or Foe? Mexico’s System of Social Protection in Health and the Formal
Sector. The latter brought together a broad set of researchers, which presented findings and studies regarding PHI.

                                                             5
contexts. Studies in Mexico had shown that many affiliates lacked knowledge regarding their
entitlements, and evidence from around the globe revealed that beneficiary entitlement
knowledgeable was crucial in encouraging health service utilization and in holding providers
accountable by using complaint, mediation, and arbitration systems. Experience from countries
such as Argentina, China, Indonesia, Poland, and Turkey showed the importance of results
monitoring, setting benchmarks, making financing conditional on results, creating experience
exchange platforms, and building capacity to ensure administration effectiveness of entitlements.
At the time of Project design, it was not politically feasible to link payment to the States to
targets of service provision; however the Commission was committed to improve the
administration of entitlements through technical assistance to the States, as well as negotiated
agreements and supervision. While Component 2 of the Project only accounted for a small
portion of the original loan amount, it addressed some initial but key steps to support the reform
of the health financing system.

19.       The Project supported Mexico’s progress towards Universal Health Coverage
(UHC), which consists of three inter-related components: (i) coverage for the entire
population; (ii) financial protection from out-of-pocket payment for health services when
consumed; and (iii) the full spectrum of quality health services according to need. (WHO
2010) Project funds were mostly used to address the first two dimensions. The Project had an
explicit aim to increase the number of people in PHI. The aim of coverage from financial risk
was an implicit one, in that PHI benefits specify that its affiliates do not need to contribute for
services at the point of service delivery; in theory, this means that PHI affiliates are covered from
financial risk arising from needing health services; however, in practice much depends on
whether the corresponding public services are available and of sufficient quality, or whether they
need to seek alternative providers that do charge for services. Working on this third dimension
(breadth and quality of services by PHI) is more complicated because service delivery is mostly
decentralized to the States, and it would have required intervention at the state level, either
directly or through incentive mechanisms between the federal government and the States. As
noted above, it was not an option at the time of Project design to introduce such incentive
mechanisms, though it remains a pending agenda. Instead, the Project opted to support the
reform of the health financing systems through small but essential steps such as technical
assistance, agreements and supervision. (See Supra and Annex 2)

20.       The Mexican health system is fragmented, and in the PAD there was a concern
that the Project may contribute to further fragmentation by supporting an additional
system of insurance (the PHI). In reality, at the time of Project design, PHI was already
covering over 25 percent of the population, so the Project did not create an additional program.
At the time of creation of the PHI, the Government did not find it possible to expand one of the
existing health insurance schemes (eg. IMSS or ISSSTE) instead of creating the PHI.

21.       A Specific Investment Loan (SIL) was considered the most appropriate lending
instrument. The loan mechanism combined a fast-disbursing component, which helped maintain
and increase federal funding levels following the 2009 economic crisis by financing eligible
federal social contributions associated with proof of new affiliation (measured via PDO indicator
1), with a technical assistance component that aimed to support the reform over the medium
term. Component 2 was reassigned, the Commission used its own resources to implement the
                                                 6
activities of the component and gained from regular supervision and frequent interaction with
World Bank staff.

22.       The Project’s disbursement modality was fully aligned with the GOM’s existing
financing arrangements for PHI. The PHI financing arrangements specify that the Federal
Government makes two contributions: the Social Contribution and the Federal Solidarity
Contribution. States make their own contribution called the State Solidarity Contribution. The
World Bank reimbursed up to 70 percent of the federal social contribution transfers to the States,
which itself accounts for approximately 1/3rd of the cost of the PHI scheme. 9 The financing did
not discriminate between existing or new affiliates; rather than trying to identify the affiliates
who would benefit directly from Project financing, the Project helped the Program to achieve its
goals of preserving and expanding the number of affiliates.

2.2 Implementation

23.       In 2010, PHI changed the unit used for calculating transfers to the States. Initially,
PHI based the transfers to the States on the number of affiliated family units in each State.
Family units included the head of household, spouse, children and parents. This gave States an
incentive to try and game the system by subdividing family units in the enrollment registers. 10 In
2009, the General Health Law was modified so as to use the individual as the basis of calculation
of the transfers. This change led to a steep rise in affiliation after 2009. (Annex 2)

24.      Due to financing constraints stemming from the crisis, the loan disbursed rapidly
and provided necessary financial support to Mexico’s safety net system. GDP fell by more
than 6 percent in 2009 and though it rebounded quickly, poverty rose from 47.4 percent in 2008
to 51.3 percent in 2010. (CONEVAL) The timeliness of the Project is evident by its quick
disbursement: the Project became effective on December 17, 2010, and within one year, 80
percent of the total loan amount was disbursed.

25.      Project activities were coordinated and implemented using the organizational
structures and staff of the Commission, which had been responsible for implementing the
PHI since 2004. Though the Program expanded dramatically, both financially and in terms of
coverage, the financial architecture, control mechanisms and management structure were in place
and supported the further expansion.




9
  The General Health Law establishes that (i) the premium of the PHI is a share9 of combined Federal and State
contributions and (ii) the Federal Solidarity Contribution amounts to 150 percent of the Social Contribution while
the State Solidarity Contribution amounts to 50 percent of the same.
10
   By 2009, evidence showed that PHI included a larger than expected number of single person and small family
units, presumably because states subdivided family units in order to increase the federal resource transfer. The
original transfer rule also did not capture differences in family sizes among states, and often allocated more funds
per person to the wealthier states with relatively smaller family units, thereby exacerbating health-financing
inequities among states.

                                                         7
26.       Notwithstanding the Project success, the decentralized nature of Mexico’s Health
System resulted in unequal implementation performance. The PHI gave the States incentives
to increase enrollment but not necessarily to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of service
provision, as federal entities have a large degree of autonomy in the use of resources and in the
organization and management of their health systems. Furthermore, state-level political
commitment and health sector capabilities vary widely among the different States. Despite
reductions in inequality in recent years, there are still large differences between the States in
terms of health funding, availability of health services per PHI affiliate and health outcomes
(CONEVAL 2013, OMM 2014).

27.       The World Bank’s involvement over the life of the Project was beneficial in
several areas. First, while the World Bank loan only financed a portion of the cost of the PHI
program, it did signal the World Bank’s support to the Program and helped protect its funding
during the financial crisis. In addition, the Project allowed for exchange and dissemination of
knowledge, both nationally and internationally. (Annex 2) Finally, the design, supervision and
implementation of the Indigenous People’s Plan led to a substantial shift in implementation
strategy and tangible benefits for indigenous populations. (See Section 1.4) Finally, the Project’s
supervision in the area of financial management supported the Government’s efforts to enhance
performance management.

28.       Despite the reallocation of the total loan proceeds from Component 2 to
Component 1, the World Bank team decided to keep Component 2 as part of the Project
and to continue supervising its achievements. The decision to retain this component can be
justified with the following considerations: (i) It allowed the Bank to continue engaging in the
area of reform of incentive and support systems to the States in the administration of PHI; while
this reform is a long-term proposition, it is essential to ensure the effectiveness of the PHI funds;
(ii) a number of Component 2 indicators were achieved through synchronous implementation
with Component 1: in particular, new affiliates received the preventive health checkups and
promotional materials of rights; (iii) the activities outlined in Component 2 were carried out by
the Commission with support from the World Bank, albeit only using counterpart funding; and
(iv) a significant portion of the World Bank’s own supervision funds were used to provide
support and convening services to the Component 2 activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

29.        During the implementation of the Project, the Commission invested heavily in
improving its M&E capabilities. These included the development of indicators for monitoring
at the state level, technical assistance to improve the collection and analysis of information in the
States, investments in health information systems such as an individualized health information
system to support preventive health screenings, and the rollout of a biometric identification
system for affiliates. The Commission carried out a wide range of studies that included various
evaluations of the PHI program. (Annex 2)

30.     PHI was evaluated using a randomized evaluation methodology before the
approval of the Project. (King et al. 2009) At the time of the Project’s design, it was not
deemed possible to carry out a second impact evaluation of the Program, despite the fact that the
                                                 8
first evaluation did not demonstrate impacts on service utilization or health outcomes, possibly
due to a rather short evaluation timeframe. During the implementation of the Project, the
Commission contracted several external evaluations of the PHI program. (Eg. Lazcano 2012 and
Lozano 2013)

31.      The Project M&E Framework used a multi-pronged approach that included
existing administrative data and regular survey data. At Project closing, the combination of
these approaches allowed for measurement of PDOs. At the same time, the M&E framework
could have made fuller use of regular survey data, and there were weaknesses in the indicators’
design and definition, which resulted in unclear and imprecise measurement of certain outcomes
during the Project’s implementation.

32.       Better definition of indicators and inclusion of indicators measuring effective
access would have enhanced the Project M&E Framework. First, the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) and the Operational Manual (OM) lacked detailed information about indicator
calculation. For a number of indicators, including PDO indicator 1 and intermediate indicators 3,
4 and 5, the monitoring framework was ambivalent about whether the indicator’s target was the
percentage or the numerator and did not give sufficient specification of the denominator. Second,
a number of indicators were rather complex, yet the design documents were incomplete as to the
source of data and methods of calculation. Finally, while the Project’s monitoring framework
included a wide array of indicators measuring affiliation, PDO indicator 3 is the only one that
captures utilization of services by PHI affiliates. The Program’s success towards increasing
effective access to health services could have been measured through: (i) public health spending
per beneficiary, (ii) composition of PHI affiliates by income quintiles based on household
surveys, and (iii) service availability and utilization. (See Table 7 in Annex 2)

33.         During implementation, the lack of clarity in the design of the indicators resulted
in imprecise measurement of a number of outcomes. A number of indicators that were
expressed as percentages reached over 100 percent. For example the percentage of
Oportunidades families affiliated with the PHI (Intermediate indicator 4) reached over 100
percent, seemingly because the Oportunidades family unit was defined differently in the
numerator and denominator. Other indicators reached high levels but were not confirmed by
alternative data sources. For example, intermediate indicator 3 reported that coverage of PHI
among the non-insured in deciles 1 and 2 reached 97 percent by 2013. Still, the 2012 National
Health and Nutrition Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrición – ENSANUT) finds that
approximately 20 percent of individuals in those deciles were not covered by any health
insurance, which gives a rather different picture of the situation. As a result, this indicator does
not convey accurate information about the reach of the program (Table 7 on Annex 2 and Annex
7). Still, because of the existence of regular household surveys, at the time of the ICR there were
sufficient data available to estimate the efficacy of the Project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.     Environmental Safeguard. The proposed Project did not have potentially adverse
environmental effects and therefore did not trigger the Bank’s environmental safeguard policy
(OP/BP 4.01). It was classified as Environmental Category C.
                                                 9
35.        Indigenous People Safeguard. The Indigenous People safeguard was triggered, and as
mandated by OP/BP 4.10, the Government prepared an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) to ensure
that indigenous peoples benefited from the Project in a culturally appropriate manner. The IPP
aimed to support indigenous people’s affiliation to PHI and ensure closer monitoring of
affiliation, services and satisfaction in indigenous localities. (Annex 2) This is important because
the health status of indigenous peoples has historically been poor in Mexico, with access to
health services constrained due to remote and rural residence and lack of contributory social
security enrollment. The social assessment prepared during the Project’s design identified many
of the issues hindering indigenous peoples PHI enrollment. Based on these finding, the Project
prepared and implemented a strategy that went beyond the Government’s initial cultural and
communication plans for targeting the population. (See Annex 2) The significant increase in
enrollment among this marginalized population reflects the success of the framework. Between
2006 and 2012, the gap in insurance coverage rates between indigenous and non-indigenous
populations was virtually eliminated, and significant advances were made in narrowing service
coverage gaps (eg. hospital based births) and even health outcomes (eg. stunting), even though
there remain significant service utilization differences. (Leyva et al. 2012) Overall, the Project’s
Indigenous Plan proved to be useful as an instrument to start to address the constraints faced by
the indigenous population in health service access.

36.       Fiduciary. Financial Management (FM) arrangements in terms of accounting,
budgeting, flow of funds, internal control and financial reporting were moderately satisfactory
throughout the Project’s life in providing reasonable assurance that loan proceeds were used for
intended purposes. Some moderate FM shortcomings, such as delays in hiring the technical
auditor and in submission of Project audits, were identified during Project implementation and
negatively impacted the FM ISR rating, which at one point was downgraded to Moderately
Unsatisfactory (MU). The final FM ISR rating of the Project (prior to closing date) was
Moderately Satisfactory (MS), as most of the FM related shortcomings were timely followed-up
and addressed. Most of the Project’s Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were prepared and
delivered in a timely manner, while the final financial audit was submitted with major delays, it
was deemed acceptable to the World Bank. Nacional Financiera (NAFIN), in its capacity as the
Project’s financial agent, provided the implementation support and oversight based on its many
years of experience with Bank-financed projects.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

37.       As of Project completion, PHI’s phase of expanding enrollment has been virtually
completed and the focus ahead is bound to change towards the organization and
functioning of the PHI. In particular, to ensure the efficient administration of the PHI benefits,
there is a need to continue working with the REPSS who administer PHI benefits at the state
level, and to reform the incentives and accountability mechanisms linking these agencies with
the Federal Government, States, and health providers, particularly primary health care providers.




                                                10
In 2013, the legislative chambers approved a change in the General Health Law 11 which aims to
improve the efficiency of the allocation of Seguro Popular resources in the States, while
strengthening the capacity of the Commission to supervise the use of the resources in the States.
An additional agenda is to start to address the fragmentation of the Health System. While the
World Bank currently does not have a loan in Mexico, it continues its policy dialogue with the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health and IMSS around improving the efficiency and
coordination between the different insurance schemes in the short term, and possibly integration
of the system in the long run. The Bank engages in these areas through analytical work and
convening services under the umbrella of a Programmatic Knowledge Services program.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

38.       The Project’s objectives remain highly relevant for Mexico at the time of
completion. Progress towards effective universal healthcare, reduction of health disparities, and
achievement of the MDGs are all part of the new administration’s goal of an inclusive Mexico.
The 2013-2019 National Development Plan reinforced the importance of health and included the
following objectives: (i) to secure access to health services, including progress toward the
establishment of a universal health system, (ii) make protection, promotion and prevention a
priority for the improvement of the population’s health profile, (iii) improve health attention for
the vulnerable population, (iv) guarantee the effective access of quality health services, and (v)
promote international health cooperation.

39.       In recent years, there has been a growing movement across the globe for UHC
ensuring that everyone who needs health services is able to get them, without undue
financial hardship. (WHO and WBG 2013) UHC is being pushed as one of the possible goals
of the post-2014 development agenda, and therefore insurance schemes like the PHI are bound to
become the center of a vivid internationally debate. (The Lancet Commission 2013) The fact that
the Mexican Government moved on UHC 10 years ago makes it a pioneer in this global agenda.

40.       Project objectives support key health MDGs and are tightly intertwined with the
World Bank’s new goals to reduce extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. The FY
2014-2019 CPS (Report No 80800-MX, October 23, 2013) calls for a series of tailored
engagements, which allow the World Bank to play an effective role in reducing extreme poverty
and promoting shared prosperity. Access to health is crucial to promote shared prosperity, as the
effort expended in reducing opportunity inequality will lead to less outcome inequality in the
future.

41.       The PHI has made a marked contribution towards closing gaps in health
coverage and financing between socio-economic groups. While 10 years ago half of the
population lacked health insurance and the poor were significantly more likely to lack coverage,


11
     Articles 77 bis 5, bis 6, bis 11, bis 15, and bis 16.

                                                             11
currently the gaps in health insurance enrollment between socio-economic quintiles have been
virtually eliminated. (Gutierrez and Hernandez-Ávila 2013) The Social Protection System in
Health and specifically the PHI significantly narrowed health-spending gaps. This narrowing of
coverage and financing gaps remains essential to reduce poverty and promote inclusion. (See
Section 3.2)

42.       As evidenced in the PAD, there is generally some concern that programs like the
PHI may generate some labor market distortions. The concern is that by offering benefits that
are comparable to those of the contributory regime, workers may choose to stay in the informal
sector even when they have an option of moving to the formal sector which has a contributory
health insurance. Several studies were undertaken during the life of the Project to evaluate this
concern. Most found a relatively small impact overall, with a greater reduction in the probability
of formal employment in rural areas. (Duval Hernandez and Smith Ramirez 2011)

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

43.      Following the Project Development Objectives, the Project efficacy should be
evaluated for the achievement of the following outcomes: (i) number of people without
contributory social security that are affiliated to PHI; and (ii) capacity of the Commission
and State Health Systems to effectively administer the entitlements of the PHI. Given the
respective initial allocations of funds between the two objectives, the ICR puts a higher weight
on PDO 1 to calculate overall Project efficacy.

44.        The Project’s efficacy was high in its objective to preserve and expand the
coverage of the PHI for people without contributory social security. By the Project’s
completion, the PHI counted 55.6 million affiliates, a 78 percent increase over the baseline and
far exceeding the end-of-Project target of 48.4 million (PDO indicator 1). The rapid growth in
affiliation was facilitated by the change in coverage focus from the family unit to the individual.
The majority of PHI affiliates appear to be individuals who have no access to alternative health
service coverage, as required by the PHI eligibility criteria. On the basis of the Household
Income and Expenditures Survey- Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos de los Hogares -
ENIGH), we estimate that the amount of filtration (affiliation to PHI of individuals with
contributory health insurance) was 9.5 percent in 2010 and 11.3 percent in 2012. 12 This number
is consistent with Technical Audit of the Project, which finds that the list of affiliates is relatively
reliable. (COLMEX 2014) (Annex 2)

45.       The Project contributed to the PHI reaching a high number of affiliates within a
shorter timeframe. While the World Bank loan only financed a portion of the cost of the PHI
program, it did signal the World Bank’s support to the Program and helped protect its funding
during the financial crisis. Without the Project, PHI coverage would most likely have progressed
at a slower pace.

     Authors’own calculations.

                                                  12
46.        The expansion in PHI coverage disproportionately benefited vulnerable groups
and fostered equity of health care coverage. The Project identified four vulnerable groups
whose affiliation to PHI was more closely monitored: the poor (i.e. individuals in deciles 1 and
2), beneficiaries of the Oportunidades program, indigenous populations, and females. As shown
in Annex 2, the majority of PHI affiliates belong to socio-economic quintiles 1 and 2, and
affiliation rates rose steeply in the lowest quintiles. The number of Oportunidades beneficiary
families affiliated with the PHI (intermediate indicator 4) grew from 3.06 million to 5.7 million,
compared to the original target of 4 million. The number of individuals affiliated with the PHI
residing in areas where more than 40 percent of the population speaks an indigenous language
(intermediate indicator 5) grew from 4.13 million to 6.9 million, against the original target of 4.8
million. Finally, the number of women and girls affiliated with the PHI (intermediate indicator 6)
increased from 16.9 million to 30 million, much above the original target of 22 million.

47.       The Project’s efficacy was substantial in its objective to improve the capacity of
the Commission and State Health Systems to effectively administer the entitlements of the
PHI. We use the following outcome measures to make this assessment: effectiveness at
providing preventive screenings, affiliates’ understanding of the PHI program, and concrete
actions to improve administration of entitlements. This assessment keeps in mind that the
original objective of the Project in this area was a relatively modest one.

48.      PDO indicator 3 can be viewed as a tracer indicator for effectiveness of coverage
and measures the number of individuals affiliated with the PHI who have received a
preventive health screening. Health prevention is particularly important in Mexico as the
country experiences an epidemiological shift, with the population increasingly struggling with
obesity and diabetes, and as health care costs rise. Over the longer term prevention strategies can
enhance the health profile of the population and lower health care cost. During the
implementation of the Project, the number of PHI affiliates that had received health screenings
increased from zero in 2009 to 22.9 million, amply surpassing the 10 million target.

49.        For PHI coverage to be effective, affiliates need to understand their rights and
obligations. While the Project indicators reveal some progress in this area, there is still an
outstanding agenda to ensure beneficiary awareness. According to the 2012 ENSANUT survey,
74.3 percent of PHI affiliates reported having received enough information to know their rights
and obligations under the PHI. (PDO Indicator 4) This is above the baseline number of 71.2
percent but below the Project’s target of 80 percent. The Project’s intermediate indicators show
that several interventions were undertaken to increase affiliates’ understanding of their rights, but
that this did not necessarily translate into “sufficient” knowledge, according to beneficiaries. The
Technical Audit finds that the degree to which affiliates know their rights depends on the type of
benefit, in the sense that basic rights are better known than rights related to catastrophic services.
(Colmex 2014) Lazcano et al. (2012) find that affiliates in the poorest States generally received
much less information about their rights than those in richer states.

50.      During Project implementation, the Commission implemented a number of
strategies to improve the administration of the PHI entitlements. First, the Commission
increased its supervision of PHI in the States in four core action areas (affiliation and operation,
health service management, financing and Oportunidades program). With this strategy, the
                                                 13
Commission aimed to strengthen the implementation of the health norms signaled by the
administration, and in particular those related to health prevention and rights of the affiliates.
Second, the Commission took a number of concrete steps to strengthen the administration of the
Program in the States, including the hiring of medical managers, management agreements with
the states, and the development of indicators for monitoring at the state level. Third, the
Commission invested in improving health information systems. It allocated increased amounts of
funding for technical assistance to improve the collection and analysis of information in the
states. The corresponding intermediate indicator 8 surpassed its target. It also invested in
improving its health information systems. For example, by 2013, the Commission had rolled out
an individualized health information system to support preventive health screenings in the 32
States (intermediate indicator 14), while 32 States had started capturing biometric information of
individuals affiliated to the PHI Program.

51.       The Project also contributed to the Commission securing funding for a wide range
of technical assistance and studies. Approximately 11 studies were mapped to the Project
though the Commission actually carried out more than 45 different studies in 2010-2012 valued
at more than US$26 million, which focused on a range of issues, including the knowledge of
beneficiaries regarding their entitlements, the design of existing mechanisms, and the evaluation
of the PHI in general. A number of these studies led to the review and refinement of the federal
monitoring system, assessed the capacity of the State Health Systems to monitor the delivery of
health services to different groups of affiliates (in particular the indigenous population),
supported disclosure (through satisfaction surveys and external evaluations) and the development
of performance benchmarks (through the establishment of State-level base lines for a number of
PHI related indicators). Component 2 also supported the development of instruments to capture
and validate information through the expansion of Consulta Segura (PDO indicator 3), which
captures affiliates health related information, and the expansion of SINOS. The Commission
worked closely with both the Bank and the Center for Economic Research and Teaching (Centro
de Investigación y Docencia Económica - CIDE) on dissemination of the studies. While the loan
did not disburse the funds that were allocated to Component 2, nevertheless the Project
contributed to the achievement of the objectives outlined in the component.

Contribution to higher level outcomes

52.       As mentioned in Section 2.1, the Project aimed to support Mexico in achieving
universal health coverage. Therefore it is useful to look beyond the Project’s original indicators
(which mostly look at population coverage) to evaluate whether there were any impacts on
financial protection and on the quantity and quality of health services, and on final health
outcomes.

53.       As the number of PHI affiliates increased, public spending on health increased
while beneficiary financial protection was improved. Federal and State expenditure on PHI
(intermediate indicator 1) increased from US$3.4 billion in 2009 to over US$5.2 billion in 2013,
significantly above the target of US$4.5 billion. Public spending on health grew from 2.55
percent of GDP in 2003 to 3.1 percent in 2012. (Table 3) While the trend is positive, total health
expenditure per capita (US$977) and as a percentage of GDP (6.2 percent) remain significantly
below the OECD averages (US$3,322 and 9.3 percent respectively). (OECD 2013) At the
                                               14
individual level, the expansion of PHI improved beneficiary financial protection. A randomized
study by King et al. (2009) estimated that the reduction in OOP expenditures was 915 pesos per
year. Avila-Burgos et al (2012) find that PHI reduced the probability that a household would
spend OOP for health by 2 percentage points, from a baseline probability of 52 percent. In
addition, they find that PHI reduced the likelihood of catastrophic health expenditures by 36.8
percent. 13

54.        The range of covered services and their utilization rose considerably during the
Project’s implementation. Between 2009 and 2013, the gap in the benefits packages offered by
Social Security and PHI gradually reduced, as PHI started to cover an increasing number of
health interventions and medicines. Still, the availability of services continues to be an issue.
According to CONEVAL (2014), the supply of services has not kept up with the number of
affiliates. On the utilization side, there is some evidence of increased utilization of services, and
that the Program has led to a shift in services from the private sector to the public sector.
However, further information would be needed on the quality of services in the public sector to
evaluate whether this shift was a positive development.

55.      The evidence regarding the impact of PHI on health outcomes is mixed. A
randomized study by King et al. (2009) found a 23 percent reduction from the baseline in
catastrophic expenditures, but no effects on medication spending, utilization or health outcomes,
possibly due to the short duration of the evaluation (10 months). All other evaluations of the
Program use non-experimental methods and results vary. Most studies do not find large effects
on standard indicators of maternal and child care usage, possibly because the baseline levels
were high to start with. By contrast, in a recent paper, Pfutze (2014) uses a weighted exogenous
sampling maximum likelihood (WESML) estimator and finds that PHI can be expected to reduce
Mexico’s infant mortality rate by close to 5 out of 1,000 births. A few evaluations look at the
impact of PHI in those areas that now form 90 percent of the burden of disease, i.e. non-
communicable diseases and injury. (Knaul et al.) Teruel et al (2014) use the 2002 and 2009-2011
rounds of the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS) and find positive impact of the Program on
health services, detection and diagnosis for urban women and rural men. They also find an
improvement of health status for urban women, rural men, and children in areas related to
chronic conditions. (See Annex 4)

56.        Part of the explanation for the mixed evidence on the link between PHI and health
outcomes may be that funding to the states for PHI ends up strengthening the entire health
system in the state, which benefits not only PHI beneficiaries. The comparison between PHI
affiliates to non-affiliates within States may be biased because non-affiliates may benefit from
improvements in health services as well. For example, some states such as Puebla have made
particularly impressive progress on the MDGs such as maternal mortality (Annex 2, Box 1) and
have used PHI funds to finance their intervention strategies. In practice, women who need
emergency services and are not affiliated are affiliated at the time they need the service. This
kind of strategy makes it challenging to compare affiliated and non-affiliated populations to


13
     Avila et al (2012) define catastophic health expenditures those that exceed 30 percent of the total expenditures of the household.

                                                                  15
extract the impact of the program. Still, overall the numbers seem promising. For Example,
Knaul et al. (2012) find that the gaps in maternal and under-5 mortality have been reduced
between those who have access to social security (i.e. the formally employed and their
immediate family members), and those who don’t.

3.3 Efficiency

57.      To break-even, the PHI program should have achieved an 11 percent reduction in
the overall burden of disease, which appears to be modestly likely given the available
evidence. A number of studies have looked into the impact of PHI on health outcomes. A
randomized study by King et al. (2009) assessed the impact of rolling out PHI, and found a 23
percent reduction in catastrophic expenditures. The evaluation found that the Program’s
resources reached the poor, but that the program did not show other effects, possibly due to the
short duration of the evaluation (10 months). All other evaluations of the program used non-
experimental methods and results vary. For example, Gakidou et al (2006) and Scott (2006) find
that SP beneficiaries have higher utilization rates than the uninsured. Bernal et al (2010) found a
3 percentage point increase in the probability that deliveries in the rural areas were attended by a
medical doctor. Estimates suffer from attenuation bias and are likely to underestimate the impact
of the Program. In a recent paper, Pfutze (2014) found that PHI can be expected to reduce
Mexico’s infant mortality rate by close to 5 out of 1,000 births. (Annex 3)

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

58.       The overall outcome rating is Satisfactory. The rating is based on the following: (i)
Project consistency with Government priorities; (ii) high relevance of the objectives and design
to the Mexican country context and the global context; (iii) high efficacy in achieving PDO 1 and
substantial efficacy in achieving PDO 2; and (iv) modest efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

59.      The Project provided health coverage to those lacking health insurance, which are
often the most vulnerable members of society. The PHI program is highly progressive and has
contributed to closing inequities in health financing. In fact, the PHI and Oportunidades are
among the most progressive programs in Mexico.

60.      Women have benefitted from the additional programs financed through the PHI
aimed at women and children. The PHI provides improved access to health services, and gives
pregnant women, mothers and children priority access to health care services through a Strategy
for Healthy Pregnancies (Estrategia de Embarazo Saludable) and the Health Insurance for a
New Generation (Seguro Médico para una Nueva Generación) as well as priority enrollment to
the PHI.

61.      The Project had a significant impact on the Indigenous population. As Section 2.4,
the IPP worked to overcome identified obstacles to affiliation of Indigenous populations. The
                                                16
Commission promoted an intercultural approach, and cooperated with the Commission for
Indigenous Development (Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas –
CDI) to launch visual and radio advertisements in different languages. The strategy was clearly
successful as reflected in the increase in affiliation.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

62.       The Project helped to strengthen the stewardship role of the Ministry of Health.
The expansion of the role of the General Health Council (Conseco de Salubridad General), a
collective decision making body that spans all participants in the health sector, including the
Commission, was key in reinforcing the stewardship role of the Ministry of Health. In addition to
setting the National Health Priorities, the General Health Council assesses the inclusion of
interventions into CAUSES and the Catastrophic Fund. The 2013 change in the General Health
Law (See Paragraph 37) aims to strengthen the capacity of the Commission to supervise the use
of the resources in the States.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative) N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

63.        The 2012 satisfaction survey of PHI affiliates 14 found a 97 percent satisfaction
with PHI, with a high satisfaction for all service components (affiliation process, medical
attention, etc.). Ninety-nine percent of those surveyed planned to re-affiliate, with most
providing the fact that service is free, that they receive good attention and that they don’t have
access to another health insurance as the main reasons for re-affiliation. Most interviewed felt
they received a detailed explanation of what they were suffering. The average wait time for
receiving attention was 104 minutes, with variations between states from 69 minutes to 157
minutes. Most affiliates say they would return to the same health center. However, less than half
of the affiliates received information concerning their rights at the time of affiliation. Indigenous
affiliates rated satisfaction with PHI in the satisfaction survey between 8.5 and 9.7 (total of 10).
While the surveys show high satisfaction levels, the survey does not fully represent the
population of PHI affiliates because it selected PHI affiliates at the point of service exit. Hence
the survey implicitly excluded PHI affiliates who did not choose to attend PHI health centers or
those that went to alternative providers; arguably these could be the PHI affiliates that are less
satisfied or have given up on receiving services from PHI providers.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible

64.     Reduced financing of eligible federal contributions to the PHI premiums would
have a high impact on the PHI. However, the likelihood of this happening is low. Though the


14
  The 2012 survey is the latest available. The Ministry of Health carries out a satisfaction survey for PHI affiliates
on a biannual basis.

                                                         17
current administration may try to change aspects of the SPSS, the elimination of the PHI is
unlikely. The PHI is grounded on the rights and principles enshrined in the Mexican Constitution
and established by the 2003 General Health Law, which established the PHI to ensure that all
individuals, including those lacking contributory social security, are equally able to exercise this
right. The PHI enjoys broad, non-partisan political support, in its eleventh year of operation and
has survived two presidential election cycles. The 2013 change in General Health law (See
Paragraph 37) continues to support the role of PHI and the Commission in reaching the
population’s health needs. According to the 2013-2018 NDP and PROSESA, the Commission
will continue working to guarantee individual’s access to quality and effective health care and to
narrow inequalities in terms of coverage between the PHI, the Mexican Social Insurance Institute
(Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social – IMSS) and the National Institute for the Social Security
of Government Workers (Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del
Estado - ISSSTE).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.      The Project’s design built on findings of earlier sector work and the objectives
were relevant and strongly supported Government and global priorities. The Project was
prepared and approved in a six-month period, as agreed with the Government, which required a
fast paced design and the selection of indicators available at the time. Weaknesses in the M&E
framework negatively weigh on the rating, although they did not lead to issues in terms of the
implementation and neither did they prevent the measurement of project achievement at the time
of the ICR.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.      The Project benefitted from a committed World Bank team and a close
relationship with the SPSS, despite the fact that it had three different TTLs. World Bank
staff worked closely with the Commission discussing and modifying areas requested by the
GOM for the two restructurings, and mobilizing global knowledge on various topics through
convening services. The World Bank also supervised and provided assistance in the
implementation of technical and financial audits, and restructured the Project in 2011 to adjust
the M&E Framework. While some improvements were made, the improvements could have been
more thorough to include the issues identified in Section 2.3.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.       For the reasons indicated above, the Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.
                                                18
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

68.       Government’s performance is rated Satisfactory due to the high level of support
given to the Project. As described previously, the Government was very committed to the
Project. Commitment waned somewhat following the change in administration in 2013, but by
that time the Project had reached the end of its cycle since it had been nearly fully disbursed.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.       Implementation agency performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The
Commission was responsible for the Project’s implementation. During the Project, the
Commission managed a 24.5M increase in affiliates without major obstacles, because the
financial architecture, control mechanisms and management structure were already in place. The
Commission’s agenda of studies was ambitious and revealed strong commitment to the PHI.
Delays in the delivery of both technical and audit reports by the Commission revealed
weaknesses in the Project’s management. Finally, as discussed in Section 2.3, there were some
weaknesses in the reporting of indicators.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.    For reasons outlined above, the overall Borrower Performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

UHC Financing in a Decentralized Context

71.       Universal Health Coverage consists of three inter-related components: (i)
coverage for the entire population; (ii) financial protection from direct payment for health
services when consumed; and (iii) the full spectrum of quality health services according to
need. (WHO 2010) The Project funds were mostly used to address the first two dimensions,
though the Project did contribute with small steps towards the reform of the health financing
systems within the States. Projects that aim at UHC should consider the 3 dimensions of the
UHC “cube”, and include monitoring indicators for all three dimensions. Empowering affiliates
of insurance systems serving the poor and vulnerable.

72.      Introduction of the SPSS did not eliminate the fragmentation of the Mexican
health system, which includes several health insurance schemes covering formal workers,
the SPSS, IMSS-Oportunidades and the private sector. The horizontal segmentation of the
health system is considered one of the main impediments to improving its performance, in
                                              19
particular in some states. Though the system has been reorganized, with an alignment of the
financial architecture and federal stewardship, reform across functions would improve efficiency.
In addition, now that a majority of the vulnerable population has been affiliated, the Government
should combine programs such as Siglo XXI, the health part of Oportunidades, etc.

73.       While PHI has succeeded in narrowing health funding differences between the
States, there are still significant differences in performance and outcomes, which largely
mimic socio-economic differences amongst the states. Linking funding to an increase in
enrollment based on a uniform per capita amount will not succeed in bringing up the poorest
States, because they have a significant lag in services and infrastructure. To achieve UHC, PHI
may require a differentiated per capita amount and specific performance targets to bring those
states up to minimum service delivery levels.

74.       There is a need to rethink incentives for the states and their providers to improve
health care performance. Although this was one of the objectives of the 2003 reform, there has
not been much progress in this regard (Kurowski and Villar-Uribe 2012). At the state level, in
most cases provider payments continue to be based on historical budgets rather than on some
measure of performance. States are not held accountable on how or where the money is spent,
and the States’ weak record in service delivery may be partly due to the lack of accountability
mechanisms. The Commission is, however, evaluating options to use the existing information
systems, including the Personalized Health Registry (SINOS) as the basis to generate these
incentives. Overall, there is still a need for a comprehensive incentive and support system to
support reform in the highly decentralized Mexican context.

Project’s Design

75.      The Project had a dual aim of protecting financing for PHI (which required fast
disbursement) and providing technical assistance (which required long-term engagement).
While Development Policy Loans (DPLs) are fast-disbursing, their disburse-and-close modality
is not well suited for long-term engagement and technical assistance to complex reform
processes. At the same time, Investment Lending allows for longer engagement and can also
include fast-disbursing components, as was the case in this Project. However, in loans that
incorporate a significant component of technical assistance, procurement arrangements are
crucial to ensure that the component will be executed as expected. Where appropriate,
procurement arrangements should use country systems.

76.     Even in Programs that aim at universal coverage, there is a need for specific
approaches and strategies to reach the most vulnerable segments of the population. As
demonstrated in this Project, effective Indigenous Peoples Plan and other targeting strategies can
help make universal health programs inclusive.

77.      Evidence generation and regular monitoring and evaluation are crucial for policy,
strategy and program decision-making. The numerous surveys carried out in Mexico, such as
the ENSANUT, the ENIGH, satisfaction surveys, and other surveys provide significant
information on the health profile of the society and the provision of health services. Yet this
information was not necessarily used to the fullest in the Project’s M&E setup. Overall, the
                                               20
M&E framework would have benefited from having fewer and simpler indicators that covered
the main dimensions of UHC (coverage of people, financial protection and availability of quality
services). However, the Government was unwilling to make significant changes to the
monitoring framework during project implementation. Documentation of the source of data and
method of calculation are essential to ensure clarity about project achievements. Globally, having
more agreement on metrics for universal health coverage would facilitate M&E at the country
level and foster comparability among countries.

(a) Achievement of PDO and intermediate indicators

78.      The Project had four PDO indicators and 15 intermediate indicators to track
Project progress. By the Project’s closing, three of the four PDO indicators had exceeded end-
of-Project targets, while the fourth was not achieved, although some progress toward the target
can be observed. Twelve of the 15 intermediate indicators were successfully achieved.

79.        The Project’s efficacy was high in its objective to preserve and expand the
coverage of the PHI for people without contributory social security. By the Project’s
completion, the PHI counted 55.6 million affiliates, a 78 percent increase over the baseline and
far exceeding the end-of-Project target of 48.4 million (PDO indicator 1). The rapid growth in
affiliation was facilitated by the change in coverage focus from the family unit to the individual.
The majority of PHI affiliates appear to be individuals who have no access to alternative health
service coverage, as required by the PHI eligibility criteria. On the basis of ENIGH, we estimate
that the amount of filtration (affiliation to PHI of individuals with contributory health insurance)
was 9.5 percent in 2010 and 11.3 percent in 2012. 16 This number is consistent with Technical
Audit of the Project, which finds that the list of affiliates is relatively reliable. (COLMEX 2014)
Specifically, the Audit finds that in 13.8 percent of the family units covered by PHI, at least one
member was covered by an alternative health insurance scheme. However, this does not mean


16
     Authors’ own calculations.

                                                          23
that all members of the household are ineligible for PHI, since other health insurance schemes do
not necessarily allow the entire family unit to be enrolled, even if one member is enrolled.
Therefore, the number of ineligible individuals that are enrolled in PHI is likely lower than 13.8
percent.

80.       The Project contributed to the PHI reaching a high number of affiliates within a
shorter timeframe. While the World Bank loan only financed a portion of the cost of the PHI
program, it did signal the World Bank’s support to the Program and helped protect its funding
during the financial crisis. Without the Project, PHI coverage would most likely have progressed
at a slower pace.

81.        The expansion in PHI coverage disproportionately benefited vulnerable groups
and fostered equity of health care coverage. Cultural and social factors in Mexico have put the
poor, indigenous, and rural population at a disadvantage for having contributory social security
and corresponding health insurance. The Project identified four vulnerable groups whose
affiliation to PHI was more closely monitored: the poor (i.e. individuals in deciles 1 and 2),
beneficiaries of the Oportunidades program, indigenous populations, and females. 18 According
to the ENIGH survey, between 2008 and 2012, affiliation rates to PHI rose by approximately 30
percentage points in Quintiles I and II, while affiliate rates for higher quintiles did not rise as
strongly. (Figure 2) As shown in Figure 3, the majority of PHI affiliates belong to socio-
economic quintiles 1 and 2. On the basis of ENIGH, at the time of the ICR we estimate that the
percentage of individuals in deciles 1 and 2 that were affiliated to PHI, as percentage of those in
deciles 1 and 2 that were not affiliated to a contributory social security system, went from

  Section 2.3 discussed a number of issues related to the calculation of coverage rates for different populations. This
ICR evaluates the project’s achievements based on absolute numbers and therefore it cannot make any judgements
about population coverage rates.

42.30% (2008) to 72.32 % (2012), a 30 percentage point increase. (ICR alternative to
intermediate indicator 3) According to Gutierrez (2013), the 2012 ENSANUT shows that 20.1%
of the population in the lowest quintile (i.e. deciles 1 and 2) had no health coverage (contributory
or non-contributory), down from 58.8% in 2006. The number of Oportunidades beneficiary
families affiliated with the PHI (intermediate indicator 4) grew from 3.06 million to 5.7 million,
compared to the original target of 4 million. The number of individuals affiliated with the PHI
residing in areas where more than 40 percent of the population speaks an indigenous language
(intermediate indicator 5) grew from 3.5 million to 6.9 million, against the original target of 4.8
million. Finally, the number of women and girls affiliated with the PHI (intermediate indicator 6)
increased from 16.9 million to 30 million, much above the original target of 22 million.

82.       The Project’s efficacy was substantial in its objective to improve the capacity of
the Commission and State Health Systems to effectively administer the entitlements of the
PHI. We use the following outcome measures to make this assessment: effectiveness at
providing preventive screenings, affiliates awareness of the PHI program, and concrete actions to
improve administration of entitlements. This assessment keeps in mind that the original objective
of the Project in this area was a relatively modest one.

83.      PDO indicator 3 can be viewed as a tracer indicator for effectiveness of coverage
and measures the number of individuals affiliated with the PHI who have received a
preventive health screening. Health prevention is particularly important in Mexico as the
country experiences an epidemiological shift, with the population increasingly struggling with
obesity and diabetes, and as health care costs rise. Over the longer term prevention strategies can
enhance the health profile of the population and lower health care cost. During the
implementation of the Project, the number of PHI affiliates that had received health screenings
increased from zero in 2009 to 22.9 million, amply surpassing the 10 million target.

84.       For PHI coverage to be effective, affiliates need to understand their rights and
obligations. While the Project indicators reveal some progress in this area, there is still an
outstanding agenda to ensure beneficiary awareness. According to the 2012 ENSANUT survey,
74.3 percent of PHI affiliates reported having received enough information to know their rights
and obligations under the PHI. (PDO Indicator 4) This is above the baseline number of 71.2
percent but below the Project target of 80 percent. The Project’s intermediate indicators show
that several interventions were undertaken to increase affiliates’ understanding of their rights, but
that this did not directly translate into “sufficient” knowledge, according to beneficiaries. For
example, the Program designed and distributed information materials on PHI rights,
responsibilities and affiliation processes through the Oportunidades program (intermediate
indicator 12). Also, in the PHI beneficiary satisfaction survey, 89 percent of PHI affiliates
reported that they had received information at the time of affiliation with regard to their right to

not pay service fees (intermediate indicator 11), higher than the targeted 80 percent. The
percentage of PHI affiliates who reported having received a bill of rights and responsibilities at
the time of affiliation (intermediate indicator 9) fell to 77.7 percent from the baseline of 81.9
percent, and missed the target of 88 percent. The percentage of PHI affiliates who reported
having received a catalogue of their benefits package at the time of affiliation (intermediate
indicator 10) fell to 74.3 percent from the baseline of 77 percent, and missed the target of 83
percent. The Technical Audit finds that the degree to which affiliates know their rights depends
on the type of benefit, in the sense that basic rights are better known than rights related to
catastrophic services. For example, over 97 percent of affiliates are aware of their right to not
pay co-payments; however less than half of family units are aware of their right to enroll children
under 5 in Siglo XXI, a catastrophic health insurance for children. (COLMEX 2014)

85.    During the implementation of the Project, the Commission implemented a
number of strategies to improve the administration of the PHI entitlements.

86.      First, the Commission increased its supervision of PHI in the states in four core
action areas (affiliation and operation, health service management, financing and
Oportunidades program). With this strategy, the Commission aimed to strengthen the
implementation of the health norms signaled by the administration, and in particular those related
to health prevention and rights of the affiliates. Intermediate indicator 7 shows that the
Commission supervised all 32 states in at least one of the four core action areas of during a
calendar year. PDO indicator 2 shows that up to 90 percent of the recommended actions resulting
from the Commission’s supervision were implemented by the states. This translated into
successful expansion of health prevention activities and promotion of the rights of affiliates.

87.      Second, the Commission took a number of concrete steps to strengthen the
administration of the program in the states. The Commission strengthened the role of medical
managers (gestores medicos) who support affiliates in accessing care; the Commission aimed to
have one medical manager per 30,000 affiliates. An agreement with the State Ministries of
Finance of all federal entities was signed in 2013 to work towards the timely transfer of PHI
resources to service providers. The Commission also supported the development of financial
monitoring indicators to ensure that resources are used for intended purposes and the
development of effective and quality coverage indicators.

88.       Third, the Commission invested in improving health information systems. It
allocated increased amounts of funding for technical assistance to improve the collection and
analysis of state health information. The corresponding intermediate indicator 8 surpassed its
target. Spending increased to US$8 million as of end-2013 from a base of US$1.7 million, nearly
US$1 million over the target. The Commission also rolled out an individualized health
information system, SINOS, 21 to support the preventive health screenings in 31 of the 32 states



21
 SINOS has been upgraded and now has a third module called Health Care, which is a primary health care medical record. The
Health Care module was originally only compulsory for the beneficiaries of the Oportunidades program and used as a verification
mechanism of responsibilities in health. The Commission has been piloting SINOS so that it can be used for the verification of

                                                             27
(intermediate indicator 14), against the target of 10 states, and 31 out of the 32 states started
capturing biometric information of individuals affiliated to the PHI Program. (intermediate
indicator 15) As of December 2013, had over 27.7 million biometric registries, approximately 64
percent of affiliates. Overall, the preventive health screening program and associated data should
help the Commission and the states to manage better manage health risks and support the health
sector’s fiscal sustainability.

89.       The Commission’s work on the development of SINOS strengthens its own and
REPSS capacity to manage health risks of PHI affiliates. SINOS aims to: (i) determine the
risk profile of PHI affiliates and generate relevant information for the planning of the SPSS, (ii)
optimize the use of the resources transferred to States, (iii) strengthen the prevention schemes for
the population affiliated to PHI, (iv) track personalized health actions based on the National
Health Card and (v) strengthen mechanisms for monitoring compliance mechanisms.
Information generated through SINOS will gradually be consolidated at various levels (national,
state, judicial, municipal and health unit). The system requires the coordinated effort of the
REPSS and the State Health Services for integrating the information through a control panel. In
addition to determining affiliates risk profile, the system aims to generate information for
planning purposes, optimize resource targeting, strengthen prevention schemes, track
personalized health actions based on the National Health Card and strengthen monitoring
compliance mechanisms for Oportunidades.

90.       Fourth, the Commission financed a wide range of studies. Approximately 11 studies
were mapped to the Project though the Commission actually carried out more than 45 different
studies in 2010-2012 valued over US$26 million (See Table 2). The studies focused on a number
of the issues listed in the PAD, such as the knowledge of beneficiaries regarding their
entitlements, the design of existing mechanisms, and the evaluation of the PHI in general.
However it is difficult to link the wide array of studies with concrete improvements in the
Commission and State Health Systems capacity to manage health risks, enhance performance
management or institute reforms. The data used generally measured the period preceding the
Project’s implementation and in some cases proved too short a period to demonstrate an impact,
however the studies do provide ample evidence regarding the initial impact of PHI on utilization,
access and efficiency, etc. The majority of the studies were carried out by CIDE, while some
were carried out by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional
Autónoma de México, UNAM), the Autonomous University of Chapingo, the University of
Guadalajara and the College of Mexico (Colegio de México – COLMEX).

91.      Dissemination of study results. During the mid-term review the Commission jointly
with CIDE organized a seminar where some results were presented. Some of the main
conclusions were the following:
    • Effective coverage and the impact on health conditions appear positive though difficult to
       measure.
    • PHI reduced the financial burden imposed by health expenditures, particularly
       catastrophic ones, to the formerly uninsured households in Mexico.
    • Health care utilization has been positively affected by the PHI.
    • The gap between public and private health spending has narrowed.
    • Universal health coverage is a moving target therefore continuous monitoring and
       evaluation is essential to introduce necessary adjustments.

92.       The Bank worked closely with the Commission on the dissemination of the studies.
The Bank supported the documentation and dissemination of important results and lessons
learned from the implementation of the SPSS at national and international workshops, seminars
and conferences in and outside Mexico. In 2012 the World Bank organized an international
conference presenting numerous papers drawing on different data sets and methodologies
regarding the PHI’s effects on the formality of the workforce. The forum brought together
policy-makers, researchers and experts from around the world to discuss research findings about
the impact of Mexico’s SPSS in health on formal sector labor force participation and debated its
relevance for health systems world-wide. The World Bank also supported the Commission
through the promotion of a bilateral cooperation with the German Society of Pediatric Oncology
and Hematology to reduce the variability of health outcomes and costs in the care of children
with cancer. As part of the cooperation, the World Bank financed travel costs of two German
experts to participate in a workshop jointly organized by the World Bank and the Commission in
Mexico City on December 7-8, 2011. Finally, the World Bank financed an exchange with the
Argentine Plan Nacer team on Consulta Segura.

93.       As mentioned in Section 2.1, the Project aimed to support Mexico in achieving
universal health coverage. Therefore it is useful to look beyond the Project’s original indicators
(which mostly look at population coverage) to evaluate whether there were any impacts on
financial protection and on the quantity and quality of health services, and on final health
outcomes.

94.       As the number of PHI beneficiaries increased, federal and state expenditure on
PHI (intermediate indicator 1) increased from US$3.4 billion in 2009 to over US$5.2 billion in
2013, significantly above the target of US$4.5 billion. Public spending on health grew from 2.55
percent of GDP in 2003 to 3.1 percent in 2012. (Figure 3). While the trend is positive, total
health expenditure per capita (US$977) and as a percentage of GDP (6.2 percent) remain
significantly below the OECD averages (US$3,322 and 9.3 percent respectively). (OECD 2013)

95.      Due to its focus on individuals lacking social security, the PHI program is highly
progressive and has contributed to closing inequities in health financing. In fact, the PHI and
Oportunidades are among the most progressive programs in Mexico. (Figure 4) The difference in
per capita financing for health between those without social security and those with social
security decreased from 145 percent in 2004 to 51 percent in 2011. 23 In 2000 the difference
between the state receiving the greatest allocation of Federal resources per person and the state
receiving the least was 6.1 to 1, by 2010 the difference was 3 to 1. (Knaul 2012)

96.       The expansion of PHI improved beneficiary financial protection. A randomized
study by King et al. (2009) estimated that the reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures was 915
pesos per year. Avila-Burgos et al (2012) find that PHI reduced the probability that a household
would spend out-of-pocket for health by 2 percentage points, from a baseline probability of 52
percent. In addition, they find that PHI reduced the likelihood of catastrophic health expenditures
by 36.8 percent. 25 Knaul et al. (2012) find that the gap in financial protection between
households covered by social security, and those not covered reduced between 2004 and 2010.
(Table 4) While the share of OOP expenditures in total health expenditure fell gradually between
2003 and 2011, (Table 3) it remains high and suggests that the population uses private sector
services either because it perceives them to be of better quality or because they continue to
encounter obstacles in accessing public services.

97.       The range of covered services rose considerably during the Project’s
implementation. Between 2009 and 2013, the gap in the benefits packages offered by social
security and PHI gradually reduced, as PHI started to cover an increasing number of health
interventions and medicines. Currently, the PHI catalogue of health services (CAUSES) covers
285 health interventions and 609 drugs. PHI affiliates are also covered by the Fund against
Catastrophic Expenditure, which itself covers 59 groups of diseases. (Figure 5)

98.       Still, the availability of services continues to be an issue. According to CONEVAL
(2014), the supply of services has not kept up with the number of affiliates. For example, at 1.7
the number of hospital beds per 1000 people remains significantly below the OECD average of
4.8. (OECD 2013) According to an Inter-American Development Bank study, the Government is
still unable to guarantee a universal package of benefits as many clinics and hospitals cannot
provide the services that are part of a universal package. (Bosch 2012) For example, though
breast cancer treatment is financed through the catastrophic fund, only 25 percent of the needed
radiologists are available to meet the demand. Some states have addressed this issue by
improving their referral system so that small medical health centers have the tools to refer
patients when lacking the necessary service.

99.       There continues to be a large disparity between States in availability of services.
(CONEVAL 2014) PHI reimbursements to the states from the catastrophic fund partially hinge
on the availability of accredited hospital and centers – yet there is a wide disparity in how many
accredited centers the states have. The poorest States tend to be the ones with the fewest
accredited facilities 27, and the largest need of funding to bring their facilities up to the required
level, yet PHI funding is generally not sufficient for the States to update their facilities. There is
a need for PHI to more actively monitor accreditation levels and focus attention on those states
that need to catch up.

100.     On the utilization side, there is some evidence of increased utilization of services,
and that the program has led to a shift in services from the private sector to the public
sector. Utilization of public hospitals rose from 25.9 percent in 2000 to 38.3 percent in 2012,
while private sector hospital use declined from 24 percent to 17 percent. (INSP 2012) The first

  This is based on interviews – at the time of the ICR, we could not obtain information on numbers and trends in
accreditation of facilities in the states.

semester 2013 evaluation of the PHI found that in urban areas there was a 30 percent increase in
the number of doctor visits by affiliated urban women between 20-60 years of age. (CNPSS
2013) For children under five there has been a shift in medical attention from private and social
security-linked hospitals to public hospitals. (Figure 6: Hospitalization of Children under 5:
Provider Share). However, further information would be needed on the quality of services in the
public sector to evaluate whether this shift was a positive development.

101.      The evidence regarding the impact of PHI on health outcomes is mixed. A
randomized study by King et al. (2009) found a 23 percent reduction from the baseline in
catastrophic expenditures, but no effects on medication spending, utilization or health outcomes.
The evaluation found that the Program’s resources reached the poor, but that the Program did not
show other effects, possibly due to the short duration of the evaluation (10 months). All other
evaluations of the program use non-experimental methods and results vary. Most studies do not
find large effects on standard indicators of maternal and child care usage, possibly because the
baseline levels were high to start with. By contrast, in a recent paper, Pfutze (2014) uses a
weighted exogenous sampling maximum likelihood (WESML) estimator and finds that PHI can
be expected to reduce Mexico’s infant mortality rate by close to 5 out of 1,000 births. A few
evaluations look at the impact of PHI in those areas that now form 90 percent of the burden of
disease, i.e. non-communicable diseases and injury. (Knaul et al.) Teruel et al (2014) use the
                                               34
2002 and 2009-2011 rounds of the MxFLS and find positive impact of the program on health
services, detection and diagnosis for urban women and rural men. They also find an
improvement of health status for urban women, rural men, and children in areas related to
chronic conditions. (See Annex 4)

102.      Part of the explanation for the mixed evidence on a the link between PHI and
MDG health outcomes may be that funding to the states for PHI ends up strengthening the
entire health system in the state, which benefits not only PHI beneficiaries. The comparison
between PHI affiliates to non-affiliates within states may be biased because non-affiliates may
benefit from improvements in health services as well. Some states such as Puebla have made
particularly impressive progress on the MDGs such as maternal mortality (Box 1) and have used
PHI funds to finance their intervention strategies against Maternal Mortality. In practice, women
who need emergency services and are not affiliated are affiliated at the time they need the
service. This kind of strategy makes it challenging to compare affiliated and non-affiliated
populations to extract the impact of the program. Still, overall the numbers seem promising. For
Example, Knaul et al. (2012) find that the gaps in maternal and under-5 mortality have been
reduced between those who have access to social security (i.e. the formally employed and their
immediate family members), and those who don’t. (Table 5)

        Table 5: Evolution of Gaps in Health Outcomes between Social Security Affiliates and Non

103.      The expansion of health insurance coverage took place alongside an improvement
in Mexico’s Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators. Infant and under-five
mortality rates have decreased significantly over the years, and the country is on track to achieve
the MDG of reducing under-five mortality (Table 6), partly due to rise in the number of births
attended by skilled physicians, currently approximately 95 percent of all births. (OECD 2013).
The maternal mortality rate has also improved, though it is unlikely to reach the MDG target of
22 deaths per 1000 births by 2015. (PROSESA)

(c) Indigenous People’s Plan

104.       The Indigenous Peoples Plan had three main objectives. The first objective was to
remove health service barriers identified in the social assessment in order to (i) promote
indigenous peoples enrollment taking into account specific socio-economic and cultural
characteristics; and (ii) raise awareness about the importance of health insurance as well as PHI
beneficiary entitlements. The second objective was to strengthen the capacity of the Commission
to: (i) monitor the affiliation of indigenous peoples to the PHI as it was scaled up; (ii) monitor
the delivery and accreditation of health services in priority indigenous localities as defined by the
CDI and rural areas; (iii) monitor indigenous peoples’ satisfaction with the PHI, incorporating
indigenous localities in its semi-annual user satisfaction surveys; and (iv) improve the SPSS’s
information system by disaggregating data by gender and ethnicity. The third objective was to
strengthen the capacity of the State Health Systems to support the implementation of IPP
activities.

105.       The Project benefited the indigenous population through increased affiliation and
specific actions as specified in the Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP). This is important because
the health status of indigenous peoples has historically been poor in Mexico, with access to
health services constrained due to remote and rural residence and lack of contributory social
security enrollment. The social assessment prepared during the Project’s design identified many
of the issues hindering PHI enrollment of indigenous peoples. Based on these finding, the Project
prepared and implemented a strategy that went beyond the Government’s initial cultural and
communication plans for targeting the population. In order to support the affiliation and re-
affiliation of Indigenous people to the Program, the Commission worked with the Indigenous
Peoples Development Commission (CDI) to implement a radio and visual information campaign
in numerous indigenous languages. The PHI program also supported sensitivity training for
health personnel and hired bilingual staff as health promoters, gestores (health information
managers that deal with complaints and promote affiliates rights and knowledge) and affiliation
staff in areas with significant indigenous populations. The significant increase in enrollment
among this marginalized population reflects the success of the framework. Between 2006 and
2012, the gap in insurance coverage rates between indigenous and non-indigenous populations
was virtually eliminated, and significant advances were made in narrowing service coverage
gaps (eg. hospital based births) and even health outcomes (eg. stunting), even though there
remain significant service utilization differences. (Leyva et al. 2012 and Figure 7). Despite the
IIP objectives, during the Project the Commission did not regularly publish information on the
delivery and accreditation of health services in priority indigenous localities, though this would
be possible on the basis of information available at the Commission.

                                       Box 1: The Case of Puebla

The state of Puebla is one of the states with the largest reported indigenous population and with a
hard to reach rural mountainous population. The state reflects a positive example of innovation
and coordination between the different health providers in the area of outreach to indigenous
populations.

In an effort to affiliate the hard to reach indigenous population, Puebla used PHI resources to
establish traditional medicine centers alongside mainstream hospitals. The eight traditional
centers include traditional midwives, healers and hueseros (chiropractor or masseuse) and provide
their services in coordination with the neighboring hospital. For example, while pregnant women
can choose to receive prenatal care and give birth with a traditional midwife in the traditional
medicine center, they must also attend five pre-natal visits with the obstetrician/gynecologist in
the adjoining hospital. Traditional midwives are trained to detect risks during prenatal care and
deliveries, and the medical hospital staff are on hand to attend any complications that occur.

Puebla has also been successful in reaching the indigenous population through a successful
coordination with the CDI, and in particular through regularly scheduled indigenous language
radio stations. The state has also hired health promoters and medical managers (gestores) who are
fluent in the local indigenous language.

Puebla used PHI funding to implement a multi-step program to address the main causes of
maternal mortality. This program includes close monitoring of high-risk hospitalized obstetric
cases, an agreement with the Red Cross to attend uncomplicated normal deliveries, the
establishment of maternal homes where women who live far away from medical centers can stay
before giving birth, and the establishment of a triage and escalation system for emergency
obstetric cases. In addition, a maternal defunction triggers an immediate administrative
investigation as to its causes. As a result of the program, maternal mortality in Puebla dropped
from 63 cases in 2012 to 37 in 2013. Death of mothers affiliated to PHI, remained the highest in
2013 (15) but fell 53 percent year-on-year. (Source: Presentation on “Reducción Muerte Materna
Puebla Sana”).


(d) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework

106.       During the implementation of the Project, the Commission invested heavily in
improving its M&E capabilities. These included the development of indicators for monitoring
at the state level, technical assistance to improve the collection and analysis of information in the
States, investments in health information systems such as an individualized health information
system to support preventive health screenings, and the rollout of a biometric identification
system for affiliates. The Commission carried out a wide range of studies that included various
evaluations of the PHI program. (Annex 2)

107.      PHI was evaluated using a randomized evaluation methodology before the
approval of the Project. (King et al. 2009) At the time of the Project’s design, it was not
deemed possible to carry out a second impact evaluation of the Program, despite the fact that the
first evaluation did not demonstrate impacts on service utilization or health outcomes, possibly
due to a rather short evaluation timeframe. During the implementation of the Project, the

Commission contracted several external evaluations of the PHI program. (Eg. Lazcano 2012 and
Lozano 2013)

108.     The Project M&E Framework used a multi-pronged approach that included
existing administrative data and regular survey data. At Project closing, the combination of
these approaches allowed for measurement of PDOs. At the same time, the M&E framework
could have made fuller use of regular survey data, and there were weaknesses in the indicators’
design and definition, which resulted in unclear and imprecise measurement of certain outcomes
during the Project’s implementation.

109.      Better definition of indicators would have enhanced the Project M&E
Framework. First, The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the Operational Manual (OM)
lacked detailed information about indicator calculation. For a number of indicators, including
PDO indicator 1 and intermediate indicators 3, 4 and 5, the monitoring framework was
ambivalent about whether the indicator’s target was the percentage or the numerator and did not
give sufficient specification of the denominator. The monitoring framework seemed to suggest
that the baseline value of the denominators would be used for all subsequent years, in which case
using absolute numbers would have been a better choice: the use of percentages does not convey
more information about project achievement since they were not adjusted for population shifts or
changes in contributory insurance affiliation. 30 Second, a number of indicators were rather
complex, yet the design documents were incomplete as to the source of data and methods of
calculation. For example, PDO indicator 1 cannot be calculated on the basis of program
indicators from the Commission only; intermediate indicator 3 was calculated on the basis of the
ENSANUT (instead of ENIGH according to the PAD), yet this was not reported during
supervision. PDO indicator 2 was revised in the first restructuring partly to add baseline and
target values. However, the unit of measure does not correspond to the indicator definition
(percentage of actions) and therefore the target values in the restructured M&E framework are
not appropriate.

110.      The Project’s M&E Framework would also have benefited from having fewer and
less complex indicators, but including indicators to measure effective access. While the
Project’s monitoring framework included a wide array of indicators measuring affiliation, PDO
indicator 3 is the only one that captures utilization of services by PHI affiliates. The Program’s
success towards increasing effective access to health services could have been measured through:
(i) public health spending per beneficiary, (ii) composition of PHI affiliates by income quintiles
based on household surveys (iii) service availability and utilization.

111.    During implementation, the lack of clarity in the design of the indicators resulted
in imprecise measurement of a number of outcomes. A number of indicators that were

  At the time of the Project’s design, the most recent population numbers were those from the 2005 Population Counting (Conteo
de Población). The 2010 Population and Household Census data was carried out in June 2010, however, the final data only
became available in early 2012, and therefore they were not used in adjusting the project indicators.



                                                             39
expressed as percentages reached over 100 percent. Other indicators reached high levels but were
not confirmed by alternative data sources. For example, intermediate indicator 3 reported that
coverage of PHI among the non-insured in deciles 1 and 2 reached 97 percent, using the 2012
National Health and Nutrition Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrición – ENSANUT).
Yet a study by Gutierrez (2013) using the same dataset finds that approximately 20 percent of
individuals in those deciles were not covered by any health insurance, which gives a rather
different picture of the situation. As a result, this indicator does not convey accurate information
about the reach of the program. In this context, it is important to note that the different household
surveys in Mexico have different sampling and calculation methodologies, and therefore,
indicators can be different depending on the source of data. While this is not under the control of
the implementing agency, it is critical to spell out the source of data and methods of calculation
in the project design documents to ensure replicability and comparability of the indicators that
are used to monitor the project.

112.      Despite the issues with the M&E Framework, at the time of the ICR there were
sufficient data available to estimate the efficacy of the Project. The existence of regular
household surveys allows to use alternate measures where needed. Table 7 presents the key
issues that were encountered with the indicators, and the ICR’s approach in evaluating the
Project.

                                    (2008) to 72.32% (2012).
                                    While the numbers based on ENIGH and ENSANUT are
                                    somewhat different due to different calculation methods,

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

113.      In this Annex, we estimate whether the Project was cost effective, using a break-
even analysis. To do so, we first estimate the costs of the PHI Program. We then estimate the
required reduction in the burden of disease for the Program to break even between costs and
benefits.

114.      The gross per capita cost of the PHI program is 2,735 Pesos per person per year.
This amount includes the Social Contribution from the Federal Government and the Federal and
State solidarity contributions from both the Federal and State Governments. (See Table 8) While
the World Bank project only directly financed the federal Social Contribution, the cost of the
program should include all funding sources. It is important to note that this does not necessarily
correspond to the amounts that are transferred to the States, as those are adjusted for other
programs that are financed by the Federal Government and benefit PHI beneficiaries, such as the
health investments financed by the Oportunidades program.

115.      To obtain the net cost of the PHI program, one needs to take into account the
possible reduction in out-of-pocket spending by beneficiaries. Reductions in out-of-pocket
spending are equivalent to a transfer from the Government to beneficiaries and should not be
counted as part of the economic cost of the program. King et al. (2009) estimate that the transfer
value of the program is 915 pesos per year (Table 8).

116.      Since PHI has beneficiaries across different age ranges and includes a wide variety
of health services and conditions, it could potentially have impacts on multiple health
outcomes. For the economic analysis, we can convert the multiple metrics into saved Disability
Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and compare the saved DALYs to the cost of the program to
obtain a measure of cost-effectiveness. (Saban et al, 2012) We then benchmark the cost per
DALY saved against national per capita GDP to assess whether the intervention is cost-effective
in the Mexican context. However, since we do not have comprehensive estimates of the impact
of PHI, we take the inverse approach: we estimate the percentage reduction in DALY burden of
disease that would be required for the PHI program to break-even against the benchmark of GDP
per capita.

117.      The 2004 Burden of Disease estimates that Mexico had a burden of disease of
15,430 DALYs per 100,000 inhabitants. (Table 9) There are two potential problems with using
this burden of disease estimates. First, Mexico has experienced increases in life expectancy and
decreases in infant mortality since 2004 - in that sense the 2004 burden of disease estimates may
                                               43
overestimate the situation in 2010, at the start of the Project. On the other hand, the PHI program
excludes individuals who have alternative health insurance schemes, which tend to be those that
are better-off – in that sense the burden of disease estimates may underestimate the burden of
disease for PHI beneficiaries. However, we do not have either more updated numbers, or
estimates that are specific to the PHI intended beneficiaries. Since it is likely that the two effects
somewhat compensate each other, we will use the 2004 burden of disease estimate for the
general population as our best estimate of the 2010 burden of disease for the PHI intended
beneficiaries.

118.     In 2010, GDP per capita was estimated to be MXPs 112,215 (World Development
Indicators). In Table 10, we simulate the cost per DALY saved for different percentage
reductions in the overall burden of disease. We find that an overall reduction in the burden of
disease of 11 percent for PHI beneficiaries would result in a break-even situation where the cost
per DALY saved is equal to GDP per capita.

119.      We then analyze available results to decide whether an 11 percent reduction in the
burden of disease is a likely impact of PHI. A number of studies have looked into the impact
of PHI on health outcomes. A randomized study by King et al. (2009) assessed the impact of
rolling out PHI, and finds a 23 percent reduction from the baseline in catastrophic expenditures,
but no effects on medication spending, health outcomes or utilization. The evaluation found that
the Program’s resources reached the poor, but that the program did not show other effects,
possibly due to the short duration of treatment (10 months). All other evaluations of the program
use non-experimental methods and results vary. For example, Gakidou et al (2006) and Scott
(2006) find that SP beneficiaries have higher utilization rates than the uninsured. Bernal et al
(2010) use the 2006 and 2009 ENADID 31 to estimate utilization of pre-natal services and health
services during the first year of life, and find no impact of PHI. However, they argue that already
in 2002, the first year of operation of the program, 97 percent of the eligible women already

received prenatal care, and 96 percent of children under one year of age already received medical
care, which makes it unlikely to find a significant effect of any program on those indicators. At
the same time, they do find a 3 percentage point increase in the probability that deliveries in the
rural areas were attended by a medical doctor, comparing to an 83 percent baseline. The authors
do not find any evidence of an impact on low birth weight in public or social-security
maternities. However, the treatment variable used in the evaluation is the state-level status of
PHI enrollment, which is a noisy indicator of individual enrollment in the program. Therefore the
estimates will suffer from attenuation bias and are likely to underestimate the impact of the
Program. In a recent paper, Pfutze (2014) uses a weighted exogenous sampling maximum
likelihood (WESML) estimator and finds that PHI can be expected to reduce Mexico’s infant
mortality rate by close to 5 out of 1,000 births.

120.      Part of the explanation for the mixed evidence on the link between PHI and MDG
health outcomes may be that funding to the states for PHI ends up strengthening the entire
health system in the state. The comparison between PHI affiliates to non-affiliates within states
may be biased because non-affiliates may benefit from improvements in health services as well.
For example, some states such as Puebla have made particularly impressive progress on the
MDGs such as maternal mortality (Annex 2, Box 1) and have used PHI funds to finance their
intervention strategies.

121.       A few evaluations look at the impact of PHI in those areas that now form 90
percent of the burden of disease, i.e. non-communicable diseases and injury. (Knaul et al.)
Parker and Rubalcava (2010) use the MxFLS 2002 and 2005 and find no impact in diabetes,
arthritis, migraine, obesity or heart disease; however, they find a reduction in cholesterol levels
and days off work due to illness. Teruel et al (2014) use the 2002 and 2009-2011 rounds of the
MxFLS and find positive impact of the Program on health services, detection and diagnosis for
urban women and rural men. They also find an improvement of health status for urban women,
rural men, and children in areas related to chronic conditions.

122.      Overall, we estimate that it is modestly likely that the PHI achieved an 11 percent
reduction in the overall burden of disease, thereby rendering it moderately likely that the
Program was cost-effective. However, the lack of a rigorous evaluation strategy that
encompasses more than 1 year of program exposure is unfortunate from the policy point of view,
especially given the magnitude of the investment.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

123.     The Commission carried out three beneficiary studies (Encuesta Nacional de
Afiliados al Seguro Popular) during Project implementation, in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The
panel surveys obtained information on the personal characteristics of affiliates and their
households, interactions with the PHI, and health expenditure.

124.       The 2012 satisfaction survey of PHI affiliates 32 found a 97 percent satisfaction
with PHI, with a high satisfaction for all service components (affiliation process, medical
attention, etc.). Ninety-nine percent of those surveyed planned to re-affiliate, with most
providing the fact that service is free, that they receive good attention and that they don’t have
access to another health insurance as the main reasons for re-affiliation. Most interviewed felt
they received a detailed explanation of what they were suffering. The average wait time for
receiving attention was 104 minutes, with variations between states from 69 minutes to 157
minutes. Most affiliates say they would return to the same health center. However, less than half
of the affiliates received information concerning their rights at the time of affiliation. Indigenous
affiliates rated satisfaction with PHI in the satisfaction survey between 8.5 and 9.7 (total of 10).

125.       While the surveys show high satisfaction levels, the survey does not fully represent
the population of PHI affiliates because it selected PHI affiliates at the point of service exit.
Hence the survey implicitly excluded PHI affiliates who did not choose to attend PHI health
centers or those that went to alternative providers; arguably these could be the PHI affiliates that
are less satisfied or have given up on receiving services from PHI providers.

126.       In terms of socio-demographics, the surveys showed the following:
   •     Demographics: Most affiliates live in households with less than five members. Most PHI
         affiliates are women and their family members: 54.5 percent, 56.4 percent and 57.8
         percent in 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively. The age of affiliates has increased over the
         last few years, from 26 for males and 28 for females in 2010 to 27 and 30 respectively in
         2012. Nine out of 10 affiliates speaks Spanish. According to the 2012 survey 37.8 percent
         of affiliates had only finished primary school, 31.7 percent had finished secondary and
         12.2 percent had completed high school.
     •   Housing: Four out of every five households having a separate cooking space. Most
         households have electricity, but only slightly over half have running water.
         Approximately 60 percent of households are connected to drainage systems. Over 75
         percent of households are tenants.
     •   Employment: Fifty-eight percent of the affiliates were employed in urban jobs. Ninety-
         three percent of affiliates (2012) counted on only one type of health service.

127.     Approximately a third of the surveyed affiliates experienced an illness in 2010 and
2011, though this number fell to a fourth in 2012. During the three surveys the number of


32
  The 2012 survey is the latest available. The Ministry of Health carries out a satisfaction survey for PHI affiliates
on a biannual basis.

                                                         48
affiliates that required hospitalization due to an illness or lesion increased from 9.9 percent in
2010, to 13.3 percent in 2012, while those that sought attention but did not receive it fell from
3.2 percent to 1.2 percent between 2011 and 2012. The likelihood of experiencing a respiratory
illness fell from 52.2 percent to 31 percent between 2010 and 2012, while treatment for diabetes
increased to 6.7 percent of affiliates in 2012 from 4.3 percent in 2010. Most affiliates
(94.7percent in 2011 and 93.2 percent in 2012) that sought attention only realized one visit to the
health center.

128.      More than four-fifths of PHI affiliates who received attention were prescribed
medicine. Of these 79 percent obtained the prescribed medicine in 2010, 74 percent in 2011 and
75.4 percent in 2012. The most frequent reason for which affiliates did not obtain medicine was
due to unavailability. Medicine costs were covered through own income (54.6 percent in 2011
and 44 percent in 2012), savings (26.2 and 21.2 percent, respectively), and loans (21.9 and 15.3
percent, respectively).

129.       The beneficiary surveys show that coverage of health care costs by PHI increased
between 2010 and 2012. In 2010, the PHI partially covered medical costs for 28.8 percent of
affiliates and fully covered costs for 41.5 percent of all affiliates. In 2011 it partially covered
costs 27.5 percent and total 51.7 percent of affiliates and 20.9 percent and 56 percent,
respectively, in 2012. In 2010, 29.7 of the affiliates surveyed stated that the PHI did not cover
their costs; 20.8 percent in 2011 and 23.2 percent in 2012. For those that required hospitalization,
in 2010 28.8 percent said the PHI covered part of the costs, 38.1 percent in 2011 and 28.6
percent in 2012. The PHI totally covered hospitalization costs in 41.5 percent, 41.7 percent and
50 percent of the cases, respectively. The reasons given for non-coverage included: affiliates
were not attended to or the illness was not covered; service was deficient or took too long;
affiliates were seen by a private doctor; and administrative issues. Over time, the surveys show a
decrease in the issues that affiliates encountered in the search for health services.

130.       The number of affiliates that were aware that they could make complaints
increased from a little less than half in 2010 to 61.6 percent in 2012. The proportion of
affiliates that actually made complaints increased from 1 to 2 percent over the time period
covered.

Unofficial translation of the Borrower’s Comments on the Draft ICR

   •   [Intermediate Indicator 2]: At the end of 2013, the number of entities that contributed
       with their State Solidarity Contribution was all 32 entities in the country; none of them
       failed to comply with this requirement of participation in the Social Protección System in
       Health.

   •   [Intermediate Indicator 4]: The correct number of Oportunidades families at the closing
       [of the Project] is 5.7 million and not 6.3 million; for this reason the calculations and
       comments about this indicator should be corrected in the document. On page 25, there is
       a reference to the correct number, as follows: “The number of Oportunidades beneficiary
       families affiliated with the PHI (intermediate indicator 4) grew from 3.06 million to 5.7
       million, compared to the original target of 4 million.”

   •   [Intermediate Indicator 6]: The denominator was established in the Project Appraisal
       Document and was used as the basis for the calculation of the indicator. However, the
       growth of the affiliation led to an increase in the number of affiliated women, to a larger
       extent than for men because women tend to have more precarious and vulnerable labor
       conditions.

   •   [Intermediate Indicators 9, 10 and 11]: The indicators about the receipt of the letter of
       rights and obligations and about the benefits exhibit a large variation nationally between
       the different federal entities. This fact is outlined in various parts of the document;
       however, it should be emphasized so as to demonstrate that the knowledge and
       dissemination [of information] depend on how the Regímenes Estatales del Sistema de
       Protección Social en Salud (REPSS) are organized.

   •   The national sources of data that are external to the Commission (CNPSS) present
       variability in their results as well as in their [methods] of processing results; this leads to
       limited consistency with the presented indicators. This problem is transversal to the
       national sources of statistical information which are being generated by various national
       institutions; their design and elaboration is not the competency of the Commission. The
       construction of the instruments used to collect the variables on income is different
       between ENIGH and ENSANUT; the methods used by those surveys to calculate income
       are also different in the sense that they are constructed using different concepts.

   •   There has been a change in the General Health Law’s articles 77 bis, bis 6, bis 11, and bis
       16. These changes were submitted through the Legislative chambers in 2013 and
       approved, and they will become effective with the signing of the executive in 2014.
       Those reforms aim to improve the efficiency of the use of resources of Seguro Popular
       destined to the affiliates in the federal entities through the REPPS, while improving the
       capacity of the CNPSS to supervise and reinforce the rules, so that the resources are used
       for health services in the federal entities.

   •   The CIDE is the institution that has the most qualified personnel in the country in health
       economics and in areas related to social protection systems. In addition, [the institution]
                                               59
    has the technical knowledge to use the pertinent analysis tools. This is the reason for
    which this institution assumed the largest part of the responsibilities for the studies. On
    the other hand, we note that there were other academic institutions involved in various
    projects; for example the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Autonomous
    University of Chapingo, the University of Guadalajara, and the College of Mexico were
    involved in studies carried out by the CNPSS.

•   [Intermediate Indicator 5]: When the Project indicators were established in February
    2010, the most recent data available were those from the 2005 Population Counting
    which clearly did not correspond to the real number of inhabitants at the time [2010].
    The [new] Population and Household Census was carried out in July of 2010, the first
    data were released early 2011, and the final results were released early 2012. For this
    reason they were not used and the denominator that was used was the number that was
    registered at the beginning.

•   [Table 2 (c): Study on the use of health service access of the PHI affiliated indigenous
    populations]: The study confirmed the indigenous population’s lack of knowledge
    regarding their rights and responsibilities regarding the PHI, while documenting the
    group’s growing affiliation and coverage. The study also revealed how health centers in
    indigenous areas often did not have the necessary infrastructure, personnel and medicine,
    while geographic, economic, cultural and administrative factors hindered health care
    access.

•   [Indigenous People’s Plan]: In the Social Protection System in Health Results Report
    which is presented every semester by CNPSS to the [Mexican] Congress, there is
    information on the number of accredited health units that can offer services [listed] in
    CAUSES, FPGC and SMSXXI. The report does not present a breakdown of those units
    but it can be done, because the General Direction of Affiliation and Operations makes
    trimestral tabulations of the population that is affiliated to the System and of the health
    units that give health services, using information from the General Direction of Health
    Information. Using those [data], it is possible to elaborate tables such as the one
    presented below, with breakdown by jurisdiction and municipality, although this is not
    being regularly published. [Table follows.]
