Protection System in Health\n            Project for Mexico had a satisfactory outcome with low or\n            negligible risk to development outcome, and moderately\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and borrower.\n            Significant changes included two Level II restructurings.\n            Several lessons were learned.  UHC consists of three\n            inter-related components which should be considered: (i)\n            coverage for the entire population; (ii) financial\n            protection from direct payment for health services when\n            consumed; and (iii) the full spectrum of quality health\n            services according to need. While Popular Health Insurance\n            (PHI) has succeeded in narrowing health funding differences\n            between the States, there are still significant differences\n            in performance and outcomes, which largely mimic\n            socio-economic differences amongst the states. There is a\n            need to rethink incentives for the states and their\n            providers to improve health care performance. Regarding the\n            project's design, many lessons were learned.  The\n            Project had a dual aim of protecting financing for PHI\n            (which required fast disbursement) and providing technical\n            assistance (which required long-term engagement). In loans\n            that incorporate a significant component of technical\n            assistance, procurement arrangements are crucial to ensure\n            that the component will be executed as expected. Where\n            appropriate, procurement arrangements should use country\n            systems. Even in Programs that aim at universal coverage,\n            there is a need for specific approaches and strategies to\n            reach the most vulnerable segments of the population.\n            Evidence generation and regular monitoring and evaluation\n            are crucial for policy, strategy and program decision-making."}, "docdt": "2014-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
