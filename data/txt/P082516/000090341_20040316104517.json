negative impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic\n            on the stabilization, recovery, and development of the\n            Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This will be achieved\n            by: (i) Reducing the risk of sexual, intravenous and\n            vertical transmission of HIV; (ii) Improving the health\n            status and quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS;\n            and (iii) Mitigating the socio-economic impact of the\n            epidemic on vulnerable groups. The project has the following\n            four components: Component 1) the project will assist and\n            support the mobilization of public institutions in the fight\n            against this epidemic by mainstreaming HIV/AIDS activities\n            in their regular work program. Activities by public sector\n            institutions on behalf of their staff and families, as well\n            as their clients will be financed on a competitive basis.\n            Component 2) The project will support HIV/AIDS activities\n            proposed by the HIV/AIDS Inter-Enterprise Committee (CIELS).\n            CIELS is an umbrella organization for private sector\n            entities and public enterprises and will serve as an\n            interface and coordinate the preparation and submission of\n            proposals by member enterprises at the national, provincial,\n            and local levels. Non-governmental and faith-based\n            organizations will be mobilized and supported to help\n            implement the national strategic plan supported by this\n            project. Component 3) A 'community' will be\n            understood as any human group mobilized around a common\n            interest. A community may be a village, a neighborhood, a\n            school or any local association. The component's\n            objective is to increase the impact of HIV/AIDS activities\n            by transferring the responsibility for identifying\n            priorities, and preparing and implementing micro-projects\n            directly to the beneficiaries in rural and urban areas.\n            Component 4) The National Coordination Unit (NCU) will be\n            responsible for coordinating the overall implementation of\n            the program. The National Coordination Unit NCU will be\n            decentralized at the provincial (Provincial Coordination\n            Units) and local (Local Coordination Units) levels."}, "docdt": "2004-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
