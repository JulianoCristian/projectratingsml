                           RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY

 The proposed restructuring aims to: (i) separate the functions of the coordinator of
 the Bank project implementation unit and the coordinator of the national body
 charged with coordinating HIV/AIDS programs, in order to allow more focus on
 project implementation and at the same time ensuring sustainability of the national
 response ; (ii) modify activities under the community component to shift from
 multiple community micro-projects to community outreach programs using a limited
 number of large actors ; (iii) revise the project's key indicators and targets to adjust
 to the revised project activities and address the current difficulties in obtaining some
 of the data ; and (iv) reallocation of budget categories into a single expenditure
 category for the uncommitted proceeds of the grant to facilitate disbursement as the
 project nears completion.

 In total these changes should allow the project to improve its performance prior to the
 closing date of January 2011.



PROJECT STATUS
  The project has been in problem status for over three years, with current rating at
  moderately unsatisfactory (MU) on implementation performance (IP). Project
  disbursement is currently at SDR 47.9 (US$ 71.8 million equivalent) with a little over
  seven months left before closing. To improve the project performance, the scope of
  some activities has been reduced and a restructuring is proposed.



PROPOSED CHANGES

 The Project Development Objective (PDO) will remain as follows: to assist the
 Recipient in: (i) increasing the access to STI/HIV/AIDS treatment; (ii) mitigating the health
 and socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS at the individual, household, and community level;
 and (iii) building strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS
 epidemic. The project was part of an umbrella restructuring for Africa HIV/AIDS
 Projects in May 2007 which included revision of PDO and PDO indicators. While the
 PDO will remain unchanged under the proposed restructuring, key indicators will be

                                           5
    further revised to better reflect the current state of the epidemic and to take into account
    serious data constraints. Through this revision the newly approved Bank-wide Core
    indicators for HIV-AIDS were incorporated.

    Proposed revised indicators and targets are described below.

                        HIV/AIDS control




       Overall, project design will remain the same although
       the scope of activities under each component will be
       reduced. Initial project design was too optimistic about
       how quickly implementation capacity could be built in
       the multiple agencies involved in the project. The
       changes are the following:
        ·   Separation of the role of project coordinator from the role of national
            coordinator for the National Program for the Fight Against HIV/AIDS.

        ·   Shifting implementation of the Community Initiatives component from
            multiple small communities to a small number of experienced national and
            international NGOs.

        ·   Revision of some PDO indicators and intermediate indicators and targets.

        ·   Reallocation of funds to reflect these changes.


                                              7
  Details for this are explained below.

  The technical scope of the project will be modified as
  follows:
  i.   Component 1 (Response of the Public Sector): Part (a) of this component
       supports the Ministry of Health to consolidate and expand health-related
       HIV/AIDS activities. The 2007 restructuring approved packaging health-
       HIV/AIDS activities under the Project with activities done by NGOs
       contracted under the two health projects financed by the Bank ­ the ongoing
       Health Sector Rehabilitation Support Project (HSRSP) and completed
       Emergency Multisectoral Rehabilitation Reconstruction Project (EMRRP) ­
       instead of delivering them through organizations contracted separately by the
       HIV/AIDS project. This was never implemented. However, due to uncertainty
       in the sustainability of ARV treatment in the potential new zones after closure
       of MAP, this option will be dropped. In Part (b) which supports other
       ministries for HIV/AIDS activities targeting their staff and clients, a total of
       16 Ministries were initially targeted. This number was expanded to 27, but
       will be reduced to fewer than 16 ministries. This will allow deepened support
       to Ministries that have developed acceptable work plans.
 ii.   Component 2 (Support to non-government sector): Instead of targeting a large
       number of non-governmental organizations, support will focus on a smaller
       number of umbrella groups (faitieres) representing specific types of NGOs
       (PLWHAs, commercial sex workers, etc.) and a few of the strongest NGOs
       whose capacity has been confirmed sufficient. This would allow better
       supervision and provision of capacity-building activities.

iii.   Component 3 (Support for Community Initiatives) will shift its focus from
       support to preparation and implementation of micro-projects by channeling
       resources directly to communities, to contracting outreach activities to a small
       number of national and international NGOs to allow larger scale interventions
       in order to enhance impact and simplify implementation.
iv.    Component 4 (Coordination and Communication) aims to strengthen
       institutional arrangements through separation of the current role of the head of
       PNMLS into a national coordination function and project implementation
       function.



  Institutional arrangement changes will include
  separating the PNMLS coordination and MAP
  implementation functions was approved in the 2007
  restructuring and was reiterated in the 2008 institutional
  audit but never materialized. The proposed restructuring
  will address this issue by putting in place a separate
                                          8
project coordinator for MAP implementation while
proceeding with the recruitment of the national
coordinator for PNMLS whose post is currently filled by
an interim. The PAD is not clear on the entire
composition of the PNMLS as it only indicates the need
to have a project coordinator, a deputy project
coordinator and a number of other posts but does not
touch upon specific functions of the project coordinator.

Financing will be modified as follows:
·   Financing Plan
    The new approach for increasing awareness and behavior change under the
    community component will result in enhanced outputs through provision of
    treatment and support services, capacity building and support to intermediate
    structures to improve supervision, evaluation, etc. Similarly, limiting the
    geographical scope to current areas of intervention will lead to narrowed, but
    more achievable service outputs in terms of ARV provision, VCT, lab
    equipment. Intermediate outcome indicators to measure the number of
    subprojects will no longer be relevant.

·   Disbursement arrangements

    Following adoption of the Biannual Plan 2009 -2010 and revision in the key
    performance indicators after the Mid-term Review in September 2009, the
    need for budget reallocation became evident. To facilitate disbursement as the
    project nears completion, a single expenditure category will be used for the
    uncommitted proceeds of the grant. All expenditure categories will remain
    100% financed by the grant. Proposed revised allocations by category is as
    below.

APPRAISAL SUMMARY
 The technical appraisal of the project remains valid as it continues to incorporate
 internationally-recognized best practices for HIV/AIDS control, while adapting to the
 Congolese context. While all stakeholders listed in the original PAD continue to be
 included in the program design , the restructured project will narrow the focus by: (i)
 limiting the number of ministries receiving support; (ii) concentrating the non-
 government organizations on umbrella groups (faitieres) representing NGOs and a few
 strong NGOs with proven capacity; and (iii) limiting the number of local communities
 receiving direct financial support and channeling more funds through a limited
 number of consulting firms/ international NGOs. These changes ensure more efficient
 usage of funds, better supervision and improved project performance.
