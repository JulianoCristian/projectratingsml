                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Government of DRC has a higher level objective of slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS in the general population. The project will support the Government by (i)
                         increasing the access to STI and HIV/AIDS treatment; (ii) mitigating the health and socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS at the individual, household, and
                         community level; and (iii) building strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Program Coordinator have finally been appointed by the Government, allowing for separation of responsibilities on strategic aspects and project management.
