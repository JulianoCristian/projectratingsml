Some lessons learned includes: lack of\n            realism and phasing in a project design and implementation\n            in a conflict or post-conflict country can undermine the\n            project ability to achieve its development objectives. This\n            project undertook to cover the entire country after a\n            conflict which left the country with weak institutional\n            systems. Identification of some hotspots along with\n            concentrating efforts in limited number of easily accessible\n            provinces may have increased the chance of the project to\n            achieve its development objectives. In a post-conflict\n            country, swift and frequent restructuring exercises may be\n            necessary in order to adapt the project design and\n            implementation as the situation changes and new data become\n            available. Strict adherence to global project frameworks can\n            undermine undertaking necessary adjustments to adapt a\n            project to the specific situation of a particular country.\n            Frameworks such as MAP, Avian Influenza, and food crisis\n            present the advantage that once the Board has approve the\n            framework, then it become easy to expedite project. In a\n            country with particularly weak capacity, it is imperative to\n            have a Task Team Leader (TTL) in the field at the onset of\n            the project and avoid frequent TTL changes. It takes at\n            least one full year for a TTL to better understand a project\n            in depth and therefore an additional couple of years at\n            least are needed to ensure continuity and smooth\n            implementation of the project. Similarly, in weak capacity\n            environments, the Bank needs to exercise intense fiduciary\n            oversight even when international firms have been hired to\n            provide fiduciary services. Donor driven projects from the\n            beginning to the end without proper incremental integration\n            into the Government budget processes poses a substantial\n            risk to the sustainability of development outcomes."}, "docdt": "2011-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
