A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

     1. Country and sector issues
The Democratic Republic o f Congo (DRC), with a population o f approximately 60 million and
an area of 2.4 million square kilometres, is the second largest and fourth most populous country
on the African continent. Decades o f Government mismanagement and the recent armed conflict
have undermined development and precipitated a collapse o f the country's economic, social, and
physical infrastructure. Annual per capita income has dropped to about US$87, and, in 2002,
about 80 percent o f the population i s estimated to live on less that US$0.20 persodday (Interim
PRSP). For the past three years, the Government has launched serious efforts to establish peace
among the various parties in conflict and to lay the groundwork for reunification. The country is
on the road to recovery. Economic growth has resumed, and, for the first time, GDP increased by
three percent in 2002. However, the country faces steep short- and medium-term socio-economic
challenges that demand massive support from the donor community.
The HIV/AIDS epidemic, a major challenge in itself, compounds the host o f other dilemmas
facing the DRC. The epidemic poses a great public health problem and is a threat to economic
recovery and development. Data compiled by the national HIV/AIDS program estimates that, as
o f 2003, about 3 million people live with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), associated with an average
prevalence rate among the adult population o f just over 5 percent, and provincial variations
ranging from 4.5 percent in Kinshasa to 7.5 percent in Lubumbashi. Unfortunately, more
credible estimates are unavailable in newly reunified provinces wrecked by the war. Isolated
studies indicate that infection rates could top 20 percent for certain groups. In light o f these
trends, the country could be on the verge o f human disaster if immediate concerted action is not
taken. The situation is compounded by the extreme poverty and weak or inexistent social
services currently characterizing DRC society.
The Government's response: Since 1983, the Government o f DRC has been aware o f the
potential security threat o f the epidemic. The National AIDS Control Commission (Comite`
national de lutte contre le SIDA, CNLS) was created, and, in 1987, developed a short-term plan
to assess the scope o f the problem. Unfortunately, political and civil unrest prevented a sustained
implementation o f efforts.
As part o f its efforts to address the growing threat posed by the epidemic, in 1999, the
Government approved a National HIVIAIDSISTD Strategic Plan, ("Plan StratCgique National de
Lutte contre le VIH/SIDA/MST"). Its objective is to contribute to the country's reconstruction
and development by slowing the spread o f HIV/AIDS and mitigating its impact on families,
communities and productive sectors. The draft Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-
PRSP) approved in mid-2002 has confirmed the high priority being given to the fight against
HIV/AIDS by the DRC Government.

     2. Rationalefor Bankinvolvement
Over the past several years, the Bank has played a crucial role in the global fight against
HV/AIDS, especially in Africa, by providing considerable financial and technical resources to
support the Government's efforts to control the spread and mitigate the impacts o f this epidemic.
Inthe process, the Bank has broadened its collaboration with other developmentpartners (WHO,
UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNFPA, NGOs, Global Funds) and has gained a comparative advantage.


                                                                                               1

This rests upon its capacity to mobilize expertise from all sectors in the design and
implementation o f HIV/AIDS programs and the ability to quickly scale-up successful initiatives.
The Bank is very experienced in community development, and recognizes, along with other
development agencies, that local empowerment is a key dimension o f any successful strategy.
In short, the Bank is in a unique position to deploy financial resources needed to support the
Government's strategy. Inaddition, its ability to involve other donors in financing multi-sectoral
development programs could prove to be critical in promoting and ensuring a coherent,
sustained, and nation-wide response to the challenges o f this epidemic.

     3. Higher-level objectives to which the project contributes
The proposed project will support the Government o f DRC inimplementingits national strategic
plan and will provide the necessary resources and technical skills to scale-up and improve
delivery mechanisms for HIV/AIDS control activities. The project will help establish a national
institutional framework, outside the Ministry o f Health (MoH), for the coordination and
implementation o f HIV/AIDS initiatives. This framework will be truly multi-sectoral and
attached to the Presidency.
This project is consistent with the objectives o f the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS)
approved by the Bank in 2001. The TSS supports the Government's goal to: (i)            consolidate
peace, (ii)stabilize the macroeconomic and fiscal framework, (iii)     improve governance, and; (iv)
rebuild social services and meet basic needs. The proposed program will consolidate and expand
HIV/AIDS control activities begun under the Emergency Early Recovery Credit (IDA Grant
H0005-DRC) and contribute to the general effort o f reducing poverty through mitigating the
adverse economic and social impacts o fthis epidemic.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

     1. Lendinginstrument
Given that the DRC is eligible for IDA financing and meets the four criteria for MAP funding
(see Annex l), is proposed that the six-year National Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS Project be
                 it
financed through an IDA grant, as part o f the second "tranche" o f the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS
Program (MAP) approved in2003.

     2.  Project development objective and key indicators
The development objective o f the MAP/PMLS is to mitigate the negative impact of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic on the stabilization, recovery, and development of the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC).This will be achieved by:
    (i)Reducingthe risk o f sexual, intravenous andvertical transmission o fHIV;
    (ii)Improving the health status and quality o f life o fpeople livingwith HIV/AIDS; and
    (iii)Mitigatingthe socio-economic impact o f the epidemic on vulnerable groups.
The MAP/PMLS is designed as a multi-sectoral operation that will mobilize a wide range o f
actors invarious spheres o f DRC society. It will provide technical capacity and financing for the
preparation and implementation o f project proposals by public sector entities, private and public
enterprises, non-governmental and faith-based organizations, people living with HIV/AIDS, and
community-based organizations. Project proposals will cover activities inthe area o f prevention,
care andtreatment, and mitigation o f impact.

     3. Project components
Total project costs amount to US$102.6 million (US$2.1 million non-allocated). A detailed
description o f the project is attached in Annex 4. The MAPPMLS is organized horizontally
along four components and structured vertically along three target areas (national, provincial,
and local). Within this framework, a variety o f actors will present project proposals for approval
andfinancing.
Horizontal organization: The four components are:

            0    Component 1:The response o f the public sector;
            0    Component 2: The response o fthe non-govemmental sector;
            0    Component 3: Support to community initiatives; and
            0    Component 4: Coordination & Communication, monitoring and evaluation, and
                                capacity building.
Each component focuses on a category o f actors, whom, depending on their comparative
advantage and capacity, will implement activities in the key domains o f prevention, care and
treatment, and mitigation o f impact. Detailed implementation arrangements are described in the
manuals.
Vertical organization: At all levels throughout the country, various actors will prepare and
present project proposals for approval and financing under one o f the three unit windows (ie.,
national, provincial, and local level). The required level of presentation for project proposals will
depend on the scope, cost, and coverage o f the proposed activity and the capacity o f the actor.
Details on thresholds, eligibility/approval criteria, and other mechanisms and rules goveming the
functioning o f the windows have been elaborated in the manuals. The National Coordination
Unit(NCU) or Provincial CoordinationUnit (PCU) ofthe Project will contract serviceproviders
to help proponents, at all levels, to ensure equal access to the program.
Component1:Response of thepublic sector - US$40.4million




                                                                                                         3

Under this component, the project will assist and support the mobilization o f public institutions
inthe fight against this epidemic by mainstreaming HIV/AIDS activities intheir regular work
program. Activities by public sector institutions on behalf o f their staff and families, as well as
their "clients" will be financed on a competitive basis. The Work Plans will identify anticipated
results and indicators, allowing the N C U to monitor implementation. In the event o f
unsatisfactory performance, the N C U and the ministry concerned will agree on appropriate
measures. The component is structured into two sub-components as follows:

         (a)       Program of the Ministry of Health (US$21.1 million): The Ministry o f Health
will consolidate and expand activities in the areas o f blood transfusion safety, screening and
treatment o f STDs and opportunistic infections, voluntary testing and counseling (VTC), and
condom promotion and distribution. It will play a key role inproviding access to anti-retroviral
(ARV) drugs and preventing mother-to-infant transmissions. The Ministry defines norms and
standards for the sector and will, therefore, supervise the quality o f medical services delivered by
all actors. Finally, the Ministry will be responsible for support activities, such as epidemiological
surveillance and research.

         (b)      Program of the other ministries (US$19.3 million): The Project will provide
technical support and finance Work Plans proposed by other ministries and public sector
institutions to target their internal (staff) and extemal (beneficiaries) clients.

Component 2: Response of the non-governmental sector - US$l7.9 million
         a)       Private sector entities/Public enterprises (US$7.3M):                    Through this sub-
component, the project will support HIV/AIDS activities proposed by the HIVIAIDS Inter-
Enterprise Committee (CIELS)` . CIELS is an umbrella organization for private sector entities
and public enterprises and will serve as an interface and coordinate the preparation and
submission o f proposals by member enterprises at the national, provincial, and local levels. In
addition, the project will contribute funding for studies o f the epidemic's impact on enterprises
and economic growth; follow up on needed revisions to the existing Labor Code; develop a
private sector strategy for promoting and distributingcondoms; and strengthen the supply chains
for medical inputs.
         b)       NGOs,faith-based organizations, professional associations (US$lO.6M): Under
this sub-component, non-govemmental and faith-based organizations will be mobilized and
supported to help implement the national strategic plan supported by this project. Apex
organizations, including the NGO Forum (FOSI) and the Inter-faith HIV/AIDS committee will
propose work plans, and member organizations will prepare sub-projects and micro-projects to
be presented for financing at the provincial and local levels.
Component 3: Supportfor communi@initiatives - US$l9.3 million
A `community' will be understood as any human group mobilized around a common interest. A
community may be a village, a neighborhood, a school or any local association. The
component's objective is to increase the impact o f HIV/AIDS activities by transfemng the
responsibility for identifying priorities, and preparing and implementing micro-projects directly
to the beneficiaries in rural and urban areas. Experience shows that community empowerment
improves priority resource allocation and use. This approach has the best chance to succeed in
'The  choice o f CIELS for year 1does not preclude that the project will work with other committees insubsequent
years.


                                                                                                            4

changing behavior, improving impact, and developing local mitigation responses. Resources will
be transferred directly to communities based on simplified financing agreements. The NCU/PCU
will contract operators to assist communities throughout the process.

(US$8M),capacity building (US$3.2M)- Total: US$22.5million
Component 4: Coordination & Communication (US$II.3M), monitoring and evaluation


       a)        Coordination and Communication: The National Coordination Unit (NCU) will
be responsible for coordinating the overall implementation o f the program. The N C U will be
decentralized at the provincial (Provincial Coordination Units) and local (Local Coordination
Units) levels. These offices will have comparable responsibilities at their level, including the
review and approval o f sub-projects and micro-projects, and decentralized planning,
programming, and supervision. The project will develop a communications strategy targeting
various audiences at all levels. This component also includes the cost o f setting-up an efficient -
probably by satellite - communication network among the various coordination units.
       b)       Monitoring and evaluation: Through this component, the project will finance
monitoring and evaluation activities as well as impact and surveillance studies, which will be
outsourced.

buildingc)activities and studies that complement those included inWork Plans, sub-projects, and
                Capacity-building/Technical Studies: The NCUwill finance transversal capacity-

micro-projects (up to 10% o f the proposal's cost). These transversal capacity-building activities
aim to enhance the capacity of actors to prepare, submit, and implement Work Plans, sub-
projects and micro-projects. Again, services will be mostly contracted.

    4. Lessonslearned and reflected in the project design
       Implementation o f the MAP has been most successful in countries where the national
       HIV/AIDS control agency has had a coordinating rather than an implementation role.

   0   Contracting o f fiduciary management functions helps to ensure quick and transparent
       disbursements. The MAP/PMLS will entrust fiduciary management to a professional
       firm.
       Leadership and commitment from political authorities can help to guarantee the success
       o f the process. The Government has created the CNMLS to steer the national program,
       which will operate under the auspices o f the Office ofthe President.
       The optimal role o f ministries is to make policy, establish norms and standards, and
       ensure quality control; thus, they should not directly execute activities contained in the
       Work Plans but rather contract qualified service providers.
    5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
Two other options were contemplated for the DRC project:
   (i)Scale-up the HIV/AIDS control activities carried out under the Emergency Early
       Recovery Project (IDA Grant H-00005-DRC). This was rejected because o f the multi-
       dimensional nature of the HIV/AIDSepidemic. It is necessary to expand the fight beyond
       the health sector. Experience has shown that ascribing implementation responsibility
       solely to a single sector ministry or agency (the health ministry in this case) in a multi-
       sector operation does not promote lasting partnerships,           ownership, and timely
       implementation; and,


                                                                                               5

    (ii) HIV/AIDScontrolinterventionsintheongoingIDA-financedEmergencyMulti-
        Include
        sectoral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project (EMRRP). The community component
        o f the EMMRP allows transfer o f funds to communities under flexible and rapid
        procedures. However, this was rejected as the EMRRP already receives multiple
        financing requests and does not support a multi-sector approach, unlike the National
        HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

     1. Partnershiparrangements
The PMLS/MAP has been prepared in partnership with other donors and international agencies
currently operating in the DRC. The United Nations AIDS (UNAIDS) team in the country is
ensuring that the World Bank-financed project would be complementary and not a substitute to
activities undertaken by other donor organizations inthe DRC.
The project supports the establishment o f a national framework (see Section 2 below on
Institutional arrangements), headed by the CNMLS, for coordinating partners' activities and
resources in support o f the implementation o f the HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan. This
common institutional framework is described in a Presidential Decree that was presented to all
partners before discussion within the Council o f Ministers and the endorsement o f the President.
Once operational, this framework is expected to harmonize programs, procedures and
implementation strategies among partners. Ideally, the CNMLS would become the Steering
Committee for all projects. It will review and approve all programs and budgets and, thereby,
ensure coherence and integration o f activities, The country would be, then, in a position to
present a unified activity program, although financing would come from multiple donors.
Progressively, norms and standards will be developed and harmonized as well.
With respect to the Global Fund and the GLIA, specific steps have been already taken. The
project will involve the Global Fund CCM (the Technical Secretariat) in the preparation o f its
annual activity program. In addition, the C C M i s represented inthe CNMLS who will review all
programs. With respect to the GLIA, the DRC has been an active and fully supportive partner in
its preparation. The GLIA Secretariat will work in each country through Country Focal Points. In
the case o f the DRC, the Country Focal Point i s the Director o f the current Ministry o f Health's
National HIV/AIDS Program (PNLS).
The monitoring system proposed will ensure that all partners are involved in evaluating in-
country HIV/AIDS activities. Joint supervision missions will be conducted in order to enhance
partnership and exchange.

     2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements
(See Annex 6 and 7, particularly the diagrams). The project will operate under the authority o f
the National Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS Committee (CNMLS), which will be responsible for the
Bank-and alldonor-financedHIV/AIDS activities inthe DRC.
The Presidency will head the National Multi-sectoral AIDS Commission (Comite` National
Multisectoriel de Lutte contre le VIH/SIDAA,CNMLS) and the Minister o f Health will serve as
Vice-president. The committee includes high-level representatives from all line ministries, the
private sector, civil society organizations, religious organizations and professional associations.



                                                                                              6

It will play the role o f a Steering Committee, and lead policy formulation, define priorities, and
approve annual work programs, budgets and public information releases. The CNMLS will be
represented by decentralized units presided by the Governor at the provincial level and by the
Territory Administrator at the local level.
TheNational Coordination Unit: The National Coordination Unit (NCU) will be responsible for
the technical, fiduciary and administrative management o f the HIV/AIDS control activities and
for implementing the work program approved by the CNMLS. In addition, it will monitor the
technical and fiduciary performance o f the executing entities (ministries, NGOs, private sector
entities, etc.). The N C U will be decentralized at the provincial and local levels2 with similar
responsibilities. Provincial Coordination Units (PCU) and Local Coordination Units (LCU) will
be established in targeted provinces and territories. Implementation will yield lessons as to the
ideal level for the establishment o f LCUs.
The N C U and its decentralized units will be staffed with professionals recruited on a competitive
basis, including: a Coordinator, a Deputy Coordinator; a Monitoring & Evaluation Specialist and
various specialists. Decentralized offices will be modeled after the N C U but will have a reduced
staff, consistent with the volume o f transactions to be conducted at that level. Each level will
have a Fiduciary Department that will be established and staffed by a highly qualified Fiduciary
Management Agency (FMA) recruited for that purpose.
Disbursements and Flow of Funds To facilitate project implementation andreduce the volume
                                          -
o f withdrawal applications, the National Coordination Unit will open three Special Accounts in
U S dollars in a commercial bank in Kinshasa, on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The
Special Accounts will be managed by the NCU, through its Fiduciary Department, for purposes
o f disbursements, financial management andprocurement.
    Special Account A will finance HIV/AIDS prevention activities, training and sensitivity
    campaigns, the operating costs, and contractual salaries o f the NCU. It will also finance
    large equipment and consultant contracts at the national level as well as the Work Plans
    signed yearly between line Ministries and Apex organizations and the National Coordination
    Unit.
    Special Account B will be utilized for transfers to Second Generation Accounts to be opened
    inthe provinces where a reliable bankingnetwork exists. They will finance sub-projects and
    micro-projects at the periphery o f the provincial capital, as well as the operating costs and
    contractual salaries ofthe provincial coordination units.
    Special Account C will be used to transfer funds to the provinces where no banking facilities
    are available. This account will also be used to transfer funds beyond the periphery o f
    provincial capitals. Inthis case, a civil society organization is expected to channel funds for
    sub-projects and micro-projects approved at the provincial, district and territory level based
    on a services contract. This intermediary will receive a fee to be prorated on the disbursement
    amounts to beneficiaries for eligible sub-projects.
To ensure prompt and efficient disbursements, procedures to channel funds between central and
provincial level will be streamlined. A computerized satellite system linking the provincial
coordination units to the National Coordination Unit in Kinshasa will be put in place to help


 Invery largeprovinces, a District Office mightbe established.


                                                                                              7

track sub-project and micro-project approvals and payments. Sample standard sub-project
documents and financing agreements will be distributed in advance to all potential beneficiaries
in the provinces in order to facilitate the submission of sub-project requests. Approval and
payment mechanisms will be simplified in accordance with the IDA Guidelines for Community-
BasedDevelopment.

     3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results
The M&E system (see Annex 3) will be structured into three sub-components to ensure
monitoring and evaluation o f (i)project activity implementation, including fiduciary
transactions; (ii)project impact; and, (iii)the evolution and impact o f the epidemic.
Responsibility for coordination o f sub-components and activities will rest on a Senior
Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist recruited by the N C U and decentralized project staff
(provincial and local levels) that will be identified and trained in data collection and analysis.
The Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist will also be in charge o f consolidating results
and information for the benefit o f project management and for ensuring communication o f key
information to all interested parties.
(i) M&E of project implementation. The purpose o f this sub-component is to enable actors at
each level, including communities, to monitor their activities and provide consolidated data to
the N C U for programmatic uses. The project Fiduciary Department will be responsible for data
collection at each level o f intervention. At the community level, they will be aided by field
operators recruited to assist communities in developing local responses to HIV/AIDS. Routine
data collection will be carried out on a monthly basis and used at each level, including
communities, to assess implementation progress. Every three months, each level will consolidate
and transmit data to the NCU.
The Fiduciary Department will assess the complete overall process of data collection and
analysis processing, linking, in particular, executed activities and disbursements. The data will
then be presented to the national Senior M&E Specialist who will do the final analysis, assess
progress and identify areas where corrective measures have to be taken. The N C U will produce
bi-yearly reports to address strategic and conceptual questions and make operational decisions.
At all levels, feedback is essential. The M&E manual describes the various arrangements and
responsibilities. Specific provisions are made for community M&E that will enable beneficiaries
to self-assess their implementation o f activities and the results.
(ii) M&E ofproject impact. This is a complex task that requires establishing a baseline and using
more sophisticated quantitative and qualitative instruments. The N C U will outsource this task to
a specialized and experienced entity, but will retain oversight and steering responsibilities.
Discussions are ongoing with the National Public Health School for that matter.
(iii) Monitoring of the evolution and impact of the epidemic. Biological and behavioral
surveillance o f STI/HIV/AIDS/TB is a national responsibility that has been supported by various
partners. The project will support the DRC's implementation o f surveys combining biomedical
and behavioral surveillance, targeting vulnerable population groups. These surveys will be
scheduled every 2-3 years andwill follow the standard WHO/"AIDS          format. Every five years,
the Project will contribute to a nationwide demographic and health survey (DHS) in association
with other donors. Social-impact evaluation will be filly integrated inmonitoring the epidemic
andwill be conducted on a regularbasis.



                                                                                             8

       4. Sustainability
  For the time being, the financial viability o f the fight against the epidemic largely depends on
  continued support from multilateral and bilateral donors. All donors are increasingly aware o f the
  impact o f the epidemic and many are increasing their financing for that sector (see Annex 2).
  The Government has also committed to allocate budgetary resources, although the amount and
  conditions remain unknown. The Government i s using the project to establish a national
  multisectoral institutional framework that will enhance donodpartner coordination o f activities
  and resources.
  Taking into account the emergency nature o f the problem and the extreme poverty o f the
  Congolese population, the project will nonetheless encourage the development o f a cost recovery
  culture by providing targeted groups with productive activities, and asking modest contributions
  intime, labor, and materials. Community empowerment is expected to foster a proactive, take
  charge attitude, which enables the population to devise creative and efficient solutions to their
  own problems. The project will also strive to develop equitable, low cost solutions andwill serve
  as a catalyst for mobilizing human and financial resources from capable entities and better-
  endowed segments o f society.
  Finally, the project will enhance institutional viability by investing in capacity building for
  public, private, and other beneficiaries. In-depth training will be dispensed in particular to
  providers o f AIDS-related medical, educational, and social services. Ownership and commitment
  are also conditions o f institutional sustainability. Already, support for the project is demonstrated
  by the firm leadership o f the central Government and the broad participation in project
  preparation by faith-based organizations, NGOs, community organizations, and PLWHA.

       5. Criticalrisks and possible controversial aspects
  The preparation o f the project identified two major risks: (i)    Policy/steering bodies and political
  pressures interfere with the technical work o f the NCU; and, (ii)        resource mobilization may be
  insufficient to support a full national strategy and trigger a significant impact. Indeed, the cost o f
  scaling-up a medium HIVIAIDS activity package at the national level is estimated to US$130
  milliordyear. Combined resources from all donors may reach US$270 million over a period o f
  five years, or about US$54 milliordyear.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

      1. Economic and financial analyses
(Detailed analysis, Annex 9). The H N / A I D S epidemic i s a serious public health problem and
threatens economic recovery and development. HIV/AIDS affects the economy inmany ways; it
disrupts the human capital accumulation process and affects both the size and quality o f the labor
force. Premature deaths not only engenderlosses ina keyproduction factor, but also losses o f the
knowledge and experience embedded in it. Higher morbidity reduces labor productivity through
absenteeism, highlabor turnover, and higher health insurance expenditures.
Finally, as the economy's active human capital erodes, a population o f orphans without adequate
means for their education and survival i s left behind. This may generate costly social problems
and these people might never develop their full potential.
Delaying intervention would be very costly to DRC's economy and society. As o f 2003, it i s
estimated that about 3,000,000 persons live with HJY/AIDS (PLWHA) and that the prevalence
rate in the adult population was about 5 %3.            A firm-level survey conducted in 48 Congolese
enterprises revealedproductivity losses due to absenteeism; HIV-infected workers can remain in
a state o f illness for about 1 to 6 months. Furthermore, the survey reveals that firms that do not
provide medical assistance have seen about 70% o f their infected workers die during the last 5
years. In general 5% represents a critical "inflection" point where the epidemic starts growing
exponentially, in some cases as much as 50% a year. In parallel, the cost o f intervention rises
rapidly in absolute and relative terms. Studies4 have shown that when the adult HJY prevalence
rate is less than 5%, the annual cost o f prevention, care, and treatment i s about 1.3 percent o f
GDP. It reaches 4.5% o f GDP when prevalence is 15%, and 10% o f GDP for a 30% prevalence
rate. The current reunification process that increases socio-economic exchanges between
provinces makes immediate intervention even more urgent.
Were intervention delayed, the D R C could expect at least 900,000 new infections as soon as next
year. PLWHA would die almost in the same proportion. Over four years, the MAP could abate
the number o f new infections from about 922,000 (expected without the project) to 162,000 in
2008. The cost-benefit analysis shows that the project could mitigate the impact o f the epidemic
for about 3,500,000 cases. Indollars terms, the project contributions would amount to more than
US$ 1 billion o f benefits through averting productivity losses and social spending. DRC could
save about 3 percent o f its GDP yearly, and, by 2030, some 5 percent annually.

     2. Fiduciary
Bearing inmind the country's post-conflict situation, the project design takes into consideration
ways to facilitate disbursements and ensure effective use o f resources and recommends
outsourcing of thefiduciary management function, setting up a satellite computerized network
system between the National Coordination Unit in Kinshasa and the 11 Provinces to monitor
sub/micro-project information, standardize/simplcj) the documentation for subhicro-projects
including performance contracts (for the private sector and NGOs) and financing agreements (for

communities), and using a technical certificate ofprogress to justify payments under sub/micro
projects. If all recommendations are implemented Risk Rating would drop from Substantial to
Moderate.
A Fiduciary Management Agency (FMA) will establish and staff a Fiduciary Department,
operational at all levels, in charge o f procurement and financial functions. This highly qualified
professional firm is being selected on a competitive, international basis. Under the authority o f
the Coordinator, the Fiduciary Department will manage the financial, accounting and
procurement process. A detailed description o f financial, disbursement, and procurement
management arrangements i s presented inAnnex 7 and 8.
The FMA will supplythe core fiduciary staff o f the NCU. The procurement staff provided by the
FMA will include a Senior Procurement Specialist and an Assistant at the central level. It will
also include a Procurement Specialist in every province. These specialists should be familiar
with World Bank's procurement procedures as reflected in the terms o f reference approved by
the Bank. The central Senior Procurement Specialist will: (i)     monitor all procurement activities
of the Project at all levels, (ii)supervise the regional procurement agents and, (iii)build
capacities o fbeneficiaries having insufficient procurement skills.
An Ad hoc Procurement Commission will be set-up for a renewable period o f one year and will
include representatives o f key ministries and key non-governmental institutions involved in the
project. This Commission will open and assess bids for major procurement o f works and goods.
The N C U will award contracts on the basis o f the Commission's recommendations. Similar
arrangements will be made at the provincial level.
For an initial period o f one to two years, line ministries will manage neither their resources (with
the exception o f small operating expenditures) nor their procurement. Duringthis time, they will
strengthen their capacity and following a positive financial and procurement capacity
assessment, might, thereafter, be entrusted with fiduciary responsibilities. Complex sets o f
integrated activities, such as ensuring the security o f blood transfixion, comprising the provision
o f goods and services, will be contracted, on a competitive basis, to specialized firms (or NGOs).
The selected firms will submit to a fiduciary capacity assessment before final approval o f their
selection. Contracts will be signed and monitored byboththe N C U and the concerned ministry.
The N C U will be able to sign contracts with apex organizations (NGOs, associations,
enterprises) for the implementation o f their annual work plan. The contract will specify tranches,
modalities o fpayment, andresults to be achieved.
NGOs, CBOs, enterprises, and professional associations that will submit sub/micro-projects on a
demand-driven basis will also enter into contractual agreements with the project. Specific
fiduciary procedures manuals, in accordance with World Bank guidelines are beingdeveloped to
assist them in implementing sub/micro-project activities. For procurement o f goods in excess o f
$50,000, these entities will have to submit to a fiduciary assessment to demonstrate capacity. In
cases o f weak performance, the project will procure the goods on their behalf.
The project will be able to enter into contractual agreements with United Nations Agencies for
the purpose o f scaling-up and implementing their HIV/AIDS activities. These Agencies will
receive funds from the project on the basis of detailed annual budgets and fit with program
objectives, and strong M&E frameworks and systems.

     3. Technical
Overall, the project incorporates intemationally-recognized best practices for HIV/AIDS control,
as defined under the MAP, and adheres to guidelines set out by UNAIDS for this type o f activity
indeveloping countries. Internationalpractices have beenadapted to the Congolese context, and
the program is designed to incorporate best-case practices proven to be useful inthe fight against
HIV/AIDS. As a result, all stakeholders identifiable inthe country (line ministries, private sector
entities, civil-society organization, faith-based organization, associations o f people living with
AIDS, and local communities) were all included inthe program design and will play a key role
in its implementation. Likewise, target groups have been identified based on the National
Strategic Plan against HIV/AIDS presented by the Government o f the DRC. Finally, the
preparation, approval, and implementation o f Work Plans will follow procedures acceptable to
the Government and will ensure that resources are used efficiently and that continuous financing
is dependent on the achievement o fmeasurable results.

     4. Social
The project preparation was fully participatory. Key stakeholders, in all sectors and at all levels,
have been highly involved in designing the project and in discussing objectives, results, and
outcomes. This has resulted in strong national ownership. The speed and quality o f preparation
are the clearest benefits o f this ownership. Participation was orchestrated through various
strategies, including: (i)a preparation unit staffed with representatives from the public, private
and NGO/Faith-based organizations sectors; (ii)regular multisectoral field visits; and (iii)
thematic workshops regrouping all categories o f actors, including customary chiefs and
PLWHAs.The national preparation team has also worked in a systematic fashion with umbrella
organizations regrouping NGOs (FOSI), religious groups (Interfaith HIV/AIDS Committee),
associations o f people living with HIV/AIDS (RCP+), and enterprises (CIELS). Finally,
Government leadership as well as the commitment and quality o f the national staff assigned to
the preparationhave contributed to creating a positive andparticipatory work environment.
A social assessment survey conducted on perception, knowledge and behavior in relation to
HIV/AIDS yielded important data that has informed the project design and strategies. The war
that has plagued and divided the country has created or exacerbated specific problems such as a
growing number o f refugees and orphans, increased rape cases, invasion o f soldiers from
countries with a high prevalence rate, and the destruction o f social infrastructure. As a result,
poverty has deepened, family and social structures have collapsed, and the population's
vulnerability to HIV/AIDS has increased. In the four provinces surveyed, focus groups have
ranked women, orphans, and young girls as the most vulnerable to the epidemic, mostly because
their isolation and weak economic power; consequently, they are more likely to engage inrisky
behaviors such as prostitution, which exposes them to abuse and bars them from accessing
adequate information and treatment. Other determinants o f the epidemic include cultural and
religious beliefs that may cloud the debate on HIV/AIDS and increase discrimination against
PWLHA. The study also examined options for enhancing behavioral change; in particular,
customary chiefs yield considerable influence and they should be part o f any social mobilization
efforts. For similar reasons, traditional healers should be trained to offer proper advice to the
population.

         5.1       How will the environmental benefits be monitored?
As with other Bank-supported MAP projects, the DRC MAP/PMLS is not expected to have
negative environmental impacts. The greatest potential environmental risk relates to the handling
and disposal o f medical waste, in particular, HIV-infected wastes. Currently, no national
environmental and social policies or regulations directly address safe handling, storage and
disposal o f waste ingeneral, much less for medical waste.
Therefore, in accordance with World Bank guidelines, a Medical Waste Management Plan
(MWMP) has been elaborated during preparation, in close collaboration with the Ministry of
Health, national institutions and agencies involved in monitoring environmental protection,
representatives o f civil society and grassroots communities. The study suggestedthat treatment
o f medical waste inthe DRC is very poor. Medicalwaste is inappropriately mixed with domestic
waste. In addition, the study suggested that knowledge on behavior, practices and funding for
medical waste management is extremely inefficient and inappropriate. In Kinshasa, as in other
major cities, this is exacerbated by the lack o f designated sites for waste disposal in general,
much less medical waste. The main provisions o f the MWMP (see details in Annex 10) call for
an increase inawareness campaigns, improvement o f training to benefit medical and paramedical
staff; additional equipment and adapted technologies for the handling and collection o f medical
waste inhospitals and healthcenters. These provisions have been incorporated into the final draft
o f the project's PIM, and will serve as guidelines inthe design and implementation o f HIV/AIDS
control activities.

           1. Countrysituation
The Democratic Republic o f Congo (DRC), with a population of approximately 60 million and
an area of 2.3 million square kilometers, is the fourth most populous country in Afkica. The
population growth rate is estimated at 3.1 percent per year. Although the country is highly
urbanized (the capital, Kinshasa, has over 8 million inhabitants), about 70 percent o f the
population lives in rural areas. Despite its potential wealth and exceptional agricultural, energy
and mineral resources, decades o f mismanagement and the recent armed conflict have devastated
the country's economic, physical, and social infrastructure. Per capita income has dropped to
about US$87 and, in 2002, about 80 percent o f the population is estimated to live on less that
US$0.20 persodday (Interim PRSP). As a consequence o f this dire situation, about 16 million
people are indanger o f starvation or are malnourished.
For the past two years, and with support from the international community, the Government o f
the DRC has launched serious efforts to establish peace among various parties inconflict and lay
the groundwork for reunification, reconstruction and the resumption o f economic development.
The results o f these initiatives are encouraging and the country appears to be on the road to
recovery. Economic growth has resumed and in2002 was positive (+ 3%) for the first time since
the outbreak o f conflict. A consensual transition Government, composed o f representatives o f the
various stakeholders, has been put inplace. The consolidation o f peace and political stability i s
possible only if massive support is provided at the same time to meet the many short- and
medium-term needs and challenges. Massive support from the donor community i s necessary to
overcome these obstacles.
           2. Main issues
The repercussions o f the crisis inthe social sectors are severe. The environment i s characterized
by a virtual absence o f investment, and by enormous difficulties in obtaining a balanced diet,
basic health care, education, clean water and decent housing. All o f these factors constitute an
extremely fertile breeding ground for epidemic diseases such as HIV/AIDS and for the spread o f
opportunistic infections.
Inmid-2002, the DRC finalized a draft Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the overall
long-term objective o f which i s to improve the living standards o f the Congolese people and to
pave the road towards stabilization, recovery, and development. Specific objectives include:
       The satisfaction o f urgent basic needs, particularly the provision o f social services and
       HIV/AIDS control;
   0   The demobilization and reintegration o f combatants;
   0   The rehabilitation o f institutions and development o f effective public policies, with the
       goal o f promoting transparency, accountability andparticipation;
       Revitalization o f economic activity, so as to satisfy the immediate needs o f the private
       sector and support the participatory development initiatives o f communities; and

The Bank has re-engaged in DRC through a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), which was
discussed in July 2001. Prior to, and since then, the Bank has provided substantial analytical
support and assistance to enhance administrative capacity as well as to help design and
implement economic reforms. Financial support was first approved in July 2001, with Board
approval o f a US$50 million Emergency Early Recovery Project (EERP), funded through an
IDA grant. Subsequently, following the clearance o f DRC arrears in June 2002, the Board
approved a US$450 million ERC in June 2002, a US$454 million Emergency Multi-sector
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (EMRRP) in August 2002, and a US$120 Private
Sector Development and Competitiveness Project in July 2003. The Bank i s also managing a
multi-donor Trust Fund, which finances the Emergency Stabilization and Recovery Project
(ESRP), with contributions from the Governments o f Belgium and Canada as well as from the
European Commission.         The Bank is currently working on the preparation o f additional
activities, both lending products and non-lending services, including this HIV/AIDS operation.
             3. Status of HIV/AIDS
A major challenge in itself, the HIV/AIDS epidemic compounds the host o f other problems
facing the DRC. As o f September 2003, data compiled by the national HIV/AIDS program
estimated that there were 2,250,000 persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and that the
national rate o f HIV prevalence in the adult population was 5.07 %, with provincial variations
ranging from 4.5 % inKinshasato 7.5% inKatanga.
Analysis o f data available from case reporting indicates that:
             the age groups most affected in general are those aged 20 to 49 years, with women
             aged 20 to 29 years and menaged 30 to 39 years being most affected.

         0   Taking into account the clinical incubation period o f HIV, it appears that women are
             acquiring the infection between the ages o f 15 and 19, while men are becoming
             infected between the ages o f 20 and 29; hence the importance o f prevention measures
             targeting young people and adolescents.

         0   Sexual transmission remains the most commonly observed mode o f contamination
             (accounting for 87 percent o f cases), although measures to ensure the safety o f
             mother-to-infant transmission (8 percent o f cases) are starting to gain ground. In
             addition, another 5 percent o f cases result from intravenous contamination, a mode o f
             infection that can be averted through blood supply andthe use o f sterile equipment.

         0   Among high-risk groups, infection rates are as high as 33 percent among hospitalized
             tuberculosis patients and 19 percent among prostitutes.

         0   Around 750,000 children under the age o f 15 have lost one or both parents to an
             AIDS-related illness.
Against all expectations, since 1997, prevalence rates have increased only slightly inthe western
part o f the country, while IST infection rates have risen steadily; at the same time, behavior does
not seem to have changed significantly.. As the quality o f the surveys has been reviewed and
deemed satisfactory, targeted research must be undertaken to understand this phenomenon. In
any case, the current prevalence rate, while relatively low compared to regional averages,
warrants immediate action to efficiently contain the spread o f the epidemic. Indeed, beyond 5
percent, the infection rates will start to grow exponentially andthe cost o f controlling HIV/AIDS
will increase accordingly.



                                                                                               2

Due to the lack o f systematic data, the national rate o f 5.07 percent does not take into account the
situation in the eastem regions. Although partial, information reaching the National HIV/AIDS
Program indicates that the war has heavily contributed to increased trends in HIV infection.
Indeed, the destruction o f social services and health infrastructures, combined with massive
displacement o f populations, military occupation from countries with high prevalence rates, and
the resurgence o f sexual violence, are all elements contributing to HIV transmission. For
example, studies indicate a doubling o f the infection rate among pregnant women inLubumbashi
(from 4.8 to 8.6 percent) and show that, inKalemie (eastern region), HIV prevalence mightbe as
high as 20 percent (Save the Children-UK, December 2001). If confirmed by data from the
sentinel sites, the reunifiedcountry would face an even sterner challenge thanpresupposed.
            4. The Government'sstrategy
Alarmed by the persistent andrapid increase inthe number o frecorded cases following diagnosis
o f the first cases in 1983, , the Government o f DRC decided in 1984 to work with the
international community to better gauge the dimensions o f this problem. The National AIDS
Control Commission (Comite' national de lutte contre le SIDA, CNLS) was created, and in 1987,
the CNLS developed a short-term plan to assess the scope o fthe problem.
Until 1994, the Medium-Term Plan 1991-1994 served as a viable framework for HIV/AIDS
control in DRC. However, its implementation was disrupted by political and civil events that
resulted in the withdrawal o f financing from the donor community. In 1995, the WHOAJNDP-
financed preparatory assistance project re-started the implementation o f HIV/AIDS control
activities and provided the opportunity to the Government o f DRC to develop a new vision for
the fight against HIV/AIDS.
More recently, the Government o f the D R C has adopted a national strategic plan with the
objective to slow down the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and mitigate its impact onfamilies,
communities andproductive sectors. This strategy i s based upon:
    (i)The     promotion at the highest level o f Government o f a multi-sectoral approach to the
         fight against HIV/AIDS and creation o f partnerships among all actors and sectors
         involved inHIV/AIDS control activities;
    (ii)TheencouragementofacentralroleforpeoplelivingwithHIV/AIDS; and
    (iii)The mobilization ofall stakeholders including Government agencies, private sector
         entities, Non-governmental and civil society organizations and beneficiary communities
         throughout the country.
Coordination o f AIDS prevention activities falls under the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
Health. A National Multi-sectoral Commission on AIDS Control (Comite' National
Multisectoriel de Lutte contre le SIDA, CNMLS) has been established to encourage the various
sectors o f national life to get involved in HIV control., This commission is chaired by the
Minister o f Health and gathers together representatives o f civil society, the various ministries,
and the thematic group. For day-to-day management o f HIV/AIDS prevention efforts, the
Ministry o f Health relies upon the PNLS, which is one o f its permanent structures. The PNLS
has a National Directorate, eleven (11) Provincial Coordination Offices (Bureauxprovinciaux de
coordination, BPC), and a Central District Bureau (Bureau central de zone) within each health
zone.

              5. Challenges Ahead
Despite the significant steps that have been taken, the country i s still far behind inmobilizing the
social, institutional, and financial resources needed to contain the spread o f the epidemic and
mitigate its impact in a country as vast as DRC, which i s recently coming out o f a very
destructive conflict.
The challenge of scaling-up: A 2001 report by Act Africa (World Bank AIDS Team Campaign
for Africa) "The Cost o f Scaling HIV/AIDS Programs to a National Level in Africa" estimates
that, based on current levels o f intervention, US$130 milliodyear would be needed to scale-up a
mediumpackage o f HIV/AIDS activities to a national level inDRC. This figure alone shows that
current levels o f financing' are far below what is required. Such a level o f financing would still
amount only to about US$2/per capita/year. If, following the war, the highrates o f prevalence in
the eastern regions were to be confirmed, the expected resources for the fight against the
epidemic would become largely insufficient.
Institutional challenge: Although the Government has spearheaded efforts to build a multi-
sectoral strategy for the fight against HIV/AIDS, the strategy i s still very much perceived as a
health strategy. All major institutions such as the National Multi-sectoral Committee for
HIV/AIDS and the National Program (PNLS) are under the tutelage o f the Ministry o f Health. In
this context, it is crucial to hasten the migration o f these institutions to the higher level o f the
Presidency and to revitalize the role andthe functioning o f the CNMLS.
Another institutional effort concerns the coordinatiordintegration o f various initiatives so as to
maximize the efficacy o f resources flowing into the country. A truly national, multi-sectoral
institutional architecture could dramatically improve the efficiency o f resource allocation and
use.
Social challenge: Despite an early awareness o f HIV/AIDS issues, behaviors have changed very
little. Reasons include: inherent difficulties in changing socio-cultural factors, an urban focus,
difficult coverage o f the entire country, restricted access due to the war, exclusive focus on
medical aspects o fthe disease, little access to treatment and deficient offer o f services.
The proposedprogram will contribute to change by implementing a true multi-sectoral approach,
developing a strategy to reach out to rural areas, and providing social and medical responses
(VTC, treatment and care, social and psychological support, mitigation o f impact) in association
to IEC campaigns.
Implementation and strategic challenges: The immensity o f the country coupled with the
collapse o f physical, social, and economic infrastructure poses a particular implementation
challenge. Even more so, as the efficiency o f HIV/AIDS strategies rests upon its capacity to
reach out to everyone, everywhere, simultaneously, intensely, from multiple perspectives, and
through an integratedpackage o f activities.
Such an approach is o f course constrained by the lack o f resources but also, in the case o f DRC,
by a haphazard mode o f intervention among actors and poor or little coordination of efforts and
strategies. The proposed program will support consensus building on norms and standards and
the identification o f an integrated package o f activities to be implemented throughout the country


5 Combining expected new financing from the World Bank, Global Fund, and other key donors, a generous estimate
i s US$50 milliodyear for the next 5 years.


                                                                                                         4

along geographical and thematic priority zones o f intervention. The proposed program will thus
complement existing interventions and establish a coherent framework for activities consistent
withnational norms and standards.
          6. Criteria for AccessingMAP Financing
The DRC is eligible for this financing and meets the four criteria for MAP funding
      Satisfactory evidence of a strategic approach to HIV/AIDS. The DRC has developed a
      coherent multi-sectoral strategy for fighting HIV/AIDS for 1999-2008, as well as an
      InterimWork Plan for 2001-2003.
      A      high-level      HIV/AIDS       coordination        body.    The     Decree    No.
       1250/CAl3/MIN/S/AJ/KIZ/015/2001 dated December 9, 2001 created a National Multi-
      sectoral AIDS Council (Comite` National Multisectoriel de Lutte contre le SIDA,
      CNMLS) within the MoH. In order to give the CNMLS greater visibility and authority,
      the Government has agreed to place it under the chairmanship o f the President o f the
      Republic. A presidential decree will be enacted for that purpose before project
      effectiveness.
      Government agreement to use exceptional implementation arrangements. The
      Government has also agreed to contract out all activities that lend themselves to sub-
      contracting and to follow streamlined administrative procedures. Specific measures
      accepted by the Govemment include the use of: (i)a Fiduciary Management Agency
      (FMA); (ii)a special civil society disbursement agency where special measures are
      required; (iii)sub-contracting o f specific activities to UN agencies; (iv) continuing
      services o f agencies which have a successful record o f HIV-AIDS programs funded
      under the current IDA project, and; (v) contracting "NGOs or service providers" to assist
      with mobilizing community levelbeneficiaries.

   0  Government agreement to use and fund multiple beneficiaries. The Government o f
      DRC has requested all ministries and public enterprises to prepare HIV/AIDS activities
      under the project. It has also agreed to fund activities proposed by private sector
      enterprises, civil society and non-governmental, inter-faith and community-based
      organizations.

            1. The World Bank'sInterventions
In 2001, the Bank approved a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) designed to support the
Government's key challenges of: (i)    consolidating peace, (ii) stabilizing the macroeconomic and
fiscal framework, (iii)  rebuilding institutions and improving govemance, and, (iv) starting to
buildsocial services and meetingbasic needs. Financial support was first approved inJuly 2001,
with Board approval of a US$50 million Emergency Early Recovery Project (EEFW), funded
through an IDA grant. Subsequently, following the clearance of DRC arrears in June 2002, the
Board approved a US$450 million ERC inJune 2002, a US$454 million Emergency Multi-sector
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (EMRR Project) in August 2002, and a US$l20
Private Sector Development and Competitiveness Project (PSDCP) in July 2003. The Bank i s
also managing a multi-donor Trust Fund, which finances the Emergency Stabilization and
Recovery Project (ESRP), with contributions from the Governments o f Belgium and Canada as
well as from the European Commission. The Bank is currently working on the preparation o f
additional activities, both lending products and non-lending services, including the proposed
HIVIAIDS operation (MAPPMLS).
As part o f the EERP, the Bank identified the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a priority and included a
financing o f US$8 million in the Emergency Early Recovery Credit (IDA grant o f US$50
million) for specifically addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis. The financing provided for HIV/AIDS
fimded three components that were implemented through international NGOs: (i)Blood
transfusion security implemented by GTZ, (ii)       Voluntary testing, diagnosis and treatment o f
infections sexually transmissible implemented by Fometro; and, (iii)Social marketing o f
condoms implemented by PSI. Results have been impressive. The entire grant was efficiently
disbursed in 12 months and development results showed that, for example, blood transfusion
security rose from 13 percent to 40 percent, and the cost o f a tested unit o f blood declined three-
fold; the frequentation rate o f targeted centers for the diagnosis and treatment o f STIs more than
doubled over the same period. Moreover, the sub-contracting o f activities to NGOs enabled the
project to become active in all 11provinces well before the reunification o f the country. Lessons
on the efficiency o f sub-contracting have been integratedinthe proposed operation.
            2. Financingof the HealthSector andHIV/AIDS Activities
For the past two years, the international community and the Government have undertaken
massive efforts in support o f stabilization and recovery. In relative terms, however, given the
huge needs o f the country, total health sector budgetary support represented less than 2% o f the
total in 2002, or about US$l/per capitdyear. About 12% o f these resources were allocated to
HIV/AIDS (about US$O.12/pers/year), insufficient to achieve substantial progress in retarding
the spread o f the disease. In2003, substantial additional resources have been or will be approved
that may bring the ratio per capitdyear to about USSO.9. Total resources, however, will remain
far below the estimated US$2.16/pers/year needed to deliver a basic HIV/AIDS activity




                                                                                                6

package6. Based on these estimations, US$130 milliodyear would be needed to scale-up
nationally a full-fledged HIV/AIDSstrategy.
In2003, the GlobalFundapproved atotal program o fUS$113 millionover 5 years and the Bank
initiatedthe preparation o f a US$102 million project to be implemented over 6 years. Along with
other commitments, the total resource amount may reach US$315 million (over 5 to 6 years).
             3. ComparativeAdvantageof the World Bank
The mapping o f interventions shows that, despite being numerous, total financing remains very
low, coverage partial, and strategic coordination deficient. For example, many partners are
focusing on prevention through IEC techniques while the UNAIDS index o f interventions (MI
2000) indicates that DRC compares favorably with most countries inthat regard, but clearly lags
behind inthe areas o f care and treatment, and impact mitigation.
Another characteristic o f donor intervention i s the geographical concentration o f activities in
specific provinces and in zones surrounding provincial capitals. While this may have been
justified by the conflict situation and ongoing difficulty in accessing rural areas, this situation
presents a challenge in terms o f social equity and undermines the efficacy o f the HIV/AIDS
strategy. For example, national statistics on blood transfusion security, with average national
ratings at 40 percent, masque the fact that a few areas are close to a 100 percent security while
the rest o f the country is close to 0 percent. With peace and socio-economic activities resuming,
travel and exchanges throughout the country will intensify and this could very well ruin past
achievements. Countries that have succeeded in containing the spread o f the epidemic, such as
Senegal, demonstrate that HIV/AIDS strategies must be truly national, intense, and
multifaceted/multi-sectoral to be efficient due to population mobility, diversity o f contexts, and
socio-cultural resistance to behavioral change.
The Bank's leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS makes it a key partner for the DRC's
efforts to implement its National Strategic Plan. The financial resources that the Bank can deploy
in support o f the Government's strategy, its ability to help with the establishment o f a rigorous
financial set-up for the management and oversight o f funds in a country as vast as the DRC, itti
ability to involve other donors in the financing o f multi-sectoral programs, would contribute
significantly to promoting and ensuring a coherent, sustained response to the challenges o f the
epidemic.
Specifically, inthat perspective, the proposedprogram will promote:

        0    A national institutional framework for coordinating planning and implementing of
             HIV/AIDS interventions, including the Global Fundprogram;
        0    Decentralizedprogramming at the provincial and local levels that would identify and
             fundlocalpriorities;
        0    The development o f national norms, standards and strategies;
             National leadership andcapacity; and,
        0     Targeted financing to complement andor expand existing activities so as to improve
              geographical coverage andthe scope/range o f proposed activities.

The capacity o f the World Bank to promote and support a national framework for coordinating
HIV/AIDS activities is extremely important in view of the number o f actors in this sector and in
view o f the important financial contribution made by the Global Fund. Mechanisms to ensure
coordination and efficient use o fresources include
        (i)The Global Fundnational management unit is represented inthe CNMLS. The
                CNMLS will be in charge o f approving final annual programs and budgets and
                should ensure that activities are coordinated;
        (ii)memberoftheGlobalFundnationalmanagementunitwillparticipateinthesmall
              A
                technical committee that will assist the NCU in preparing annual programs and
                budgets. Programs and budgets will be reviewed by the Global Fund national
                management unit before transmission to the CNMLS; and,
        (iii)Discussions are under way with the Global Fund management unit to share
                provincial and local offices andjointly prepare sub-national programming.
Similar discussions and arrangements are under way with the GLIA and other major partners.

     2. Arrangements for results Monitoring
The project will be a Teaming-by-doing" process; therefore a solid M&E system will be a key
feature of the project design. An overall project M&E system will be established containing (i)
activity monitoring and evaluation, (ii) monitoring o f the epidemic and its impact (iii)  financial
monitoring o f all the financed Work Plan and sub-projects, in order to identify emerging
problems in execution o f activities and (iv) social monitoring impact, to assess the impact of the
project on vulnerable population groups.
Participative approach: Ownership o f the system, felt by all stakeholders, i s vital and actors at
all levels should be involved in the appropriation o f the procedures. Auto-analysis, structured


                                                                                               2

 feedback and regular contact by supervisory visits will be a main feature o f the M&E system.
The M&E system will establish databases on activity experiences and results (both national and
intemational), as well as for epidemiological data. This data should be transparent and readily
accessible at different levels, so as to promote adaptive leaming.
Implementation arrangements: Monitoring and Evaluation o f the National AIDS program o f
DRC is ultimately the responsibility o fthe CLNS. Daily management will be inthe hands o f the
M&E Specialist inthe NCU, who will coordinate the M&E system, butnot execute the activities.
The FMA will play a key role in the collection o f data, and can use their infrastructure at the
provincial level to facilitate the process. Staff at every level has to be trained in data collection
and analysis. Tools and forms have to be developed and finally a decision has to be made about
the flow o finformation.
Monitoring of activities: Past HIV/AIDS program activities have not been sufficiently
monitored. In contrast, the DRC HIV/AIDS project will monitor all activities on any level
following a relatively simple format, so that all actors are able to monitor their progress, even at
the most peripheral levels; therefore the collection and reporting procedures must be as simple as
possible. It should contain a standardized core (see manuals for details), however, this does not
precludepartners from collecting additional, situation-specific data.
Flow of data: Data will be collected monthly from community level and after auto-analysis
presented on a quarterly basis to provincial level, which must assess the completeness o f the
data, but also define the coverage o f activities in the region to ensure optimal coverage
efficiency. Fromthere it will be presented to the Project's Fiduciary Department that will process
the data. This Fiduciary Department will link realized activities to disbursements (referencing
contracts with executing organizations), in order to analyze and ensure the balance between
funding and number o f activities executed. This will also ensure sound finance-program data
cross-verification From there on the data will be presented to the national M&E officer, who will
do the final analysis, assessing progress and identifying areas where corrective measures have to
be taken. Finally the N C U will use the half-yearly reports to address strategic and conceptual
questions and to take decisions on approaches to abandon or develop. On all levels feedback i s
essential, both as an encouragement as well as a possibility to improve, and will be formalized.
Use of data: Since collected data should be used to improve activity execution, it is important to
develop capacity in data collection and analysis, starting with the communities; this will
necessitate adequatetraining inappropriate tools like self assessment and auto-evaluation, so that
communities will be able to estimate the effectiveness o f ongoing activities. Similarly, training
and capacity buildingat higher echelons will be undertaken, wherever activities are executed.
Monitoring of the epidemic: Another aspect o f the M&E system targets the epidemic itself;
National biological and behavioural surveillance o f STI/HIV/AIDS/TB will be monitored and
translated in sexual behaviour rates and HIV epidemic trends. To this end the M A P will support
DRC in implementing surveys every 2-3 years, following WHO/UNAIDS formats, combining
biomedical and behavioural surveillance, targeted to vulnerable groups. Every 5 years a larger
nation-wide survey will be executed with financial and technical assistance from other donors.
The social impact evaluation will be part and parcel o f the monitoring o f the epidemic, done by
intermittent surveys.
The M o H will play a lead role in the follow up o f activities executed under their purview;
specific indicators will be developed for monitoring:


                                                                                                3

       0   Treatment of STIs by the syndromic approach
       0   Prevention o f mother-to-child HIV transmission
       0   Condom distribution (specifically the supply chain logistics)
       0   Treatment o f TB and other opportunistic infections
       0   Treatment o f PLWHA
       0   The supply o f safe blood
Some but not all o f these indicators will be usedinthe national level analysis. Programmanagers
will use some o fthese indicators to improve activities for which they bear responsibility.
Financial monitoring: Financial Monitoring & Evaluation will not touch audit procedures, but
will be used as a management instrument, using tools like cost analysis. Accurate and full cost
information is crucial for evaluating the current level o f resource use and assessing opportunities
for future expenditures on controlling the AIDS epidemic inDRC. It can make future budgeting
more accurate and will also allow project planners to project the financial requirements
necessary to continue, expand, or replicate ongoing activities.

      CONGO, DEMOCRATICREPUBLICOF: DRC- MultisectoralHIV/AIDS Project


               1. Objectives
The proposed Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS Program (MAP/PMLS) will support the implementation
of the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan adopted by the Government in July 1999. Its main
objective i s to mitigate the negative impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the stabilization,
recovery and development of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
I t s specific objectives are:
      a    To reduce the risk of sexual, intravenous and vertical transmission of HIV;
            To improve the health status and quality of life of persons living with the virus (PLY);
           and
           Tomitigate thesocio-economic impact of the epidemic on vulnerablepopulation groups.
The MAP/PMLS will be a multi-sectoral operation that will involve a wide range o f actors inall
spheres o f the country's socio-economic life. It will seek to support and amplify public and
private initiatives at all levels inthe country's eleven provinces and inurban andrural areas .
              2. Project approach and strategy
The M A P P M L S will be organized horizontally into four components and structured vertically
into three windows (national, provincial, and local) to which actors will present project proposals
for approval and financing.
Horizontal organization: The four components are:
           I)Theresponseof thepublic sector;
           2) Theresponse of the non-governmental sector;
           3) Support to community initiatives;
           4) Coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building.
Each component focuses on a category o f actors who, depending on its comparative advantage
and capacity, will implement activities inthe three key domains o f intervention: Prevention, Care
and Treatment, and Mitigation o f Impact. Eligible activities include but are not limitedto:
      (i)   Prevention     (Safety   o f    blood   transfusions;    IEC/Community     mobilization;
      Supply/promotion/distributiono f condoms and medical supplies; Voluntary counseling and
      testing (VCT); STD screening and treatment; Reduction o f mother-to-infant transmission;
      Epidemiological surveillance; Research);
      (ii) Support services, care and treatmentfor PLWHA (Nutritional support and healthhygiene
      services; Screening for, and treatment of, opportunistic infections-01; ARV drugs;
      Psychological and social support services; Support to associations o f PLV; Expansion o f
     home health care; Improvement o f the legal framework for protecting the rights o f persons
      infected with HIV and/or suffering from AIDS and;
      (iii) Mitigation of the impact on persons and groups affected (Community mobilization;
     psychological and social support services; social/economic support to families and groups
      affected by HIV/AIDS; strategies for supporting orphans; improvement o f the legal



                                                                                               5

    framework for protecting the rights o f persons infected with HIV and/or suffering from
    AIDS, andthose affectedbythem; combatingsocial stigma.
 Vertical organization: Various actors, at all levels, throughout the country, will prepare and
present project proposals for approval and financing to either one o f the three MAP/PMLS
financial windows (national, provincial, and local level). The level o f the proposal's preparation
depends on the scope, cost, and coverage o fthe activity and the capacity o f the actor. Inshort:
    (i)Selected ministries, umbrella organizations (NGOs, faith-based organizations, inter-
    enterprises committees, unions, and the like), and large enterprises will prepare and present
    WorkPlans at the National Window;
    (ii)varietyofactorsactiveattheprovinciallevel(NGOs, enterprises, associations,public
        A
    services, various institutions, religious organizations) will prepare and present Sub-projects at
    the Provincial Window and;
    (iii) varietyofactorsactiveatthelocallevel(for example, communities, neighborhoods,
         A
    small NGOs, associations, and schools) will prepare and present Micro-Projects through the
    community component.'
The National Coordination Unit (NCU) or the Provincial Coordination Unit (PCU) will contract
operators to help actors, at all levels, prepare proposals and ensure equity in accessing the
program. Once the project proposals are approved, the concerned actors will sign a
performance-based agreement or performance based contract with the                N C U or PCU and
implement the proposed activities. Thresholds for financing, eligibility/approval criteria, and
specific mechanismdrules for accessing financing and ensuring quality o f implementation are
detailed in the manuals and are subject to change over the project life based on lessons learned
from experience. They will remain consistent, however, with the following principles:

    0  Financing and monitoring is based on mutually agreed results on theground;
    0   Thepackage of activities within Work Plans will be contracted to service providers as
        much aspossible;
       Someform of resource constraint (competition over a limited budget, co-financing and
       matching arrangements in cash and/or kind) will ensure that selected activities have a
       highpriority;
    0  Decentralized decision-making over programming and resource allocation will ensure
       goodfit between identified needs and approved activities;                    -

    a  Eligibility/approval criteria shall take into account the actors' comparative advantage in
       executing an activity, their capacity to initiate and/or scale-up activities, and their track
       record;
    a  Simple rules will be established and integrated into process of approval and supervision.
       Such rules, which will also be monitored, include,for example, the definition of a ceiling,
       based on apercentage of total costs,for capacity building activities and operating costs.
            3. Description of components
Component 1:Responseof thepublic sector - US$40.4million
The objective o f this component is to support the mobilization o f public institutions inthe fight
against the epidemic. The ministries will enter into the MAPPMLS progressively and will be
selected according to the relevance and coverage o f their work plans, which will address,their
internal clientele (Le., their staff) and their extemal clientele. The strategic objective is to anchor ,




                                                                                                  6

the work plan in the existing structure o f a given ministry and to systematically integrate
HIV/AIDS prevention activities into all the ministry's regular activities. This approach should
make it possible to quickly amplify the sector's response.
This component has two sub-components: a) the program of the Ministry o f Health; and b) the
program o f the other ministries.
a) Prozram of the Ministry of Health (US$ZI.I million): Given the dominant role that it plays in
controlling the epidemic, the work plan o f the Ministry o f Health (MSP) is in fact a fi-ee-standing
sub-component:
         Consolidation and expansion of activities in the areas of blood transfusion safety,
         prevention of mother-to-child transmission, treatment of STDs and opportunistic
         infections, voluntaly testing and counseling (VTC), and condompromotion/distribution;
         Improvingsafe access to anti-retroviral (AR y) drugs;
         Developing norms and standards and makingpolicies
         Epidemiological surveillance and research.
b) Program of the other ministries (US$19.3 million): The National Coordination Unit (NCU)
will help the ministries develop work plans relevant to their areas o f intervention. Inorder to
facilitate collaboration, a focal point has already been identified inseveral ministries.
The ministries' work plans will be national in scope and will target their staff (the internal
target) and customary clientsheneficiaries (the external target). The N C U will validate these
work plans on the basis o f eligibility criteria to be identified inthe manuals. These criteria may
include: a pre-determined financing envelope; the capacity for co-financing (Le., a budget line,
other in-kind resources); relevant integration o f HIV/AIDS into activities currently underway;
the cost-effectiveness o f interventions and modes o f implementation; and level o f demonstrated
effort to reach grassroots levels and direct beneficiaries.
Work plans will start to be developed at the same time as preparation o f the MAPPMLS, so that
they can be implemented as soon as the program is declared effective. Work plans will identify
the anticipated results and indicators that will allow the N C U to monitor quality and
implementation.      In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the NCU and the ministry
concerned will agree on appropriate measures.
Component 2: Response of the non-governmental sector - US$l7.9million
a) Private sector entities and public enterprises (US$7.3 million): The objective o f this sub-
component i s to mobilize the private sector entities and public enterprises in the fight against
HIV/AIDS. Inter-Enterprise Committees for HIV/AIDS will be responsible for implementing
this sub-component according to four themes:
                 Information/communication about the program
                 Support to, andpromotion of, project proposals within small, medium and large
                 enterprises;
                 Studieso fthe epidemic's impact on enterprises and on growth;
                 Development of a strategy for promoting and distributing condoms through
                 commercial channels;
                 Research/development addressing supply chains for medical inputs and the
                 development o fnational productionthereof.




                                                                                                7

b) Sector of NGOs, relizious groups, and professional orzanizations (US$I0.6 million): This
                                -    -
sub-component will be implemented by the various apexiumbrella organizations that make up
the sector. These umbrella organizations are preparing work plans that include activities such as:

               Information/communication about theprogram;
               Assistance to member organizations for identifying, preparing, and implementing
               project proposals;

            e  Structuring, strengthening and expanding of PLWHA associations. These
               associations are key inprevention, combating the stigma, and providing support to
               infected individuals and their families. They may also play a central role, in
               partnership with health services, in the functioning o f VCTs, outreach activities,
               and in improving equity and efficacy in accessing treatment. A pilot i s being
               developed to test these hypotheses;
               Structuring, strengthening and expanding NGOs and associations involved in
               various AIDS-related activities; and,
            e  Assistance to communities in identifying, preparing, implementing, and managing micro-
               projects.
Component3: Supportfor community initiatives- US$19.3million
A `community 'shall be understood as any humangroup mobilized around a common interest. A
community may be a village, a neighborhood, a school or any local association, etc.
The component's objective is to increase the impact o f the HIV/AIDS activities by transferring
the responsibility for identifying priorities and implementing micro-projects to the direct
beneficiaries in rural areas as well as in the urban areas. Experience shows, indeed, that
community empowerment improves priority identification, resource allocation, and ownership.
This component offers the best chance to succeed in changing behaviors, improving impact, and
developing local mitigation responses.
Through a participatory diagnosis, communities will identify their primary needs and basic
development priorities into which HIV/AIDS activities will be included. They will prioritize,
prepare, submit for financing, and implement micro-projects in the areas o f local development,
prevention, care and treatment, and impact mitigation. Resources will be transferred directly to
communities based on simplified financing agreements.
The N C U P C Uwill contract Operators to assist the communities throughout the process.
Details on eligible activities and procedures are developed in the manuals and are based on the
following strategic principles:
      Involvement o f customary structures for greater social mobilization;
      Integration within administrative structures for greater legal recognition and institutional
      sustainability;
      Co-financingmatching arrangements for greater ownership and social control, and
      improved priority-setting;
      Development o f scaling-up strategies (inter-village grouping, systematic identification o f
      Community Agents, etc.);
      A strongpartnership with healthservices;
      Access to quality technical support;



                                                                                               8

       Integration o f local development and HIV/AIDS.
Component 4: Coordination & Communication (US$ll.3M),Monitoring and Evaluation
(USSSM), Capacity Building (US$3.2M)- TOTAL: US$22.5million
The National Coordination Unit (NCU) will be responsible for operational functions. Thus, it
will be responsible for coordinating the overall implementation o f the program. More
specifically, the N C Uwill be responsible for:

  0    Preparing/consolidatingprograms, budgets and annual statements o fresults;
  0    Ensuring coordination and integration o f components and activities;
       Ensuring that lessons learned from experience are disseminated andput to use;
  0    Ensuring program monitoring and evaluation;
  0    Ensuringsupervision o fcontractual interventions;
  0    Ensuring the management o f program resources;
  0    Procuring equipment, ARV and other medical inputs; and
  0    Preparing andimplementing transversal capacity-building activities.
The N C U will be comprised o f professionals recruited on a competitive basis. Its staff will
include a Coordinator, Assistant Coordinator, Component Managers, Subject Matter Specialists,
a Monitoring & Evaluation Specialist, an Administrative and Financial Director, Accountants,
and a Procurement Specialist.
Giventhe scope o fthe program andthe immensity o fthe task to be accomplished, such functions
as financial management, procurement, andmonitoring and evaluation will be sub-contracted.
            4. Principalprojectareas
The coverage o f the project will be national. Standardized and successful operations (package o f
activities) to be implemented via large service providers and/or independent agencies with a
proven track record (such as some UNAgencies) will be consolidated and possibly expanded in
the 11provinces.
Newer activities and institutional arrangements will first be implemented in four provinces:
Katanga, Kasai Oriental, la Province Orientale, and SudKivu. Expansion to other provinces will
proceed gradually, subject to criteria that include: prevalence rate and risk, impact, intensityo f
other partners' involvement and institutional readiness (opening o f MAP/PMLS structure and
capacity). In areas where other development agencies are active, M A P P M L S authorities would
have discussions with such agencies to harmonize and complement each other's development
and HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.

The organizational arrangements are depicted inCharts 1attached to this annex.


            1. SteeringCommittees
At the national level, aNationalMulti-sectoral AIDS Council (ComitC National Multisectoriel de
Lutte contre le SIDA-CNMLS),         which defines the policy, strategy, and priorities for the sector,
would assume the role o f a project steering committee. CNMLS is composed o f high-level
representatives o f all line ministries. Inaddition, the Committee would have equal representation
o f civil-society, including NGOs and religious organizations. The President o f the Republic
chairs the Committee, and the Minister o fHealth i s its Vice-chairman.
The Committee would be responsible for overall monitoring and evaluation o f project
implementation and would approve the annual work plans and budgets, aligning them with
project objectives. It would organize at least one annual meeting with representatives o f the
donors, and perhaps establish a consultative committee o f key donors, to ensure adequate
coordination o f activities.
In the participating provinces, Provincial Steering Committees (already existing HN/AIDS
Committees chaired by the Governor) would provide guidance for defining broad orientations
and priorities at that level and assist the National Steering Committee. Similar arrangements will
be established at the Territory level. The Committee will be chaired by the Territory
Administrator.
The composition, tasks, responsibilities, and level o f authorization o f the different committees
and staff is detailed inthe project's implementation manuals.
            2. Projectadministrationand monitoring
Coordination: A National Coordination Unit (NCU) would be responsible for the technical and
fiduciary implementation coordination o f the project. A team o f experienced technicians, to be
recruited on a competitive basis, including a Project Coordinator, a Deputy Coordinator, an
Officer in charge o f Operations and Logistics, financial and procurement personnel, a
Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, Component Coordinators, and Thematic Specialists,
would staff it. The N C U will prepare annual programs and budgets as well as activity reports for
approval by the CNMLS. The N C U will also review and approve Work Plans prepared and
submitted for financing at that level.
For field coordination and programming, the project will have decentralized administration units
ineachprovince, to be supervised bythe NCU.
The Provincial Coordination Units (PCUs) will have a smaller staff, but include a Provincial
Coordinator, fiduciary and administrative Staff, a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, and
support staff. The CPU will review and approve sub-projects presented for financing and will
supervise the implementation o f activities at that level.
A similar structure with corresponding responsibilities may be established at the local level, or
Local Coordination Unit (LCU). Ifestablished, the LCUs will have reduced staff but include: a



                                                                                                12

Local Coordinator, a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, and support staff. The L C U will
review and approve micro-projects presented at that level and will ensure adequate supervision.
In very large provinces a Coordination Unit could be opened at the District level as well to
facilitate coordination and the flux o f information. This will be decided based on pragmatic
needs way duringimplementation.
At each level, the Coordination Units will be assisted in reviewing and approving project
proposals, and preparing annual programs and reports by a small Management Committee
(Comite de Gestion) containing representatives o f the various actors responsible for component
implementation (for example ministries' focal points, heads o f apex organizations) and a
representative from the Global Fund Technical Secretariat (CCM) at the national level. Such a
Committee will meet on a regular basis and will also advise the Coordinator on various technical
matters as needed (review o fterms o f references, reports, data analysis).
The participation o f a member o f the CCM to the Committee will ensure coherence inplanning
and programming between the two programs. In addition, annual programs and budgets will be
formally presented to the C C M before transmission to the CNMLS. If this mechanism were to
prove successful, it could be strengthened over the course o f the project and used to improve
coordination with other partners.
The Project Implementation Manual will specify the tasks o f the different organs and their
members, including the competence levels required.
Fiduciary and Administrative Implementation: The fiduciary management arrangements are
explained in document "Fiduciary Arrangements" and in Annex 7 o f the project appraisal
document. For day-to-day fiduciary operations, including procurement, the project will recruit a
highly qualified firm with international reputation or linkages (Fiduciary Management Agency-
FMA). The firm will establish fiduciary departments at all decentralized levels where resources
will have to be managed. The firm would have a service contract with the NCU, which would
retain the decision-making powers and responsibilities inthe financial and procurement matters.
The Fiduciary and Administrative Manual provides detailed arrangements.
For the purpose of selected procurement activities (opening o f bids, reviewing and evaluating
them, and making recommendations for award) an Ad hoc Procurement Commission will be
established. The Commission, to be comprised o f a maximum o f 10 people, will contain
Representatives from concerned ministries, the Ministry o f Finance, the non-governmental
sector, and from the NCU. .A sub-set o f that Commission, people with procurement experience,
will make up the Technical Commission that will evaluate bids and make recommendations for
awards. Awarding the bids will be the responsibility o f the NCU. A detailed description o f the
Commission and its functioning is presentedinthe Fiduciary and Administrative Manual.
            3. Implementationof componentsand subcomponents
COMPONENT1:SUPPORT TO PUBLIC-SECTORRESPONSE
The ministries selected for the project each year prepare annual work plans and present them to
the NCU. The work plans contain the priorities o f each ministry, selected among the eligible
activities under the project. The ministries' work plans have a nationwide coverage and are
targeted to the personnel o f the ministry and to the people who are in the sphere o f influence o f
the respective ministry (clients, families, users o f services, such as students for the Ministry o f
Education).


                                                                                             13

The N C U will review and approve the annual work plans for each ministry. Rules limiting
capacity building activities and operating costs to a percentage o f total costs will be applied.
Principles o f co-financing`resource matching will be in effect. Upon approval, the ministries will
sign a Performance-Based Agreement with the project, committing them to implement the
approved plan within the target dates and with the expected results. Four times a year, the
ministries will provide the N C U with an activity report monitoring progress towards objectives
and physical targets.
For the program to commit additional resources, the ministries will have to show evidence that
the previous work plans have been implemented satisfactorily (using criteria presented in the
Project Implementation Manual). Failing to implement the earlier work plans fully may cause
reduction o f funds for that particular ministry or an exclusion from project support during the
following year.
Ministries are in charge o f formulating policies, establishing norms and standards, ensuring
quality control, and therefore not expected to directly execute activities. As much as possible,
they will contract out their activities to service providers or delegate them to Facilitating
Agencies (in the case o f UN Agencies for example). N C U and concerned ministries will sign
contracts, and payments will be authorized on the basis o f legal provisions contained in the
contract.
Duringthe first one or two years, funds for the ministries' use will be operated by the Project's

Points"- principal contact points in the ministries - already selected for most ministries.
Fiduciary Department, except for small petty cash given to the ministries and operated by "Focal

Following satisfactory establishment o f fiduciary systems and performance in the ministries,
funds can be transferred to the ministries semi-annually or quarterly. The ministerial HIV/AIDS
committees may be used for the supervision o f the funds receivedfrom the project.
Component 2: Support to Non-Governmental Sector Response
Component 2 provides support to apex organizations and their member organizations inthe non-
governmental sector that include the private sector, public enterprises, NGOs, faith-based
organizations, and professional associations.
The MAP/PMLS will contract with pre-identified apex organizations and will finance their
annual work plans on the basis o f agreed performance and results. At the provincial and local
levels, non-governmental entities, assisted by apex organizations and the program, will prepare
and present sub-projects and micro-projects for financing. Rules limiting capacity building
activities and operating costs to a percentage o f total costs will be applied. Principles o f co-
financing inthe case o f enterprises will be in effect. Upon approval, they will sign performance-
based agreementdcontract with the        NCU/PCU and receive resources for implementation.
Monitoring and control will be simplified and based on technical progress reports and expected
outputs.
The Coordination Units will associate apex organizations in the review, approval, and
monitoring o f project proposals. In subsequent years, the Coordination might transfer full
responsibility for the above tasks to apex organizations, provided that capacity has been
strengthened and transparency mechanisms established. The respective manuals will provide the
criteria andrules to be followed.

COMPONENT 3: SUPPORTFOR COMMUNITY INITIATIVES
The process for providing financial support to initiatives proposed by various local communities
(e.g., women and youth groups, local churches, sport clubs, cooperatives, trade associations, and
village development communities) starts at communities, where provincial or local service
providers will help to organize participatory needs assessmentsand planning.
Through participatory planning, communities will discuss their development priorities and the
localized impact o f HIV/AIDS, and identify appropriate response measures. They will prepare
micro-projects to be submitted to the local coordination unit for approval. The funds will be
transferred directly to the community using simplified methods. These guidelines are already
outlined in the World Bank document, Guidelines on Simplified Procurement and Disbursement
for Community-Based Projects        (Africa Region 1998), including those for implementing,
monitoring, and auditing local micro-projects.
The N C U P C U will recruit service providers from among experienced civil society
organizations, NGOs, and consultant units to inform, advise, and help local communities
identify, prepare and implement micro-projects. The manual for local initiatives will detail
structures and processes used inimplementingthe component on community initiatives.

            1. COUNTRYISSUES
There are no recent diagnostic studies that contain definitive evaluation o f the country's
fiduciary environment. However, a joint IMF/World Bank assessment o f the DRC's eligibility
for assistance under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries was recently
issued which provided some insight into the status o f the country's public sector management
setting. This, together with other World Bank documents, portrays a highly unsatisfactory
control environment with weak          economic,    fiduciary and administrative institutional
infrastructure.
The Democratic Republic o f the Congo (DRC) is gradually emergingfrom a decade o f political
instability, conflict, mismanagement and corruption. Physical damage is extensive, institutions
are in shambles, and the country's economy is literally still on its knees. Against this
background, progress towards peace and reconciliation has accelerated within the context o f the
1999 Lusaka Agreement. A UN peacekeeping force has been deployed and the withdrawal of
foreign troops has been completed. Recently, political negotiations between the Government,
armed groups, political opposition, and civil society culminated in an agreement on a power-
sharing arrangement for a transition period leading to elections within 24 to 30 months. An
agreement was also reached on June 30,2003 on the formation o f an all-inclusive Government o f
national unitywith representation o f all key armed groups, unarmedopposition and civil society.
In-depth structural reforms have been launched in the areas o f economic governance, public
expenditure management, transparency, financial sector and public enterprises reform. The
country's development partners have also expressed their interest in helping it to strengthen
capacity in public administration. Although there i s cause for cautious optimism, it will take a
long time for these reforms to yield the substantial improvements in the management o f public
funds.
            2. INSTITUTIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
The project's institutional arrangements are documented in detail in the Project Implementation
Manual and will include: a National Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS Commission (Comite` Nationale
Multisectoriel de Lutte contre le S D A - CNMLS), chaired by the President o f the Republic and
whose Vice Chairman will be the Minister o f Health; the National Coordination Unit (Unite` de
Coordination Nationale - NCU) which will be responsible for day-to-day management o f the
Program, for putting in place a strong fiduciary management system and for the recruitment o f
staff and support agencies such as the Fiduciary Management Agency; and decentralized project
coordination units at the province, district or local (community) levels supervised by the N C U
and whose roles will reflect those o f the N C U at the national level. Below these structures,
groups o f villages will also form HIV/AIDS committees to help indetermining priority actions.
Program activities will be implementedbybeneficiaries at all levels (public or non-governmental
sector organizations with a legal existence, credibility and acceptability in their area o f
operation) andby Facilitating Agencies such as the UNagencies.

               3. SUMMARY RISKANALYSIS
An effective fiduciary management system will be vital for the project because o f the need to
deliver services to target groups quickly over a large geographic area to a wide variety of
stakeholders. The objectives o f the project's fiduciary management systemwill be: (i) ensure           to
that project funds are used only for their intended purposes in an efficient and economical way;
(ii) enabletherapiddisbursementofprojectfundstobeneficiaries;(iii) ascertainthatfunds

the preparation o f accurate and timely fiduciary reports; (v) to assist build the capacity o f the
beneficiaries in terms o f fiduciary       management; (vi) to stimulate accountability through a
strong flow o f information on project activities; (vii) to enable project management to monitor
the efficient implementation o f the project and; (viii) to safeguard the project assets and
resources. The table below identifies the key risks that management may face in achieving these
objectives and provides a basis for determining how management should address these risks.

                4. FIDUCIARYAND ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT
 The Fiduciary Department o f the NCU, PCUs, and LCUs will be established and staffed by a
 Fiduciary Management Agency (FMA) recruited to that effect. The Fiduciary Department, under
 the authority o f the National Coordinator, will carry out contracting, procurement, disbursement
 and fiduciary management functions required under the M A P in accordance with standard and
 accepted guidelines o f the donor agencies supporting this program.
 It is envisaged that the FMAFiduciary Department will be managed by a senior manager with
 suitable qualifications and experience in public administration, accounting, or project
 management.        He/she will be supported by professional staff as necessary to assist with
 accounting, disbursement and expenditure review. The Terms o f reference for the agency will
 provide an indication o f the staffing resources required, but discretion will be left to the firm to
 determine the optimum structure and staffrequired to fulfill its obligations.
 The firm will also determine the best structure to put inplace provincial and lower levels inorder
 to enable the Fiduciary Department to meet the terms o f its establishment. This may be through
 the hire o f staff, or through supervising personnel that already exist inthose locations.
 The Terms o f Reference will form the basis o f invitations for expressions o f interest, bids and
 later, the contract signed with the successful candidate. This contract will specify the nature,
 level, mix, and standards o f services expected to be delivered from the F M M i d u c i a r y
 Department. Insituations where the contractor fails to perform, it will be liable for any resulting
 delays or damages, and this could lead to the termination o f the contract. This will help enhance
 the control o fthe NCU over the management and control o fProgram resources.
 Overall Responsibilities The FMNFiduciary Department will support the Project inall aspects
                              -
 o f financial management, accounting, contracting and procurement related to the MAP. In
 particular, it will be responsible for the following: designing and establishing a computerized
 fiduciary management system, disbursement o f funds, maintaining the Project's bank accounts,
 maintaining up-to-date accounting records and ledgers, and recording fiduciary transactions for
 all activities pertaining to the project for which the FMNFiduciary Department i s given
 responsibility, fiduciary reporting, and ensuring that a proper internal control system is inplace
 to achieve accountability at all levels.
 The Manager o f the F M M i d u c i a r y Department will report to the Program Coordinator on day-
 to-day transactions. At least two sets o f financial reports will be prepared by the F M M i d u c i a r y
 Department: the quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and the Program's financial
 statements. In addition, ad-hoc reports may reasonably be requested by the N C U and other
 donors.



                                                                                                            19

             5. DISBURSEMENTIDA FUNDSTO THE PROJECT
                                  OF
FMR-Based Disbursements: A key objective o f the project's fiduciary management system will
be to ensure that, within an appropriate fiduciary framework, beneficiaries are able to access
sufficient funds to operate effectively. After a period o f six to twelve months disbursements o f
IDA funds to the project are expected to be authorized based on Financial Monitoring Reports
(FMRs) subject to a satisfactory financial management assessment and timely submission o f
financial reports. FMRs will integrate project accounting, procurement, contract management,
disbursementand audit with physical progress o fproject implementation.
Special Accounts: To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume o f withdrawal
applications, the National Coordination Unit will open three Special Accounts in U S dollars in
commercial banks in Kinshasa, on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The Special
Accounts will be managed by the FMA/Fiduciary Department.

    0   Special Account A will finance HIV/AIDS prevention activities, training and sensitivity
        campaigns as well as the operating costs, and contractual salaries o f the National
         Coordination Unit and the FMA. It will also finance large equipment and consultant
         contracts at the national level as well as work plans signed yearly between line ministries,
         apex organizations and large enterprises. These work plans contain detailed activity
        programs and budgets. Duringthe first few years, the N C U will make direct payments to
        beneficiaries and service providers on behalf o f the Ministries, while it will sign a
        performance-based contract with apex organizations and large enterprises. Once
        Ministries have acquired sufficient capacity, they will be granted greater fiduciary
        responsibilities. This Special Account will also finance facilitating contracts to be signed
        betweenUNagencies and specialized service providers, and the NCU.

     0  Special Account B will be utilized for transfers to Second Generation Accounts opened
        in the provinces, where a reliable banking network exists. Special Account B will be
         opened in a commercial bank with a corresponding bank network available in the
        respective Chef-lieu o f the Provinces. The Second Generation Accounts will be in an
         amount corresponding to an average o f four months o f expenditures not to exceed U S
        dollars 350,000. They will finance sub-projects and micro-projects at the periphery o f
        the Provincial capital, as well as the operating costs and contractual salaries o f the
        provincial unit.

     0  Special Account C will be used to transfer funds to the provinces, where no banking
         facilities are available. This account will also be used to transfer funds beyond the
        periphery o f the provincial capitals, as needed. Inthis case, a civil society organization i s
        expected to channel funds for sub-projects and micro-projects approved at the Provincial
        and local levels based on a services contract or a financing agreement for micro-projects.
        The intermediary will receive a fee prorated on the amounts disbursed to beneficiaries
        undersub-projects.
Initially, the authorized allocations would be U S dollars 6 million for Special Account A, U S
dollars 5 million for Special Account B and U S dollars 1 million for Special Account C. The
respective allocations will cover about six months o f eligible expenditures. The Special Account
would be used for all payments inferior to twenty percent o f the authorized allocation and
replenishment applications would be submitted monthly.           Further deposits by IDA into the



                                                                                              20

Special Accounts would be made against withdrawal applications supported by appropriate
documents.
An advance will be made into each Special Account at the inception o fthe project. The advance
will be meant to cover project expenditures for 6 months as indicated in the initial six-month
cash flow forecast. Following the initial training period o f 6 to 12 months necessary to build
capacity, FMR-based disbursements are expected to be authorized by the Association. From that
point, the project, every subsequent quarter, will submit FMRs which include a cash flow
forecast for the following 6 month period The cash request at the reporting date will be the
amount required for the forecast period as shown in the approved FMRs less the balance in the
Special Account at the end o f the quarter. Subsequent disbursements o f the IDA funds will be
made inrespect o f this request.
Project Completion: The project is expected to be completed over a six-year period and funds
will be disbursed under the grant in accordance with categories o f expenditures as shown in
Table C, below. When the project reaches its closing date i.e. six months after the completion
date, the Special Account advances will be recovered in fbll. A four months grace period will be
granted at the Government's request to allow payment o f pending invoices for goods delivered,
works completed and services rendered by the closing date. A computerized accounting and
integrated fiduciary management system will be set up and assessed by IDA as a condition of
effectiveness. The FMA will provide assistance to the Project during project life and until all
activities are completed.

6.       PROJECTDISBURSEMENTS               TO BENEFICIARIES' AND SERVICE AND GOODPROVIDERS
Use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements for all expenditures will be made
against full documentation, except for items o f expenditures for: (a) contracts for consulting
firms in an amount inferior to US$100,000 equivalent, (b) contracts for individual consultants in
an amount inferior to US$50,000 equivalent, (c) contracts for works and goods, in an amount
inferior to $250,000, (d) facilitating Agencies (UN Agencies and selected private providers) in
an amount inferior to $500,000; (e) sub-projects in an amount inferior to US$lOO, 000, and (e)
community micro-projects, training and operating costs, which will all be claimed on the basis
o f Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained at
a suitable location by the Central unit, province, NGO, association and/or the community. The
documentation will be made readily accessible for review by periodic IDA supervision missions
andextemal auditors.
Flow of funds: arrangements to channel funds from the Central to the Provincial level will be
streamlined in order to ensure prompt and efficient disbursements. A computerized satellite
system linking the Provincial units to the Central Unit in Kinshasa will be put in place to help
track sub-project and micro-project approval and payments. Sample standard sub/micro-project
documents and financing agreements for sub/micro-projects will be distributedinadvance to all
potential beneficiaries inthe Provinces in order to facilitate the submission o f sub/micro-project
requests. Approval and payment mechanisms will be simplified in accordance with the IDA
Guidelines for Community-Driven Development. The number o f payments under a subproject
will be made in tranches depending on sub-project size. The first advance payment will be
triggeredby an approved sub-project while subsequent payments take place based on a technical
certificate o f progress. Subproject documentation will be maintained by the beneficiary (village,
community, NGO, Association etc.) and will be audited by the project's extemal auditors on a
samplebasis.
The weak bankingnetwork in the country will require bold innovation to find ways inwhich to
ensure project funds reach beneficiaries who are situated beyond the banking network. It is
envisaged that project funds to finance activities in provinces will be transferred to Second
Generation Accounts maintained at the provincial; level, whenever a commercial bank is
available inthe provincial capital.
Inprovinces or remote areas, where no banks are available, an international relief organization
with countrywide operations will be used to transmit payments to beneficiaries o f micro-projects.
Negotiations are on-going with a civil society organization to perform this function. The method
o f transmitting these payments will be agreed at the time o f signing the services contract with the
internationalrelief organization. The schedule o f such payments will be specified inthe services
Contract, and although disbursements will not be based on accountability for previous expenses,
approvals for the payouts will take into consideration the compliance by the relief organization
o f the conditions o f the contract, including those relating to accountability for funds and
disbursement triggers



8Beneficiaries include the recipients ofproject resources for the implementation of Work Plans at the national level,
o f Sub-projects at the provincial level, and Micro-Projects at the local level. Beneficiaries can be public, private, or
non-government entities (for example, ministries, enterprises, and communities)




                                                                                                                 22

Disbursement of Project Funds for the Implementation of Work Plans prepared by Ministries.
Initially, for a period o f one to two years, line ministries will not manage resources (with the
exception o f small operating expenditures) nor procurement. During that period, they will
strengthen their capacity and following a positive financial and procurement assessment, they
might, thereafter, be entrusted with fiduciary responsibilities up to a certain threshold depending
on the result o f the capacity assessment Complex sets o f activities (defined as comprising the
acquisition o f goods and services and costed above a threshold that will be determined in the
implementation manual) will be contracted, on a competitive basis, to qualified firms (or NGOs).
The selected firms will be submitted to a fiduciary capacity assessment before final approval o f
their selection. Contracts will be signed and monitored by both the N C U and the concerned
ministry.
Following a positive assessment o f their capacities, the project will make disbursements to
selected ministries and public sector entities on the basis o f an annual program, budget, and
schedule called Work Plan. A Performance based agreement or contract will be signed between
the project and the entities that will specify expected monitorable results and conditions o f
implementation. Tranches would be made in accordance with schedules agreed uponbetween the
project and Ministries. The submission o f accountability for previous advances will not be a
condition for paying subsequent tranches, but the Ministry will present physical and financial
progress reports. In addition, appropriate corrective action will be sought from implementing
entities where such actions are identified as a result o f exercises carried out by the project
coordination units to verify expenditures and performance. Approval o f new Work Plans will
depend on the results o f such exercises and overall performance measured by agreed-upon
indicators. Misguided activities could result inthe suspension o f financing for a given entity. The
FMAEiduciary Department will reserve itself the right to verify the expenditures ex-post and
refunds mightbe requested for non-respect o fthe agreement or contract clauses.
Disbursement of Project Funds for the Implementation of Work Plans prepared by Apex
Organizations. Following a positive assessment o f their capacities, the project will make
disbursements to selected apex organizations on the basis o f an annual program, budget, and
schedule called Work Plan. A Performance-based contract will be signed between the NCU and
the entities that will specify expected monitorable results and conditions o f implementation.
Tranches will be made in accordance with contract payment terms (schedules and results agreed
upon betweenthe project and the apex organization). The initial advance will not exceed 20% o f
the total amount. Submission o f an invoice and a report on physical progress for previous
advances will be a condition for paying subsequent tranches.
The submission o f accountability for the previous payment will not be a condition for making
disbursements. However, appropriate corrective action will be sought from implementing entities
where such actions are identified as a result o f exercises carried out by the project coordination
units to verify expenditures and performance. Approval o f new Work Plans will depend on the
results o f such exercises and overall performance measured by agreed-upon indicators. Refunds
might be requested for non-respect o f the agreement or contract clauses and misguided activities
could result inthe suspension o f financing for a given entity.
Disbursements of Project Funds for Sub-projects and Micro-Projects prepared by Public and
Private Entities, Communities, NGOs, Associations. The project will finance sub-projects at the
provincial level and micro-projects at the local level for the implementation o f project proposals
to fight HIV/AIDS. Both sub and micro projects can be prepared and presented by a wide array


                                                                                              23

o f actors/beneficiaries   including private and public entities,        enterprises, professional
associations, communities, etc. What distinguish sub and micro projects i s the cost o f the
proposal (thresholds are defined inthe manuals) and, thus, the level o f submission.
The FMNFiduciary Department will make disbursements to the beneficiaries whose proposal
has been approved based onJinancing agreements signed following approval o f a sub/micro-
project proposal. Financing Sub/Micro-Project Agreements will be performance-based and will
detail expected results and schedules. Payments will be made in accordance with the payment
modalities, as specified in the agreement with an initial advance not to exceed 20% o f the total
amount. The F M M i d u c i a r y Department will effect subsequent payments to the entity upon
presentation o f an invoice and a report on physical progress, in accordance with contract
payment terms. The submission o f accountability for the previous payment will not be a
condition for making disbursements. However, the FMNFiduciaryDepartment will reserve itself
the right to verify the expenditures ex-post andrefunds might be requested for non-respect o f the
agreement or contract clauses.
Disbursements of Project Funds for a Complex Package of Activities. The project will also be
able to sign a Facilitating Services Contract with services providers selected on a competitive
basis for the implementation o f a complex package o f activities comprising the coordinated
provision o f goods and services and requiring that the project delegate part o f its fiduciary
responsibilities. Examples o f such complex activities include Security o f Blood Transfusion,
Social Marketing o f Condoms, Care andTreatment o f PLWHA, and Diagnosis and Treatment o f
STIs.
The project will also be able to sign a Facilitating Services Contract with United Nations
Agencies for the purpose o f scaling-up and implementing their HIV/AIDS activities. The
selected providers will receive funds from the project intranches, on the basis o f detailed annual
budgets and agreed-upon monitorable results, inaccordance with contract modalities.
Payments will be made in accordance with the payment modalities, as specified in the contract.
The FMA/Fiduciary Department will effect subsequent payments to the service provider upon
submission o f accountability for the previous payment or upon presentation o f an invoice, and
upon presentation o f requested output (or proof that the requested output has been delivered) as
specified in the contract. The FMNFiduciary Department will reserve itself the right to verify
the expenditures ex-post and refunds might be requested for non-respect o f contractual clauses.
Disbursement of Project Funds for the Payment of Goods and Services to Providers (Private
sector/NGOs). The project through the FMMiduciary Department will make disbursements to
service providers (private sector, NGOs) based on service contracts. Payments will be made in
accordance with the payment modalities, as specified in the contract. The FMA/Fiduciary
Department will effect subsequent payments to the service provider upon submission o f
accountability for the previous payment or upon presentation o f an invoice, and upon
presentation o f requested output (or proof that the requested output has been delivered) as
specified in the contract. The FMNFiduciary Department will reserve itself the right to verify
the expenditures ex-post and refunds mightbe requested for non-respect o f contractual clauses.
            7. FINANCIAL,ACCOUNTING,AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
The accounting systems, policies and procedures employed by the Project in accounting and
managing for project funds will be documented in the project's Fiduciary and Administrative



                                                                                             24

Manual (FAM).This will be usedby: staff as a reference manual; IDA and other donors to assess
the acceptability o f the project accounting, reporting and control systems; and by the auditors to
assess project accounting systems and controls and in designing specific project audit
procedures.
Specific procedures will be documented for each significant accounting function. They will be
written to depict document and transaction flows, and will cover the following aspects: flow o f
funds; record keeping and maintenance, the chart o f accounts, formats of records and books o f
account; authorization procedures for transactions; planning and budgeting; financial reports
(including formats, linkages with Chart o f Accounts and procedures for reviewing these); and
auditing arrangements.
Inaddition, the Project Implementation Manual will document the arrangements that have been
made for recording project impacts, outcomes, outputs, and inputs that are required to assess
progress toward the achievement o fproject objectives.
A team o f consultants has been recruited to prepare the FAM. It will be revised, in the first
instance after the appointment o f the FMA, and regularly thereafter.
Planning and Budgeting. Each sector and level o f administration will prepare a strategy for
combating HIV/AIDS, taking into account the views o f relevant stakeholders. The strategy will
identify the activities to be undertaken, the role o f different parties and present work plans and
budgets. These will indicate the planned activities and related costs, and will form the basis for
cash requests in the public sector and contractual arrangements in the private sector. Annual
work plans will be consolidated into a single document by the N C U and this will be submitted to
the CNMLS for approval. The consolidation will be done after the N C U ensures, through its
technical committee, that the plans meet eligibility criteria.
A project budget and a disbursement schedule have been drawn up and included in the Project
Appraisal Document and the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). It is from this disbursement
schedule (as may be subsequently revised) that annual budgets will be drawn.
The NCU and its decentralized coordinating committees will be responsible for the review and approval
of sub/micro-project proposals submitted by implementingorganizations.

Planning and budgeting at community level. Communities and village organizations will come
together and determine actions to determine priority needs in a participatory manner. The
initiatives they determine will form the basis o f preparation o f micro-projects. These will be
submitted for approval to the nearest level o f project coordination (corresponding either to the
territory or district). They will be consolidated into the annual work plans for that level o f
coordination. In designing effective micro-projects, the Program will deploy field operators to
support team to assist communities in the preparation o f Village Development Plans
encompassing the micro-projects inthat area. A Manual on Community Initiatives includes more
guidance on these aspects.
The local financial window will be also accessible to small NGOs, enterprises, and other local
entities performing at that level.
Staffing. Qualified Ministries and other agencies will retain staffing resources that are adequate
with their level o f operations and activities and are sufficient to maintain accounting records
relating to project financed transactions, and to provide the FMABiduciary Department with the



                                                                                              25

financial reports and retums that are necessary to maintain the project's overall accounting
records. The fiduciary capacity assessment that will qualify Ministries and other entities to
perform fiduciary responsibilities will also identify the number o f staff available to carry out
these functions at that level. It is envisaged that a support function will be set up by the NCU to
hire such staff as are necessary to fill any gaps. Training and capacity buildingplans will also be
designed and implemented to ensure that the relevant functions are transferred to ministries that
established such capacity.
Funds not exceeding 10% o f funds (or any other percentage agreed upon with the Association)
requested in each work plan may be dedicated to capacity building activities including
reinforcing planning and budgeting, implementation and monitoring and evaluationcapacity.
Record keeping and maintenance. At the national level, the FMNFiduciary Department will be
responsible for maintaining the project's records. For the various beneficiaries including line
ministries and decentralized coordination, accounting source documents will be kept at their
premises and made available for the purpose o fverifying project expenditure incurred.
Financial Reporting. Financial reports will be designed to provide quality and timely
information to project management, agencies, and various stakeholders on project performance.
Formats o f the various periodic FMRs to be generated from the fiduciary management system
will be developed using the World Bank's Guidelines for Borrowers on Financial Monitoring
Reports. These will include financial statements (e.g. sources and application o f funds;
expenditure classified by project components, disbursement categories, expenditure types and
agencies, and comparisons with budgets). Additional information required by the World Bank
Loan Department for disbursement purposes will also be included such as a Special Account
activity statement and information on contracts above andbelow the prior review threshold.
Annual Financial Statements will include: a Statement o f Sources and Uses o f Funds showing all
the sources o f project funds, expenditures analyzed by project component and credit category;
Notes in respect o f significant accounting policies and accounting standards adopted by
management and any supplementary information required to enhance analysis; a Special
Account Activity Statement; an Implementation Report containing a narrative summary o f the
implementation progress for the project; and a Summary o f Withdrawals using FMRs, listing
individual withdrawal applications by reference number, date and amount. The reports, whose
formats will be developed by Credit Effectiveness, will be submitted for audit within three
months after the end o f the fiscal year.
At the community level, simplicity will be the primary objective in designing records that are
maintainedto account for sub project transactions. Physical progress reports and financial reports
from the subproject level will be submitted to the FMNFiduciary Department in accordance
with agreed simplified reporting formats specified inthe performance based agreementlcontract,
in accordance with the Bank's Community-Driven Development Guidelines. The timing for
submission o f the reports will also be specified in the agreement. At this level, the form and
content o f the reports could include one or more of, inter alia, progress and completion reports,
technical inspection certificates, minutes o f community meetings, memoranda o f receipts and
expenses, etc., as appropriate for each set o f circumstances. These reports will be available for
review during regular supervision missions and for audit purposes. For small subprojects o f a
short duration, a single report issued at the end o f the subproject period may be sufficient.




                                                                                              26

Other agencies will be required to submit reports in accordance with terms agreed between the
project and the agency.
Internal Auditing. A separate Internal Audit Department (IAD) will be established within the
NCU. The IAD's role will be to ensure that the project's fiduciary procedures and regulations
relating to the management o f project resources are adhered to. The IAD will perform
inspections o f accounting procedures used by the project's fiduciary department to ensure that
they conform to the established procedures and guidelines. The IAD will work with the internal
to achieve its objectives. This may include the verification o f expenditures
Internal Audit provides an independent and objective function in ensuring management
effectively carries out its responsibilities as part o f the overall control mechanism o f the
organization. The IAD will perform inspections o f accounting procedures used by the FMA to
ensure that they conform to the established procedures and guidelines. The IDA staff will carry
out its missions inthe various implementingagencies, such as the line ministries andNGOs and
may be for Value For Money- highest value for the least cost (EEE), for Best Value and for the
effectiveness o f the project's accounting and internal control systems.
At the decentralized levels o fproject implementation, a simple inexpensive internal ex-post audit
o f community subprojects will be designed and linked to the overall monitoring and evaluation
of the community subprojects. This will enable the N C U to confirm that sub-project funds are
spent on the intended purposes and that the community has received value for money. The
internal audit function will be carried out by an International Consultant
The manual o f accounting procedures will contain a description o f the roles and responsibilities
o f the IAD, and a description of a line or reporting that guarantees the requisite level o f
independence.
External Financial Auditing. A firm o f auditors will be contracted to carry out the audit o f the
financial statements o f the project on a annual basis as o f December 31 o f every year. This
frequency could change depending on the findings o f the first audits reports. The selection o f the
successful firm will be based on Terms o f Reference that are acceptable to IDA. The terms o f
reference will also set out the scope o f the audit. The audited financial statements together with
the auditor's report and management letter covering identified internal control and accounting
system weaknesses will be submitted to IDA within six months after the end o f the audited
period. A single audit opinion will be issued on project income and expenditures, special
accounts and FMRs. Another audit opinion will be issued on specific controls such as
compliance with procurement procedures and FMR requirements. Any firm o f auditors
subcontracted to carry out the audit will meet the IDA'Srequirements interms o f independence,
qualifications and experience.
External Technical Audit. A firm o f technical auditors will be contracted competitively to
review procurements, statements o f expenditures, and immobilizations as well as verifying the
physical existence goods, equipment, and services acquired through the project. This audit will
be conducted on an annual basis as o f June 30 every year. The periodicity could change
depending on the findings of the first audits reports. The selection o f the successful firm will be
based on Terms o f Reference that are acceptable to IDA. The terms o f reference will also set out
the scope o f the audit. The audited documents together with the auditor's report will be
submitted to IDA within four months o f the end o f the review.




                                                                                             27

Closing the accountability cycle: Following up on audit queries                  -  The duties o f the CNMLS
will include the review o f audited financial statements and internal and external audit findings.
This committee will be mandated to require corrective action to be taken by the N C U and the
FMA/Fiduciary Department to address any weaknesses in the fiduciary management system or
incidences o f non-compliance with procedures. The N C Uwill also use the results o f the audits in
monitoring the performance o f the Fiduciary Department, beneficiaries, and Facilitating
Agencies. This arrangement will ensure the satisfactory follow-up o f audit findings.
The successful internal control and fiduciary management o f the project will require that
beneficiaries and other stakeholders be kept well informed at all times and at all levels about
their entitlements, rights, obligations, and the project's costs and benefits. This information will
be provided in a manner understandable to all interested parties and its availability will facilitate
the involvement o f the beneficiary community inthe fiduciary management o f the project. It will
also enable them to dem,and accountability from their leaders or from community organizations
that are responsible for the implementation o f subprojects. In furtherance o f this objective,
summaries o f local project expenditures and procurement information will be posted in a public
place within the communities.

    CONGO, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF: DRC- MultisectoralHIV/AIDS Project


            1. BACKGROUNDPROCUREMENT
                               -                   REFORM
The Democratic Republic o f Congo (DRC) has started to emerge from a long period o f country
mismanagement and devastating conflict, but stability has yet to be fully achieved. The
procurement laws need to be entirely renewed. These laws date from 1969 and have never been
revised, except for some initial unofficial drafts. The inexistence o f modemized laws and the
absence o f objective control mechanisms have caused public procurement to disintegrate into an
ad-hoc system where every agency more or less follows its own set o f rules. Although the Code
("Ordonnance No. 69-279 relative aux march& publics de travaux, defournitures, de transports
et de prestations" o f December 5, 1969) includes appropriate provisions, it is incomplete and
substantially outdated. Provisions for the procurement o f goods and works are not clearly
distinguished, and consulting services are not dealt with separately.
A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) is underway inDRC. The CPAR will lay
the basis o f the reconstructiono f the procurement function inthe DRC inits entirety. Part o f the
main framework, such as the Direction des march& and the system o f Bid Award Councils may
be retained, but within this general framework, laws will have to be redrafted and procedures and
practices completely modemized. Meanwhile, national regulations cannot be used under the
Project in the absence o f the conclusions and recommendations of the CPAR. Therefore, this
project will follow the Bank's Procurement Guidelines and standard biddingdocuments.
            2. USEOFBANKGUIDELINES
Procurement o f civil works and goods will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines:
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 edition - revised January and
August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999). Bank's Standard Bidding Documents and
Standard Bid Evaluation bidding documents for works and goods under Intemational
Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used. The Government will prepare Standard Bidding
Documents for procurement o f works and goods under National Competitive Bidding(NCB) and
these documents annexed to the Manual o f Procedures will be mandatory. Bank's Standard Bid
Evaluation forms would be used for N C B contracts with necessary modifications.
Selection o f Consultants will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers (January 1997 edition - revised
September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002). Bank's Standard Request for Proposals and
evaluation forms will be used where applicable.
           3. PROCUREMENT       IMPLEMENTATION       ARRANGEMENTS
The establishment and staffing of a Fiduciary Department for the handling o f procurement and
financial functions will be outsourced to a Fiduciary Management Agency (FMA). This
professional firm with an international reputation will be selected on a competitive basis.
The tasks o f the Fiduciary Department will comprise: (i)    maintaining registers o f all interested
bidders; (ii)  maintaining a detailed list o f technical specifications o f goods and services to be
financed by the project; (iii)  preparing and updating procurement plans and calendars; (iv)
preparing andor finalizing bidding documents and requests for proposals; (v) preparing bid


                                                                                              31

evaluation reports; (vi) approving contracts; (vii) processing intemational and local price
quotations; (viii) receiving o f goods and services and dispatching; and (ix) monitoring o f
contracts implementation. The Fiduciary Department will manage procurement under the
administrative responsibility o f the National Coordinating Unit (NCU). The N C U will submit
quarterly reports (including activities under all components) describing the program already
executed and the updated schedule for remaining activities.
The Work Plan o f eight line ministries - including the Ministry o f Health (MOH) - will be
financed during the first year o f the project. Since the capacity o f these ministries i s very weak,
procurement will be done by the Project's Fiduciary Department until the capacity is built in
financial and procurement management. The Fiduciary Department will be responsible to train
the accountant and the person in charge o f procurement in order to transfer this activity after a
satisfactory completion of a procurement capacity assessment. It is expected that this transfer
could take place one or two years after project effectiveness. Procurement to be camed out for
the MOHwill include general goods and selection o f consultants.
The Government is in the process o f establishing a system o f centralized procurement and
decentralized distribution o f drug and medical supplies               (Fkdkrution des Centrules
d'Approvisionnement en Mkdicuments Essentiels - FEDECAM) using existing capacity among a
large number o f organizations (catholic missions, civil organizations, national and intemational
NGOs). This i s currently in the pilot stage in four locations, with the World Bank (Economic
Recovery Credit) supporting the establishment of an additional five in the first half o f 2004.
Some o f these distribution centers are located in the MAP target provinces. However,
procurement o f drugs, ARV and medical supplies through FEDECAM can only be done after an
assessment o f its capacity to perform procurement has been declared satisfactorily by the Bank.
ARV and medical supplies may be procured through UNAgencies (WHO; UNICEF; UNFPA).
Acting as suppliers these agencies may be a good source o f high-quality, low-cost medicines and
medical supplies. Inthose cases, they can behiredunder sole-source provisions.

             5. PROCUREMENTCAPACITY
Since the N C U has recently been created and the Fiduciary Management Agency (FMA), which
will supply the core fiduciary staff o f the NCU, is not yet selected, it is not possible to assess its
procurement capacity. The procurement staff provided by the FMA will include a Senior
Procurement Specialist and an Assistant at the central level, but also a procurement agent in
every province. These specialists should be familiar with World Bank's procurement procedures
as reflected in the terms o f reference approved by the Bank. The central senior procurement
specialist will: (i)monitor all procurement activities o f the Project at all levels, (ii)
                                                                                        supervise the
regional procurement agents, (iii)build capacities o f beneficiaries which have not enough
procurement capacities.
Inthe line ministries financed the first year, i.e. Health, Education, Transport, Armed Forces,
Rural Development, Interior and Culture, the procurement capacity assessment will be done by
the Fiduciary Department after a period o f one or two years when these ministries will be
considered capable to handle procurement and financial activities. So procurement risks are
evaluated low for these entities. For NGOs, CBOs and Private Sector Organizations, there i s no
need o f assessing the capacity because the strategy is based on a demand-driven approach. Civil
society organizations will identify, develop, submit, implement and monitor activities on the
basis o f signed agreement. Therefore participating organizations are not yet identified as well as
the type o f activity andrelated procurement they will propose.
            6. PROCUREMENTPLAN
A draft procurement plan has been prepared and will be finalized before negotiations for all
procurement to be carried out at the national level for the first year activities. The exact mix o f
procurement will be determined on an annual basis during the annual joint reviews between the
NCU, line ministries, IDA, and other partners, where a draft procurement planfor the following
financial year will be presented and agreed upon. The detailed procurement plans for subsequent
years will be developed and submitted to IDA for review and approval. The plan will include
relevant information on goods, works and consulting services under the project as well as the
timing o f each milestone in the procurement process. These plans will be reviewed by IDA
supervision missions and by the external technical audits if needed. The procurement plan will
be updated on annual basis in conjunction with preparation o f the sectoral Work Plan. All
procurement will be carried out in accordance with the formally agreed procurement plan
(original and formally up-dated). Inlight o f the difficulties in planning the number o f contracts
and packages and coming up with precise figures for the value o f each contract, no aggregate
amount for any procurement method o f procurement plan i s required in the project appraisal
document or ingrant agreement.
            7. PROCUREMENT       METHODS
All invitations for bidshall include a detailed description o f the works or goods, including basic
specifications, the required completion date and a basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA,
and relevant drawings where applicable. Awards will be made to the contractors or suppliers
who offer the lowest price quotation for the required work, provided they demonstrate they have
the experience and resources to complete the contract successhlly.
Civil Works (US$3.8 million, excluding Community-Based Sub-Projects). There will not be
any major civil works contract under the project therefore no International Competitive Bidding



                                                                                               33

(ICB) is expected during the life of the project. Small refection of facilities for line ministries
estimated at less than US$50,000 equivalent will be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price
contracts awarded on the basis o f quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors
invited in writing to bid. The invitation shall, among other things, include a detailed description
o f the works, including basic specifications, relevant drawings and bill o f quantities where
applicable, the required completion date and a basic form o f agreement acceptable to the Bank.
A sufficient bid submission period will be allowed andbidswill be opened inpublic. The award
will be made to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder who has appropriate experience and
resources to successfully complete the contract. For small works that may be included in sub-
projects and community-basedmicro-projects, giventhe sub and micro-projects size, amount and
demand-driven nature, these contracts would be govemed when applicable by the Guidelines for
Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for Community-Based Investments (February 1998)
detailed inthe Project Manuals.
Goods (US$l8.3 million). The total cost o f goods, including drugs, is estimated at US$18,3
million equivalent for the project, not including contracts for goods under the community sub-
projects. The items would include: office equipment, fk-niture and materials, audio-visual and
laboratory equipment; vehicles; HIV/AIDS-related health commodities, condoms; IEC materials,
and other project related supplies. Procurement o f goods will be bulked where feasible into
packages valued at US$lOO,OOO equivalent or more perpackage andprocured through ICB.
(a) Goods estimated to cost less than US$250,000 and more than US$50,000 would be procured
through national competitive bidding (NCB).
(b) Goods estimated to cost US$50,000 equivalent or less per contract may be procured through
National Shopping procedures. ARVs, reagents, laboratory equipment and other HIV/AIDS
related drugs to cost US$250,000 equivalent or less per contract may be procured through
International Shopping procedures. Contracts will be awarded on the basis o f written solicitation
issued to at least three qualified suppliers, following evaluation o f bids received inwriting from
such qualified suppliers. The award would be made to the supplier with the lowest price
quotation for the required goods, provided it has the experience and resources to execute the
contract successfully. The first three contracts for the procurement o f ARVs will be subject to
prior review.
(c) HIV/AIDS-related health commodities, such as drugs including ARV and reagents
(hemoglobin, hepatitis, RTD) and medical supplies, tests equipment (Elisa), blood-takinglgiving
sets, milk substitutes, ARV, antiseptics and anti-TB drugs, can be procured from UnitedNations
Agencies (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, etc.), in accordance with the Bank Guidelines. It could also
be done through FEDECAM, provided an assessment o f its capacity to performprocurement has
been declared satisfactorily by the Bank as mentioned above.
(d) Procurement of reagents for HIV/AIDS and blood transfusion security considered as
proprietary items may be procured directly from manufacturers and authorized local distributors
inview ofthe requirements ofexisting laboratory/testing equipment.
(e) Regarding the procurement o f ARVs, the market situation o f each product, the nature o f the
medicines and medical supplies, and the critical dates for delivery, are all major factors
determining, choice o f procurement method. The majority o f ARVs and some other HIV/AIDS
related drugs are either single source or limited-source products. So International (or national)
competitive bidding without pre-qualification typically cannot be the preferred method o f


                                                                                             34

procurement. Instead, limited international bidding, direct contracting, or shopping may be the
most appropriate.
Consulting Services, Studies, and Training (US$lS.3million). Consultant services, studies and
training financed by IDA would be for the following types o f activities: studies and surveys
related to the monitoring and evaluation activities, trainers, community development specialists,
public relations firms (IECBCC campaigns), N C U and PCU core staff, procurement, financial
management, financial and technical audits, and accounting specialists.
(a) Quality-and-Cost-based Selection:       All consulting service contracts for firms would be
awarded through Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) method including the selection if
Auditors. To ensure that priority is given to the identification o f suitable and qualified national
consultants, short-lists for contracts estimated at or less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent may be
comprised entirely o f national consultants (in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 of
the Consultant Guidelines), provided that a sufficient number o f qualified individual or firms are
available. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest, they would not be excluded from
consideration.
(b) Consultant's Qualification Selection may be used for consulting services for research, and
targeted interventions for which organizations with specialized expertise, strong capacities to
work with vulnerable groups and proven track records would be recruited. The amount o f the
contract is estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO. This method may also be used for the
selection o f training institutions when training cost does not exceed US$50,000 equivalent per
contract
(c) UN Agencies, like WHO, UNICEF and UNHCR, will be hired on a single source basis to
carry out consultants' services particularly in the field o f monitoring and evaluation (WHO),
orphans, and support to the refugees (UNHCR). The exact scope o f the assignment and the
estimated amount o f the contract is not yet known since discussions are under way. The use o f
the Standard Form o f Agreement for Consultant's Services prepared by the World Bank for use
by its borrowers/recipients and their implementing agencies when they hire UNAgencies will be
mandatory.
Training, Workshops, Study Tours, and Conferences. The total cost o f these activities is
estimated at US$17.1 million equivalent for the project. Training, workshops, conference
attendance and study tours will be carried out on the basis of approved annual training programs
that will identify the general framework o f training and similar activities for the year, including
the nature o f training, study tours, workshops, the number o fparticipants, and cost estimates.
            8. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL                   (PIM),     AND    FIDUCIARYAND
                 ADMINISTRATIVEMANUAL        (FAM) OFTHE PROJECT
The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) will define and specify the procedures for the
execution o f the Project. It will be composed of sections and annexes detailing the
implementation and monitoring procedures for each component and financial window. The PIM
will be specific with respect to procedures, rules, eligibility criteria, and other conditions to
access project resources through work plans, sub and micro-projects. It will describe the
contractual arrangements between the Project and the beneficiaries and will contain models o f
such contractual documents. The PIM will be reviewed by the Bank and adopted by the
Government prior to effectiveness.



                                                                                              35

The Fiduciary and Administrative Manual (FAM) will describe the internal control o f
procurement actions, the technical specifications in each case, as well as reference to the model
contracts as per the Bank's SBD and RFP, etc. (submission form, contracts, etc.). It will include:
(a) a specific section on procurement detailing (i)procedures for planning, calling for bids,
selecting contractors, suppliers and consultants, (b) a Project Implementation Plan- and a
Procurement Plan for the first year o f operations. It will describe: (i)
                                                                       the supervision and control
procedures, including operational guidelines defining the role o f each executing agency and
reporting requirements; and (ii)disbursement procedures.
           9. PRIORREVIEWTHRESHOLDS            (TABLE  B)
Monitoring and evaluation o f procurement performance at all levels (national, provincial, and
community) would be carried out during IDA supervision missions and through annual ex-post
audit and or technical independent audit. All contracts, which are not subject to prior review
according to Table B, would be subject to post review inaccordance with paragraph 4 Appendix
IoftheGuidelines.
The Borrower and IDA will review all thresholds stated in this section on an annual basis.
Amendments may be agreed upon based on performance and actual values o f procurement
implemented. Amendments to the DGA may be proposed accordingly.
Risk and Frequency of procurement supervision. In the absence o f a procurement capacity
assessment and given the general context o f this project, the Overall Procurement Risk
Assessment is considered high. The Bank will agree with the Government during negotiations
for one supervision mission every six months for the two first years, including a special
procurement supervision for post-review audits.
Frequency ofprocurement supervision missions. Once every six (6) months (including special
procurement supervision for post-review/audits).

                           Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis
    CONGO, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICOF: DRC MultisectoralHIV/AIDS Project
                                                         -

Poverty, income and sex inequality, war, sexually transmissible diseases, social norms, social
and political changes, work related migrations, are among the propagating factors o f the HIV.
The unprecedented disruption o f the process o f social and human capital accumulation and the
domestic saving it entails is what causes HIV/AIDS to undermine the economic development
process, however. . The impact o f HIV/AIDS leads to a vicious circle through which HIV/AIDS
reduces economic growth and worsens poverty, which in turn accelerates the propagation o f
HIV.
            1. SOCIO-ECONOMIC      DETERMINANTS HIV/AIDS INTHEDRC
                                                    OF

Social norms and economic incentives and constraints shape individual behavior, which are the
major determinants o f the evolution o f the epidemic. On the other hand, by affecting the health
of individuals, reducing life expectancy, and increasing mortality, the HIV/AIDS influences the
economy and individual behaviors. This explains international variations inprevalencerates, and
within a country among provinces/regions, towns and villages. Inthe DRC the following factors
can be considered as the major propagating factors o f HIV/AIDS.
Poverty and income inequality. More than 3 decades o f mismanagement followed by 5 years o f
war have worsened the already poor living standard o f the population. In the DRC, per capita
income has declined by 60 percent in 12 years. It was only US$ 86 in 2002 and as a result, 80
percent o f the population lives on less than US$ 0.20 per day. Although the exact mechanism o f
transmission are not known, many studies including Over (1997) and Robalino et al. (2002) have
shown statistical correlations suggesting that the prevalence o f HIV increases when per capita
income declines and income inequality increases. Indeed, the poor are likely to be more
vulnerable to the epidemic. They have in general less knowledge about the risks o f HIV/AIDS
and prevention methods; they have fewer opportunities to define their choices or behaviors (in
particular women); and, poverty can induce people to engage incommercial sex activities.
The war and related population migrations. Since 1996, different wars involving armed groups
from 7 countries and diverse militias have caused the death over 3 million o f people and have
displaced millions from neighboring countries where HIV/AIDS prevalence rates are higher.
Thus, the number o f new infections is estimated to have increased by a factor o f 16 between
1990 and 2000; the prevalence rate is especially high in regions affected by conflict and among
women.
Woman rights and the issue of gender. Studies show that inequality among sexes- measured by
the share o f women's population inurban centers and the gap between male and female literacy
rates - is associated with higher HIV/AIDS prevalence rates (Over, 1997). These results suggest
that countries where women's rights are not promoted, leaving less or no control on the
frequency and type o f sexual encounters, are more favorable environments for the spread o f
HIV/AIDS.
            2. MACROECONOMICOF HIV/AIDS
                                    IMPACT
HIV/AIDS reduces economic efficiency andcompromises reconstruction efforts as resources are
reallocated away from productive uses to finance additional health expenditures.


                                                                                           38

Economic impacts through the loss of current and future human capital: HW/AIDS affects
the economy by disrupting human and social capital accumulation. HIV/AIDS affects both the
size and quality o f the country's labor force. First, higher mortality and morbidity negatively
impact the size and productivity o f the current labor force. Premature deaths represent not only
losses in a productive factor, but also losses o f the knowledge and experience embedded in it.
Higher morbidity can also reduce labor productivity, for instance, through absenteeism, high
labor turnover, and higher health insurance expenditures. A firm-level survey conducted in 48
enterprises located in 4 provinces showed that the majority o f firms experience productivity
losses because o f absenteeism as HW-infectedworkers stay inthe state o f illness for about 1to 6
months. Furthermore, the survey revealed that firms o f Kasai-Oriental and Bas-Congo that do
not provide medical assistance have seen 80 and 54 percent o f PLWHA die during the last 5
years.
Second, HIV/AIDS retards accumulation o f hture human capital, as premature deaths tend to
increase the number o f orphans who are less likely to hlly develop their physical and intellectual
capacities. Today inthe DRC, it i s estimated that there are over 1.5 million orphans, as about 60
percent o fpeople dying from AIDS leave behind 4 to 6 children.
HIWAIDS, saving and investment: Empirical results show that, in general, the savings rate in
developing countries may be negatively related to the HIV prevalence rate (World Bank, 2000).
The bulk o f households will be compelled to reduce both their saving and non-AIDS related
consumption in order to finance additional health care costs, cover the costs o f additional
dependents, and meet other adverse effects o f AIDS on family expenditure or income. Public
saving is expected to decrease as a result o f mounting Government spending on health and
various forms of social support. The impact on public saving may be more severe if Government
has to subsidize either pharmaceutical company to allow HIV+ patients accessibility to
treatments or directly to patients. The DRC counts some 3,000,000 PLWHA as o f 2003. Ifthe
annual health care cost per PLWHA amounts to $100 (excluding ARV therapy), the budgetary
cost could reach up to U S $ 300 million, representing 55 percent o f fiscal revenues (excluding
grants) or about 5 percent o f GDP. The cost is clearly unaffordable for the DRC.
             3. COSTS-BENEFITSANALYSIS
The Government o f the DRC is preparing the implementation o f a U S $100 million grant
received from the World Bank as a five-year (2004-08) support to the country effort to mitigate
the effects o f HIVIAIDS. This section analyses the costs and benefits o f the HIV/AIDS MAP in
DRC.

The following' formula has been applied to estimate the prevalence o f HIV/AIDS in the DRC
between2004 and2030:

    (1)      P =H exp (a0 +al*t)/(l+exp (aO+al*t)
                      *
Where P=country specific prevalence rate, H=max prevalence rate of 10 (and varied assumptions have been used),
t=years from first incidence o f AIDS case reporting (1985), a0 and a1 are the coefficients from the regression of log
(P/(H-P)) taking two reporting points intime 0.19% for 1985 and 1.77% for 2000.

            a. Why Waiting Can be Costly
In 2003, the number of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) was estimated at 3,000,000,
and the prevalence rate in the adult population stood at 5.07 %, with provincial variations
ranging from 4.5 % inKinshasa to 7.5% inLubumbashi.
Although, this i s relatively low compared to regional averages, the prevalence rate has reacheda
critical point where in general the epidemic starts growing exponentially. In addition, at this
stage, the situation i s not fully known in the recently reunified provinces wrecked by the war
since 1996. Isolatedstudies indicate that infectionrates could reach20%.
Evenifthe prevalence rate remains at below 10percent, the simulation (no project intervention)
reports that the incidence rate of HIV/AIDS increases from 820,829 annual new adult cases in
2004 to 921,633 in 2008. The prevalence rate increases from 5.84 percent o f adults in 2004 to
6.01 percent o f adults in 2008. By 2011, there will be about 1,000,000 people newly infected by
HIV, and the number will reachover 1,700,000 in2030. Inparallel, almost PLWHA will die in
the same proportions: over 760,000 in2004, 960,000 in2011and 1,600,000 in2030. The cost on
the entire society would be highly exorbitant and alarming as the most active group of the
population i s eliminated, leaving behind a population of orphans without adequate means for
their education and survival.

              b. The Benefitsof the MAP
For the purpose o f the simulations, an assumption i s taken that the intervention through the MAP
program will reduce HIV/AIDS prevalence by 10 percent between 2004 and 2008. Table 2
displays the results when the prevalence rate is reduced by 10 percent due to project intervention
(with a max P= 9.9).


This is a conservative assumption. In the five year project lifecycle, the incidence o f new HIV
infections are only 140,168 against 820,000 without the MAP in 2004 and in 2008 the project
helps the Government reduces new cases at 161,197 from 921,633 without the MAP.
This i s an overall decline duringthe project lifetime inprevalence o f 10 percent compared to the
scenario o f no project intervention. The impact o f the project fades out gradually beyond the fifth
year. However, the incidence o f new infections remains relatively low; in 2030, only 340,808 o f
new infections occurred compared to more than 1,700,000 inthe case o f no project intervention.
Table 3 provides an estimation o f the project benefits from the HIV/AIDS prevention introduced
by the MAP.

Table 4 shows the net present value (NPV)" over the project lifecycle and beyond the project
lifetime. It i s assumed the MAP will disburse respectively $10,000,000,                          $15,000,000,
$20,000,000, $25,000,000, and $30,000,000 on the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth year o f
the project. The NPV for the first five years from the inception o f the project is US$ 1,500,000.
However, the NPV grows rapidly to about US$400,000 a year beyondthe project lifetime.
The simulation results above are based on key assumptions that every infected person can work
and earn a minimum o f $105 in 2004, and that the overall growth rate o f per capita GDP i s at
least 3 percent per year during the lifetime o f the project and thereafter. Not surprisingly, the
benefits o f the project will be meager if the economy fails to grow at a minimum o f 3 per cent
per annum, and HIVpropagation acceleratesbecause income poverty.
The Cost-Benefit Analysis nevertheless shows that combating HIV/AIDS through the MAP can
slow down the propagation o f the epidemic and allow planned reconstruction and re-unification
efforts to bring forth expected results. The benefits o f the MAP amount to 3 percent o f GDP per
year during the lifetime o f the project and 4 to 5 percent o f GDP beyond the lifetime o f the
project. However, the extent to which the epidemic can decelerate depends on the effectiveness
o f the program. Simulation results show that although the impact o f the project i s already
considerable as soon as the first five years o f the project lifecycle; impact increases markedly
beyond the fifth year. The hypothetical situation demonstrates that the benefits of the project can
be far greater, if there is a larger deceleration inthe growth o f the epidemic, which i s dependent
on the intervention programs. The Cost-Benefit analysis therefore supports the implementation
o f the MAP.

return r for Nyears. Inshort, NPV is the sum o f discounted net benefits over time.

As part o f the project preparation, an environment assessment was carried out. This assessment
suggested that the main environmental challenges faced by such a project will be the handling,
collection and disposal o f health care waste (HCW). The assessment recommended an in-depth
study o f the current issues states o f affairs regarding medical waste management in the country
context.
             1. OBJECTIVES OFTHE STUDY
The main objective o f the study was to assess the current health care waste management
(HCWM) practices in selected hospitals and health centers in order to identify the level o f
Health Care Waste Management relevant to help implement and enforce proper health and
environmentally sound, technically feasible, economically viable, and socially acceptable
systems for management o f health care waste inDRC.
The examination o f current practices with regard to the handling o f hospital waste verified both
the management o f waste within hospitals, clinics and other health centers as well as the
management by municipal authorities once the waste left the source. It assessed the level o f
knowledge among staff (hospital orderlies, nurses, patients, municipal workers, etc.) about
practices to be adopted, and into the availability o f equipment needed inmedical waste handling,
collection andtreatment.
The study was carried out in selected hospitals and health centers in 3 provinces: Katanga,
Kinshasa and Bas Congo. The choice o f these sites was based on their easy access. The health
infrastructures visited reflect the diversity o f the national health system including public
institutions (2 national teaching hospitals, 1provincial hospital, 2 general hospitals) and private
(2 general hospitals).
             2. STRUCTUREOFTHE DRCNATIONALHEALTHSYSTEM
The national health system o f the DRC i s structured in three levels: the central or national level
for policy development, the intermediate level or regional level for technical support and the
health zone (zone de sante? for health services delivery and policy implementation. The country
i s divided into 504 health zones with the aim o f development and delivery o f primary health care
strategy. There are 3 university clinics, 480 hospitals and a total o f 69,441 beds in the health
system. The quantity o f medical waste generated is dependent on the size and attendance o f the
infrastructure involved and varies greatly from 0.3 m3 kg/week (for the university clinic -
CUK/Kinshasa to 0.1 - 0.2 m3/week for general hospitals referential hospital, an average o f 5
m3/week o fH C W are produced andbetweenthe HGR.
             3. FINDINGOFTHE STUDY
Institutionaland legal aspects in the management of the HCW: The institutional and legal
framework for Health care medical waste management is sketchy. In principle, the Ministry o f
Health (MoH) and Ministry o f Environment (ME) share responsibility for public hygiene. But in
practice, there is no sense o f such arrangement and no coordination. Moreover, there is no
national environmental policy document available for consultation.




                                                                                            46

However, the study uncovered that there is on-going progress on this front and, as a result, a
draft environmental document i s available and will be soon be submitted to Parliament for
review and adoption. In addition, a national health policy document i s available for the MOH
and has been submitted for adoption by Parliament. The M o H also established and is in the
process o fupgrading equipment and providing training for a national hygiene agency, whose role
will be to include the development and enforcement o fwaste management guidelines.
Knowledge, behavior and practices in the HCWM: The study revealed two findings about
knowledge o f waste management safety and health risks. For medical personnel, knowledge,
behavior and H C W M practices are acceptable. However, the same is not true for other staff,
including paramedical staff and cleaners due to lack o f basic education for health personnel
constantly incontact with infectious waste without any proper tools or knowledge. It is common
among this group to collect blood and engage inother risky activities without wearing gloves.
Health Care Waste Management in hospitals and health centers: Health care waste is poorly
managed in most hospitals and health centers. The study compiled a list o f problems related to
poor management including: (i)      lack o f basic training for cleaners, incinerator operators and
other sanitation agents; (ii)lack o f adequate protection equipments for agents dealing with waste
collection, transport and treatment; (iii)Absence o f adequate mechanisms for separation o f waste
(infectious waste, domestic waste, sharp objects etc.); (iv) scavenging activities; (v) open dumps
and buming o f waste inside hospitals or innearby sites; (vi) disposal of H C W inholes without
a soil cover; (vii) absence o f sanitary landfill for municipal wastes and HCW; (viii) poor
operation o f incinerators, where available.
Collection, handling, and disposal of medical waste: With regard to storage and collection o f
medical waste, hygiene services inhospitals are very poor, inefficient, illequipped and staff ill-
trained. The study observed that there were neither specific procedures nor guidelines to assist
the medical and support staff in the handlingand storage o f medical waste including separation
by waste types or incineration or disposal o f such waste. As a result, medical waste is stored
randomly in open containers and disposed in uncovered holes in easily accessible areas on the
grounds o f the hospital or health center. In some cases, medical waste i s incinerated in open air.
This practice is most common and has the potential o f contributing to air pollution andthe spread
o f germs and disease to hospital patients and neighboring communities. Clearly, management o f
medical waste i s not a priority for most hospitals and health center management staff.
Stakeholders in the management of health care waste: Several stakeholders are involved in
the production, transportation and management o f health care waste in the DRC. Health
establishments are the source o f most health care waste production, but in general their
management o fthis waste is poor; (ii)  Municipalities: Along with municipal waste transportation
and disposal, they are also involved in the transportation and disposal of medical waste.
Unfortunately, most cities do not have sanitary landfills and therefore the disposal o f waste in
general is done in very poor conditions following no common or acceptable guidelines.
Technical services o f ministries o f Health and environment: There are national initiatives (such
as the programme national d 'assainissement) which contracts with hospitals for the removal
medical waste in addition to their traditional mandate o f collection and disposal o f municipal
waste.
Additional stakeholders in the medical waste include community and local NGOs and private
sector entities. In the DRC, a few NGOs and private sector entities are involved mostly in



                                                                                              47

municipal waste collection, but with limited involvement in health care waste management.
Some private sector entities are mostly involved in wastewater disposal from residential areas
and contracted hospitals (Andre Motors in Kinshasa). Moreover, informal entrepreneurs
including street children are also involved in the collection o f waste with an even greater risk as
they operate under even worse conditions.
Finally, the international donor community has played and continues to play a key role in
improving the collection and management o f medical waste in the DRC. Through the financing
o f initiatives for that purpose, the European Union financed the construction o f incinerators in
health centers and hospitals in Kinshasa, and USAID has financed the improvement o f hygiene
inhealthcenters inrural areas.
Health and environmental impacts: The poor management o f the healthcare waste observed in
the field has many consequences to the general population, to the hospital and health center
patients in particular, and to the environment. Direct exposure to open dumps where infectious
waste i s mixed with domestic waste can result in casual contact with wounds and infections.
Most prominent among these concerns i s exposure to HIV infected waste, viral hepatitis (B and
C), microbial and parasitic diseases. For the environment, the impacts o f poor management
include soil and food chain contamination, water surface and underground water pollution and
air pollution.
             4. THEDRC MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN
Analysis o f the findings o f the study yielded a number o f recommendations, which serve as
guidingprinciples inthe formulation o f a Work Plan for the management o f a health care waste
management plan for the DRC. This planwill be executed for an initial period o f five years. The
DRC MWMP i s focused on five key areas: (i)      Improving the legal and institutional framework
for HCWM; (ii)strengthening hospitals and health centers with adequate equipment for
improved medical waste management; (iii)     training medical personnel and other stakeholders on
medical waste management; (iv) Increasing awareness o f the general population on risks related
to handling o f infectious waste; (v) Encouraging the involvement o f communities and private
sector entities inthe HCWM activities.
Improving legal and institutional framework for health care waste management: The Work
Plan proposed the development o f an institutional framework for HCWM; In this regard,
additional efforts should be deployed in order to push forward existing activities under way
including the adoption o f legal and technical documents for improving medical waste
management inthe DRC. These documents should include internationally acceptable guidelines
on handling, storage and disposal o f medical waste throughout the country. In addition, the plan
calls for dissemination o f these documents nationwide for use in hospitals and health centers
across the country.
Strengthening hospitals and health centers capacity in handling medical waste: This will
ensure that health centers and hospitals throughout the country meet minimum standards in the
collection, handling and treatment o f medical waste. The medical waste management plan
proposed the addition and equipment o f a necessary materials and equipments for waste
handling, collection, storage and disposal. It called particularly for the provision o f safety and
protective equipments (gloves, masks, and blouses) and the installation o f incinerators in the
main hospitals. Finally, it called for the quick drafting and distribution o f guidelines on health
care management to hospitals and health centers throughout the country.

Training medical personnel and all stakeholders in waste management: This will improve
knowledge, attitude and practices on medical waste management among the core users o f these
services. The medical waste management planproposed a number o f related activities including
the development o f training materials, training o f the medical and paramedical staff, medical
assistants and midwives. In addition, it also proposed regular supervision inthe workplace and a
continuing education o f the health practitioners and the general population (particularly children
and scavengers) on the risks relatedto the mishandlingo f medical waste.
Encouraging the involvement of communities and private sector entities in waste
management activities. The medical waste management planalso called for increased efforts in
encouraging the involvement o f communities and private sector entities. For that purpose, it
proposed the conception o f messages for NGO and privates to be part o f the H C W M activities
and support to these entities for involvement inspecific aspects o f medical waste management.
Selection of appropriate technology and practices: The use o f technology for the treatment o f
health care waste in the D R C does not reflect the wide range of existing options. As in many
developing countries, limited resources, the cost technology and the lack o f qualified manpower
limit the use o f available options. As part o f the implementation o f the medical waste
management plan for the DRC, a number o f appropriate technologies have been identified as
meeting minimuminternational standards, and ifused appropriately will improve the situation in
the country. These include: (i)       Disinfectants: for use on liquid waste before poring into drains;
(ii)Lagoontreatment ofhospitalwasterswhere the landisavailablearoundthehospital(e.g.
around the CWKinshasa); (iii)           Incinerators for burning medical waste. It is recommended that
university and provincial hospitals be equipped with modem incinerators, while locally made
incinerators are sufficient for general hospitals in the zone de sante'. (iv) Finally, the medical
waste management plan suggested adopting the practice o f burying waste for health centers in
rural areas and where space is available.

                          Annex 15: ImplementationAssistancePlan
    CONGO, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF: DRC- MULTISECTORALHIV/AIDS
                                           PROJECT


The high level o f involvement o f the Bank team during preparation and its ability to spend
extensive amount o f time in the field with the national team made possible a fast-track, yet
highlyparticipatory preparation process. The resulting quality and ownership o f the project call
for sustaining the same strategy during implementation. The capacity to maintain a close and
productive dialogue with the national team along with the capacity to visit regularly field
activities (outside Kinshasa) will determine the outcome o f implementation. In short, close and
active collaboration and support, rather than ordinary supervision i s more likely to ensure a
successful implementationprocess.
Inaddition, this kindofintensive implementation assistanceis warrantedby the general country
context and the innovations introduced by the project, the wide span o f activities, and its blend o f
public, private and civil society implementation agencies, whose experience with HIV/AIDS
programs andwhose general capacity vary considerably.
The Bank's supervision efforts inthe first year will focus on the following strategic areas.
ComprehensiveApproach to HIV/AIDS. The implementation o f a broad range o f HIV/AIDS
activities across many sectors by multiple entities at the national and local levels, with a
particular emphasis on scaling up existing programs and building-capacity, will require
consistent and sustained support and coordination, including learning from other MAP and
HIV/AIDS programsfrom around the world.
Ownership and Stakeholders. Experience has shown that the commitment and enthusiasm
shown by stakeholders during project preparation needs to be maintained during early project
implementation by accelerating the funding o f projects inboth the public sector and civil society.
Manuals have been prepared with stakeholders' involvement and will need to be adjusted inreal
time based on local realities. Extensive and regular field visits, and constant dialogue between
the national andthe Bank teams, together "learning by doing'' will be needed.
New Institutions. The CNMLS is designed to steer and orient rather than to control and
implement. Any new institution, however, implements its mission through actions. Supervision
will focus, in particular, on assisting the CNMLS and the National coordination units to: (a)
contract out key services and functions; and (b) empower the implementing agencies in the
public sector and civil society by allowing them to make decisions on program activities and to
participate inadjustingproject processes based on early lessons o f implementation.
Fiduciary Architecture. Financial management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and
implementation channels represent the core fiduciary responsibilities that need to be assessedand
enhanced during supervision. The selected arrangements are new for the DRC and will require
special attention duringimplementation.

Specific Arrangements
At least one Staffwith management responsibilities will be based inthe field and will work with
the core fiduciary team already in situ. In addition, the Team is discussing with other partners,
the possibility to have another donor-funded position at the Resident Mission. Last, UNAIDS has
already committed to assist implementation by joining Bank missions, ensuring constant
dialogue with other partners, and providing constant support to the national team.
 Objectives and Schedule of Missions
Duringthe first twelve months, implementationsupport will be shaped as follow:
  (i) formal`supervision' missions
     Three
  (ii)Regular, ad hoc visits from field-based staff, particularly the Financial Management and
      Procurement staff. They will be empowered to assist the project on a need basis so as to
      ensure efficiency and transparency o f fiduciary transactions
  (iii) UNAIDS/WorldBankmonitoring andevaluation supportunitinWashingtonwill
       The
      schedule at least two comprehensive missions. The first to help start-up the system and
      provide the necessary training and advice. The second, at the end o f the twelve months to
      assess performance and recommend adjustment. The national team, however, will be in
      constant contact with GAMET who will advice as needed
  (iv) The members o f the UNAIDS Thematic Group in the DRC will also assist the national
      team through, technical advice and brainstorming sessions, capacity building o f
      implementing agencies, and ad hoc reporting o f fields activities.
Thefirst formal mission will be scheduled at the onset o f implementation and will have for
objective to ensure operational readiness. The mission will review activity programs and
procurement plans, assist with contractual arrangements, help train new staff (particularly the
fiduciary staff), fine-tune operational and institutional arrangements, provide implementation
support to provincial units. The mission will also review the communicatiodinformation strategy
and ensure that technical support is available to all entities qualified to apply for funding from
the PMLS.
The second mission will focus on providing assistance to ensure that: (a) the Implementation
Manual has been adapted to early implementation experience; (b) existing programs are being
scaled up and funded, especially in core public sector ministries and civil society organizations
already working on HIV/AIDS; (c) capacity buildinghas started for agencies that require it; (d)
the coordination units are operating effectively; and (e) provincial programming is integrated and
coordinated with other partners interventions.
The third mission will focus on assisting the DRC to hold an annual review o f the project that
would involve donors, the UNAIDS Thematic Group and stakeholders in the country. The
review would (a) assess the performance o f the project during the first year o f implementation
andmake any necessary design adjustments; (b) preview the program o f activities for the second
year; and (c) ensure that appropriate fimding is available from the international community and
from local resources.

The Bank'sImplementationAssistance Effort
The joint UNAIDWWorld Bank progress review o f MAP in mid-2001 concluded that MAP
projects require support using multi-sectoral teams. The Bank preparation team will be carried
over into the first year of supervision. It i s expected that the supervision budget for the first 12
months will exceed the Bank norms, particularly, with respect to non-variable costs. Indeed, in
DRC, given the size o f the country and logistical difficulties, the cost o f visiting field activities i s
very high and requires time. Each mission is expected to last at least three weeks and will
comprise between four and six members. About 65 total staff weeks will be required for the first
year and sufficient non-variable costs should be guaranteed. Indicative cost o f supervision for the
first 12 months o f the project is estimated at US$250,000 and will be incorporated into the CD's
budget for FY05.
Technical skills required by a mission will depend on relevant implementation issues, the
necessary specialists are likely to include:
                   Firstmission: TL, procurement, financial, M&E, health, civil society expert
                   Second mission: TTL, civil society expert, education, and institutional
                   capacity expert.
                   Thirdmission: TTL, health, social, financial, procurement,
