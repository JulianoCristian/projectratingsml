Airports Development Project, closely interrelated, are to\n            eliminate capacity bottlenecks to traffic growth,\n            particularly for tourism and associated foreign exchange\n            earnings; raise the service quality of the Cairo\n            International Airport and Sham El Sheikh Airport to\n            international best practice standards; and promote efficient\n            private participation in airport management and airport\n            service delivery in a more competitive market. There are\n            three project components:  Component 1 constructs a third\n            terminal at Cairo International Airport and enabling works.\n            Component 2: constructs a new terminal at Sharm El Sheikh\n            Airport and enabling works. Component 3 strengthens sector\n            operations and environmental management."}, "docdt": "2004-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
