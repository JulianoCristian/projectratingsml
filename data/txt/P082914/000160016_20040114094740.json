It details expected adverse\n            environmental impacts and mitigation measures, the majority\n            of which will be incorporated in the project design. Further\n            mitigation measures to dispose of construction waste; and\n            minimize hazards to workforce and resident populations\n            during construction include the following: Use good site\n            practices, construct temporary noise barriers, relocate\n            equipment, reduce number of plant items and limit equipment\n            operating time, and require workers to wear protective gear\n            to reduce noise impacts. Dust suppression measures include\n            regular watering of exposed areas, site access and egress\n            control, development of a haulage route, restriction of\n            vehicle speed and exhaust, locating stockpiles far away from\n            sensitive areas and using impervious sheeting as covers, or\n            spraying with water or a suppression chemical. Maintain\n            evaporation ponds in site drainage to manage surface run\n            off, lock storage tanks to prevent spilled fuel oils, empty\n            and clean oil interceptors to prevent release into the storm\n            water drainage system, dispose of waste materials at an\n            approved storage site, use portable chemical toilets and\n            sewage holding tanks, and only handle and store contaminants\n            in designated areas and ensure that a spill management plan\n            is in place. To control excavated waste, construction waste,\n            and general refuse, use a waste management plan that\n            minimizes waste generated, reuses on-site materials,\n            segregates and recycles waste, and treats and disposes of\n            waste according to relevant regulations outlining procedures\n            for handling, collecting, removing, and disposing of waste.\n            Ensure that chemical waste is properly stored and contained,\n            using impervious, corrosive-free vessels (in capsulated\n            barrels  with cement), in well ventilated areas and removed\n            by licensed waste collectors and transported to licensed\n            waste facilities. Ensure public safety by gating access to\n            the construction site, reducing interaction between\n            construction and airport traffic during morning and\n            afternoon peak periods, and fencing to prevent accidental or\n            unauthorized entry. Parking and pedestrian movements will be\n            monitored to assess the need for added measures. Reduce\n            traffic congestion by using signage, enforcing illegal\n            parking rules, and completing a feasibility study to\n            evaluate different options, if needed."}, "docdt": "2003-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
