A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Country and Sector Issues

Inthe early 199Os, Egyptbeganmovingaway from central planninganddownsizing its massive
public sector. Between 1995 and 1999, the economy responded to the new market-oriented
environment and growth increasedto around five percent per annum (p.a.). Inmost recent years,
however, both internal and external shocks have combined to slow growth to around three
percent p.a. To promote development and curb unemployment, faster growth i s needed. To that
end, the Government of Egypt (GOE) policy is focused on promoting private sector
development, attracting more foreign direct investment and maximizing foreign exchange
earnings from tourism and exportable commodities. Air transport sector has a key role to play in
increased growth, but this role i s currently underminedby four factors.

Airport Capacity Bottlenecks. Close to 50 percent of Egypt's passenger traffic is handled at
Cairo International Airport (CAI). In2000, passenger traffic peaked at 8.9 million and has since
remained around 8.4 million. With a maximumrated capacity of nine million passengers, C A I
cannot absorb additional traffic without a rapid deterioration o f service standards. This i s
especially critical since 76 percent o fpassengers are international. Cargo traffic, which i s almost
entirely concentrated at CAI, stagnated at around 200,000 tons p.a. since 1999. For bothtraffic,
terminal and apron capacity constraints did influence growth in addition to extemal factors (e.g.,
foreign charter flights are no longer permitted to fly to CAI due to capacity constraints). In
contrast, the country's other international airports, which primarily serve tourism, experienced
average growth rates o f nearly 13 percent p.a. between 1993 and 2002, processing a total o f 8.9
million passengers in 2002. O f these airports, Sham El Sheikh (SSH) grew the fastest, now
handlingthe second largest tourist traffic inEgypt. Airport capacity nationwide is increasingly
short of needs andthe GOE i s giving ahighpriority to the airport extensionprogram.

A Legal and Institutional Framework in development. Sweeping sector reforms in the civil
aviation sector began in 2001 and are ongoing. The Ministry o f Civil Aviation (MCA) was
created in 2002 and entrusted with overall responsibility for the country's airports and civil
aviation matters. M C A is overseeing Egypt Air and its subsidiaries, as well as the Egyptian
Holding Company for Airports and Air Navigation (EHCAAN), which owns four affiliate
companies, including the: (i)Cairo Airport Company (CAC) created in 2002; (ii)Egyptian
Airport Company (EAC) created in 2001 to manage and develop other public airports; (iii)
National Air Navigation Services Company (NANSC);                 and (iv) Aviation Information
Technology Company (AVIT). The GOE's stated policy i s to commercialize the public
enterprises operating inthe sector through the EHCAAN as a first step towardprivatization. Law
No. 3 of 1997 madeprivate airport concessionspossible, and Law No. 93 o f 2003 grantedM C A
substantial pricing freedom subject to prior consultation with a Higher Council for the Pricingof
Services (HCPS). The thrust o freforms is sound andimplementation issues are being addressed.

           Institutionand capacity buildinginairport regulation i s neededto attract more private
           investments in airport infrastructure. Tendering, asset ownership, and assignment of
           rights to lenders are among constraints that only allowed signing o f two small
           concession contracts to date (Marsa Alem; El Alamin). The Organizational, Legal,



                                                 7

            Technical, Financial and Economic Regulations o f National and Local BOOT, BOT
            and BOO Projects issued inJuly 2003 address these constraints.

            As the largest user, service provider and concession holder (from ground-handling
            services to duty-free shops and hotels), EgyptAir (EA) can influence the aiport policy
            and compromise the level-playing field objective private competitors need and
            prevent CAC and EAC to earn a fair returnon assets at its disposal.

            Management information systems do not generate enough o f the financial and
            operational data that would make the airport sector easier to assess thereby
            enouraging private sector investments innew facilities.

Narrow RevenueBase. Except for CAI, airports were not profitable inthe 1990s, and untargeted
cross-subsidization was the norm. Even CAI's positive financial picture partly stemmed from
deferment o f     capital investments.    Airport tariffs in Egypt were, and remain, low by
international standards, and there was no pricing freedom until Law No. 93 o f 2003. Action is
still pending on tariff alignment with regional market levels that would make the project
financially viable. CAC will still need to strengthen marketing o f airport-based services and
facilities inorder to make commercial revenues commensurate with its large airport domain.

Regulated Air Transport Market. If liberalization is making progress for international flights
between Egypt, Africa and the Arab countries, constraining Air Service Agreements (ASA) still
regulate air transport relations with Europe and other major markets. Should Egypt Air become
more competitive, liberalization o f these key routes would also be possible, and prospects o f CAI
becoming a regional hub would brighten.

2. Rationale for Bank Involvement

In a deteriorating business climate for infrastructure concessions worldwide, private financing
for airport development inEgypt i s unlikelyinthe near future. Airport investments are overdue,
and public financing for the proposed new terminals is a valid alternative provided steps are
taken to remove obstacles to private participation inairport infrastructure. Bank involvement will
help ensure that necessary actions are taken, including those designed to develop competition
within and between airports through signing o f management contracts with private firms. In
addition, the Bank will:

            provide experience in financing large and complex transport infrastructure projects,
            andknowledge o fassociateddevelopment issues;
            ensure proper consideration o f environmental and social issues;
         a  enhance chances o f attracting high quality bids for private management contracts
            through transparent and predictable tendering, something highlyvalued by the GOE;
            provide specific technical expertise when needed, as exemplified by the Bank's
            assistance already extended inrelation to managing air cargo facilities at CAI.

3. Higher Level Objectivesto Which the ProjectContributes

Beyond transport, airports are effective engines o f economic growth with significant multiplier
effects. The Intemational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) estimates that every US$lOO o f
output from air transport generated demand three times as high, and that 100 air transport jobs
induced 610 jobs in other industries. Developing countries growth may depend even more on
efficient air transport, which cames up to forty percent o f their exports in value and (for some)
sustains tourism, now the world's largest industry (30 percent o f GNP andten percent o fjobs).

The project should, therefore, contribute to three higher level objectives:

            Employment generation Although direct employment is not expected to rise given
            the current excess staffing (around 2,260 passengers per staff for CAC), indirect
            employment opportunities would be created with the project through expanding
            airport traffic. A study in 1999 estimated indirect employment generated within
            CAI's area o f influence at 185,00Ojobs, risingto nearly 350,000 by 2020.

            Increasingforeign exchange earnings Tourism is one o f Egypt's largest sources o f
            foreign exchange. Intemational tourism injectedthe equivalent o f US$4.3 billion into
            the economy in2000, or an average o f US$780 per tourist up from US$3.0 billion in
             1996. Airports are the primarypoints o f entry for international tourists.

            Developing agricultural exports Two-thirds o f cargo traffic is export, most o fwhich
            is perishable and concentrated in CAI. Since 80 percent o f air cargo is carried by
            passenger planes, the project would have a direct impact. The project will also
            finance a strategic study on air cargo development. Removing capacity bottlenecks to
            air cargo expansion should give a boost to agriculture production and employment.

As such, the project is expected to support higher and sustained economic growth, a key
objective in the June 2001 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Egypt. It is consistent with
criteria set out in the CAS for Bank financing: (i) govemment commitment and support
                                                       strong
for a project; and (ii)  the Bank's adding value to an operation through its involvement. Both
criteria are met by the proposedproject. The CAS was reviewed by the Board prior to the events
of 9/11, when concessions were still the favored option for developing infrastructure. Since
then, investment flows to Egypt have declined, while the need for expanding transport facilities
has continued to rise. Finally, the project meshes well with the Bank's emerging Infrastructure
Action Plan, which calls for more responsiveness to client demands for infrastructure in light o f
the private sector's declining ability and interest infinancing public-purpose infrastructure.

3. Project Components

The proposed Airports Development Project (ADP) has three components.
       .
           Component 1:Construction o f a third terminal at Cairo InternationalAirport (TB3)
           and enabling works (US$485 million);
           Component 2: Construction o f a new terminal at Sharm El Sheikh Airport and
           enabling works (US$63 million);
           Component 3: Strengthening sector operations and environmental management
           (US$26.2 million).

For Cairo, the project covers the construction o f a multi-level terminal (TB3) that comprises a
concourse building, two finger piers and a link to the existing Terminal Building 2 (TB2).
Aircraft parking aprons with airbridge equipped stands plus remote stands, access roads from the
existing highway system to the terminal and ancillary facilities are also included. When
integrated with TB2, the new terminal will have a capacity o f 14 million passenger p.a. (11
million for TB3 alone), o f which nine million will be international traffic. An enabling works
contract has been signed to prepare the work site. The construction o f TB3 will be carried out
under what is called the Main Contract. The construction is expected to span 30 months. The
CAC also intends to construct a 4-km runway (US$66 million), which the Bankwill not finance.
For Sham El Sheikh, an enabling works contract is also under execution for site preparation.
The project covers construction and equipment o f a new terminal designed to accommodate 4.5
million passengers p.a. The Bank will only finance the terminal. Upon completion, the new
terminals will be privately managed.

The technical assistance is comprised o ftwo components:

       (a) The Government financed component (US$17.9 million) covers contracts with
           engineering and legal consultants to advise the airport companies throughout project
           implementation, plus a contract with a French investment bank to prepare tendering
           for the private airport management contract and assist inthe selection of firms; and

       (b) The Bank financed component (US$8.3 million, including $3.5 million on
           equipment) will finance studies, advisory services and equipment to: (i)     prepare a
           national airport master plan; (ii)  prepare an action plan for gradual air transport
           liberalization; (iii)
                               define a strategy for reorganization and development o f air cargo;
           (iv) deploy air quality and noise monitoring equipment and establish the
           environmental units inC A I and SSH; and (v) buildmanagement capacities (including
           provision o f IT equipment) at EHCAAN, CAC and EAC related to commercial,
           financial, regulatory andmonitoring functions.

4. Lessons Learned and Reflected in Project Design

       A strong commitment from counterpart authorities is key to consistent project
       implementation and achievement o fproject development objectives; it i s verified here.




                                                11

        Completion o f key steps early on improves quality at entry and reduces uncertainty (the
        legal framework i s inplace for the most part; advance contracting for works is ongoing).
        Smaller, but practical steps with a good probability of success are more effective in
        bringing market liberalization to fruition than would aggressive and riskier actions that
        could only stir up opposition (the loan conditionality derives from suchprinciples).
        Complex operations require close interaction between the Bank and a strong project team
        on the Borrower's side. The international technical and legal advisors hiredby the airport
        companies and effective Project Management Unit (PMU) arrangements will allow for it.
        The quality o fmonitoring andreporting systems i s always essential, and the work already
        carried out by EHCAAN in this area, plus their commitment to set up dedicated task
        forces, should produce good and timely reporting. The PMU arrangements improve
        prospects for good implementation.

5. Alternatives ConsideredandReasonsfor Rejection

Combining Government financing o f the new terminals at CAI and SSH with private operation
o fthe new facilities is the preferredoption. Other alternatives considered were:

            Tendering a management contract that would require private financing o f the
            terminal's equipment in order to strengthen performance incentives by asking the
            investor to put its capital at risk. The added complication of structuring a contract
            that should guarantee a fair return on capital invested and the possibility o f having
            effective incentivesput ina private management contract led to reject this option.

            A Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) scheme was also considered, but this, too, was
            rejected given the adverse infrastructure concession market climate in the world and
            inthe regionas verified byAlgeria which failed to sign a contract for completionand
            operation o f the Algiers airport terminal. The incomplete legal framework and gaps in
            the available financial andoperational data also justified dropping this approach.

            Financing the reorganization and development o f CAI's Cargo Village in the
            operation might have strengthened the project's economics. This component however
            was not ready for implementation and the project will only help instrategy definition.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. PartnershipArrangements

The GOE has not indicated an interest inseeking partnership arrangements with other donors on
the project. However, the airports at Hurghada, Luxor, Aswan and Abu Simbel are also slated
for development and to be privately-operated under management contracts. Should these plans
go forward, substantial investment would be needed, and it is likely that other donors, including
the European Investment Bank, would partner with the GOE. Should donors become actively
involved, coordination mechanisms would need to be established not only to harmonize views on
the sector, but to organize investments and develop complementary assistance packages for
modernizing affected institutions and the sector's management.          The International Finance
Corporation has also discussed potential partnerships with the GOE.




                                                  12

2. InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

The Project will be implementedbetween July 2004 and December 2008, and June 30,2009 is
the Loan's scheduled closing date. EHCAAN will be the implementing agency. E H C A A N
throughits affiliates, CAC andEAC, will beresponsible for implementingthis Project.

There i s a LoanAgreement betweenthe Bank and the Government o f Egypt (Ministry ofForeign
Affairs), and a Project Agreement between the Bank and EHCAAN. By virtue o f a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement (SLA) between the GOE and the EHCAAN, the GOE will on-lend the Bank
loan proceeds funds to EHCAAN. Only technical assistance and part o f goods, will be financed
out o fthe Special Account, as direct payment procedures will apply to the civil works.

To clarify the respective roles o f CAC and EAC in project implementation, Contractual
Agreementss (IA) should be in place between EHCAAN and each o f the affiliates, before the
deadline for the submission o f bids for the two main works contracts. The IAs, to be reviewed
and found acceptable by the Bank, will detail procurement and payment processes and other
responsibilities for implementing the different activities as well as key staffing requirements.
These I A s will also specify financial arrangements between E H C A A N and CAC and EAC,
respectively, to help EHCAAN service its debt under the SLA. These I A s will be signed no later
thanJune 30,2004.

A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be established within the EHCAAN. Its chieffunctions
will be to program, collect information and data, monitor and evaluate progress, coordinate and
advise on all fiduciary matters, maintain project financial accounts, manage the Special Account,
submit replenishmentrequests andRequests for Direct Payment to the Bank, and prepare reports,
includingfinancial monitoring reports (FMRs). Inaccordance with the aforementionedIAs with
CAC and EAC, the PMU will coordinate and supervise project implementation, verify
compliance with agreed procedures. Payments due to contrators, suppliers and consultants will
come from funds held by the EHCAAN, upon receiving appropriate instructions from CAC and
EAC. EHCAAN will be responsible for the procurement o f the seven TA packages.

A Project Steering Committee, to be chairedby EHCAAN, will be set up to oversee the work o f
the PMU. Representatives will include key stakeholders inthe project, such as from the Ministry
o f Civil Aviation, the Ministryof Finance, and EHCAAN's affiliates. A comprehensive Project
Implementation Plan (PIP), including the format o f monthly and quarterly progress reports, has
been finalized by EHCAAN.

The Steering Committee will be established no later than June 1, 2004. The Head o f the PMU
will be appointed no later than May 31, 2004 whereas the full PMU organization will be
operational before Effectiveness.. Two financial officers will be appointed by CAC and E A C no
later than September 30, 2004.




                                                13

Environmental Units will be established at CAC no later than July 1, 2004 and at E A C no later
thanAugust 1, 2004 to monitor implementationof the Environmental ManagementPlan (EMP).
Needed capacity buildingwill be achieved through Bank-financed TA.

3. Monitoringand Evaluation of Outcomes/Results

Data and statistics for monitoring performance and updating indicators will be gathered by
EHCAAN, CAC and EAC. EHCAAN has committed to establish a task force to develop
methodologies, instruments, and report to the PMU. Evaluation o f the outcomes will be
supported by the taskforces, or outside technical expertise, if needed. Monthly reports on the
progress o f works, quarterly progress reports will be submitted to the Bank, and a mid-term
review will be undertaken in 2006. An Implementation Completion Report will be completed
within six months o fproject closing.

4. Sustainability

The Borrower's commitment to project objectives is strong and evidenced by written statements
and actions, including the hiring o f renowned international consulting firms to serve as Project
Manager and Financial Advisor to the Borrower, ensuring that a cost-effective and timely project
delivery. While not perfect, legislation has already been passed and offers a suitable foundation
for effective development inthe sector. Other conditions for sustainability include:
        .
            Good airport preventive and corrective maintenance: it will be provided for in the
        ..  private management contracts. CAC and EAC will build their own capacities to
            ensure that private management companies perform well.
            Highstandards of airport security: they will be detailed inthe management contracts.
            Cost and Market-based airport pricing : the pricing freedom introduced by Law No.
            93 will allow for it once the Higher Council for Pricing o f Services is established.
        =   Competition in andfor the airport service market. Technical assistance and capacity
            building under the project will broaden its scope and strengthen the airport
            companies' monitoring o f performance by private operators and lessees. For ground-
        .   handling, new companies will be licensed. The private airport management contracts
            will allow for yardstick competition between the hired firms.
           Air transport ZiberaZization-Through an "Open Skies" policy, C A I might become an
            international hub and the GOE Statement o f Sector Policy (SSP) supports its gradual
            implementation. The sooner it happens, the faster airport traffic will develop.

   As with all "A" ratedprojects, there is the potential for environmental andor social controversy
   as a result o f the project. Possible issues associated with the new facility at C A I (TB3) include:
   (i) selection;(ii) andairpollution;(iii)
        site                 noise                               management o f solid and liquid waste; and (iv)
   the capacity o f local institutions to monitor and enforce environmental covenants. To lessen the
   potential for negative impact, Environmental Management Plans (EMP) describe mitigating
   measures to be taken duringproject construction and operation o f the new terminals. Inaddition,
   training is provided under the project to build local capacity inthese matters.

D. APPRAISALSUMMARY
1. EconomicandFinancialAnalysis

                                   A.      Economic Analysis

Cairo InternationalAirport (TB3). As detailed inAnnex 9, the economic analysis hinges on the
following major assumptions:
           Without the project, overall traffic would stagnate, and the minimal growth of
           domestic traffic would be at the expense o f tourist traffic. Incontrast, traffic would
           grow annually by 3.5 percent whenTB3 is completed.
           Withthe project, the ten millionpassengerswould behandledundermuchimproved
           conditions; the analysis accounts for time savings inrelationto business trips.
           For the incrementaltraffic made possible by the project, benefits are includedand
           calculated at the market-basedairport tariff.
           Withthe project, commercial revenue is expectedto increaseto US$5 perpassenger
           from development of facilities and better managementby the private firms
           Tourist traffic would expandwith the project, as foreign charterswould againbe
           allowed to landinCairo, andEgyptwould increaseits net foreign exchange earnings.
                                           -.-
Based on the above assumptions, the economic rate o f return (ERR) i s 16.2 percent, and the net
present value (NPV), discounted at ten percent, i s US$252 million. The sensitivity analysis
basedon switching values confirmed that the project economics were robust (Annex 9).




                                                16

Sham El Sheikh Airport. SSH has become a thriving seaside resort on the Sinai Peninsula.
Traffic exploded from less than half a million passengers in 1994 to nearly three million in2002.
Current capacity constraints are severe and the growth in traffic can only resume at trend pace
once the new terminal i s built. The economic analysis follows a similar pattern to that o f CAI,
with some variation incapturingtraffic specificities (SSH is mostly usedby tourists).
         0  Traffic growth is expected to be faster than in Cairo (5 percent p.a. for international
            traffic and 2.5 percent p.a. for domestic traffic) and traffic creation is expected after
            the terminal is commissioned. Without the project, traffic would stagnate.
         0  No time savings are assumed on the "without project" traffic, since tourism is the
            main motive for trips to SSH.
            Benefits are calculated on incrementaltraffic, as for Cairo.
         0  Benefits from tourism are also included but account for traffic specificities.
         0  The commercial revenue base would also increase, but to a more modest level.
The ERR computed on this basis i s 28 percent and the NPV, discounted at ten percent, is
US$122 million. Given the highrate o f return, a sensitivity analysis was not deemed necessary.

                                      B.      Financial Analysis

Past and Current Financial Performance o f CAC.           Through the 1990s, CAI was the only
profitable airport. Financial statements for FY2001thru FY2003 were reviewed showing that:
         0  After-tax income rose from LE59 millioninFY2001 to LE68 million inFY2003;
         0  Airport tariffs are low by regional standards, especially for passenger departure fees;
         0  Commercial revenues amounted to less than US$2 per passenger;
         0  Despite overstaffing, labor costs as a percentage o f operating expenses decreased
            slightly from 25 percent to 24 percent close to the world average o f some 25 percent;
         0  CAC's profitability was enhanced by deferring maintenance and investment (many
            assets are fully depreciated andthe company's indebtedness is limited).
Future Financial Performance o f CAC. The capacity o f CAC to generate cash will more than
double inFY2004, as international and domestic passenger departure fees are expected to rise to
US$15 (LE92) and US$3 (LE18) respectively. A new fee will also be introduced for use o f
weighing counters. The new tariff is expected to be implemented starting inthe first semester o f
2004. Since two-thirds o f revenues are from US$ denominated charges, revenues inLEwill rise
inrelation to the expected depreciation of the local currency, and further tariff increases would
not likely be needed until project completion.         Detailed assumptions used in the financial
projection and financial tables are found inAnnex 9. Since it will provide E H C A A Nwith hnds
to repay its portion o f the Bank Loan, CAC should maintain its healthy financial status which
two financial ratios will help monitor from FY07 onward:
                a debt service coverage o fno less than 1.3, beginningin2007; and
                a current ratio o fno less than 1.O, beginningin2007.

Past and Current Financial Performance of EAC. EAC was established in 2001 and has had
difficulties collecting and consolidating financial data from all airports it owns. Therefore, the
financial analysis i s limited to EAC's FY2003 financial statements, the first ones deemed
reliable. As shown inAnnex 9, EAC earned an after-tax income o f LE12 millionin2003.




                                                  17

Future Financial Performance of EAC. Beginning in January 2004, EAC's future financial
performance will be enhanced by the increase in tariffs. Unlike CAC, however, EAC will face
rapidly rising development costs inrelation to expansion investments at Luxor, Borg El Arab,
Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikh Airports. Operating at lower costs, the company will be able to
generate cash flows commensurate with its financial charges from operations and borrowings.
Annex 9 provides the summary financial statements supporting this conclusion. The financial
analysis was extended to show how the proposed investment at Sharm El Sheikh Airport would
affect EAC's financial position showing that Sham El Sheikh should generate enough cash to
pay for the investment and further contribute sizeable funds to EAC.        Since it will provide
EHCAAN with funds to repay its portion o f the Bank Loan, E A C should maintain its healthy
financial status which two financial ratios will help monitor from FY07 onward:
                a debt service coverage o f no less than 1.3, beginningin2007; and
                a current ratio o fno less than 1.O, beginning in2007.

Future financial performance o f EHCAAN. It will hinge on the performance o f its four
affiliates which contribute a portion o f their revenues and their income toward coverage o f
EHCAAN's management costs. CAC and E A C are the largest contributors and their good
financial prospects give assurance that they will sustain that role in the future. NANSC i s also
expected to remain highlyprofitable. AVIT results will also make positive contributions albeit o f
small size. Annex 9 shows EHCAAN's projectedcash flow statement over 2003-2009.

2. Technical

The detailed engineering design for the new terminal in Cairo (TB3) is based on a concept
common to modem airports and includes state-of-the-art equipment and electromechanical
systems. It was completed by a reputable engineering firm with prior experience in airport
design. A Bank financed consultant reviewed the bidding documents and found them to form a
good basis for tendering. The review also recommendedto verify that I C A O standards are met.

For SSH, the same engineering firm was hired to prepare the preliminary design which was
reviewedby a Bank-financed consultant whose recommendation was conveyed to the Borrower
for appropriate andtimely action. The detaileddesign is inprogress.

3. Fiduciary

Procurement. An international consultant well versed in Bank-financed projects worldwide and
familiar with Bank procurement procedures, was hired as Project Manager by CAC and EAC to
assist them throughthe procurement process and to supervise construction under their respective
project investments. The contractual agreements between EHCAAN-CAC and EHCAAN-EAC
will detail procurement and payment processes and other responsibilities for implementing the
different activities. This will allow CAC and EAC to sign contracts with the two winning
contractors. Also, these agreements will allow E H C A A N to issue withdrawal applications to the
Bank to makedirect payments to the contractors on behalfo f CAC and EAC.

CAC and EAC will sign contracts for their respective project investments, while EHCAANwill
sign all contracts under the technical assistance components. The decision-making process,



                                                  18

especially with regard to contract awards, will be defined inthe EHCAAN-CAC and EHCAAN-
EAC contractual agreements and will be reviewed closely by the Bank as part o f its due
diligence responsibilities, in order to ensure efficient implementation and fiduciary soundness.
Fiduciary responsibilities held by each company will be specified in the Agreements they will
sign with E H C A A Nby no later than June 30,2004.

Procurement o f works and goods financed under the Loan will be carried out inaccordance with
the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised
January and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999). The Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents for Prequalification for Works, Procurement o f Works, Procurement o f Goods and
the Standard BidEvaluation Forms will be usedinthe procurement o fworks and goods.

Procurement o f goods and works will be carried out using International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) for the two contracts for works and the contracts for goods. The following procurement
methods for selection o f consultants will be used: (i)Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)
will be used for selection o f consultant services with value o f contracts estimated at more than
US$lOO,OOO equivalent under the TA component. (ii)      Individual Consultants will be selected in
accordance with paragraphs 5.1 to 5.3 ofthe Guidelines.

The PMU staff will include a Procurement Coordinator (PC) whose responsibilities will deal
primarily with the guidance and monitoring functions o f EHCAAN vis-a-vis its two affiliates in
the context o f this Project.   CAC and EAC shall each appoint a Procurement Officer with
qualifications experience and terms o f reference acceptable to the Bank, for the duration o f the
Project, to coordinate with the PMU at E H C A A N and to ensure that the procurement o f works
under Parts A and B and goods under Part C of the Project is conducted as per the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines.

Financial Management. An assessment o f the financial management arrangements for EHCAAN,
CAC, and EAC was carried out to determine whether the financial management arrangements for
the Project are acceptable to the Bank. The assessment examined the three entities' financial
management systems (FMS) to ensure that they possess a sound system that is capable o f
capturing, summarizing, recording, and reporting its transactions in an accurate and timely
manner. Certain weaknesses were noted, such as manual accounting and reporting systems, lack
o f experience in implementing Bank financed projects, and reliance on the Central Auditing
Organization (CAO) in performing annual audits. The assessment concluded that the financial
management systems did not meet the Bank's minimum requirements.                     As such, the
establishment o f a fully functional project FMS, including the installation o f accounting
hardware and software capable o f recording the project's financial transactions and generating
financial management reports (FMRs) and annual financial statements, and the appointment o f a
qualified Finance Officer familiar with Bank guidelines, is a Condition o f Effectiveness. Because
the first two components will be implemented by CAC and EAC, the reliability o f the reports
generated from the PMUwill depend on the control environment inboth companies, and as such,
qualified finance officers will be hiredby CAC and E A C no later than September 30,2004.

To provide assurance that the issues identified above will be mitigated, the following measures,
which will be the responsibility o f the PMU, have been incorporated into the project's design: (i)



                                                19

establishing a PMU and staffing it with qualified individuals; (ii)creating a competent, qualified,
and adequately staffed financial management unit(s); (iii) up automated accounting and
                                                             setting
reporting systems; (iv) issuingquarterly FMRs; (v) contracting private external auditors; and (vi)
close monitoring by Bank staff, especially during the first year o f implementation.           The
E H C A A N has also recruited an international firm to upgrade its overall financial management
capabilities as well as CAC's and EAC's. It will ultimately enhance the Project's overall control
environment and March 31,2007 is the target date for completion o f this upgrading. A Special
Account will be established at a commercial bank.

4. Social

Three Land Acquisition Assessments were prepared for the project (two for TB3 and one for
SSH). The results show that the sites designated for the construction o f a third terminal and an
additional runway at C A I are state owned, have been fenced for the last twenty years, and legally
transferred to CAC. The hture site o f the third terminal is presently used for public parking, and
construction o f an alternative parking site i s underway. The new runway site is free o f any
economic activity. Both sites are located within CAC's overall property and are free of claims.
As for the new terminal at Sham El Sheikh, the landis state property legally transferred to EAC.
It is fenced, adjacent to the existing terminal, and surrounded by more land belonging to the
EAC. Presently, the land is not used for any economic activity and there are no claims on it.
OPBP 4.12 relatedto Involuntary Resettlement will not be triggeredfor bothproposed sites.

OP 4.10 relatedto indigenous peoples andcultural property is not applicable.

Within the framework o f the Environmental Assessments, independent Social Assessments
(SoA) were conducted for both TB3 and SSH. The results o f the SoAs show that overall,
respondents have a positive opinion o f the project, and acknowledge the value added,
particularly from increased business and improved infrastructure and services. However, some
concems were registered over increased noise and the potential for job losses.          Mitigation
measures to address elevated noise levels, which include the deployment o f noise monitoring
equipment, the adoption o f ICAO standards for landing and takeoff procedures, and managing
landings and take offs between runways to minimize noise at night have been included in the
EMPs. Proper implementation o fthese measures will significantly lessen the impacts. The new
runway will be located further away from built-up urban areas, and its impact is expected to be
limited. Interms o fjob losses, most existingjobs will be transferred to the new terminals once
operational and it is expected that traffic growth induced by the Project will create newjobs.

5. Environment

The Project has been classified as Category A, as project works and the new runway in C A I will
produce noise, and air pollutionimpact from that could be significant for residential areas around
the airports. Other potential impacts include road traffic congestion. The project will also
generate a few benefits (e.g. improved waste management and implementation o f noise and air
quality monitoring programs). The EA reportswere prepared inaccordance with OP 4.01.




                                                 20

The EIAs examined project alternatives and the new runway, and identified the main impacts
resulting from the socio-economic, biological and physical environment. Scoping sessions and
public consultations were also conducted during the different phases o f the EA preparations.
Expected impacts, mitigating measures and related implementation costs (US$3.20 million
overall), responsibility for financing and implementing those measures, and for monitoring
arrangements during the pre-construction, construction, and operational phases are defined in
detailed EMPs (Annex 10).

Final Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for C A I and SSH were disclosed inEgypt and at
the World Bank's InfoShop on November 26, 2003. A comprehensive executive summary
covering the two components and third runway was prepared and disclosed inEgypt (inArabic)
and at the InfoShop (in English) on November 26, 2003. The final EIAs, which were reviewed
and approved by the EgyptianEnvironmentalAffairs Agency (EEAA) on December 9,2003 and
December 21,2003, also satisfied the requirement ofEgypt's Environmental Law No. 4/1994.

TA is provided under the Project to implement the environmental and social mitigation measures
inthe EMPs, including capacity buildingat CAC and SSHto help monitor theirimplementation.
Environmental units will be established at CAC and EAC no later than July 1, 2004 and August
 1, 2004 respectivelyto ensure smooth and complete implementation ofthe EMPs.

Traffic

Cairo International Airport (CAI) anchors a national system comprised o f 24 airports, ten o f
them open to international traffic. Close to 50 percent ofthe country's airport traffic is handled
there, with a large proportion o f tourists. Since 2000, passenger traffic at CAI has remained at
around 8.5 million passengers p.a. As its overall capacity i s only about 9 million passenger
annually, hrther traffic growth can only accelerate deterioration o f already mediocre service
standards. Traffic at other international airports soared from 3.3 million passengers in 1993 to
9.8 million in 2002, an average growth o f 13 percent p.a. O f 2002's total, around 9.5 million
passengers (over 95 percent), were handled at Sharm El Sheikh, Hurghada, Luxor, Aswan,
Alexandria and Abu Simbel Airports. Tourism has been the principal driver behind the rapid
growth, and new airport facilities are required to efficiently manage this increase. With close to
three million passengers in 2002, Sham El Sheikh (SSH) has largely exceeded its maximum
capacity o f 1.8 million passenger p.a. The GOE i s giving its airport expansion program a
justifyably highpriority and, because o f the substantial financing needs that will be required, the
authorities are seeking funding, including from the private sector when available to finance and
operate other airports.

LegalandRegulatoryFramework

The civil aviation sector hasbeen undergoing a reorganization since 2001. Commercialization o f
public enterprises and private sector participation in airport infrastructure are key objectives o f
the reform. A reviewo fthe mainrelevant laws anddecrees follows.

Private Sector Participation (PSP) inAirport Infrastructure

       Law No. 3 o f 1997, also known as the "Airport Concession Law" (AC Law), is
       comprised o f only six Articles exempting airports from old laws governing infrastructure
       concessions (Laws No. 129 of 1947 and No. 61 o f 1958), which were restrictive to the
       point o f deterring private concessions. Since 1997, several airpofi concessionshave been
       tendered, but only two were signed and implemented for development o f Marsa Alam
       and El Alamin Airports. Law No. 3 o f 1997 is silent on some aspects important to the
       rights ofparties to a concession contract.

       The AC Law does not address land ownership issues, and public domain rules apply to
       airport concessions. A concession holder cannot normally own airport assets, including
       land development and buildings erected on it, which deprives lenders o f collateral rights
       and results inless favorable financing terms. There are ways around this problem (e.g. an
       usuhct agreement) to give the developer quasi-ownership o f land acquired, as well as
       full ownership of airport buildings by the concession holder who can then mortgage
       them. Interpretation o f concession agreements i s based on the Civil Code, and other
       basic laws which creates some uncertainty, especially as the established doctrine of the
       Administrative Court seems at odds with provisions o f the AC law. Issues not addressed
       by the AC Law could cause lengthy and complex debates and negotiations among



                                                22

       investors, lenders and the Airport Authority, thereby increasing transaction costs. For
       investors to benefit from a transparent contracting environment, detailed regulations for
       application o fthe AC law were therefore needed.

    u  Conditions for tendering airport concessions are not specified in the AC Law except for
       its call for competition and transparency. The general practice has been to comply with
       Law No. 89 o f 1998 (the "Tender Law") even though commercial companies like CAC
       and EAC are exempted from it. Law No. 89 i s not adapted to concessions for which
       different rules should be considered.

Meant to correct above-describedgaps inthe PSP legal framework for airports, a Decree on the
Organizational, Legal, Technical, Financial and Economic Regulations o f National and Local
BOOT, BOT and BOO Projects were issued in July 2003. Furthermore, the Sector Policy
Statement reaffirms that EHCAAN and its subsidiaries are not bound by Law 89/1998 but can
instead have their own procurement Bylaws. Nonetheless, the July 2003 Decree needs further
review and clarification before the conclusion that it addresses all issues can be reached. These
aspects will be an important part o f the Bank's dialogue with the GOE during project
implementation.

Sector and Corporate Governance
    .
       Law No. 28 o f 1981, as amended, provides the general framework governing civil
       aviation. Presidential Decree No. 56 o f 2002 established the Ministry o f Civil Aviation
       (MCA), entrusting it with all responsibilities pertaining to air transport and airports,
       including those previously held by the General Authority for Civil Aviation, which was
       abrogated a few months later. The reform reflects the higher priority given to the sector

       Law No. 203 o f 1991 set the stage for corporatizing public sector entities, two o f which
       are overseen by MCA: (i)      the Egypt Air Holding Company, created by Presidential
       Decree in 2002, owns six affiliate firms (Egypt Air and its former five subsidiaries
       dealing with air cargo, charters, ground-handling and maintenance); and (ii)     Egyptian
       Holding Company for Airports and Air Navigation (EHCAAN), which was created by
       Presidential Decree in 2001 with four affiliates: (a) the Cairo Airport Company (CAC),
       created in 2002 to manage and operate Cairo International Airport; (b) the Egyptian
       Airport Company (EAC), which manages and operates all airports except Cairo, Marsa
       Alem and A1 Alamin (two recent "Build-Operate-Transfer" schemes); (c) the National
       Air NavigationServices Company (NANSC), created in2001 to manage and operate air
       traffic control and related functions; and (d) the Aviation Information Technology
       Company (AVIT), created in 2002, oversees and operates information technology,
       includingits supporting facilities and equipment.

               EA'Spublic ownership and its importance as an airport user raise real or perceived
               risks that it will receive preferential treatment and distort competition in the market.
               Levelling the playing field for all airport users is a key condition for balanced PSP
               development inairports and optimization o f financial returns on airport assets.

Pricing and Funding

Law No. 93 o f June 2003 replacing Law No. 119 o f 1983 introduced a new tariff structure and
pricing freedom consistent with the objective o f corporatizing the airport sector (in the past,
budgets and tariff had to be approved by the Parliament) and reorganized airport cross-
subsidization.

Articles 16 and 21 o f the new law give the M C A authority to set airport charges. Article 17
empowers the Minister to grant partial or full exemption o f fees under conditions yet to be
specified. Article 36 gives the Minister freedom to increase tariff rates within a 50 percent limit.
Airport pricing decisions are subject to prior consultation with a new body, the Higher Council
for the Pricing o f Services (HCPS), which will be created by Presidential decree. Potential
issues include:


          9    HCPS should be established undertransparent conditions ensuring that advice is
               competent, evenhanded and independent from the ministry;

               Any exemptionmustbe givenunder conditions that would provide equal treatment to
               all users, foreign and local; and

          9    Article 19 calls for payment of compensation by a foreign airline when authorized to
               carry passengers that an "entitled" airline (namely Egypt Air) cannot carry for lack o f
               spare capacity.

Airport tariffs in Egypt are low by international comparison, a fact documented by many
studies'.      A 1999 study2 compared Egypt with Tunis, Dakar, Abidjan and Nairobi, and
established that passenger fees, as well as landing fees, inEgypt were the lowest o f those airports
included inthe survey. The economic analysis o f the TB3 project contains another set o f recent
comparisons with airports in the Middle East that led to the same conclusion. A Dutch study
carried out in 20013 stated that with the exception o f Cairo International Airport, Egyptian
airports at the end o f the 1990s were loss-making. Cross-subsidization balanced national airport
finances, with revenues collected by the Government and redistributed according to priority
needs. The project's financial viability hinges on a substantial tariff increase, and the Minister of
Civil Aviation is reviewing a request to boost the average revenue per passenger in Cairo from

about US$4 at present to close to US$18. The tariff increase is expected to be effective soon
after establishment ofthe HCPS.

Revenue from commercial sources andrentals i s underdeveloped. Typically, concession fees are
based on a percent o f turnover beyond a minimum with a minimum lump sum due if it is not
reached. In many cases, CAC only collects the guaranteed lump sum and, overall, the total
commercial revenue amounted to less than US$2 per passenger in2003. This has to do with the
limited space currently available in Cairo, and with the fact that EA, the largest occupant o f
commercial space, pays too little. Construction of TB3 would address the lack of space issue,
while awarding concessions through competitive bidding and including performance incentives
incontracts would address the other issue.

Part I11of Law No. 93 creates a "Fund for the Development and Support o f Civil Aviation"
(FDSCA) as a legal entity reporting to the Minister o f Civil Aviation (Article 24).                  FDSCA
collects a fixed share o f proceeds generated by fees, as stated in Law No. 93. Inparticular, 30
percent o f airport charges on passengers and aircrafts and 0.3 percent of the revenue earned by
E H C A A N accrue to FDSCA. Subsidization of air transport (e.g. it may apply to domestic air
transport maintained for reasons of public interest), assistance to companies under the MCA in
exceptional cases, payment incentives to enhance staff performance, funding of social activities
benefiting the sector staff and funding o f airport upgrading are among many possible
applications of funds. Board members will be appointedbythe Prime Minister.

FDSCA is expected to contribute 55 percent o f its total revenue from CAC to the Project
(namely, CAC will only transfer a net 16.5 percent o f collected user fees). This arrangement will
last at least through 2028.

Air Transport Market Regime

The GOE's international aviation policy is reflected in Air Service Agreements (ASA's), which
are signed with other countries. The GOE has concluded some 117 ASA's, o f which Egypt Air
effectively operates around 51. Typically, ASA's deal with international scheduled services
between two contracting states and contain provisions regarding carrier designation, traffic
rights, including points o f entry, frequency, capacity and tariffs. They have been used inthe past
to protect national flag carriers against foreign competition by restraining supply. Air transport
deregulation spearheaded by the United States inthe 1980s producedan explosion indemand for
air transport, and led an increasingnumber o f countries to promote "Open Skies" policies.

Egypt's stated policy is to gradually liberalize air transport. This started in 1988 with the signing
o f the Yamoussoukro Decision (later amended in 1994), which technically liberalized air
transport to the 5th Freedom in all 52 African States and is being implemented, albeit at a
relatively slow pace.        Signing of the COMESA Treaty (Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa) in 2000 provided for 3rd, 4th and 5thfreedom rights4 among 21 East and South




 The 5" freedom right is the rightto carry passengersbetweentwo countriesby an airline ofa thirdcountry on a
 route with OiD inits home country.

 African countries5. In November 1998, the Council o f Arab Transport Ministers adopted a
 program for gradual liberalization o f their common air transport market, and according to the
 MCA, Arab carriers will be granted 5th freedom rights from 2006 onward. With regard to
  European countries and the United States, liberalization still has a long way to go in that ASAs
  contain restrictive assignments o f rights between designated carriers, and Egypt Air is the sole
 beneficiary on the Egyptian side.

 For charters, liberalization is more advanced as foreign charters can fly freely to Hurghada,
  Sham El Sheikh and Saint Catherine.            However, they are not allowed to land at Cairo, a
 restriction imposed by the current saturation o f this airport's capacity.                   Once TB3 i s
 commissioned to traffic, general access rights to Cairo will be reinstated.

 For domestic traffic and notwithstanding the fact that private airlines exist in Egypt and that
 several o f them were issued licenses for provision o f regular air transport services, EA enjoys a
 defacto monopoly on scheduled services. The private sector airlines confine their activity to
 charter and air taxi services. It appears that market constraints are the main reason why they do
not operate scheduled flights. A low load-factor combined with low tariff make them
unprofitable. EA is indeed losing money on its domestic network and cancelled most loss-
making services inthe recent past. Inshort, the lack of competition on the domestic air transport
market is less a problem o f restrictive regulations (except for those on pricing that are not
 discriminatory) than one o f market size andaffordability o f fares.

 The GOE's international aviation policy toward the West partly insulates EA from competition,
 as it faces the challenge o f a deteriorating intemational air transport market. The ongoing
 commercialization o f EA should make it capable o f coping with more competition. Promoting
 Cairo as an international hub entails developing its role for all traffic to and from Egypt. The
project's outcome would be enhanced if liberalization o f the air sector continues.

CONSTRUCTIONOF THIRDTERMINAL AT CAIRO (TB3)

When completed, TB3 will have a total capacity o f 11.0 million passengers(5.0 milliondomestic
and 6.0 million international passengers), compared to the current 9.5 million for Terminals 1
and 2. At completion, TB3 will be integratedwith Terminal 2, which i s presently usedprimarily
by foreign airlines. Terminal 1, which has EgyptAir as its main user, will continue to receive
domestic andregional flights. The TB3 will consist of:


        0   one new terminalbuilding;
            one concourse;

        0   two fingers;
        0   three skyways - two connecting the concourse with each finger, andone connecting
            Terminal2 with TB3; and
        0   electromechanical systems and equipment.

The new terminal will consist o f three levels and have a built-up area o f 164,000 square meters.
The halls, which will measure320 meters by 150meters, will beused for processing arrivingand
departingpassengers, baggagehandling, andcommercial activities. TB3's two fingers will have
extendable capacity, but will initially have fifteen swing gates. The gates will be provided with
fifteen contact stands that can be increased to twenty for small aircraft and 47 remote stands.
Ancillary facilities will include an apron control tower, power plant for HVAC and electrical
equipment, two water pumpingstations, and an 18,400 squaremeterwater reservoir.

To better accommodate an aggressive construction schedule, two packages o f works have been
planned. The first i s an "enabling package," which will proceed inadvance o f the main contract
and involve a local contractor to prepare the site by puttingup fences, moving utility networks
providing temporary access roads and parking facilities, and preparing a laydown area for
equipment and supplies. The enabling package i s estimated to have a duration of between eight
and nine months, will cost about USS9 million, will be tendered locally, and financed by the
National Investment Bank o f Egypt. The second package, or main contract for works and
equipment, will be completed in 30 to 32 months. The main contract will be co-financed by the
GOE andthe Bank. It is estimated that the compositiono fproject expenseswill be 70 percent in
foreign currency and 30 percent inlocalcurrency.

While existing runway capacity has been deemed sufficient to handle additional traffic generated
as a result o f TB3 through much o f this decade, design work for a third runway at CAI i s
currently beingundertaken byAkroports de Paris. The runway will be four kilometersin length,

65 meters wide, and will accommodate the future generation of wide body aircraft that will carry
between 600 and 800 passengers. The estimated cost to buildthe new runway i s US$66 million,
and while it will not be financed under the Loan, it will be constructed and made operational by
the time TB3 is completed (around January 2007).

A private firm will be hired to operate CAI's existing terminals plus TB3 when it is
commissioned to traffic. The selection will be made upstream, and the EHCAAN has hired a
French investment bank to assist in the selection process by finalizing the scope o f the
investment and preparing appropriate tender documents with a view to awarding a management
contract by end 2005. The work by the investment bank is an integral part of project's
development and has been closely coordinated with the Bank team. Slippages are possible, and
project conditionalities have been designed to minimize risks o f failure to select a private firm to
manage the new terminals.

CONSTRUCTIONOF NEW TERMINAL AT SHARMEL SHIEKH

Sham El Shiekh is the third largest airport in Egypt in terms o f passenger volumes.
International traffic accounts for more than 70 percent o f all traffic at the airport, which is
currently operating at its designed capacity o f two million passengers per annum. When
completed, the new terminal will have the capacity to accommodate 4.5 million passengers
annually. The new terminal will consist of:


       0   one new terminal building; and

       0   electromechanical systems andequipment.

As for TB3 in Cairo, two packages o f works have been planned for Sharm's new terminal - an
"enabling package" (some US$2.5 million) and the main design-build contract. The construction
period, which is scheduled to be 18 months, is set to begin in October 2004, with the goal o f
making the new terminal operational by April 2006. The composition o f project expenses is
estimated to be 70 percent inforeign currency and 30 percent inlocal currency.

The GOE intends to hire a private firm to manage the airport and assigned the same French
investment bank to help inits selection.

STRENGTHENINGSECTOR OPERATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

Services o f a Project Manager and of a Legal Advisor were hired by CAC and EAC to assist
them throughout preparation and implementation o f their civil works contracts. These services
are not financed by the Bank and neither are those o f the Engineering firm which
preparedhpdated the biddingdocuments for project civil works inCairo and ShmEl Sheikh.

The Bank financed TA (some US$5 million), all o f which will be implemented by the
EHCAAN, i s comprised o f the following:

     Sub-Component I Preparationo f a National Airport Master Plan for Egypt.Development
     o f a master plan is needed to coordinate investment plans for Egypt's airports and airport
     extension with growth of tourism. A national master plan will help clarify an overall
     country strategy for the development o f airport infrastructure, sequence and optimize
     investments, guide future development o f private concessions, define how supporting
     infrastructure will be financed and identify responsibility for its maintenance, and address
     issues faced by small airports, like tailoring subsidies to real socio-economic functions.

     Sub-Component 2 Plan for Gradual Air Transport Liberalization. This study will define
     a realistic path for liberalization o f air transport consistent with promotion o f one or
     several airports as international hubs and the timeframe for strengthening the national
     airline industry, without which the full potential o f these hubs will never materialize.
     Fullliberalization o f air transport is likely to exceed five years, andthe development o f a
     detailed action plan for the next four years must be realistic andbeneficial to the country.

     Sub-Component 3 National Strategy for Development o f Air Cargo. The objective here
     is to enhance and support the implementation o f strategic plan including creation of an
     international cargo hub at CAI. Advice will be provided on the feasibility o f expanding
     the cargo village at Cairo Airport. The assessment will include a review o f cargo traffic
     and forecasts at CAI, existing laws and regulations, ownership and operating scenarios,
     operational and logistical requirements for air cargo facilities.

     Sub-component 4: Support to Environmental Units. Funding will be provided to install
     air and noise quality monitoring equipment and to establish environmental units at CAC
     and EAC. Financing will also be available for the services o f an independent long-term
     contractor to oversee implementation o f the environmental management plans (EMP) for
     CAC and EAC, and to train local staff to implement associated mitigation measures
     described inthe EMPduringproject construction and new terminal operations.

     Sub-component 5: Airport Management Capacity Building. The main objective o f this
     assistance will be to build management capacity at EHCAAN, CAC, EAC and AVIT,
     including provision o f IT equipment.            Upgrading human resource management,
     revamping commercial functions and establishing effective monitoring and control
     systems are the main objectives. Training will be provided for staff to operate under the
     new systems, as well as to strengthen counterparts abilities to regulate and monitor
     airport users andthe performance o f private airport management firms.

     Sub-Component 6: Auditing o f the project-related accounts. An auditor will be hired to
     audit the Project Accounts for each Fiscal Year throughout project implementation.

     Sub-component 7: Technical support to the PMU. Experts will be hired and financed out
     o f the Bank loanproceeds to ensure efficient operation o fthe PMUinthe field o f
     procurement and financial management.

Sub-component 8. Equipment. The equipment procured by EHCAANunder the project
will include air quality and noise monitoring equipment needed by the CAC and EAC
environmental management units to implement the Environment Management Plans o f
the Cairo and Sham El-Sheikh terminals, and Information Technology equipment aiming
to strengthen EHCAANmanagement capacities.

                         EG-AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

The Project will be implemented between July 2004 and December 2008, and June 30, 2009 is
the Loan's scheduled closing date. EHCAAN and its affiliates, particularly, CAC and EAC will
be responsible for implementingthis Project.

Interms oflendingarrangements andflow offunds, there willbe a LoanAgreement betweenthe
Bank and the Government o f Egypt (Ministry o f Foreign Affairs), and a Project Agreement
betweenthe Bank and EHCAAN. By virtue o f a Subsidiary LoanAgreement (SLA) betweenthe
GOE andthe EHCAAN, the GOEwill on-lendthe Bank Loanproceeds funds to EHCAAN.

To clarify the respective roles o f CAC and E A C in project implementation, Contractual
Agreements (CAS) should be in place between EHCAAN and each o f the affiliates, before the
deadline for the submission of bids for the two main works contracts. These CAS,which should
bereviewed andaccepted bythe Bank, will detail procurement and payment processes andother
responsibilities for implementing the Project's different activities.  This will allow CAC and
EACto sign contracts with the two winningcontractors. Also, these CASwill allow EHCANNto
issue withdrawal applications to the Bank to make direct payments to the contractors on behalf
o f CAC and EAC. These legal instruments will also specify financial arrangements between
EHCAAN and CAC and EAC, respectively, under which the latter will service their share o f the
debt incurredby EHCAAN. Signing o fthese CASshouldtake place no later than June 30,2004.

A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be established withinthe EHCAANby effectiveness to
supervise, coordinate and monitor overall implementation o f the Project. Its chief functions will
be to program, collect information and data, monitor and evaluate progress, coordinate and
advise on all fiduciary matters, maintain project financial accounts, manage the Special Account,
submit replenishment requests and Requests for Direct Paymentto the Bank, andprepare reports,
including financial monitoring reports (FMRs).         In accordance with the aforementioned
contractual agreements with CAC and EAC, the PMU will coordinate and supervise project
implementation, and authorize and work with its affiliates and the Ministry o f Civil Aviation to
carry out each of the project's components. Payments due contrators, suppliers and consultants
will come from hnda held by the EHCAAN, upon receiving appropriate instructions from the
CAC and EAC. EHCAAN will be responsible for the procurement o f the five packages under
the Technical Assistance component o f the Project. The composition o f PMU staffing will
include inter alia a qualified Project Director (PD) who will head the unit, a Finance Officer, a
Procurement Coordinator, and a Statistician, and may include Project Coordinators from CAC,
EAC and AVIT to facilitate communications between with the PMU. In addition, CAC and
EAC will assign a Senior Engineer to interact with the PMU's PD on matters o f contract
management related to construction of their respective terminals. To be effective, the PMU will
needto: (i) interact with two Senior Project Coordinators appointed at CAC and EAC, who will
facilitate collection from relevant departments o f the operational, financial and procurement
information it needs to process FMRs; and (ii)  have direct access to the Project Manager and the




                                                38

Legal Advisors hiredby the airport entities for checking and completing the data communicated
by CAC andEAC.

A Project Steering Committee, to be chaired by EHCAAN, will have responsibility for project
oversight and coordination. Representatives will include key stakeholders inthe project, such as
from the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Ministry o f Finance, and E H C A A " s affiliates. A
comprehensive Project Implementation Plan(PIP), includingthe format o f monthly and quarterly
progress reports and covering the tasks for which the PMU, CAC and E A C will be responsible
respectivelyhas been finalized by EHCAAN andwas submittedto the Bank.

For the third terminal at Cairo Intemational Airport, the Cairo Airport Company has contracted
an international engineering firm to serve as Project Manager (PM) to assist inthe procurement
process and during the contract management phase. CAC has also signed contracts with another
engineering firm to designlupdate and supervise construction o f project investments. Both
recruitments were found acceptable to the Bank. For the new terminal at Sharm El Sheikh
Airport, EAC has contracted the same intemational engineering firm to develop engineering
designs and to supervise construction o f the new terminal. Contract management will be mainly
carried by EAC with the support from the international engineering firm in their role as the
"Engineer" under the construction contract, with some extended technical assistance to EAC.
Both CAC and EAC will be supported by the PMU to provide the required knowledge in Bank
procurement and complementing the roles o f the recruited consultants inprovidingthe necessary
expertise and resources to CAC and EAC in the procurement and management o f theses two
large contracts. The PM contract with CAC was signed on July 2003, for a period of 41 months
with an estimated effort o f 450 person-months. The PM contract with EAC is from December
2003 until February 2006. Both CAC and E A C will appoint a procurement officer and be
supported by the Procurement Coordinator in the PMU to provide the required knowledge in
Bank procurement and complementing the PM role in providing the necessary expertise and
resources to CAC and E A C in the procurement and management of theses two large contracts.
The PMhas preparedthe pre-qualification documents, the biddingdocuments and assisted CAC
andEAC inthe preparation ofthe pre-qualification reports for these two packages.

EHCAAN will sign all contracts under the Technical Assistance Component. The decision-
makingprocess, especially with regardto contract awards, willbedefined inthe EHCAAN-CAC
and EHCAAN-EAC Contractual Agreements and will be reviewed closely bythe Bank as part o f
its due diligence responsibilities, in order to ensure efficient implementation and fiduciary
soundness. It has already been agreed with EHCAAN, that for the works contracts, the payment
approval cycle will be carried out inthe following manner:

    1. The contractor will submit invoicesto the supervisingengineer or PM.
    2. The PM will verify the quantities and prices and transmit the invoices to CAC for TB3
        and EAC for SSH.
    3. CAC and EAC will review and approve the invoices prior to forwarding them to the
        PMU.
    4. The PMU then reviews, approves payments, then processes requests to the World Bank
        for direct payments to contractors.




                                                39

An assessment o f EHCAAN's financial management system has been carried out in order to
ensure that the PMU will be capable o f accurately capturing, summarizing, recording, and
reporting transactions in a timely manner.         Certain weaknesses were noted.         To provide
assurance that identified weaknesses will be properly mitigated, the following measures have
been incorporated into the project's design: (i)  staffing the PMUwith a competent and qualified
Finance Officer; (ii)   setting up automated accounting and reporting system at the PMU; (iii)
issuing quarterly FMRs; (iv) contracting a private external auditor; and (v) close supervision by
Bank staff, especially duringthe first year o f implementation. Because most o fthe contracts for
civil works and goods are for large amounts, the direct payment method will be usedprimarilyto
finance these project-related activities, while a small Special Account (SA), to be established at a
commercial bank, will be used to pay for consulting services. The SA will be established and
managed by the PMU. The financial management systems o f CAC and E A C may be assessedby
the Bank separately, depending on the actual arrangements reflected inthe EHCAAN-CAC and
EHCAAN-EAC contractual agreements to be signed no later than June 30, 2004.                        The
establishment o f a comprehensive financial management system for the Project related accounts
is a Condition o f Effectiveness.

Environmental Units will also be established at CAC and EAC no later than July 1, 2004 and
August 1,2004 respectively to monitor implementation o f the Environmental Management Plan
and maintain corresponding indicators. Technical assistance will be financed under the project
to start up each unit, perform necessary tasks, and train staff to take over at the project's closing.

Private airport operators will be hired under management contracts let by E H C A A N to manage           t.


the new and existing terminals at CAI, and the new, and possibly, existing terminal at SSH. An
intemationally recognized investment bank was hired to: (a) provide advise to the E H C A A N on
a strategy to attract private management firms; (b) prepare the tender documents, including
contract design, and market the transactions; and (c) assist inthe tendering process and selection
o f management companies. Much o f project success will hinge on the performance o f the
management companies, which are expected to modernize management systems, adequately
maintain airport facilities, ensure a high standard o f airport security, and build in-house
capacities to assume responsibility once their contracts, which are expected to have a six to eight
year duration (they could be extended by a year), expire. At the same time, it will be important
that the Egyptian authorities exert effective control to ensure the performance o f the private
operators.

Executive Summary and Conclusion. An assessment o f the financial management arrangements
for EHCAAN, CAC, and EAC was undertaken inOctober 2003, and completed during appraisal
to determine whether the financial management arrangements for the Project are acceptable to
the Bank. A financial management questionnaire i s included inthe Project files. The assessment
looked at the three entities' financial management systems to ensure that they possess a sound
system that is capable o f capturing, summarizing, recording, and reporting its transactions on an
accurate and timely manner. Certain weaknesses were noted during the assessment, such as
manual accounting and reporting systems, lack o f experience in implementing Bank financed
projects, and reliance on the Central Auditing Organization (CAO) inperforming annual audits.
The assessment concluded that the financial management systems did not meet the Bank's
minimum requirements. As such, the establishment of a fully functional financial management
system, including the installation o f accounting hardware and software capable of recording the
project's financial transactions and generating FMRs and annual financial statements, and which
is staffed by a qualified Finance Officer familiar with Bank guidelines, is a Condition of
Effectiveness. Also, as the first two components will be implemented by CAC and E A C the
reliability o f the reports generated from the PMU in E H C A A N will depend on the control
environment in both companies, and as such, each company will recruit a qualified finance
officer no later than September 30,2004.

Countrv Financial Management Risks.              The 2003 ROSC Report, the on going CFAA Report
(2003), and the CPPR Report (2002) identified major weaknesses in Egyptian financial
accountability in both the public and the private sectors. Two areas in the 2001 CAS that also
give indications o f these inherent risks, which are found in the context o f country economic
development and public sector administration capacity.            Another issue that could affect the
residual risk i s transparency within Egypt. According to some indices, the perception o f non-
transparency inEgypt worsened in2003.14

Proiect Financial Management Risk.                EHCAAN, CAC and E A C have no experience in
implementingBank projects, which i s a significant risk. Also, reliance on full manual systems to
record and report financial transactions and a lack o f experience with International Accounting


l4Inthe TransparencyInternational's CorruptionPerceivedIndex for 2002, Egypt scored 3.6 out of 10, while in
  2003, the perception dropped to 3.3 (more risk).

Standards (IAS) leads to a high fiduciary risk that needs to be mitigated through specific
measures and arrangements. In addition to the mitigating measures listed below, E H C A A N has
contracted KPMG to assess the overall financial management systems at EHCAAN, CAC and
EAC, develop an action plan for upgrading the system, and finally support inthe implementation
o f their recommendations. This would ultimately contribute to a more reliable system for the
project implementation. Upgrading o f the company's FMS must be completed no later than
March 31,2007.

   Implementing             High       No experience with Bank projects. Involvement insimilar
   Entity                              project to develop Terminal 2 in 1986. E H C A A N is a new
                                       entity andmost staff only have public sector experience.
  Funds Flow              Moderate    Because the project will have a limited number o f
                                       contracts, direct payments will be used. However, a SA
                                      will be opened at a commercial bank inEgypt for the TA

                                       a focus on unifiedaccounting systems.
   Internal Audit           High       Although it can be argued that C A O fulfills an internal
                                       audit function, an Internal Audit Department does not
                                       exist.
  External Audit            High       Annual audits are conducted by CAO, however, the Bank
                                       does not accept C A O reports for new projects. Also, CAO
                                       does not give oDinions on EHCAAN's consolidated FS.
  Reporting and             High       Most financial reports, including FS, are produced
  Monitoring                          manually. It i s worth noting that the 2002 audit has not yet
                                      been completed due to problems in determining opening
                                      balances.
  Information               High      Manual systems are used. EHCAAN launched a process to
   Systems                            computerize its MIS,       but this is not yet under
                                      implementation. It is fair to say that most staff are not
                                      familiar with commters or their amlications.

                                        Overall Risk: High


Risk Mitigatinn Measures. To compensate for the above-mentioned shortcomings, and to lower
the overall risk rating to moderate, a combination ofthe following actions is proposed:




                                                  43

        0   "ring-fencing" the project, and reliance on Direct Payments;
        0   creating a competent, qualified, and adequately staffed FMunit(s);
        0   implementing an automated accounting andreporting system;
        0   producing quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR);
        0   hiringKPMGto upgrade the FMsystems inthe three companies;
        0   contracting private external auditors to review quarterly FMRs and audit annual
            financial statements (FS) for the project inaccordance with International Standards
            on Auditing; and
        0   close monitoring by the Bank to help reduce risk.

To establish a sound financial management and reporting system within the EHCAAN, the core
PMU staff will include a qualified Finance Officer familiar with the Bank's principles and
guidelines on financial management, can issue Financial Monitoring Reports, and prepare timely
withdrawal applications and Statements o f Expenditure (SOE). To ensure that the information
received from CAC and E A C is accurate and timely, two finance officers will be recruited and
physically located in both companies. The Finance Officer will liaise with EAC's Finance
Officer, CAC's Finance Officer, the PD, and the Bank on issues associated with financial
management and disbursement.       The PM will submit monthly FMRs to the Finance Officer
covering the project's first and second components. The Finance Officer will be responsible for
preparingconsolidatedFMRs for the project, including the activities o fthe thirdcomponent.

Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR). The project should have an adequate management
information system that is capable of generating necessary financial reports, including sources
and uses o f funds, cash withdrawals, cash forecasts, and Special Account reconciliation. The
format, content, and frequency o f these reports have been drafted and were finalized during
negotiations. While the PMU's Finance Officer will prepare the FMRs, the PMU's PD will be
responsible for ensuring that they are submitted to the Bank ina timely manner.

Procurement Reports. These reports should provide information on the procurement o f works,
goods, and related services, as well as the selection of consultants and compliance with Bank
procurement guidelines and methods. Inaddition to the procurement progress, the reports should
include information on all authorized contract variations.      Information on complaints from
bidders, unsatisfactory performance o f contractors, and other major contractual disputes should
also be included.    The PMU's Procurement Coordinator will prepare relevant procurement
reports, and the PMU's Project Manager will be responsible for ensuring that they are submitted
to the Bank ina timely manner.

Physical Reports.    These reports should include narrative information and output indicators
linkingfinancial informationwith physical progress, andhighlightissues that require attention to
ensure that project costs are well managed. The PMU's Project Manager will be responsible for
organizing the production o f these reports and for submitting them to the Bank in a timely
manner.

Flow o f Funds. Because most o f the contracts for civil works and goods are for large amounts,
the direct payment method will be usedprimarily to finance these project-related activities, while




                                                44

a small Special Account will be used to pay for consulting services. To ensure that hnds are
readily available for project implementation, and to separate and avoid commingling o f funds
from various sources, a Special Account for IBRD funds (denominated in US Dollars) will be
opened at a commercial bank in Cairo, and managed by the PMU. Deposits into, and payments
from, the SA will be made in accordance with provisions in the Loan Agreement. As for the
local currency contribution, National Investment Bank (NIB)will cover that part at the request o f
CAC and EAC, which will be transferred to the Project's Local Currency Account on quarterly
basis based on the expected implementation.

Mechanism for Making Construction Pavments. The appointed PM will follow the prescribed
mechanism for making payments to contractors, determining amounts due and payable within
the powers granted them. The PM will prepare monthly financial reports (cash forecasts),
procurements reports, and physicalprogress reports. The payment mechanism is outlined below.
       Contractors will provide the PM with monthly statements showing amounts due at the
       end o f each month. Statements will show the proportions o f local Adforeign   currencies
       required.
       Within 14 days o f receipt of monthly statements, PM determines amounts due and
       payable inrespective currencies, and delivers an interim payment certificate to the CAC
       or E A C for review and approval
       CAC or E A C will approve the interim payment certificate and deliver it to the PMU for
       payment.
       The PMUthen reviews and approves payments.
       Upon execution of the "Form o f Agreement" and provision o f bank guarantee, P M
       certifies a ten (10) percent advance.
       Upon issuance o f "Taking-Over Certificates," one half o f retention money is certified by
       PM for payment to Contractor. Upon expiration o f "Defects Liability Period," the other
       halfo fretentionmoney shall be similarly certified byPM.
       Within forty-two (42) days after receipt of monthly statements from the PM, the PMU
       pays the amount certified as due the Contractor.




                                              45

        Within twenty-eight (28) days of Letter of Acceptance, Contractor shall provide the P M
        with a quarterly cash flow statement. Also, revisedcash flow estimates shall be provided
        to the PM. Bothwill be shared with the PMU.

A local currency account for counterpart contributions will be opened at a commercial bank in
Egypt.

External Audit. A private, qualified, and independent auditor will handle annual audits for the
project, which will include a review o f quarterly FMRs. Terms o f reference for the audits will
clearly reflect the nature o f the project and its exact needs. The cost o f the audit will be financed
from Loan proceeds. The audit report and opinion, accompanied by a management letter, will
cover the project's financial statements (prepared in accordance to US), reconciliation and use
o f the Special Account, use of direct payments, and withdrawals based on SOEs. The report
should be submitted to the Bank no later than six months following the closing of the fiscal year,
or by December 31st. The external audit report should encompass all project components and
activities as a "whole" under the Loan Agreement. The audit should be in accordance with the
Bank's auditingrequirements and conducted according to InternationalStandards on Auditing.

Bank Supervision. Close supervision by the Bank through the resident mission office inEgypti s
recommended.        This will entail quarterly missions, at least during the first year o f
implementation, to review work done by the PMU and to ensure that the developed system is
maintained in a consistent manner.          Also, identified financial management risks will be
continually evaluated and appropriate remedial measures taken duringthe supervisionmissions.

Allocation o f LoanProceeds. The World Bank Loan o fUS$335 million will be disbursed during
project implementation according to table 8. The Loan is expected to be disbursed over a period
of just over four years, beginning in July 2004.          All project activities are expected to be
completed by December 31, 2008, and the Loan i s expected to close on June 30, 2009.
Preparation and submission of disbursement applications will be the responsibility o f the PMU.
All expenditures are net o ftaxes andduties.

DISBURSEMENTARRANGEMENTS

Loan proceeds, which will be disbursed in accordance with the Bank's disbursement guidelines
as outlined in the Disbursement Handbook, will be used to finance project activities through the
disbursement procedures currently in use. As projected by the Bank's standard disbursement
profiles, disbursements would be completed four months after project closure. Disbursements
wouldbemade against standard Bankdocumentation.

Special Account. Because the procurement o f works and goods are expected to be dominated by
a couple o f large contracts, the preferred disbursement method will be direct payment for such
civil works and associated goods, as well as appropriate use o f special commitments for goods,
when warranted or requested by the Borrower. However, to facilitate disbursement o f eligible
expenditures under smaller contracts for goods and consultant services, the PMU will open a
Special Account (SA) inU S dollars at a commercial bank in Egypt to cover part of the Loan's
share o f eligible expenditures. The SA will be managed and administered by the PMU, which
will prepare Withdrawal Applications for replenishing the SA. Withdrawal Applications will be
signed by two authorized representatives, and authorized signatories names and corresponding
specimens o f signature will be submitted to the Bank. The authorized allocation o f the SA will
be the equivalent o f US$500,000 covering an estimated four months o f eligible expenditures
financed by the Loan. The PMU will be responsible for submitting monthly replenishment
applications with appropriate supporting documentation for expenditures incurred, and will
retain and make the documents available for review by Bank supervision missions and project
auditors.

The Special Account will be replenished through the submission o f Withdrawal Applications,
which should be made on a monthly basis and will include reconciled bank statements and other
documents, as may be requiredby Bankprocedures.

Use of Statement o f Expenditure (SOEs). All applications to withdraw proceeds from the Loan
will be fully documented, except for: (i)   expenditures o f contracts with an estimated value o f
US$lOO,OOO equivalent or less for civil works; (ii)   US$lOO,OOO equivalent or less for goods
contracts; (iii)US$lOO,OOO equivalent or less for consulting firms; and (iv) US$50,000 or less
for individual consultants and training, which may be claimed on the basis o f certified
Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting expenditures claimed against
SOEs will be retained by the Project and will be available for review when requested by Bank
supervision missions and project auditors. All disbursements will be subject to the conditions o f
the Loan Agreement and the procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.

                         EG-AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

General

Public sector procurement inEgyptis governed by a legal framework anchored inPublic Tender
Law No. 89/1998 and further detailed in the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)
o f December 2003.

With regard to the proposed Airports Development Project, EHCAAN and its affiliates, CAC
and EAC, have been authorized by GOE to operate under Egypt's commercial laws, as private
sector enterprises. This has been confirmed by GOE and EHCAAN and is recorded accordingly
inthis PAD. Furthermore, with regard to procurement activities financed inwhole or inpart by
the Bank Loan, the provisions o f the Loan Agreement, including the Bank's procurement
guidelines, will supercede anynationalprocurement regulations or practices.

Use of BankGuidelinesandStandardDocuments

Procurement o f works and goods financed under the Loan will be carried out in accordance with
the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised
January and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999). The Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents for Prequalification for Works, Procurement o f Works, Procurement o f Goods and
the Standard BidEvaluation Forms will be used inthe procurement o fworks and goods.

Procurement o f consultant services will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for the
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997, revised
September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002).          The Bank's Standard Request for Proposals
(RFP) for the Selection o f Consultants (July 1997, revised April 1998, July 1999 and March
2002), and the Sample Evaluation Forms will be used for assignments estimated to be above
USD100,OOO equivalent. For assignments estimated to be less then USD100,OOO and for the
recruitment o f individual consultants, simplified forms that are acceptable to the Bank may be
used.

Advertising

As part o f Advance Contracting, as defined inthe relevant provisions of the Bank's procurement
guidelines, EHCAAN, with the concurrence and assistance of the Bank, advertised Specific
Procurement Notices in the United Nations Development Business (UNDB) and Development
Gateway for Prequalification o f Contractors for Cairo International Airport, Terminal No. 3, and
for Sham El Sheikh Airport, New Terminal, on August 15, 2003 and September 28, 2003,
respectively. Advertisements were also published in two national newspapers, which have the
largest circulation in Egypt (A1 Ahram and A1 Akhbar), on the same dates. Contractors have
been prequalified for Cairo TB3, with the Bank's no objection, and contractors have submitted
applications to be prequalified for the new terminal at Sham El Sheikh Airport.




                                                48

A General Procurement Notice and Specific Procurement Notices to advertise for Consultant
Services with an estimated value above USD200,OOO equivalent, will be advertised in UNDB
and Development Gateway, and inat least one newspaper with national circulation. Invitations
for Expressions o f Interest for Consultant Services with an estimated value below USD200,OOO
equivalent will be advertised locally.

The consulting contracts for engineeringdesign, supervision and contract management services
have already been awarded by GOE, EHCAAN and CAC and E A C and will not be considered
for retroactive financing under this Project.

ProcurementPlan

A draft procurement plan is attached reflecting the dates for the main packages for the
Technical Assistance component,       the construction o f Terminal 3 at Cairo Airport and the
construction o f a new terminal at Sharm-El-Sheikh Airport and Information Technology and
Environmental MonitoringUnits equipment. Two bar chart diagrams (attached to this Annex) for
implementing the two terminals have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be acceptable.
Component 3, Strengthening Sector Operations and Environmental Management, will consist of
goods and the following seven subcomponents regarding consultant services:

      3.1 Developing a National Airport Master Plan;
      3.2 Formulating a planto gradually liberalize air transport;
      3.3 Providing guidance to support the transformation o f C A I into a cargo hub;
      3.4 Establishing Environmental Monitoring Units and implementing the EMPs;
      3.5 Capacity buildingto strengthen airport management functions;
      3.6 Services o f independent auditor and:
      3.7 Specialists to support PMUoperations

The programming for these packages was prepared by the EHCAAN and reviewed by the Bank
duringnegotiations. Goods will beprocuredas showninthe ProcurementPlan.

The Project Implementation Plan, which includes the Project Procurement Plan, will be updated
on a continual basis.

CapacityAssessment

EHCAAN has not conducted any large procurement process and in particular, large packages
under international bidding or international donors' guidelines.       Currently it does not have
capacity to do so. Under Egyptian Law, holding companies are not permitted to execute
investment projects. However, the affiliates o f holding companies may execute investment
projects. Therefore, EHCAAN's affiliates, EAC and CAC will be responsible for the
construction o f the two airport terminals to be financed by this Project. The overall assessment
of the procurement capacities in both E A C and CAC indicate that they have adequate measures
to conduct procurement according to their needs. However, they both have no knowledge in
Bank procurement. EAC has not dealt with a project o f the size envisaged under the Project.
For a project o f this magnitude and complexity, it would require a dedicated professional




                                                49

workforce with the corresponding technical capabilities. Although EAC has carried out some
projects o f nature and size similar to the Sharm El Sheikh new terminal, it still requires technical
support inthe procurement andmanagement o f their project.

To address the same problem and to strengthen its capacity, CAC signed a contract with an
international engineering firm to upgrade the Terminal 3 (TB3) design, and to supervise the
construction works. CAC also signed a technical assistance contract with an internationally
renowned Project Management firm, as o f July 2003, to provide project management support
duringthe procurement and contract management phases. Similarly, EAC has signed a technical
assistance contract with the same Project Management firm, starting from December 2003 until
February 2006. This assistance covers the design phase, assistance in the procurement process
and supervision during the construction phase. The firm will also support EAC in the project
management.

The PMU staff will include a Procurement Coordinator (PC) whose responsibilities will deal
primarily with the guidance and monitoring fhctions o f E H C A A Nvis-a-vis its two affiliates in
the context o f this Project. This PC would be expected to have solid experience in conducting
procurement according to Bank Guidelines. Inaddition, the PC will dealwith the procurement o f
packages under the Technical Assistance component. E H C A A N may be further supported by
short-term individual consultants to prepare the TORSfor the technical assistance packages and
to assist in the proposal evaluation processes. E H C A A Nhas confirmed that the PC, a core staff
o fthe PMU, will be recruitedbefore effectiveness.

CAC and E A C shall each appoint a Procurement Officer with qualifications experience and
terms o f reference acceptable to the Bank, for the duration o f the Project, to coordinate with the
PMU at EHCAANand to ensure that the procurement o f works under Parts A and B and goods
under Part C o f the Project is conducted as per the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.

A procurement training workshop for EHCAAN, EAC and CAC staff who will be involved in
the procurement processes under this Project will be offered by the Bank, at or prior to project
launch. The workshop will focus in particular, on Bank Procurement Guidelines for works and
for the Selection o f Consultants. Special attention will be devoted to the procedures for the
evaluation o fbids and proposals, as well as contract administration.

ProcurementImplementationArrangements

The Project Implementation Arrangements are detailed inAnnex 6.

The four main procurement activities under this Project can be categorized into (1) Technical
Assistance, (2) the construction o f Terminal 3 at Cairo Airport, (3) the construction of a new
terminal at Sharm-El-Sheikh Airport and (4) Information Technology and Environmental
Monitoring Units equipment. EHCAAN will be responsible for the procurement o f the seven
packages under the Technical Assistance component o f the Project. Furthermore, in its function
as the Holding Company, EHCAAN will also provide guidance to and monitoring o f CAC and
EAC. CAC will be responsible for the construction o f Terminal 3 at Cairo Airport ;E A C will be
responsible for the construction o f the new terminal at Sharm-El-Sheikh Airport. Both will be
supported inthe procurement process by the PM and the PMUinEHCCAN.




                                                 50

Furthermore the procurement for the goods packages will be handled by each end user as
appropriate, i.e. EHCAAN, CAC and EAC. All procurement activities will be coordinated by the
P M Ubased on a comprehensive Project ProcurementPlanwhich will be updated continuously.

The procurement arrangements are as follows:

       Contract for Construction o f Terminal 3 at Cairo Airport (estimated contract value:
       USD410 million). The pre-qualification process was launched inAugust 2003. The pre-
       qualification report was presented to the Bank early December and was provided a no-
       objection by the Bank, under the relevant provisions of the Guidelines for Advance
       Contracting. The biddingdocuments were submitted to the Bank for review and revised
       inJanuary2004. The biddingdocuments willbeissuedto the prequalified contractors by
       early February 2004; with an expected award o f contract in August 2004. The estimated
      duration ofworks construction is 900 days.

       Contract for Construction o f New Terminal at Sham-El-Sheikh Aimort (estimated
      contract value: USD 58 million).       Again, as part o f Advance Contracting, the pre-
       qualification process was launched in September 2003. The pre-qualification report was
      presented to the Bank December and i s currently under review. A first draft o f the
      bidding documents has been submitted to the Bank. The bidding documents are being
      revised in accordance with the Bank comments on the first draft. The biddingdocuments
      will be issued to the prequalified contractors by April 2004, with an expected award of
      contract inSeptember 2004. The estimated duration o fworks construction is 550 days.

      Technical Assistance Component. There are seven technical services packages under
      this component with estimated values ranging from USD200,OOO to U S D 1.0 million.
      The programming o f this components is to be finalized and submitted for Bank review
      prior to negotiations. The selection process will be according to the Quality and Cost
      based Selection Method (QCBS). Individualconsultants will be also recruited to assist in
      the preparation o fthe TOR and evaluation o fproposals submitted for these assignments.

      Procurement o f Goods. This relatively small component (USD3.5 million) is comprised
      o f (i)Information Technology equipment and (ii)the equipment needed for
      implementationofthe EMP.

      Reserved Procurement. Prior to the award o f the main works contracts, CAC and EAC
      expect to award separate contracts for the Enabling Works, using their own procurement
      methods. These Enabling Works are shown under the column         " N.B.F." in Table A of
      this Annex as being part o f this Project but are not to be considered for financing under
      the Bank Loan.

ProcurementMethods(Table A)

Goods and Works. Procurement o f goods and works will be carried out using International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) for the two contracts for works, and for major contracts for goods.

              A.       Economic Evaluation of TB3 at Cairo International Airport

Traffic Structure and Evolution

        Between 1997 and 2002, total passenger volumes at Cairo International Airport (CAI)
rose on average by three percent annually, in line with the world wide average annual passenger
growth during these years,*' but slower than the historical growth rate for the Middle East
region, which has been 4.7 percent. Table 1A provides basic details on the traffic structure and
evolution.

        Scheduled internationaltraffic accounts for three-fourths o f total passenger movements at
CAI, while just two percent of total passengers use CAI for connecting flights. Around half o f
international passengers are on leisure trips. The most important origin and destination (OD)
markets are the Middle East (56 percent) and Europe (35 percent).

        As a result of the GOE's decision to ban foreign charter airlines from CAI, non-
scheduled traffic has decreased significantly since 1998. On the other hand, foreign charters and
scheduled services have been allowed to fly directly to the other Egyptianinternational airports,
an opportunity on which Sham El Sheikh, Hurghada and even Luxor16 Airportswere able to
capitalize. Passenger volumes at these airports have grown at a tremendous pace since 1998.
Through 2002, Luxor saw average yearly volumes increases o f 58 percent,17 while volumes at
Hurghada and Sham El Sheikh grew by 50 percent and 42 percent respectively. This evolution,
however, cannot be construed as being only a consequence o f charter restrictions at CAI, as all
these airports serve thriving centers of tourism.

l6Although Luxor is not among the destinations that have been liberalized, non-scheduled permits for Luxor have
  apparently been relaxed.
" higheraveragegrowthrate
  The                           of Luxor compared to Hurghada and Sham El Sheikh is a result of the correction
  inpassengertraffic following the 1997terrorist incident.

         Statistics on the number o f tourists at C A I are not maintained. ECG's 2003 traffic study
indicates that tourists account for about half o f all intemational traffic, or about 2.2 million.
Most o fthe tourist traffic is on scheduled flights.

Current Airport Capacity

         The analysis done in February 2000 by Schiphol Project Consult B.V. indicated that
CAI's first terminal had a capacity o f 5.4 million passengers, while the second terminal could
accommodate 2.3 million passengers. The report noted that "as more traffic is squeezed into the
existing facilities, the level of sewice will decline more rapidly than the traffic increases."
Modernization o f TB1 has since taken place, and the current combined capacity o f the two
terminals is around 9 million passengers per annum. The stagnation in traffic since 1999 i s
principly caused by exogenous factors, but capacity constraints were also a factor (e.g. exclusion
o f foreign charter flights). Conditions offered to travelers have been, and continue to be, less
than adequate, and act as a drag on traffic growth. Overcrowded airports generate economic
losses due to the delays sufferedbybothpassengers andplanes.

Traffic Forecasts

         The development o f a third terminal at C A I has been discussed for more than a decade,
and several feasibility studies, including traffic forecasts, have been carried out.     Table 2 A
summarizes four o f those forecasts respectively prepared by NACO/ECG (1994), Schiphol
Project Consult (2000), Parsons (2000) andECG (2003). The latest forecast takes full account o f
the political context inthe region, and the impacts September 1lth and the 2003 war inIraq had
on air transport worldwide.

         The ECG/NACO was based mainly on professionaljudgement and empirical analysis in
combination with trend analysis and market surveys.             The Schiphol and Parsons forecast
methodologies were based on combining historical trends with economic outlook and price
elasticity, while the ECG forecast was based on trend analysis from 1985 to 2002.

        The most important markets for C A I have been, and will continue to be, Europe and the
Middle East. The demandfor air travel will grow more strongly inthe less developed markets o f
the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Over the past six months, overall passenger traffic in the
region rose by 4.9 percent, fueled in part by infrastructure developments in the Gulf States.
Traffic in the region will continue to recover to resume something close to its historical rate of
growth. Demand for air travel will be driven primarily by economic growth, and the Middle
East's sub-market i s expectedto grow by 4.3 percent annually through 2020 (see table 3A).

         The extent to which CAI, but also Egypt Air, will be able to capitalize on these markets
will most certainly influence the long-term growth rate. CAI aspires to become a passenger and
cargo hub for the Middle East with Egypt Air serving as hub carrier. However the implications a
hub strategy may have for the GOE's civil aviation policy in general (deregulation,
liberalization, fleet and network management), and for the other Egyptian international airports
and airlines in particular, have not yet been properly assessed by CAC. Moreover, the main
driver for air traffic growth has been, and most likely will continue to be, the tourisdleisure
segment, both on international and regional scales. Egypt i s a favorite destination for tourists
and the negative impacts that followed international and local acts o f terrorism (e.g. the events in
Luxor in 1997 and September 11,th were o f relatively short duration. Tourism in2003 soared by
around 50 percent, notwithstanding the war inIraq.

         Bearing inmindthe above mentioned factors, a long-term traffic forecast through 2020 o f
between 3.0 percent and 4.5 percent seems realistic. An increase fiom 8.4 million passengers in
2002 to 16 million or 18 million by 2020 is reachable. Should Egypt Air fulfill its ambition o f
becoming a hub carrier, traffic growth might well exceed 4.5 percent, but the economic analysis
conservatively assumes no such development, given remaining uncertainties on the speed at
which liberalization o f the Egyptianair transport market will take place.

Airport Tariffs

         The Cairo Airport Company generated gross operating revenues o f around US$63 million
equivalent in 2002, or roughly US$7 per passenger. About 70 percent o f revenue came from
aeronautical charges (of which airside charges accounted for nearly two-third), and the balance
from commercial charges and rentals.               Notwithstanding an unusually large airport domain
(around 8,000 acre), the latter two sources o f revenue are underdeveloped (average revenue o f
US$1.8 per passenger). Concession contracts in particular include payments proportional to
turnover beyond a minimumfee, which inmany cases turns out to be the only payment made by
occupants as they are unable to develop their business (an example of which i s Egypt Air, which
pays 54 percent o f the concession's total revenues).               The potential to develop commercial
revenues i s high.

         Aeronautical fees in Egypt are notoriously low.                 A Bank study o f Moroccan air
transport'* ranked Egypt ninth out o f ten countries in the region for landing charges applied to
B747s and MD80s (the Egypt index was half the average). More recent data obtained inMarch

2003 and shown inTable 4A confirms that aeronautical tariffs are below the regional market for
a representative aircraft class (A320 weighing 70 tons). There i s room for a significant tariff
adjustment, especially for the passenger fee.

InvestmentCosts

       Net of tax project investment costs, including physical contingencies, are estimated at
US$461million (including construction o fthe third runway).

        The economic analysis covers twenty years o f operation. A residual value o f US$200
million i s credited in 2027, which corresponds to the infrastructure's assumed economic life o f
forty years. N o renewal investment i s accounted for, as the heavy duty equipment to be installed
will have a twenty-year economic life.

MainAssumptions Used

Traffic.
            With the project, passenger traffic would grow at 3.5 percent per annum under the
            best case scenario, or from 8.4 million passenger in 2002 to 20 million passenger in
            2027.   The same rate applies to each o f the four traffic components (domestic,
            charter, tourists on scheduled flights, and other passenger on scheduled flight). On
            top o f expected growth in passenger traffic, charter traffic is expected to double in
            three years following the re-admittance o f foreign charter flights to CAI in 2007
            (from about 160,000 passengers in2006 to 350,000 in2010). The sensitivity analysis
       .    tested lower (3 percent) andhigher (4.5 percent) yearly rates.

            Without the project, traffic would not be able to grow beyond ten million passengers
            p.a..  The one million passenger capacity additional to the current one (i.e. nine
            million) would come from better utilization o f available terminal space through minor
            layout adjustments, although not without additional overcrowding and strains to
            passengers.   This maximum traffic is reached in 2008, and the model assumes
            redistribution o f traffic among the four components to be consistent with the ten
            million passenger constraint. Under the model, domestic, charter and business related
            traffic was escalated at just one percent p.a. between 2008 to 2015, thereafter at 0.5
            percent p.a. beyond 2015, since assuming no growth for these traffic segments would
            be unrealistic.    To be consistent with terminal capacities, tourists arriving on
            scheduled flights must be decreased to make room for domestic traffic. In2027, only




                                                 62

          two million tourists would be received in Cairo without the project, compared with
          4.4 million with the project.

Tariffs

          The Cairo Airport Company requested that the new passenger departure fee be
          increased to US$15 per intemational passenger, and US$3 per local passenger. This
          increase is expected to be effective in early 2004. Corresponding revenues would
          increase from about US$12 million in2003 to around US$53 million in2004. A new
          fee will be added to offset the costs o f installing a security device at weighing
          counters (US$l per international passenger and US$0.8 per local passenger).
          Because the private management company i s expected to make better use o f existing
          and planned commercial spaces, the economic projection assumes commercial
          revenue per passenger will grow from its current level o fjust below US$2 to US$5.
          Revenue from other sources will be based on unchanged rates.

          The plannedtariff increases are substantial, but they remain market-based.

Expenses

          Additional working expenses would be incurred as a result of TB3 operations.
          Operating and maintenance costs other than labor are assumed at two percent o f the
          investment cost. Since TB1 and TB2 will lose traffic to TB3, another assumption is
          that their working expenses, other than labor, would drop by 20 percent in 2008, then
          grow again by one-third o f traffic growth. No incremental labor costs is assumed, as
          CAC is grossly overstaffed and opening TB3 would provide an opportunity to
          redeploy staff among facilities.     Costs associated with the private management
          contract are also considered. The management contract is assumed to run for ten
          years beginning in 2005, and the fee is calculated as eight percent o f revenues, after
          deducting the Aviation Fund's share. It i s hrther assumed that the management
          contract would respectively cover 40 percent and 66 percent o f C A C activities before
          and after opening o f TB3. Once the management contract expires, CAC would need
          to strengthen its own management team in order to assume operations, and related
          incremental costs are assumed at one-third o f the private management fee.

Benefits

Itis assumedthat benefits would come from the following sources:

          Existing tmfJic. The ten million passenger that could be received inCairo without the
          project would benefit from an improved level o f service once TB3 is opened. The
          tariff increase will also apply to this traffic, but the incremental tariff cannot be
          construed as equivalent to the improvement in service levels as it is first and foremost
          a correction to a lower than market tariff.      Direct measurement o f benefits is a
          challenging task, given the paucity o f information available. Aircraft will have faster
          turnaround times and lower costs, albeit to an extent that is difficult to ascertain, and



                                               63

           the economic analysis takes the view that only those airlines using Cairo as a hub
           would really benefit.      Since Egypt Air is not foreseen to fulfill this function, no
           airline benefit i s accounted for. Passengers would also spend less time waiting. A
           30-minute gain by passengers and, conservatively assuming that saved time will be
           used for leisure by most, one-third o f an average household revenue per hour o f
           US$l0 would be saved. Acknowledging uncertainties surrounding such estimates,
           switching value o f this parameter have been used to gauge its degree o f realism.

       m   Additional traffic. Traffic that would not come to Cairo because o f current capacity
           bottlenecks would generate benefit based on the tariff that would apply to them (close
           to US$10 per passenger, excluding incremental revenue from commercial functions).
           This charge is consistent with consumers' willingness to pay based on the regional
           market features, and can be used as a proxy o fbenefits generated by the project.

       m   Incremental commercial revenue base. More space would be created for use by
           commercial activities. The revenue base would also be expanded as a result o f more
           commercially oriented management brought in under the management contract. The
           economic analysis assumes that the commercial and rental revenue earned by CAC
           would be raised to US$5 equivalent per in-and-out international passenger from an
           estimated revenue o f US$1.8 under current conditions (incremental revenue o f
           US$3.2 per in-and-out internationalpassenger).

       m   Revenue netted by Egypt from tourism. Without the project, tourist traffic would be
           much less. Without the project, not all tourists lost to Cairo would be lost to Egypt,
           since visits to Cairo are often combined with visits to other places within the country.
           The assumption is that: (a) Egypt is netting five percent o f total spending by tourists
           (estimated at US$800per visit in2001, updated to US$l,OOO at present, then reduced
           to US$870 tax free amount); (b) two-thirds o f lost tourists would still visit Egypt,
           meaning that only one-half o f spending by tourists would be lost without the project;
           and (c) the net benefit to Egypt o f tourist (namely US$22) is then applied to half o f
           in-and-out tourist traffic.

Results

Based on the above assumptions, the economic rate o f return (ERR) is 16.2 percent, and the net
present value (NPV), discounted at ten percent, is US$252 million.

Sensitivity Analysis

A sensitivity analysis was carried out, testing key assumptions to verify by how muchbelow the
base case scenario they would have to fall to bringthe ERR down to a lower limit o f ten percent.
Results are as follows:

              Annual traffic growth would have to fall to 1.75 percent;
              Investment costs would have to increase by some 70 percent;
              Not accounting for time savings would still produce an ERR o f 12percent;
              Not accounting for commercial revenue gains would still produce an ERRo f 12
              percent; and
              The two last benefits would have to be overestimated by a factor o f three for the ERR
              to drop to tenpercent.

               B.       Economic Evaluation of the New Sharm ElSheikh Terminal

  Background

          Owing to its climate, beaches, coral reefs and reputation as one of the best diving
  destinations in the world, Sharm El Sheikh has become the major seaside resort in the Sinai
  peninsula. Development of tourism started in the mid-l980s, and the area now has,some forty
  hotels, includingfive star hotels, and has around 30,000 rooms available. The neighboring small
  harbor o f SharmElMoyais an active yachting center.

          Air transport is the most common transport mode used to access the resort. The first
  terminal buildingat SSH was commissioned to traffic in 1994. With 4,500m2 of space available,
  it was designed to handle 600 passengers per hour. This capacity was extended twice, once in
  1998 and again in 2002, to reach 9,000m2at present and a peak capacity of 1,600 passenger per
 hour, which roughly corresponds to maximum traffic o f around 2.5 million passenger per year
 under current traffic patterns. The apron canreceive up to 27 aircraft, andthe airport is open to
 traffic around-the-clock.
 Traffic Structure and Evolution

          After CAI and Hurghada, SSH is the third biggest airport inEgypt interms of passenger
 volumes. International traffic accounts for over 70 percent of all traffic. Passengertraffic grew
  from around 250,000 passengers in 1993 to 981,000 passengers in 1997, for an annual growth
 rate of 40.7 percent. From 1997 to 2002, traffic continued to grow at a fast annual pace (24.5
 percent), notwithstanding the pauses experienced in 1998 and 2001. As shown in Table lB,
 traffic growth has been due mainly to the increase in international non-scheduled services. With
 upto four flights handled at the same time, the airport's terminal is chronically overcrowded and
 the level of service offered to passengers has much deteriorated in recent years,. There i s an
 obvious need for additional capacity.

          A new terminal with capacity to accommodate 2,500 passenger per hour will be built to
 overcome existing constraints. It will bring the airport's overall capacity to some six million
passenger per year at normal service standards.               The existing runway has enough reserve
capacity to handle this increased traffic.

Traffic Forecasts

         The traffic development potential was studied on an independent basis by several
consultants       in FY2002,           including        Copenhagen,     Airport/MISR,   SONS/Dragados,
ABB/Skanska/Samerete Egypt, and APDMNincilAlkadOrascom.                         Their estimates for 2020
were in the 4.4 million to 5.3 million range. ECG revised those estimates upward in 2003 and
projectedthat traffic in 2020 would be around 6.3 million passengers.

         ECG's forecast is consistent with the average growth o f air traffic inthe Middle East, as
shown inTable 3A. Based on the fact that the Govemorate has plans that would make S h a m El
Sheikh the largest resort in the Sinai and lead to a 42 percent increase in the number o f hotel
rooms by 2017,20 and acknowledging the recent growth in airport traffic, previous forecasts are
too conservative, and the economic analysis has been based on annual growth rates in
intemational and domestic traffic at five percent and 2.5 percent respectively. Unhindered by
airport capacity, overall traffic would reach six million passengers by 2016, which is an average
annual growth rate o f 4.7 percent.


Airport Tariffs

         SSH earned revenue o f about LE36 million in2002, with the following breakdown:

         fl  LE7.0 million innavigational fees (19 percent o f total);
         fl  LE12.5 million inpassenger departure fees (35 percent o f total);
         fl  LE11.O millioninlandingandother airside fees (30 percent o ftotal); and
         fl  LE5.5 million inconcession fees andrentals (16 percent o f total).

Airport fees, excluding navigational fees, amounted to LE29 million, or US$1.3 per in-and-out
passenger (including US$0.7 from the departure fee, but excluding commercial revenues, which
average no more than US$0.3 per in-and-out passenger).                   The projection assumes that the
passenger departure fee will be raised as in Cairo to an average o f US$11.5 per outgoing
passenger. As inthe case o f CAI, the additional space and commercial dynamism to be brought
in by the private operator is expected to expand the commercial revenue base and raise an
incremental US$0.7 per in-and-out passenger. The same fee o f for use o f the weighing counter
will be added (US$0.95 on average).

InvestmentCosts

       The project investment package, excluding taxes (only applying to equipment), but
including physical contingencies, amounts to US$54.5 million. Construction o f the new terminal
will span two years, and expenditures per year would be US$21.0 in2004, US$32.8 in2005 and
US$0.7 in 2006. No renewal of equipment is foreseen within the project's analytical timeframe
(ending in 2025). A residual value equivalent to 40 percent o f project investment costs
corresponding to the infrastructure (consistent with a 40-year economic life) i s credited in2025.

MainAssumptionsUsed

Traffic

           With the project, the intemational and localtraffic would grow annually by five
           percent and two percent respectively. Inaddition, intemational traffic would grow by
           33 percent within two years after commissioning o f the new terminal to traffic.
           Based on these assumptions, the airport's new capacity o f six millionpassenger
           would be saturated by 2015. Domestic traffic would grow from 0.6 million
           passengers in2005 to nearly 0.75 million in2015. Corresponding data for
           intemationalpassenger are 2.4 million and 5.25 millionpassengers. Once the new
           capacity is saturated, local traffic growth would fall to 0.5 percent per year, and
           intemational traffic would decrease slightly, which would be consistent with the
           overall capacity constraint.

           Without the project, existingcapacities wouldbe saturated in2004, andoverall traffic
           would stagnate. Domestic traffic is still assumed to grow by one percent p.a. until
           2015, and by 0.5 percent thereafter. Internationaltraffic would decrease from close to
           2.5 million in2004 to 2.2 millionin2025.

Expenses

           Costs are expressed inconstant dollars.

           Working expenses, which are limitedto operation andmaintenance of the new
           terminal building, are estimated at 3.5 percent o finvestment costs, including labor
           (unlike Cairo, SSH is not overstaffed andwill need to hire additional staff). Based on
           the assumption presented by EAC, the private management fee would addUS$1.8
           million to the first year's cost of operation, andwould increase inrelation to traffic
           through its ten-year duration. From 2016, one-third o fthat cost is held constant, as
           SSH internalizespart o f the costs to upgrade management.




           Additional traffic. Benefits are based on anaverage revenue o f US$9per passenger,
           excluding incremental commercial revenue.

       m     Expansion ofthe commercial revenue base. The "without project'' intemational
             traffic would spend an incrementalUS$0.7 per passenger, and the incremental
             intemational traffic would generate revenue o f US$1perpassenger.

             Revenue netted by Egyptfrom tourism. Average spendingby tourist is taken as 75
             percent o f the one calculated for CAI, or some US$650 net o f taxes. Revenue netted
             byEgypt is five percent o faverage spending, andonly twenty percent is deemed lost
             without the project (meaning that 80 percent o f tourists would go to another seaside
             resort anyway).

             Timesavings. Most passengerscome to vacation, andtime lost intransit has no
             impact on economic production.

Results

Based on the above assumptions, the economic rate o f return (ERR) is 27.6 percent, and the
NPV, discounted at ten percent, is US$122 million. Table 3.B provides the flow o f costs and
benefits.    Given the high ERR, which is not surprising for an airport project dealing with
tourism, no sensitivity analysis is warranted.

                 C.      FinancialAnalysis of CairoAirport Company(CAC)

Past andCurrentCAC Performance

Accounts produced for FY2001 through FY2003 show CAC as a profitable enterprise. The
unified accounting system used in Egypt is close to standard international accounting, yet
includes presentational specificities (e.g. calculation o f virtual capital costs inrelation to equity,
and virtual rental costs based on land owned by the company) that required some retreatment o f
data. Changes in the distribution o f gross revenues between CAC and the Civil Aviation Fund
were brought about by Law No. 93 o f June 2003.            Whereas sixty percent o f the passenger
departure fee and fifty percent o f the parking fee would accrue to the latter, the new system
provides CAC to pay thirty percent o f its gross revenue from airside activities (except parking),
and repayment by the Fund o f 55 percent o f what it collects in support o f CAC's development
program (the actual Fund's share o f gross revenue is therefore limited to 9.4 percent). CAC
applied for an increase inthe passenger departure fee and the creation o f a weighing counter fee,
as mentioned in the economic analysis.        Both fees are expected to be collected at above-
mentioned rates beginning in2004. CAC employs close to 4,000 staff, but only needs one-third
o f this amount. However, its compensation policy keep labor costs to stay at no more than one-
third o fworking expenses. Annual depreciation is low reflectingthe lack of large investments in
recent years and the predominance o f aged assets. In FY2003, the outstanding long-term debt
stood at LE118 million and represented no more than 14percent o f CAC's equity. Both the low
depreciation and interest payments contributed to relatively large profits, which increased from
LE59 million in FY2001 to LE68 million in FY2003. About 75 percent o f after tax income is
distributed. Of the remaining 25 percent, up to five percent goes to the legal reserve and up to
twenty percent to other reserves. Taxation is normally calculated at 42.5 percent o fbenefits, but
some items are exempt from taxes, and the actual taxation o f benefits is around one-third. CAC
does need to enlarge its cash generation, which the requested tariff increase would achieve.

MainAssumptionsUsedinthe FinancialProjection

A financial model, linkedto the economic andthe project cost models, was developed to project
CAC's future financial performance. The revenues collected by CAC are generated from airside
and landside activities. The former include aircraft landing fees, airport parking and waiting
charges, passenger (departure) fees, disembarkation fees, loading bridges, handling charges
(ground and ramp), cargo handling, and heling fees. The latter are generated from duty-free
shops, restaurants, car parking, rental (counter) space for airlines and other commercial
operations, and entrance fees from well-wishers. Main assumptions used are as follows:
         .
           Higher rates for passenger departure and weighing counter fees effective in 2004.
           No other tariff increase is envisaged throughout the projection period. However,
           some 64 percent o f revenues (airside) are payable inforeign currency.
           Based on the Bank's projection o f local and foreign inflation, the Egyptian Pound is
           expected to depreciate against the US$. These exchange rates are used for conversion
           inEgyptianPounds o fforeign currency denominatedtariff.

                 Revenues are based on traffic growth assumptions used inthe economic analysis.
                 Commercial revenue will rise for several reasons: (i) rates will increase by two
                                                                                      rental
                percent annually to partly compensate for inflation; (ii) will be pushed up by 15
                                                                                          rates
                percent in FY2008, when larger and better quality commercial spaces become
                 available; and (iii) contracts signed for parking, as well as other contracts to be
                                       recent
                 signed prior to completion o f project investments will allow physical expansion o f
                 activities from an index o f 100 in 2003 to an index o f 115 in2007. The activity will
                 expand by 74 percent following commissioning o f the new terminal.                                       These
                 assumptions entail that commercial revenues will increase from about LE100 million
                 inFY2003 to around LE250millioninFY2009.
                Labor costs would increase by about ten percent p.a.
                 Other working expenseswill increase inrelation to inflation and (inpart) to growth in
                traffic. When TB3 is commissioned to traffic, operating and maintenance costs (net
                o f labor) are added (two percent o f the investment).
                75 percent o fbenefits are distributedthe year after they are earned.
                CAC would borrow the equivalent of LE1.9 billion from the Bank (2.5 percent
                interest, and 12 repayment annuities following a 5-year grace period). In addition
                CAC would pay a 0.75 percent commitment fee on the undisbursed loan amount.
                CAC will incur foreign exchange losses in relation to the Bank Loan. Provision for
                 such losses are included inCAC's balance sheet.
                CAC plans to borrow from the National Investment Bank to finance local costs.
                Lending terms include a 2-year period o f grace and 10repayment annuities.
                Working capital management was relatively adequate in past and current years and
                the faster collection o f invoices assumed here has minor financial impacts.

                 D.    FinancialAnalysis ofEgytianAirport Company(EAC)

Performanceof EAC

EAC owns the Sharm El Sheikh airport and its overall financial performance is bound to
influence project implementation and sustainability inrelation to this airport. Whereas CAC has
been an ongoing business for many years, the EAC was recently created and has not yet
completely sorted out its inventory o f assets, complications arising from EAC's regrouping other
Egyptian airports. The financial analysis o fpast and current data i s limited to FY2003, as this i s
the first year for which relatively reliable accounts are available. While airports under EAC's
control handle a combined traffic similar to that o f CAC, EAC staffing is much lower with
around 1,300 employees at present.       EAC also benefits from Law No. 93 o f 2003, which
provides more freedom to set tariffs and, beginning in January 2004, revenues are expected to
double when departure fees for international passengers will increase from US$5 per passenger
to US$15 per passenger (abou LE andLErespectively at present). Onthe one hand, EACruns at
lower costs as it mostly handles domestic and charter traffic. At the same time, EAC faces high
development costs given that strong growth intraffic will necessitate faster construction o f larger
facilities. Although not yet finalized, EAC's income statement for FY2003 shows a net income
o f LE11.9 million, which is quite satisfactory. The higher tariff that will soon apply will triple
EAC's capacity to generate cash, and allow E A C to finance the costs o f planned expansions.

Table 1 shows the evolution o f the income statement over FY04-FY08. E A C is expected to
generate substantial benefits roughly equivalent to around 30 percent o f its yearly turnover. The
working ratio would stay below 0.2 which is quite low.

Table 2 shows how the balance sheet would evolve over FY04-FY08 and that the indebtedness
would remain at moderate level throughout the period despite increased resort to borrowings to
finance   the development o f Sham El Sheikh and other airports (the debt to equity ratio would
peak at 34:66 inFY2007).

Finally, as shown in Table 3, EAC will be able to finance its sizeable investment program and
still strengthen its cash position. The debt service coverage ratio would bottom out at 1.9 in
FY2005 then rise above 2 in subsequent years. Overall, E A C should be able to maintain a
healthy financial status during and after implementatonofthe investment inShann El Sheikh.

SharmElSheikhAirport (SSH)

Although SSH is part o f the EAC, it is the site where the second project investment will be
carried out, which raises the question o f whether or not the airport would make a positive
contribution to EAC. To address this question, a more cursory analysis was developed, which
consisted o f developing an income statement and simplified cash flow statement (the latter does
not include increases inworking capital).

The main assumptions used inthe financial analysis are as follows:

           Revenuewill grow inrelation to traffic growth (as assumed inthe economic analysis)
           and the higher tariff (departure passenger fee,weighing counter fee). They will also
           increase as the main source o f revenue is priced in US$ which is expected to
           appreciate against the EgyptianPound.
           Revenue from commercial services will rise from tariff adjustments to compensate
           for inflation o f around four percent p.a. and from a tripling o f activity after the new
           terminal's opening in2006.
           Labor costs will increase by ten percent annually until the new terminal's opening.
           Staffing is then assumed to increase as a proportion of the new to the old capacity
           multiplied by a reduction coefficient o f 0.6 (not all positions will need to be
           duplicated).
           Other working expenses will increase according to growth in traffic (one-third o f
           traffic growth) and inflation until opening o f the new terminal, when they will
           increase by 50 percent.
           The contribution to the Aviation Fund was stated by E H C A A N as seven percent o f
           revenue.
           In2005, the aiport will pay a management fee to the private operator, calculated as
           seven percent o f revenue.
           Project investment costs including contingencies are estimated at US$60.6 million
           (EP391 million).
           The portion o f the Bank Loan to be used for SSH is around US$42 million (LE274
           million).   Foreign exchanges losses will be incurred and are recognized in the
           financial projection. Although the Bank Loan would be serviced by EAC, the
           assumptions on the grace period, rate o f interest, commitment fee and repayment
           annuities are the same as for CAC.

The following table presents the results o f the financial projections, and confirms that SSH
would be a net contributor to EAC.

Projected FundsFlow Statement for EHCAAN

E H C A A N i s a holding and its financial status hinges on that of its affiliates. The above analyses
cover two of them, CAC and EAC. The other two affiliates (NANSC and AVIT) have not been
reviewed in detail as the main one (NANSC) is not involved in project implementation and the
other (AVIT) i s of marginal importance. The failure of one o f these two affiliates would not
affect the financial status of C A C and EAC which are independent. E H C A A " s projected

This statement shows that EHCAAN will generate substantial cash from its four affiliates over
the period. The statement is incomplete as it does not show any inflow and outflow related to
borrowings and debt servicing because E H C A A N will get from each o f its affiliate the funds it
needs to service the debt assigned under the Project Agreement. CAC and EAC were shown
capable to service their respective debt and the positive contribution o f AVIT to EHCAAN
suggests that it will also be able to service its own debt which will be limited to the IT
equipment. The large cash surpluses accumulated by EHCAAN will be enough to service the
small AVIT, should AVIT fail to meet its commitments.

Fiscal Impact

Since the sector's restructuring in2003, both the CAC and the EAC have been corporatized. The
assessments indicate that there i s a strong likelihood that once completed, the revenues generated
bybothnew terminals will be sufficient to cover the incremental operating costs anddebt service
requirements o f the project. As such, financial support from the E H C A A Nis not envisaged. On
the other hand, once the terminals become operational, the EHCAAN stands to benefit from an
increase intaxes that will be generated by the capacity to accommodate ever-increasing volumes
o f passenger traffic, and from better exploitation o f commercial activities under the private
management contracts.

                                    Annex 10: SafeguardPolicyIssues
                          EG-AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

Environmental Safeguard Issues. The Project has been classified as a Category A as terminal
buildings andnew runway will produce impacts from noise and air pollution that will potentially
be significant for a number o f people living in residential areas beside the airports. These
populations may also be affectedbyinducedimpacts, such as an increase intraffic congestion. It
should be noted that there will also be a number o f nominal benefits resulting from these
projects, including improved waste management, implementation o f a noise and air quality
monitoring programs.

The major environmental issues that canbe mitigated are:

Air Pollution. The results o f model calculations of emissions and concentrations o f nitrogen
oxides (Nox) carbon monoxide( CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and volatile organic compounds
(VOC) around the two airports have indicated that the contribution from the airport on a local
andregional scale is small. The emission rates for SO2 from aircraft operations is normally only
five percent to ten percent of the NOx emissionrates dependent upon the fuel quality. It has also
been shown that the total emissions from aviation normally do not contribute much to national
total emissions.

Noise. Noise generated from the operation o f TB3 itself will unlikely be a significant
environmental and social impact for the surrounding residential areas, compared to other noise
generating activities at Cairo Airport, i.e. aircraft movements. This is largely due to the fact that
the TB3 facility itself will emit little noise and Noise Sensitive Receivers (NSRs) are some
distance from the TB3 facility. The level o f noise at some locations in SES, however, will
exceed the limits as prescribed by Egyptian and International Laws. The Project will, therefore,
establish a noise monitoring network and will enforce noise by regulating the traffic and landing
andtake offhours o faircraft.

Traffic. The new Terminal Building3 will increase the airport's capacity by some 11million
passengers per year.     Subsequent growth in airport traffic will result in an increase in the
airport's vehicular traffic, thus affecting the performance o f both the airport itself, in terms o f
available parking spaces and entrance/exit gate capacities, and the main accessroads. The future
parking demand and entry/exit vehicular facilities fall broadly within the proposed capacity o f
the new terminal buildingand will be sufficient to accommodate the forecast future traffic. It is
only around year 2020 that additional booths would be required. Duringthe operation phase o f
SES, a traffic conflict will occur at the airport gate. This will be a probable cause o f congestion
that can lead to delays and traffic congestion that could cause a delay o f twenty minutes per day
for the traffic volume. The delay value could reach o f 52 minutes per day by the year 2020.

Two dimensions o f mitigation measures are, therefore, proposed to solve the anticipated traffic
congestion - short-term measures that aim at limiting the direct impacts o f airport traffic on the
airport access roads, and long-term measures that would look at ways o f minimizing the impacts
of both airport and background traffic on the airports main entrances and access roads. The




                                                  78

project will finance a strategic environmental assessment as part o f the TB3 master plan to
propose mitigating measures to reduce traffic congestion.

The main findings o f the EAs, as well as the mitigating measures covering the main components
o fthe project, are summarized inthe Environment Management Plans on the followingpages.

Social Safeguard Issues. Within the context o f the environmental assessments (EnA), two
concise and distinct Social Assessments (SoA) were undertaken, as were stakeholder
consultations, for the thirdterminal at CAI and the new terminal at SSH. Stakeholders included
households o f all socioeconomic conditions living in neighbourhoods surrounding the airport,
businessmen, representatives o f the private sector, particularly tourism, and airport employees
and officials. Fifty-seven percent o f the respondents welcomed the proposed extension because
of the potential for employement opportunities, new sources o f livelihood and the improved
services it would bring to their businesses and in their neighbourhoods. The remaining forty-
three percent, although recognizing the positive aspects o f the extension, feared an increase in
noise and air pollution.

For the communities surrounding CAI, the issue o f increased noise levels is their number one
concern. Forty three percent o f the respondents inCairo do not believe that protective measures
will be taken by the public authorities to protect the communities against the increased noise that
the will be created as a result o f the new terminal (inSSH, 16percent o frespondents voiced this
concern). The matter o f increased noise levels is addressed in the Environmental Management
Plans.

The SoA for conducted for'SSH revealed that 84 percent o f the respondents welcomed the
proposed new terminal, where the situation is different from that o f CAI. The airport is much
smaller and is not over-staffed. Airport workers are particularity supportive o f the project and
believe that the new terminal will create job opportunities. Furthermore, consultations with
airport employees, officials and businessmen helped identify security and design issues, as well
as previous mistakes. These lessons were taken into consideration inthe preparation and design
o fthe new terminal.

Interms of social safeguards, OD 4.20 and OP 4.11respectively related to indigenous peoples
and cultural property are not applicable, as both sites are public lands, are not inhabited, and are
not known to have archeological or cultural values.

Three Land Acquisition Assessments (LAA)were prepared for the project (two for TB3 and one
for SSH). The results show that the sites designated for the construction o f a third terminal and
an additional runway at Cairo International Airport are state owned, have been fenced for the last
twenty years, and legally transferred to the Cairo Airport Company. The future site o f the third
terminal i s presently used for public parking, and provisions are being made to provide an
alternative parking site. The site for an additional runway is not used or leased for any economic
activity. Both sites are locatedwithin CAC's overall property and are free of claims.

The LAA for the new terminal at Sharm El Sheikh Airport (SSH) revealed that the land is state
property legally transferred to the Egyptian Airports Company (EAC). It is fenced, adjacent to



                                                 79

the existingterminal, and surrounded by more land belonging to the EAC. Presently, the land is
not used for any economic activity and there are no claims on it. As such, OP/BP 4.12 related to
Involuntary Resettlement will not be triggered for any o fthe proposed sites.
