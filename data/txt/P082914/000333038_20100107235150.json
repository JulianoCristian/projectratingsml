Development\n            Project for Egypt were as follows: outcomes were highly\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            sector reform can only be progressive and the Bank's\n            support through a large scale investment lending operation\n            can make a difference, if provided through an early dialogue\n            during implementation, and focused on strategic aspects,\n            high policy advice, and game changing issues. Management\n            contracts are an effective Public Private Partnerships (PPP)\n            model to foster the modernization of economically viable\n            public entities, enhance operational and financial\n            performance, and transfer know-how, especially when private\n            partners are competitively selected at an early stage, on\n            the basis of well prepared bidding documents. Large\n            infrastructure investments like airports can successfully\n            contribute to a country's economic development, through\n            regional integration, facilitation of trade, increased\n            currency earning tourism, and direct job creation from\n            attracted economic activities when a critical mass is\n            achieved. The Bank's attention and responsiveness\n            during preparation and a strong support all along the\n            project implementation is instrumental for the success of a\n            project. The demonstration of solid knowledge and timely\n            delivery of projects enhances the Bank-country relationship.\n            The quality, completeness, and relevance of the design, as\n            well as a strong engineer during construction, can\n            significantly contribute to controlling final costs."}, "docdt": "2009-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
