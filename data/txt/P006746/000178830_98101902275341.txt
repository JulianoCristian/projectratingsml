INTERNATIONAL BANIK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMEN'-
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones, with the guarantee of the
Republic of Colombia, for the equivalent of US$60 million to help finance a
fourth telecommunications project. The loan will have a term of 17 years,
including a grace period of 3-1/2 years, with interest at 8.2% per annum. The
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) would provide additional financing of
US$29 million, of which US$13 million, is local currency. The IDB loan would
have a term of 30 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 2% per
annum and additional charges of 1-1/2% per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Colombia (1548-CO) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on May 13, 1977. It assesses current developments and
provides a medium-term perspective of the Colombian economy. Country data
sheets are provided in Annex 1.
Background
3.        During the past two decades substantial structural transformation
has taken place in the Colombian economy. The country has made impressive
progress in the transition from a predominantly rural and agricultural economy
made up of largely self-contained regions to an urban industrial economy, more
oriented toward international trade. Broadening of the country's productive
base has been accompanied by rapid growth of nontraditional exports (those
other than coffee) and development of a modern sector which relies to a
considerable extent on imported inputs. From 1967 to 1975 GDP rose by an
average 6.4% per annum in real terms, well above the historical average of
less than 5% (1950-67), and real per capita income increased by an average
annual 3.6%. Two mutually dependent phenomena, increased investment and
relaxation of the foreign exchange constraint, have been the major factors in
bringing about this acceleration. Merchandise exports have expanded more than
three-fold since 1967 and, most significantly, nontraditional exports have
become an increasingly important source of foreign exchange earnings, growing
from 27% of merchandise exports to about 50% at present. Much of this increase
was the result of both product and market diversification, especially of manu-
factured exports, as the share of total exports shipped to Latin American
countries more than doubled. Despite the substantial progress, Colombia still
remains essentially an underdeveloped country with a limited modern sector
superimposed on a large, traditional, and poor base.



- 2 -
4.        When the present Government took office in August 1974, the country
was faced with several adverse developments -- weakening balance of payments
situation, impending loss of self-sufficiency in petroleum production, infla-
tion, deterioration of public finances, and reduction in public investment --
which threatened to interrupt the high growth rate achieved by Colombia in
recent years. The new administration embarked upon an economic stabilization
program with the aim of restoring the basis for sustained economic growth.
In line with this, it implemented basic reforms of the fiscal, monetary
and price systems.
5.        To help strengthen public finances, the new Government implemented
a tax reform which covered almost every important component of the tax system
and represented a significant improvement in terms of progressivity and elas-
ticity. The Government also made certain changes in the financial system with
the purpose of stimulating private savings and improving the allocational
efficiency of the financial system.   The action included a restructuring of
interest rates, simplification of the complex reserve system, and elimination
of many of the more rigid and cumbersome controls.
6.        The Government also took steps to correct major distortions which
existed in the price system. Price controls on a number of important agri-
cultural products were removed. In May 1976, the Government introduced
far-reaching modifications in its petroleum pricing policy which aim at
regaining self-sufficiency in production of crude petroleum by improving
incentives for exploration and exploitation. Under the new policy, foreign
oil companies are now paid the international price of crude CIF Cartagena
for new petroleum produced in association with the government petroleum cor-
poration.   (Previously the foreign oil companies received less than US$7 per
barrel for new crude.) The Government is also encouraging incremental produc-
tion from existing fields and, in this connection, eliminated the special
petroleum exchange rate, effectively increasing the price of crude oil
by about 20%. Furthermore, retail prices of gasoline have been raised in
successive steps from US$0.11/gallon in August 1975 to US$0.27/gallon in
January 1977, or by almost 150%. The Government proposes to continue this
policy until the prices of gasoline and other petroleum derivatives approach
international prices.
7.        Economic growth slowed in 1975 (from 6% in 1974 to about 5%) and
unemployment increased, reflecting both the impact of the stabilization
measures adopted at the end of 1974 and the effects of the world recession.
Towards the end of the year the economy began to recover, stimulated by
increased exports, larger agricultural output and heightened industrial
activity. The recovery continued in 1976 with real GDP growing by about 6%.
During 1974-76 National Government savings increased substantially; due to
the 1974 Tax Reform, tax revenues increased by over 40% a year while nominal
GDP grew at an annual rate of about 30%. Private savings mobilized through
the financial system also increased rapidly, growing by almost 50% a year
during 1974-76.  Mloreover, the balance of payments turned favorable in 1975
as a result of the sharp increase in world coffee prices and expansion of



non-coffee agricultural exports.  The favorable balance of payments perfor-
mance continued in 1976 with foreign exchange reserves reaching almost
US$1,150 million, sufficient to cover over 5 months' imports. With increased
export earnings, the public debt-service ratio declined from 17.0% in 1974 to
11.7% in 1975 and about 11.4% in 1976.  However, despite strengthening of the
Government's monetary and fiscal policies (which had reduced inflation from
27% in 1974 to 18% in 1975), the rate of inflation increased to 26% in 1976.
Colombia, through a combination of domestic policies and fortuitous external
developments, has come through the period of world recession and economic
adjustment with a strong foreign exchange reserve position and a rapidly
recovering domestic economy.
Recent Economic Performance
8.        The economic forces have continued to be favorable.   Coffee prices
are high and the balance of payments remains strong; foreign exchange reserves
stood at more than US$1,400 million at the end of the first quarter of 1977,
the highest level in Colombia's history. The increased demand generated by
the higher incomes of the coffee producers has been a powerful stimulus to the
economy. Real GDP growth in 1977 is projected at 7%. As a result, urban un-
employment, down from about 13% in 1974 to about 9% by end-1976, is expected
to decline further.
9.        The inflow of foreign exchange from coffee sales has, however, led
to a resurgence of inflation and this has prompted the Government to continue
to give priority to short-term management of demand. Several measures have
been taken. Legal reserve requirements have been increased and limitations
on private external borrowing have been established. Import duties have been
drastically reduced to shift part of the inflationary pressures to the exter-
nal sector. Fiscal management was quite restrictive in 1976; the Treasury
accounts had a surplus, which was used for repayment of the Government's
short-term domestic debt. Almost two-thirds of coffee earnings are being
kept from increasing the monetary base by measures adopted recently. /1 The
Government's liberalized import policy will (although with a lag) increase the
supply of goods, thus dampening pressure on domestic prices. Nevertheless,
inflationary pressures are likely to persist.   Even after the sterilization
measures taken, the record coffee export receipts will add to the monetary
expansion. Furthermore, current price and cost trends (the Government is
attempting to hold wage increases in the public sector to 18%, but private
sector wages will probably increase substantially more) as well as "corrective"
adjustments in public-service prices make substantial deceleration of price
/1   The measures are:  15% of payments to coffee producers to be made in
three-year compulsory savings certificates; an increase in the coffee
retention tax from 23% to 46%, and investment of a substantial portion
of this tax, including the four percentage points received by the Coffee
Federation, in Government bonds.

increases unlikely during 1977. However, the rate of inflation is expected
to decline over the medium term as the Government remains strongly committed
to reducing inflation and its monetary, fiscal and trade measures begin to
take effect. Although the reserves being built up during the "coffee boom"
strengthen Colombia's longer-term prospects, the rapid increases in liquidity
add to the difficulties of short-term economic management and illustrate the
special problems facing economies with a heavy reliance on a single export
commodity. Although inflation needs to be brought under control, the economy
seems now poised for a period of rapid growth.
Development Strategy and Prospects
10.       The Government's development strategy is embodied in the 1975-78
development plan. The plan aims at creating the conditions necessary for sub-
stantially reducing unemployment through increased capital accumulation in the
private sector, improvement in the efficiency of the price system in order to
encourage more labor-intensive production techniques and expansion of public
investment. The plan places increased emphasis on the need to strengthen
public sector institutions; particularly, public enterprises are in the future
to earn a satisfactory rate of return on their revalued assets and financial
intermediaries are to maintain the real value of their capital. In terms of
public investment, the main thrust will be on providing adequate economic
infrastructure to stimulate rapid growth and employment in industry and agri-
culture, as well as on socially oriented projects to help eradicate rural and
urban poverty. Within infrastructure, special priority has been assigned to
the development of domestic energy sources to help reduce the country's
impending dependence on imported energy. Also, the Government continues to
stress agriculture because it is in the rural areas where the greatest con-
centration of poverty exists and in agricultural activities where increases in
employment can be most quickly achieved.    Commercial agriculture is to receive
support due to its strong contribution to export as well as employment growth.
A substantial portion of public expenditures is being reoriented toward
nutrition and primary education programs which affect the productivity of the
poorest 50% of the population.   Policies for promoting decentralization of
industry away from the largest cities have been adopted to accelerate inte-
gration of more backward areas into the modern sector of the economy.
11.       Colombia's strong balance-of-payments prospects for the immediate
future should make it possible in 1977 for the country to resume the high rate
of growth of GDP (6-7%) achieved in the early 1970s.    Export prospects for the
next several years are excellent, as world coffee prices remain strong and
economic growth is resuming in the industrialized countries. With the contin-
uation of appropriate incentives, minor exports should grow very rapidly once
again. Manufactured exports--textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, mechanical
and electrical equipment, and paper products--are over the long-term expected
to lead this recuperation, along with non-coffee agricultural exports.    Given
the improved outlook for coffee, Colombia is likely to maintain a favorable
trade balance throughout the late 1970s.   Under these circumstances an annual
growth rate of GDP of about 7.4% is expected to be accompanied by a 10% annual
increase of imports in real terms.   In light of favorable external economic



- 5 -
conditions and domestic policies the marginal savings rate over this period
is projected to be about 30% and public sector savings are projected to be
about 8% of GDP. However, Colombia's public sector investment program calls
for a high level of expenditures if both economic and social objectives are to
be fulfilled. Capital expenditures are expected to be about 10% of GDP.
Consequently, Colombia will continue to require substantial capital inflows
to bridge the savings/investment gap of the public sector.
12.       Colombia is expected to require gross capital inflows of US$4.2
billion during the five-year period 1977-82, of which almost US$350 million
will be disbursed from commitments made through the end of 1976. To attain
this level, annual gross capital inflow will have to increase from US$421
million in 1976 to US$990 million in 1982. Direct foreign investment is
expected to provide only a small part (8%) of the required capital inflow,
with approximately 50% being provided by official multilateral and bilateral
sources and the remainder by suppliers', financial and other credits from
private sources.
13.       Colombia's public external debt repayable in foreign currency
amounted to US$3.3 billion at the end of 1976, or about US$2.6 billion excluding
undisbursed commitments. The Bank Group's share of this external debt (dis-
bursed only) as of the end of 1976 was about 28% and is expected to decline
to about 25% by 1982. Service on this debt was about 11.4% of exports of goods
and non-factor services in 1976, and is projected to remain at that level,
assuming recovery of minor exports and the favorable outlook for coffee over
the next few years. Balance-of-payments prospects beyond 1980 will depend to
a significant extent on the results of petroleum exploration and on progress
made in implementation of several resource-based export projects currently
under preparation. The Bank's share of public debt service in 1976 was about
26% and is expected to decline marginally to 25% by 1982. With the maintenance
of sound economic and financial policies, Colombia should have no difficulty
securing or servicing the external capital it needs.
PART II:   BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
14.       The proposed loan, the 66th to be made to Colombia, would bring the
total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$1,421.4 million (net of cancel-
lations). Of this amount, US$1,040.4 million is now held by the Bank; IDA made
one credit of US$19.5 million for highways in Colombia in 1961. Disbursements
have been completed on 43 loans and the IDA credit. IFC has made effective
investments and underwriting commitments of US$51.2 million in 23 enterprises
and now holds US$28.5 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and the IDA credit as of March 31, 1977 and IFC investments as of
April 30, 1977. The Annex also contains summaries on the execution of the
22 on-going projects.



- 6 -
15.       Since FY68, Bank lending in Colombia has become more diversified and
has been concentrated on production-oriented programs and activities which
carried social as well as economic benefits. Eight of the eleven agricultural
loans have been made since then, six of the nine loans for industry, all three
loans in the education sector and all six loans for water supply and sewerage.
This compares with only seven loans since FY68 in the power and transport
sectors.
16.       Bank lending to Colombia in FY76 consisted of one loan for develop-
ment finance companies totalling US$80 million. The FY77 program includes
the recently approved Integrated Rural Development and Second Agricultural
Credit Projects, the proposed Fourth Telecommunications Project, a proposed
Seventh Highway Project and a proposed small-scale industry project. Work
is also under way in nutrition and health, development finance companies, slum
improvement, power, water supply and sewerage, mining, small farm development
and agricultural extension for possible consideration by the Executive Directors
during the next two years.
17.       In lending to Colombia, the Bank tries to assist the Government in
achieving four major objectives. These objectives are interdependent and com-
plementary. One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more widely
than before and, more particularly, to attack directly the problem of rural
poverty. A second objective is to help Colombia expand output, including
exports, by supporting projects that directly or indirectly make large contri-
butions to production and employment. A third objective is to support programs
that will bring about improvements in the management of the economy and, par-
ticularly, that will help to strengthen public institutions and financial
intermediaries. A fourth objective is to transfer sufficient external re-
sources to complement Colombia's domestic savings and provide the necessary
funds for maintaining an adequate level of economic and social investments in
a framework of sound domestic finances and a viable balance of payments.
18.       The operations of external lenders in Colombia are shown in Annex I.
While IBRD, IDB, and AID provided about 75% of total external financing to
Colombia in the 1961-72 period, their share has decreased since then to
approximately 40%. Like the Bank, IDB and AID have given increased emphasis
to social projects. For instance, the IDB has assisted projects in low cost
housing, rural development, agrarian reform, university education, water
supply, and land erosion. AID has supported programs in education, urban
development and small farm development. More recently, it has moved to small
project loans aimed chiefly at improving the distribution of income. It is
expected to phase out its aid program in Colombia in the current year.

PART III: THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
19.       Colombia is a country of about 24 million people distributed in a
number of distinct regions which, for the most part, are divided by mountain
ridges. In the west, there are the densely populated centers isolated from
each other by high mountain chains, while in the east, there are numerous
sparsely populated districts, in the Llanos and Amazon Regions. In these
conditions, adequate transport and communication play a vital role in facil-
itating and coordinating the flow of goods and services. The Government, in
its 1975-78 development plan, has given high priority to regional integration
and development. Consistent with this, it is expanding the country's infra-
structure, including communication facilities, to help bring about more
balanced regional growth and, in this way, give far more people in the country
an opportunity to participate in the production process.
20.       Telecommunications services in Colombia have developed in diverse
ways. Local telephone services have been legally and practically the domain
of municipal and state governments. As a result there have been as many as
61, and currently are 48, independent entities providing telephone services.
Long distance telephone and international telephone and telegraph services
were initially operated by foreign companies under Government concessions,
while the national telegraph system was operated by the Ministry of Communica-
tions itself. In 1947, the Government created the autonomous Empresa Nacional
de Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM) to operate and develop long distance services.
TELECOM subsequently obtained control and sole responsibility for operating
international telegraph and telephone services as well as domestic telegraph
service. TELECOM has been responsible for telex services since their initia-
tion. Also in recent years, TELECOM has acquired responsibility for some of
the local telephone services, principally in rural and semi-urban areas.
21.       The Ministry of Communications exercises regulatory control over the
sector. It is responsible for sector policy, licensing and regulation of the
various entities operating in the sector. The National Planning Department
decides upon investment priorities within the sector and approves the invest-
ment plans proposed by the different agencies. The sector's tariffs are
established by the National Tariff Board (NTB), which is chaired by the Chief
of the National Planning Department. The Ministry of Communications partici-
pates in NTB whenever revisions to telecommunication tariffs are being consid-
ered. After NTB approves the level and structure of tariffs, the entities
can introduce tariffs up to the level approved. The sharing of long-distance
telephone revenues between TELECOM and each of the telephone entities is
based on contracts between TELECOM and each of the entities.
Existing Telecommunication services
22.       The number of telephone subscribers has more than doubled in the
last ten years. As of December 31, 1975, Colombia had an installed capacity



- 8 -
of 968,000 _ires and 830,000 subscribers' connections.    With 5.5 telephones
per 100 pcpula:_on as of January 1976, Colombia compares favorably with other
middle income countries. /1 However, the four largest cities, with less than
30% of tne Dccilation account for nearly 80% of the total, while the distribu-
tion of services to small urban and rural areas is limited in number as well
as quality. Only approximately 500 of the 4,500 rural communities have access
to telephone services. There is at the same time a very large unfilled demand
(presently estimated at about 250,000 lines) which together with extensive use
of existing lines by non-subscribers has resulted in a large amount of conges-
tion and substantial subscriber dissatisfaction. Long distance networks
similarly suffer from traffic congestion; however, largely as a result of the
previous Bank loans, the reliability and quality of the service has improved
drastically.
23.       Colombia is well served by telegraph, telex and international tele-
phone facilities. The 1,600 telegraph offices are spread throughout the
country so that all towns with a population of more than 3,000 have telegraph
facilities. The number of telex network subscribers has grown in recent
years, 5% annually during 1968-73 and 12% since then. It is expected that
subscribers will number about 4,600 by 1978. TELECOM plans to continue meet-
ing the entire demand for telex services. International telephone services
are also of a high quality with a total traffic of almost 4,000 calls a day.
Sector Problems
24.       Despite the rapid increase in both the quantity and quality of the
various telephone services, the local and internal long distance systems are
inadequate to satisfy the present economy's needs. Demand forecasts have
repeatedly been exceeded and congestion has become the rule rather than excep-
tion. In many of the municipally operated exchanges, there has been virtually
no growth during the past five years and no planning for future needs. In
TELECOM's local exchanges as well, which currently cover only 5% of the sub-
scribers, demand greatly exceeds supply. TELECOM, however, has prepared a
long-range plan and aims to fill nearly the entire demand in its exchanges by
1982.
25.       The fragmentation of the operations of the 48 telecommunication
entities has been largely responsible for the inadequacies of the system.
Most of the local entities do not have the capacity to manage their operations
effectively, let alone plan and implement an expansion program. Furthermore,
many have substantial financial difficulties as a result of poor financial
discipline, excessive use of short-term financing and inadequate tariffs.
Procurement practices are unsatisfactory and result in excessive costs. To
help overcome this problem, the Government has assumed many of the normal
/1   For comparison, the number of telephones per 100 population in a selected
group of countries was as follows (January 1976): Argentina 9.7, Brazil
3.1, Mexico 4.8, Costa Rica 5.6, and Malaysia 2.4.

functions of the entities but with limited success. The Government, there-
fore, iequested Bank assistance to complete a sector study to propose a course
of action (Telecommunications Sector Colombia (Report No. 663-CO), May 16,
1975). The sector study commented adversely on the fragmentation of telecom-
munication operations in Colombia and recommended, as a long-term objective,
that they should be consolidated into a single entity. The sector study also
suggested that procurement of all telecommunications equipment should be
centralized and that the structure and level of existing telephone tariffs
should be revised to compensate for the cost of rendering the service. The
sector study found wide disparities in the rates charged by the different
local telephone companies.
The Bank Role
26.       The Bank in its three previous loans to TELECOM aimed at (a) streng-
thening the institution; (b) extending telephone facilities to smaller towns
not yet serviced; and (c) installing and extending high quality long-distance
telecommunication facilities within Colombia. The Fourth Project would con-
tinue to support these objectives and would assist the Government in its
efforts to improve efficiency in the sector, particularly through the incor-
poration of local telephone entities into TELECOM. The project would help
expedite this process in two ways: by encouraging municipalities wishing to
expand telephone services to sell their enterprise to TELECOM and by allowing
TELECOM to utilize the investment for expansion as equity participation for
obtaining at least a controlling share in some of the municipal companies.
This approach is expected to promote development of the sector, with a conse-
quent reduction in operating costs from standardization and consolidation of
operations. The consolidation of the sector would also help establish uniform
tariffs throughout the country. Furthermore, it would permit bulk procurement
of the many investment items required by the small entities through interna-
tional competitive bidding with significant savings in equipment costs.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
Background and Objectives
27.       The proposed project follows three loans to TELECOM totalling US$46
million between 1967 and 1974. The first loan (499-CO) of US$16 million,
which is fully disbursed, was made to help finance the establishment of a
basic long distance network and for the expansion and improvement of national
and international telecommunications services. The second loan to TELECOM
(740-CO) of US$15 million, approved in 1971 and nearly fully disbursed,
financed the expansion of long distance facilities and the installation of
new local networks. Under the loan, TELECOM also retained technical and
financial consultants to assist in improving its operations. TELECOM, with
its own resources, has continued to use the consultants to further develop
its management and financial systems for a much larger and spread out organ-
ization. The third loan (1073-CO) of US$15 million, approved in 1975, consists



- io -
of further expansion of local and long distance service as well as assistance
for the purchase of telex equipment. Nearly one half of the loan has been
disbursed and all contracts have been awarded.
28.       The first two projects achieved their primary objectives of assisting
in the development of a high quality internal long distance system, helping
TELECOM expand modestly its services to rural areas and, most important, devel-
oping and strengthening an institution capable of operating and expanding
Colombia's telecommunications network. The third project is continuing with
that program and should be completed by December 1978.
29.       A Project Performance Audit Report of the first project (499-CO)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 19, 1976. While the
report commented favorably on the project, it pointed out the need to hasten
the speed of project execution and to improve TELECOM's efforts in collect-
ing overdue accounts receivable. Project execution has improved significantly
since the first project and accounts receivable have been reduced. Further-
more, current billings are now being collected without delays. In early 1977,
TELECOM obtained majority control over two municipal entities, and is negotia-
ting to purchase a third, all of which have had large overdue payments. For
the remainder of the overdue accounts receivable, largely of Government
entities and municipal telephone companies, TELECOM has agreed to prepare by
February 28, 1978, a plan satisfactory to the Government and the Bank, to
expedite collection of overdue receivables and to ensure continued prompt
collection of current billings in the future. (Section 5.09 of the Loan
Agreement).
30.       The proposed project aims at assisting TELECOM in the expansion of
its domestic operation and in managing effectively exchanges previously run
by about 32 entities. Specifically, the project is designed to: (a) integ-
rate a significant percentage of the smaller telephone entities into the
TELECOM system to improve services and efficiency; (b) provide access to
telephone service in rural areas; (c) upgrade and expand the long distance
network; and (d) expand local networks to meet part of the existing demand
for local connections.
31.       Negotiations were held in Bogota in April 1977 with a Colombian
delegation led by Dr. Gabriel Turbay Marulanda, Director General of Public
Credit, Ministry of Finance. A project appraisal report entitled "Colombia:
Fourth Telecommunications Project" (No. 1464a-CO dated May 25, 1977) is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the
loan and project are summarized in the Loan and Project Summary and in
Annex III.
Project Description, Cost and Financing
32.       The project consists of:   (a) the expansion of existing exchange
facilities by 95,000 lines primarily in small towns and rural areas; (b) con-
nection of about 75,000 subscribers; and (c) installation of microwave radio
and multiplex equipment to increase circuit capacity by about 8,800 internal



- 11 -
long distance circuits. A portion of the long distance circuits are to meet
the increased demand resulting from the provision under the project, and with
the assistance of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), of public tele-
phone service to about 2,200 rural communities in 21 departments where such
service is lacking or deficient.
33.       The cost of the project is estimated at about US$167.7 million
(Col$7,937.4 million). Foreign exchange expenditures are estimated at about
US$101.3 million (Col$4,768.0 million), or 60% of the total project cost. The
cost estimates are based on prices paid by TELECOM in recent contracts updated
to December 1976. The price contingencies amount to 23% of total project
costs and are based on estimates of the yearly price increases. Since the
equipment needs of the project are based on detailed forecasts and engineering,
no physical contingencies have been provided. A 5% contingency was provided
for civil works to allow for variations in quantities.
34.       The proposed Bank loan of US$60 million would cover about 36% of
total project costs and about 59% of foreign exchange costs. Of the remaining
US$41.3 million in foreign exchange costs, the IDB is providing US$16 million,
in a loan already approved, and TELECOM the remaining US$25.3 million. The IDB
will also finance the equivalent of US$13 million in Colombian pesos of local
currency costs. TELECOM will provide the remaining US$53.4 million of local
currency costs.
Project Execution and Organization
35.       TELECOM would implement the proposed project.    Its staff would pre-
pare engineering designs and bid documents, evaluate bids and draw up equip-
ment contracts. TELECOM would also lay, joint and commission all distribution
cables and would supervise construction of cable ducts constructed by local
contractors. All installation and maintenance of equipment would be carried
out by TELECOM's technical staff. Where new technologies are involved,
TELECOM would install equipment with the support of the manufacturer's special-
ist staff. TELECOM would carry out acceptance tests of all installed equip-
ment. TELECOM's management is experienced and capable of handling all of the
above activities.
36.       TELECOM is managed by a Board of Directors appointed by the President
of the Republic with the Minister of Communications as the ex-officio Chairman
of the Board. Day-to-day operations, of course, are the responsibility of the
President, also appointed by the President of the Republic, with the assis-
tance of five vice presidents (engineering, operations, integration, indus-
trial relations and finance). As of December 31, 1976, TELECOM had a total
of about 13,000 staff, of which about 9,000 were being used in telephone oper-
ations and about 4,000 in telegraph and telex operations. The existing staff
is considered adequate for the level of operations. Pay scales are attractive
and staff turnover is low. TELECOM has no difficulty recruiting qualified
professional, technical and administrative staff. During the project period,
TELECOM would recruit 4,000 additional staff, of which 1,000 would be tech-
nical and financial staff, about 2,000 operational and administrative staff
and about 1,000 telegraph operating staff. TELECOM operates several training
centers to prepare new staff.



- 12 -
Integration of Local Telephone Services
37.       Following on the recommendations of the May 1975 sector study,
TELECOM, with the agreement of the Government, has been purchasing smaller
local telephone companies. The project would support this effort and would
provide the necessary equipment for the exchanges of local telephone entities
to be acquired by TELECOM. The cost of this equipment will be TELECOM's pay-
ment for taking at least a controlling interest in some of the local telephone
companies. TELECOM intends to purchase 26 smaller companies, which would then
be fully integrated into the TELECOM system, and to obtain controlling equity
interests in six additional companies. During negotiations, TELECOM has
given assurances that the acquisition of about 26 local entities would be
completed by the end of 1980 and that the Bank will be consulted on the terms
of each contract (Section 3.01 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement). In addition,
TELECOM has agreed to enter into agreements setting out arrangements, satis-
factory to the Bank, regarding capitalization, organization, management and
financial and tariff policy, for the acquisition of majority interest in about
six local telephone companies in which it will obtain a controlling interest
(Section 3.01(c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Financial Performance
38.       TELECOM's past operating results have been satisfactory and its
financial position is sound. In 1974 and 1975 TELECOM generated a commendable
67% of the financial resources needed for its investment program. Under the
Third Telecommunications Project (Loan 1073-CO) TELECOM is required to achieve
an annual rate of return of at least 11% on the value of net fixed assets in
service calculated on the peso equivalent of the dollar value of the assets.
TELECOM has exceeded this requirement: the rate of return in 1974 was 11.6%,
in 1975, 13.6% and in 1976 was provisionally 18.4%.
39.       Forecasts of income and financial position suggest that TELECOM's
rate of return would vary from 18.5% in 1977 to 13% in 1982. The operating
ratio during 1977-82 is projected to be between 79 and 83%. Both of these
results would be satisfactory.
40.       TELECOM's debt-equity ratio was 53/47 in 1976 and is projected to
increase to 70/30 by 1980 and to decline to 64/36 by 1982, when the proposed
project would be completed. The ratio is high but is acceptable for a
Government Corporation which is not required to pay out dividends. TELECOM
proposes to adjust its tariffs to help obtain a substantial portion of the
funds it requires for investment and debt service during the project period.
The tariff increases will not unduly burden the subscribers and the economy.
TELECOM's tariffs include monthly rental charges of US$1 equivalent for
business and US$0.75 for residential subscribers, with a call charge of
USJO.5 per three minutes for all subscribers. Subscribers also pay a one-time
installation charge of almost US$10.50, a guarantee deposit of about US$22 and
an additional non-interest bearing deposit. Though these rates are low in
relation to other countries, TELECOM's tariff level has been adequate to



- 13 -
maintain its required rates of return. TELECOM has undertaken to maintain
tariffs adequate to enable it to obtain at least a 16% rate of return calcu-
lated on the peso equivalent of the US dollar value of net plant in service
during 1977-80. TELECOM currently obtains the bulk of its income from long
distance services. It is estimated that long distance tariff increases of
about 10% per year would be required to achieve the 16% rate of return. For
the years following 1980, it would review this requirement with the Bank but
in no case would it be set below 11% (Section 5.05 of draft Loan Agreement).
41.       TELECOM's ratio of internally generated funds to debt service was
a favorable 3.6 in 1976. During the period of project execution internally
generated funds are expected to amount to at least 2.1 times debt service
requirements. This performance is acceptable and reflects a satisfactory
financing plan. In the future, TELECOM would seek Bank concurrence before
incurring long-term debt, if the debt service coverage would fall below 1.5,
and would inform the Bank promptly upon acquiring any short-term debt in
excess of US$500,000 equivalent (Section 5.04 of draft Loan Agreement).
TELECOM has also agreed to seek Bank concurrence before proceeding during the
project period with capital expenditures (not required by the Telecommunica-
tions Development Program) which exceed US$1,000,000 or 10%, whichever is
greater, of the previous year's total capital expenditures (Section 5.06 of
draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
42.       All goods financed under the Bank loan would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Other
imported goods outside of Bank financing would be procured: (a) through
negotiations with existing suppliers where additions to existing equipment
warrant standardization; and (b) through competitive bidding for other new
equipment. Goods such as cables, cable ducts, poles and fittings, which
are manufactured domestically, would be procured through competitive bids
from domestic suppliers and financed with TELECOM's funds and part of the
proceeds of the IDB loan. Since none of the Bank-financed goods are currently
produced in Colombia, the matter of bidding preferences does not arise.
43.       Disbursement would be for the FOB prices of the imported equipment
and the foreign costs of its installation. TELECOM is required by Government
regulations to utilize Colombian ships for transport and to insure goods with
Colombian insurance companies, and therefore, pays for insurance and freight
with local currency. Any unused balance of the loan would be used to finance
additional equipment, similar to that already procured under the loan, after
consultation with the Bank. Disbursement for expenditures on telephone lines
in exchanges currently operated by independent local enterprises would be
conditioned upon TELECOM's signing of contracts for the acquisition of full
ownership or a controlling interest in the local enterprises (Schedule 1, 2(d)
of the draft Loan Agreement).



- 14 -
Justification and Risk
44.       The proposed project would help meet a sizeable unfilled demand for
telecommunication services, particularly in unserved, predominantly rural
areas. The project would facilitate the timely delivery of goods and ser-
vices and would contribute to improved efficiency in industry, commerce, agri-
culture and the service sector. The project would also assist in institution
building by promoting consolidation of the sector and rationalization of
Colombia's telecommunication facilities. The rate of return on the project
defined as the discounted rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues
attributable to the project with capital and operating costs is 21%. The
project rate of return is estimated to be 19%, when foreign exchange is shadow
priced 20% higher than the official rate (a figure calculated from tariffs on
imports and subsidies on exports). The incremental returns, however, under-
estimate the benefit to subscribers in business, industry and agriculture, and
also do not include the estimated revenues from the additional lines that will
undoubtedly be connected sometime in the future over and above those included
in the immediate project but for which this project builds the capacity. With
an unfavorable combination of main parameters, sensitivity analysis suggests
that the rate of return of the project would not be less than 11%.
45.       The project is technically feasible and offers limited risk.    The
only possible risk is that it may take TELECOM some time to adjust to its
new role as a major provider of local telephone services. However, with
TELECOM's successful performance in recent years, and proven ability to
recruit and train qualified staff, there is reason for optimism that the high
standards of efficiency will be maintained.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Colombia and the Bank, as well as the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii), of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
47.       Special conditions of the loan are listed in Section III of Annex
III. A special condition of disbursement for expenditures on telephone lines
for exchanges currently operated by independent telephone companies would be
that TELECOM has entered into purchase contracts for a full or controlling
equity interest in such enterprises (Schedule 1, paragraph 2(d) of the draft
Loan Agreement).
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
1.   Ln No. 575 Electric Power (Interconnection); US$18 million, December 1968.
Effective date: February 25, 1969
Closing Date:     original - February 29, 1972
current - July 31, 1977
The original project was completed and commercially operational
in 1971. The Bank agreed that an undisbursed balance could be used to finance
a 220 kv transmission line, Guatape - Barrancabermeja. The cost of the line
is estimated at US$7.2 million of which about US$4.1 million represents the
foreign component. Work on the line is almost fully completed.
2.   Ln No. 680 Highways VI; US$32 million, June 1970.
Effective date: March 29, 1971
Closing date:     original - November 30, 1974
current - November 30, 1978
The largest component of the project, the paving program, has
experienced considerable cost increases and delays. As of this writing, seven
sections in the program are still under construction and about 200 km still to
be paved. Project completion is now expected for 1979. The other components
of the project were completed with much less delay. The Ministry of Public
Works has taken several steps to hasten project execution and strengthen the
performance of contractors.
3.   Ln No. 681 Chivor Hydroelectric Power; US$52.3 million, June 1970.
Effective date: September 1, 1970
Closing date:     June 30, 1977
The project has experienced considerable delay and project costs
are expected to be 35% higher than originally estimated. Work is now proceed-
ing satisfactorily and the first generating units are expected to be put into
service in mid-1977.
4.   Ln No. 682 Cali Water Supply and Sewerage; US$18.5 million, June 1970.
Effective date: September 2, 1970
Closing date:     original - June 30, 1974
current - June 30, 1977
As of March 31, 1977, about 96% of the loan amount was disbursed.
Disbursements were delayed due to a late project start, but the entire project
is now under execution, and it is expected that construction activities will
be finished by mid-1977.
/1   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understand-
ing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

5.   Ln No. 738 Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage; US$2 million, May 1971.
Effective date: December 29, 1971
Closing Date:     original - March 1, 1975
current - March 1, 1977
As of March 31, 1977, about 85% of the loan amount was disbursed.
Disbursements were delayed due to initial management and fiscal problems. A
financial crisis in early 1973 was resolved through higher tariffs and tight
budget control. The Bank is now awaiting proposals from the company as to the
use of about US$300,000 still undisbursed which will not be needed for the
original project.
6.   Ln No. 740 Telecommunictions II; US$15 million, May 1971.
Effective date: August 16, 1971
Closing Date:     June 30, 1977
Contracts for all Bank-financed goods have been signed and technical
and financial consultants have been retained. Due to initial delays in the
procurement of project equipment, some of the project's works will be completed
18 months behind original schedule.
7.   Ln No. 741 Water Supply (Bogota II); US$88 million, May 1971.
Effective date: August 16, 1971
Closing Date:     June 30, 1978
Disbursements up to March 31, 1977 amounted to 64% of this loan.
Slow progress in the construction of the vital Palacio - Rio Blanco Tunnel is
the main reason for the project's delay; the original contractor was replaced
by another firm which has already made an impressive start. The progress of
the project, however, is endangered by serious financial problems which are
currently the subject of consultations with the Government and the Borrower
concerning necessary corrective measures, including further tariff increases.
8.   Ln No. 849 Irrigation (Atlantico II); US$5 million, June 1972.
Effective date: November 14, 1972
Closing Date:    March 31, 1978
The project is the second and final phase of a scheme to develop
about 17,000 ha of seasonally inundated land for agricultural production.
Work is continuing satisfactorily on project roads and a main drainage canal;
the final two main drainage canals are scheduled to be completed during 1977.
Land clearing, tertiary drainage works and allocation to farmers are behind
schedule, but improved in 1976. The organization and settlement of farmers
within the project areas and the technical assistance and farm credit oper-
ations are not yet satisfactory. At Government request, the Bank has agreed
to cancel US$2.8 million of the original amount of the loan.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 7
9.   Ln No. 860 Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$9.1
million, October 1972.
Effective date: March 7, 1973
Closing Date:     original - September 30, 1976
current - September 30, 1978
As of March 31, 1977, about 50% of the loan amount was disbursed.
Disbursements were delayed due to initial project management problems, but
progress of works has since accelerated.
10. Ln No. 874 Guatape II Hydroelectric Power Project; US$56 million,
January 1973.
Effective date: March 13, 1973
Closing Date:     December 31, 1978
The progress of the work is generally satisfactory except for
delays in the resettlement of El Penol and Guatape villages, which means
that filling the Santa Rita reservoir cannot be started before mid-1978,
three years behind schedule. This would be likely to lead to an energy
deficit in the interconnected system from 1978 to 1981. The revised project
cost estimate is substantially above appraisal estimates, mainly due to higher
costs of the works at El Penol and Guatape. The Borrower experienced serious
financial problems but as a result of a series of tariff increases, the
company is projected to achieve the covenanted rate of return in 1977. Finan-
cial gaps, however, remain to be met if the investment program is to be com-
pleted on schedule.
11. Ln No. 903 Development Finance Companies V; US$60 million, May 1973.
Effective date: November 9, 1973
Closing Date:     June 30, 1977
The loan is fully committed. Disbursements are still behind sched-
ule, but in view that the loan is fully committed, they should be completed by
the Closing Date.
12. Ln No. 920 Education III; US$21.2 million, July 1973.
Effective date: January 10, 1974
Closing Date:     original - June 30, 1977
current - December 30, 1979
Project implementation had been suspended in mid-1975 pending rede-
finition of sector priorities by the Government. Implementation has resumed
recently after the Bank agreed to reallocate part of the loan to finance rural
primary schools instead of rural secondary schools as originally proposed. As
the number of primary school graduates increase, the primary schools will
gradually become secondary school centers.



ANNEX II

13. Ln No. 926 Sixth Railway Project; US$25 million, August 1973.
Effective date: December 6, 1973
Closing Date:     original - June 30, 1976
current - December 31, 1977
The operation of the railway has improved and for the first time
since 1974 the 1976 traffic approximately equalled the previous year's level
(in terms of ton-kms it was slightly higher). The financial condition of the
railway, however, continued to deteriorate as tariff increases have not kept
pace with cost increases. In 1976, operating ratio of 137 did not meet the
appraisal target of 104. As a result, the railway has requested financial
support from the Government. Track rehabilitation work and procurement have
improved, but derailments and availability of rolling stock continues to be
poor.
14. Ln No. 971 Preinvestment Studies Project; US$8 million, March 1974.
Effective date: June 27, 1974
Closing Date:    December 31, 1978
The Bank has approved 26 sub-projects. Commitments under the Bank
loan are proceeding at a satisfactory rate.
15. Ln No. 1071 Small-Scale Industry; US$5.5 million, January 1975.
Effective date: May 20, 1975
Closing Date:     June 30, 1978
After a slow start due to a change of management in Corporacion
Financiera Popular, the beneficiary institution, commitments moved well and
are now on schedule. The second tranche was released by the Bank in view of
the satisfactory performance of CFP. It is expected that the loan will be
fully committed by June 30, 1977.
16. Ln No. 1072 Second Multi-City Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$27
million, January 1975.
Effective date: April 14, 1975
Closing Date:     June 30, 1980
This loan became effective on April 14, 1975 but there have been
substantial delays in making the eight subloans effective. The last subloan
(Barranquilla) was made effective on September 9, 1976. After a slow start,
disbursements are beginning to increase.
17. Ln No. 1073 Telecommunications III; US$15 million, January 1975.
Effective date: April 14, 1975
Closing Date:     December 31, 1978
This loan became effective on April 14, 1975 and US$6.8 million has
been disbursed.   Contracts for all Bank-financed goods have been awarded.



ANNEX II
Page 7 of 7
18. Ln No. 1118 Caqueta Rural Settlement Project; US$19.5 million, June 1975.
Effective date:   April 1, 1976
Closing Date:     October 31, 1979
This loan became effective on April 1, 1976 after a six-month delay.
Since then, implementation has proceeded rapidly and some of the lost time
regained.  Road and bridge construction is well ahead of schedule (79 km have
been completed). School construction, however, is behind schedule, while the
credit program is proceeding well.
19. Ln No. 1163 Cordoba 2 Agricultural Development Project; US$21 million,
September 1975.
Effective date: March 30, 1976
Closing Date:     December 31, 1980
A few months after effectiveness, the Government decided to give
responsibility for project execution to another agency. This decision delayed
the initiation of the project. Implementation is now proceeding satisfactor-
ily, but still behind schedule.
20. Ln No. 1223 Sixth Development Finance Companies Project; US$80.0 million,
March 1976.
Effective date: September 1, 1976
Closing Date:     June 30, 1980
This loan is proceeding satisfactorily and according to schedule.
21. Ln No. 1352 Integrated Rural Development Project; US$52.0 million,
December 1976.
This loan was signed on January 7, 1977 and has not yet become
effective.
22. Ln No. 1357 Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$64.0 million, December
1976.
This loan was signed on February 4, 1977 and has not yet become
effective.
