PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA
FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (LOAN 1450-CO)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The Coloibian Telecommunications Sector in 1977, when the Fourth
Telecommunications Project was approved by the Bank, was characterized by
the fragmentatior. of its operations in more than 50 companies, most of them
small and weak, by the lack of standardization and adequate planning, and
by inadequate telephone services in small cities and rural areas. The
Project's basic objectives were to help improve this situation by the
consolidation of the Sector around TELECOM (a public enterprise responsible
for long-distance services, and local telephone services in minor cities
and rural areas) by a process of negotiated purchase or affiliation of
about 32 small telephone companies, and by supporting the expansion of the
long-distance telecommunication network to small towns and rural areas as
well as of local telephone services in these areas.
2.       The Project comprised a self-contained portion (about 50%) of
TELECOM's :Lnvestment program for 1977-82, and included most of new
transmission and switching facilities for TELECOM's telecommunications
network, and excluded mainly international satellite telecommun±catiors and
ongoing works. Project cost was estimated at about US$168 million, to be
financed partially by a US$60 million Bank loan.
3.       Project implementation experienced major delays (four years behind
schedule) due mainly to procurement problems, lack of continuity in the
borrower's management team, and delays in completing civil works. First,
changes in the procurement law applicable to TELECOM originated a
protracted discussion with the Bank about the precedence of the Banks'
norms over the Colombian law. Furtlhermore, the situation wva worsened by
differences during the bid award process due to the application of
legalistic criteria by the Borrower. Second, TELECOM's top management was
replaced twice in 1978 and 1982 by people from outside the institution,
when a new national President came to power. This fact had a negative
impact on project execution because the new management had to familiarize
themselves with the Project and the Bank's procedures. Finally,
construction of buildings to house the equipment was delayed for years due
to difficulties in land acquisition and procurement of construction
services.
4.       The project scope and cost were substantially increased, by about
50Z for the base cost and between 20% and 200% for work quantities. These
major changes were related, by and large, to the four year delay in
completing the Project. The Borrower had to revise its investment pregram
to take into account a larger demand for telephone services and reported
most of the new works as part of the Project.   In this regard, neither the
Bank nor the Borrower applied clear and consistent criteria to delimit the



Project. What started as a subset of the investment program became a
project resembling a time-slice of the investment program. Although this
fact should have facilitated loan disbursements, the above mentioned
procurement problems precluded a faster project execution.
5.       Project cost reporting by the Borrower was inadequate and
unreliable, mainly because TELECOM did not maintain a proper accounting
system to determine cost by project component, currency, etc.
6.       The financial results were satisfactory in spite of project
delays. Financial indicators like the rate of return, the internal
generation of funds, and the debt/equity ratio were adequate and exceeded
requirements established at the appraisal. The rate of return was higher
than 20% most of the time, internal generation was above 40%, and debt
equity evolved from 59/41 'n 1977 to 36/64 in 1985. These good results
were due to adequate tariff increases, a substantial increase of the most
profitable bcsiness: long-distance services, and by TEL1COM capturing a
large share of long-distance revenues (about 70Z). Nevertheless, TELECOM's
performance regarding improvements of the collection period (about 5
months) was not adequate. Indeed, accounts receivable increased in real
terms during project execution.
7.       In spite of major delays in completing the project, TELECOM was
successful in making subsrantial progress in extending telephone services
to new communities, in modernizing and expanding the national long-distance
telecommunieations network, and in improving the quality of telephone
services.
8.       The Project contributed significantly to the consolidation of the
telecommunications sector. Although only 23 out of the 32 local companies
were purchased by or affiliated to TELECOM, the program was effective in
channeling investment for the improvement of telecommunication services in
small cities and towns and in improving planning, engineering and
management of small local Telcos. It fell short, however, in standardizing
technologies and in improving long-term planning.
9.       The Borrower experienced some management problems during project
execution. First, procurement experienced many difficulties and delays.
Although TELECOM had to follow cumbersome legal procedures established by
law, it seems that other institutions in Colombia have been able to manage
procurement and contracting more expeditiously. Second, as mentioned
above, it had major top management changes during project execution.
10.      The Bank played a major role in advancing sector consolidation,
and it was right in focusing on sectoral issues. However, project
supervision experienced some difficulties related to protracted discussions
with the Borrower on procurement matters, and a lack of continuity in the
supervision effort in the second half of the Project. In this regard, the
borrower would have preferred a stronger Bank's role for ensuring the
implementation of needed remedial actions like the reduction of accounts
receivable and further consolidation of the sector.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA
FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (LOAN 1450-CO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Telecommunications Sector in Colombia in 1976, at the time
when the Fourth Telecommunications Project was appraised, comprised about
50 municipal or state companies responsible for providing telecommunication
services to the larger cities and their environs, and a national company,
Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM), responsible for national
and international long- distance telephone, telegraph and telex services,
and local telephone services in some minor cities and towns and rural
areas.
1.02     In May 1975 the Bank undertook a Telecommunications Sector study
at the request of the Government of Colombia. This study identified the
fragmentation of the operations between more than 50 companies as one of
the major issues, because most of these companies were too small to manage
adequately their operations, and this fragmentation impaired the
implementation of an effective expansion program and increased development
costs. This study recommended that the sector be integrated by
progressively consolidating the various entities into a single entity. As
a first step, it recommended that TELECOM takes over the smaller entities.
One of the main goals of the Fourth Telecommunications Project was to
assist the Government in implementing this first step.
1.03     The Fourth Telec.smmunications Project comprised a substantial
increase in the capacity of local telephone services in more than 30 small
cities and towns, the strengthenTng and expansion of the national long-
distance network, and the expansion of access to telephone services in
rural areas. It included a substantial portio-n of TELECOM's 1977-1982
expansion program and, additionally, supported the channeling of investment
through TELECOM for the development of local telecommunication services in
small cities in exchange for equity participation of TELECOM in the Telcos
serving these cities.
1.04     Before this prLject, the Bank had supported three projects in the
Telecommunications Sector between 1967 and 1976 with loans amounting to US$
46 million, basically for establishing a modern long-distance network and
expanding local telephone services in small cities and towns. The Bank's
role in these operations concentrated mainly on (i) institutional building
of TELECOM; (ii) improving long-distance services; and (iii) expanding
coverage of local telephone services to smaller towns.

1.05     The Fourth project was partially financed by the Bank with the
Loan 1450-CO for an amount of US$ 6P million, which was signed in July
1977, and disbursed during the periou 1979-1986.
1.06     This Project Corpletion Report was prepared by a consultant based
on the information available in the project files, a completion report
prepared by the borrower in June, 1986 and informal interviews with a few
Bank and TELECOM staff members who were involved in the execution of the
project and still were with these institutions. Access to other
documentation was limited by the fact that most of the files were not
active or complete more than ten years after project appraisal. The
Con3ultant had wished to have access to more sources of information to
validate inconsistencies in basic data and to confirm supporting evidence
for his conclusions, but this was not possible.
II.  PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01     The Fourth Telecommunications Project was a product of the Bank's
aectoral study prepared in 1975 (see para. 1.02). After having reached a
tentative ag iement to the recomwandations of this study, the Government
requested in July 1975 the Bank's assistance for preparing and financing a
development plan for the expansion of local telephone services in small
cities and towns. By early 1976, TELECOM had prepared a five year
expansion program of telecommunication services for small cities and towns
under its responsibility or being served by small municipal Telcos, as well
as of the national long-distance telephone network.  Under these
circumstances, the identification of the project focused on the selection
of components in this program appropriate for Bank's financir.g, related to
the provision of telephoneo services in small cities and towns, and which
would support the acquisition of local Telcos by TELECOM.
Preparation, Appraisal, Negotiation and Approral
2.02     The project was pLepared basically by TELECOM's own staff during
1975 and 1976. The Bank conducted three preparation missions from
September, 1975 to June, 1976 to review the e:cpansion program prepared by
TELECOM and the investment cost estimates, and to identify the major issues
related with the Project. From the technical point of view, project
preparation was expeditious and benefited from the Bank's previous
experience and continuous involvement with the Sector. No major changes in
the project concept appeared to be necessary during its preparation, and
most of the Bank's comments focused on the justification of the demand
forecasts for telephone lines and on the cost estimates. A consultant
assisted the borrower in preparing these forecasts.
2.03     Project preparation and appraisal concentrated on the following
major issues:



-3-
a.   The fragmentation of sector operations in many small and weak
telephone companies, poorly coordinated and inefficient.
b.   The need to decentralize TELECOM's operations to manage local
services effectively.  Although TELECOM, under the Bank's
encouragement, had decentralized maintenance and operational work
to seven regional offices, it was felt that with the acquisition
of new Telcos and the expansion of telephone services to new
areas, it was necessary to strengthen these regional offices and
improve its management information system.
C.  UJnsatisfactory collection period equivalent to five months'
revenues. About 702 of accounts receivable were owed by the
Central Government and the local connecting companies.
2.04     To resolve these issues, the loan agreement established the
following specific covenants:'
a.   By December 31, 1979 enter into contracts, satisfactory to the
Bank, with about six local telephone enterprises, by which the
Borrower shall acquire a controlling equity interest of each
enterprise (LA Section 3.01 (c)).
b.   By December 31, 1980 purchase about 26 local telephone enterprises
and exchange views witn the Bank on the terms and conditions of
the contracts before these are executed (LA Section 3.01 (b)).
c.   Maintain rates to provide a rate of return on the average current
net value of its fixed assets of at least 162 for 1977- 1980 and
at least 112 after 1980 (LA Section 5.05 (a)).
d.   Maintain a pension payment reserve in its accounts.  By December
31, 1978, review adequacy of current practice, prepare a pension
plan and carry out the plan (LA Section 5.07).
e.   Furnish to the Bank by October 31, 1977 a detailed plan to reduce
overdue accounts receivables, agree on a final plan by February
28, 1978 and carry out the plan (LA Section 5.08).
f.   Establish by January 1, 1979 an information system between
headquarters and the regional offices (LA Section 5.09).
g.   Prepare and carry out, by July 31, 1978, a plan for conducting
studies of the economic benefits of telecommunication services (LA
Section 5.10).
1 The following are considered customary covenants:
i)   Reporting requirements
ii)   Consultation with the Bank for large additional capital
expenditures, and additional long-term and short-term obligations.
iii) Insurance of goods, and land acquisition.



- 4 -
2.05     The above covenants were, at that time, a good attempt to resolve
the key issues identified during the preparation/appraisal process. The
Government and the Borrower did not have major reservations about them, and
they appeared to be realistic goals. Regarding the fragmentation issue,
covenants (a) and (b) above supported a practical approach agreed with the
Government, by which Sector consolidation would be achieved either by
purchase by agreement between TELECOM and the Telco willing to sell its
telephone system, or by TELECOM acquiring a controlling interest in A Telco
by procurement and installation of additional local exchange equipment and
obtaining equity in return. Regarding the collection period problem,
covenant (e) was a customary Bank covenant requiring the Borrower to
prepare and execute a satisfactory plan to resolve the problem. Regarding
the decentralization issue, covenant (f) established a deadline to take
specific action to resolve this problem.
2.06     Project appraisal and internal Bank processing of the loan did not
experience major difficulties and were carried out during a seven month
period from October 7, 1976 (appraisal mission) to April 26, 1977. During
this process the Bank addressed with the Government the issue of improving
bill collections and confirming the government's policy for the acquisition
of small Telcos by TELECOM (see para. 2.04). Negotiations were conducted
in the borrower's country and the only concessions made by the Bank were:
(i) to accept that the Bank's and the IDB's loan2 were virtually
independent and therefore, no reference to IDB should be made in the Loan
Agreement; and (ii) a list of the companies to be acquired by TELECOM
should not be included in the loan agreement in order to avoid jeopardizing
TELECOM's negotiation position.  These two changes were not considered to
be critical, and the Government accepted the key covenants proposed by the
Bank (see para. 2.04).
2.07     In retrospective, during project preparation and appraisal the
Bank concentrated on a key sectoral issue and a basic strategy to help
resolve some of the most pressing sectoral problems. Whether or not this
was the right strategy, is open to discussion. In this regard, the
Telecommunications Sector Study completed in 1975 (para 1.02) had
identified the most important sector problems, among themt poor planning
and coordination, fragmentation of operations, inadequate procurement
practices, proliferation of technologies and lack of standardization and
financing of local services development. This study concluded that most of
these problems would be resolved automatically by consol'dating the Sector
into a single telecommunications entity, and proposed this as a long-term
objective. The strategy was, therefore, to support the existing process by
which TELECOM was acquiring a controlling interest of the small Telcos.
Although the reduction of the number of Telcos was beneficial, the project
fell short in alleviating the above mentioned sectoral problems.
2 The IDB loan financed the development of long-distance services to rural
communities that were considered part of the Project.



Project's Role in Long-Term Plan
2.08     The bAsic objectives of the project were to:
a.   Help consolidate into TELECOM a significant proportion of the
small municipal and state goverranent - operated local telephone
entities, and to rationalize and improve service in the small
towns and rural communities they were serving.
b.   Greatly expand access to telephone service in rural areas by
providing long-distance call offices in about 50 of the rural
communities with no facilities at that time.
c.   Strengthen and expand the long-distance network to meet additional
traffic demand.
d.   Significantly develop local networks in small towns to meet part
of the demand for local connections.
2.09     The project was a key component of the long-term development plan
which sought to: (i) establish a modern long-distance network; (ii) expand
local telephone services in small towns and rural areas; (iii) develop a
financial basis for future expansion; and (iv) consolidate the sector in a
few operating companies.
Project Description
2.10     The project was a self-contained portion (about 50Z) of TELECOM's
investment program for 1977-1982 and comprised two parts:
Part A:
(.)  Installation of about 31,000 additional lines in about 26 existing
local automatic exchanges operated by local telephone enterprises
(not affiliated)f
(ii)   Installation of about 33,000 additional lines in about 6 existing
local automatic exchanges operated by affiliated lccal telephone
enterprises;
(iii)   Installation of about 31,000 additional lines in 37 existing local
automatic exchanges operated by TELECOM; aid
(iv)   Installation of about 6,000 lines in about 150 manual exchanges in
rural areas without exchange facilities.
Part B:
(i)   Installation of local distribution cables and subscribers'
equipment to connect a total of about 75,000 additional
subscribers.
(ii)   Installation of microwave radio equipment on about nine new
routes.



-6-
(iii)   Installation of about 8,800 additional long-distance circuits on
existing and new routes, and installation of the corresponding
long-distance exchange termination equipment.
(iv)  Construction of buildings to house equipment.
An IDB loan essentially covered the provision of long-distance
services to about 2,200 additional rural communities (part of (iii) above)
and it was executed relatively independent of the Bank's loan.
III. PRQJECT IMPLSMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01    The loan was declared effective on October 3, 1977, about three
months after the loan agreement was signed. No special conditions were
established for it.
3.02    To expedite start-up in January, 1977 a Bank mission visited
Colombia to discuss final details for the procurement arrangerments.  Draft
standard general conditions and special conditions of bidding documents
were submitted to the Bank in April, 1977, about four months after the date
envisaged at the appraisal for initiating the bidding process.  However,
due to a lengthy approval process of these documents, the first bid was not
opened until October, 1977, about seven months behind schedule.
Changes in Project Scope
3.03    The project scope was substantially increased during its
execution. However, this increase was not related to scaling-up of
individual components, but to .n extension of the execution period (from 5
years to 9 years) and the,addition of new components required to meet a
larger demand. Annex 3 shows the physical targets that were met as
compared to appraisal targets, and is summarized below:
-----------------------------------------------------------__--------------

---------------------------------------------------------------__----------



3.04     These changes in project scope are misleading in many cases
because TELECOM did not apply clear and consistent criteria to delimit "the
project' when project completion was extended from 1981 to 1985. On the one
hand, in the case of local exchanges related to entities to be acquired by
TELECOM, it was very easy to delimit the project to those exchanges for
entities that were actually acquired.  On the other hand, in the case of
long-distance exchanges and transmission equipment, TELECOM reported as
part of the Project all the expansion of the national toll network during
1977-1981. The Bank considered in 1983 that these additions should be part
of another subproject in TELECOM's program of works and requested TELECOM
to report separately the original project from the revised project.
Although this was done once in 1984, afterwards TELECOM continued to report
only the revised project.
3.05     The main reason for these changes in project scope were:
a.   Major delays in project execution.  In late 1978, when it was
obvious that procurement was about two years behind schedule,
TELECOM decided to: (i) revise its expansion plan in order to
extend the planning horizon up to 1985 and to reflect new demand
and traffic figures, and (ii) include in new bids the additional
equipment required for the extended period. This had a major
impact on work quantities (number of lines per switch, number of
channels per route, etc.) and increased also the number of
locations and transmission reu:tes originallv envisaged for the
shorter planning period (see para. 3.03).
b.   Variations in the number of local Telcos that were actually
affiliated or purchased by TELECOM. In these cases, TELECOM
acquired equipment only for those Telcos that fere willing to sell
to or affiliate with TELECOM. The figures irn Annex 3 show that
the number of Telcos actually purchased by TELECOM fell short of
appraisal estimates by about 40Z and the number of Telcos
affiliated to TEIOECOM exceeded appraisal estimates by about 30Z.
Accordingly, these variations affected work quantities, as shown
in para. 3.03.
c.   Underestimation of work quantities in the original expansion
program for the national toll network. A simple comparison of the
original estimates and the actual figures for long-distance
exchanges supports this statement, as shown below:

d.  A substantial increase in the coverage of the national toll
network is included in the project. This explains the largest
percentage increases summarized in para. 3.03, as shown below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------__------
Implementation Schedule
3.06    Project execution as a whole was about four years behind schedule.
The project was expected to be completed by the end of 1981 and it was
actually not completed until the end of 1985. Since there was no clear
criterion to del'mit the project, and that it consisted of hundreds of
components, delays in project execution as a whole are very subjective,
difficult to calculate, and sometimes meaningless. In this case, the four
years' delay was calculated as the delay in disburslng or closing the loan,
and is related with delays in procuring goods financed by the Bank. When
one looks at individual components, the variance of delays is high, but of
course, on the average, there is a major delay in completing individual
components, as shown below for a sample taken from the original project:

3.07     The main reasons for the delay in project execution were:
a.   Changes in the procurement law in Colombia.  First, in 1976 the
Colombian Government enacted Decree 150, which established
detailed regulations and norms for procurement of goods and
services by public institutions at the national level.  The
application of this decree had a major impact on TELECOM's
procurement process and gave rise to a lot of discussion and
consultation with the Bank about the precedence of the Bank's
procurement norms over the Colombian law, which resulted in major
delays in preparing the general conditions and special conditions
of the tender documents and consequently, delayed the whole
procurement schedule (see Annex 4). Second, in February 1983,
Decree 150 was revised and replaced by Decree 222, which again
gave rise to new changes to TELECOM's bidding documents, and
established a lengthy bid approval process which takes on average
eight (8) months, as four government agencies had to approve
TELECOM's bid award before any contract could be made effective.
b.   Difficulties during the bid award process, TELECOM often was
legalistic in determining whether or not a bid was responsive.
This caused much consultation between the Borrower and the Bank
during the bid evaluation process, and delayed procurement. As an
example, bid BIRF IV-13 (switching equipment for Boyac4)
processing took about four years and went through three rebids
because all bids were rejected twice.
c.   Delays in completing civil works.  Commissioning of several
switching facilities was substantially delayed because the
buildings to house the equipment were not ready at the time Che
equipment was delivered on site. The cases of the Cartagena and
Neiva exchanges illustrate this point. Although equipment was
delivered by mid'1980, it was kept in storage for about two years
awaiting completion of the buildings and it was finally
commissioned in late 1982. Although Bank staff associated this
problem with lack of coordination between the equipment
installation, cable installation and building groups (see
Supervision Report of July 27, 1981), TELECOM's staff associated
it with difficulties in acquiring land and procuring construction
services. In this regard, TELECOM had to negotiate land based on
official assessments, making it difficult to reach an agreement
with the seller. Furthermore, municipal governments required
approval in three debates by their councils in order to sell land
to site the local switches. Finally, some contractors were not
able to complete the works mainly because they were underbidding,
and price escalation clauses did not compensate for cost
increases.
d.   Changes in TELECOM's management team.  As in most public
enterprises in Colombia, TELECOM's management changes every four
years after a new national President takes office.  As a matter of
fact, in 1978 and 1982 TELECOM's president, most of its vice-
presidents and some division chiefs were replaced by new people,



- 10 -
in many cases from outside the institution. These changes had an
impact on project execution mainly because the new staff had to
familiarize themselves with bidding procedures, loan conditions,
etc.
Proiect Cost and Financing
3.08    The consolidation and analysis of cost information for the project
was subject to many constraints. First. TELECOM did not maintain an
adequate accounting system to determine costs by project component,
currency and period. Second, there were no clear criteria to delimit the
project, making it difficult to compare costs. Third, TELECOM's reporting
of project costs In the Progress Reports was inadequate, as many
corrections and changes were introduced in cost data with little or no
explanation. Fourth, in this Project Completion Report TELECOM revised
previously reported cost figures based on a detailed analysis of all
contracts related to the project; unfortunately, it did not keep track of
annual investments broken down by component and by currency.
3.09    In light of the above, the calculation of project costs in real
terms was based on partial and unreliable iniormation, adjusted by the
consultant using many assumptions and approximations, as explained at Annex
5. The project costs in constant Dec.186 prices (US$ equivalent) are shown
there and summarized below:

The reason for these overruns are analyzed below.

higher than envisaged at appraisal time:

c.  Project was scaled up and price contingencies increased

3.12    Regarding the base cost overrun, the main reason was the
substantial increase in the project scope. This point is supported by a
simple comparison of increases in work quantities vis-a-vis price increases
for individual components of the project, as follows:

2/ Based on a comparison of appraisal estimates and actual work

------------------------------------------------------------__-------------
A direct calculation of unit cost variations based on these
figures would be misleading because:
1.   Regarding local exchanges, the quantity refers to the number of
lines installed, and does not take into account the number and
capacity of individual exchanges. Generally speaking, unit costs
would vary by capacity ranges (small and large switches).
Besides, many local exchanges were combined exchanges which
included terminations for long-distance transmission.
2.   Regarding long-distance exchanges, part of the termination costs
were included as local exchanges costs, and furthermore, TELECOM
substituted digital switches for part of the analog switches
originally envisaged.
3.   Regarding long-distance transmission, unit costs would depend on
the number of channels, capacity of transmission equipment,
infrastructure required for the transmission route, etc. TELECOM
made substantial changes in the number and location of
transmission routes and in the capacity of transmission equipment,
so a direct comparison of cost per channel is not adequate.
Disbursements and Financial Sources
3.13     The disbursement schedule (actual vs. appraisal) is shown at
Annex 7. About US$ 2.4 million of the loan proceeds were cancelled due to
misprocurement.
3.14     The substantial cost overrun was financed basically with TELECOM's
own resources and supplemented with suppliers credits and commercial bank
loans as shown below:

Reporting
3.16    The quarterly progress reports were submitted irregularly and late
during the first two years of the project, due in part to some
misunderstanding about the reporting format to be used. However,
subsequently, TELECOM submitted them regularly.



- 14 -
Procurement
3.17     A procurement program comprising 14 bids was established at
appraisal (see Annex 4). Its implementation experienced many difficulties,
and it was a major cause for delays in the project execution (para. 3.07).
First, there were problems related to conflicts of the Bank's procurement
guidelines with national laws, specially a protracted discussion about the
precedence of the former over the latter. They were also a major factor in
a case of misprocurement for bid BIRF-IV-08 (telephone sets) when the
Bcrrower applied bid evaluation criteria that were not consistent with the
Bank's guidelines. Second, there were problems related to the application
by the borrower of a legalistic approach in evaluating bids, which required
additional consultation between the borrcwer and the Bank, delayed the
procurement process, and resulted in another misprocurement case (bid BIRF
IV-14- transmission equipment), when the borrower disqualified the lowest
bid because it did not submit a simple certification.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.18     TELECOM is satisfied with the quality and performance of the
equipment acquired under the project and has no complaints about the
performance of contractore. TELECO1 did not retain any consultants for the
implementation of the project.
IV.  OPERATING PERFOW'ANCE
4.01     In spite of major delays in its execution, the project contributed
to make substantial progress in extending telephone services to new
communities, in modernizing and expanding the national long-distance
network, and in improving the quality of telephone service. The
operational indicators shwwn at Annex 2 support this conclusion, and are
discussed below.
4.0,.    Regarding the extension of service coverage, TELECOM increased the
number of locations with automatic local exchanges from 89 in 1976 to 339
in 1985, representing an annual rate of growth of 16Z, well above the rate
of 12Z envisaged in the appraisal for the period 1976-1982. With respect
to the number of lines installed in automatic local exchanges, It increased
more than three times from 1976 to 1985, representing an annual growth rate
of 13.5Z.
4.03     Regarding the modernization and expansion of the national network,
TELECOM strengthened the long-distance transmission system by adding about
30,000 channels, and the interurban switching system by adding about 72,000
terminations. Furthermore, it introduced digital switches in the four
largest urban centers (Bogota, Medellin, Cali and Barranquilla), providing
adequate capacity for about 80Z of telephone traffic demand in the country.
4.04     Regarding the quality of telephone service, the project
substantially reduced blockage in the national toll network, increased the
coverage of automatic dialing to 83Z of subscribers in the country, and the



- 15 -
access to long-distance international automatic dialing to 272 of all
subscribers. Furthermore, it stimulated long-distance traffic by providing
automatic toll metering to 174 locations.
4.05     The project also supported a major increase in international
telephone service by providing the infrastructure to access a new
international exchange in Bogota, and to expand international satellite
circuits at Chocont.  As a matter of fact, the total number of minutes
billed in international telephone calls increased from 1976 to 1985 at an
average annual rate of 28.52, well above a 242 envisaged at appraisal.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Results
5.01     The finiancial results for 1977-1985 were satisfactory in spite of
project delays. The financial statements for this period (balance sheets,
flow of funds and income) included at Annexes 8, 9 and 10 compare the
projections made at appraisal with actual figures. These statements are
commented below.
5.02     With respect to the balance sheets (Annex 8), net fixed assets
increased 8 times, from about Col$ 4,000 million to Col$ 34,000 million,
representing a 30? total increase in real terms. Net fixed assets were
below projected values for 1977 to 1981, due to the fact that investment
was delayed during this period. However, in 1982 actual figures surpassed
projected ones. On the other hand, long-term debt increased at a much
slower pace than envisaged, as net income was higher than expected and
internal contribution to investment was also higher. As a matter of fact,
TELECOM has become less dependent on borrowings and the debt/equity ratio
evolved from 59/41 in 1977 to 36/64 in 1985. On the other hand, the current
ratio has kept at relatively low values of about 1.5, well below
projections. In this regerd, there was a major increase in accounts
receivable (see para. 5.11) and in current liabilities (accounts payable,
short-term debt, and social benefits obligations).
5.03     Regarding the income statements (Annex 10), operating revenues
increased in nominal terms at a rate of about 35Z p.a. during 1977-1985,
well above a 23Z average annual inflation. As a result, opeLating revenues
in 1982 were 282 higher than forecasted. Various factors contributed to
it: higher than envisaged tariffs, strong sales specially for international
long-distance services, and a relatively stable arrangement for sharing
long-distance revenues with the Telcos.
5.04     Regarding tariffs, they were increased at a higher than expected
rate. Annex 12 shows the evolution of tariffs for 1976-1985 and it is
summarized below:



- 16 -
UNIT                1976      1982

Appraisal                                       0.15    0.45
Actual                                          0.15    0.60
Interurban call charge   (Average Index)
Appraisal                                      100     165
Actual                                         100     220
In real terms, however, there was a major change in the tariff structure.
While charges for local services increased, in general, about 25Z, charges
for interurban services decreased about 45? from 1976 to 1985 (see Annex
12). Apparently the loss in the tariff value was compensated by a
stimulation of long-distance traffic, specially international traffic,
which in 1985 generated about 5OZ of TELECOM's gross revenues. The drop in
long-distance telephone charges does not mean, however, that local services
are subsidizing long-distance serviLes. On the contrary, in spite of a
lack of marginal cost studies for telecommunication services in Colombia,
it is generally recognized that local charges are well below cost and that
long-distance rates may exceed its cost.
5.05     In relation to the arrangement for sharing long-distance revenues
with the local Telcos, during 1977-1985 the telcos received on the average,
about 30% of gross revenues for these services (Annex 13). This
arrangement had a major impact on TELECOM's and the Telcos' finances and
has been a matter of discussion and dispute between them (para. 5.12). The
importance of these revenues is illustrated by the fact that for TELECOM
its sharing of long-distarice revenues represented in 1985 about 82Z of
total operating revenues.
5.06     Although operating expenses grew at a higher rate than expected
(232 over the projected value in 1982), net income was substantially higher
than expected (about 200Z over projected value in 1982) and it contributed
to a high financial rate of return.
5.07     Regarding the flow of funds (Annex 9), total internal generation
was much higher than expected (over 482 in 1982) due to higher net income
and non-cash expenses. The debt service coverage ratio was, in general,
higher than expected and fluctuated between 2 and 5, during 1977-1985.
Financial Rate of Return
5.08     The financial rate of return, calculated on the basis of revalued
assets, was satisfactory and much higher than expected.   Annex 10 shows
the results for 1977-1985 and it is summarized below:
l

Actual                               6.32       30.92     23.2Z
The main reasons for this good performa:ce were discussed above (para. 5.03
- 5.06). It is important to notice that according to TELECOM's required
accounting practices, assets are maintained at original cost. To meet
Bank's requirement for the rate of return computation, TELECOM maintained
parallel records reflecting this revaluation.
Financial Covenants
5.09     TELECOM complied with the financial covenants established in the
loan agreement except for the one related to improving the collection
period.  The loan agreement established the following specific covenants:
(i)   Maintain tariffs to provide for a rate of return over 16Z for
1977-1980 and over 112 thereafter (LA 5.05;.
(ii)   Review adequacy of pension payment reserve practices (LA 5.07).
(iii)   Prepar- and carry out a plan to reduce overdue accounts
receivables (LA 5.08).
5.10     As for the rate of return covenant, TELECOM exceeded the
requirements (para. 5.08). In compliance with the pension plan covenant,
TELECOM hired a consultant in 1981 to review the adequacy of existing
practices for determining the pension fund reserve requirements, and, as a
result of these studies, in 1985 TELECOM adjusted the reserve provision by
about 80? from COL$15,825 to COL$28,387 million.
5.11     Regarding the accounts receivable covenant, TELECOM was not
successful in reducing the 5 months collection period existing in 1977, in
spite of having prepared a plan to improve the situation and having taken
several actions to implement the plan. Annexes 8 and 11 show the evolution
of accounts rece!vable during 1977-1982, and the results are summarized
below:

2I Portion of total accounts receivable
5.12     The main reasons for the failure to shorten the collection period
were: (i) the lack of an effective legal mechanism; and (ii) a tight
financial situation at the connecting companies. Regarding the legal
mechanism, TELECOM could only threaten to disconnect service of its direct
subscribers (including the National Government), or reach agreement with
the connecting companies to settle overdue accounts and obtain securities
for its payment. In the case of the national government, TELECOM was able
to improve the situation by disconnecting long-distance service to key
delinquent accounts (the Congress) and by negotiating account comper-ation
with some ministries.  In the case of large connecting companies, w   h
bill long-distance services directly and reimburse their share to TELECOM,
no substai.tial improvemen'. was made, except in Barranquilla's case for
which it was agreed to collect long-distance bills through the banks. In
the case of small Telcos, the purchase and affiliation were an effective
mechanism to solve the problem. Regarding the financial problem of local
Telcos, these companies have complained in the past that they have a share
of the most profitable business (long-distance service) that is too small
to compensate them for their large share in the investment required to
provide the service.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01     A major objective of the Project was the consolidation of the
Sector around TELECOM by a process of negotiated purchase or affiliation of
small and weak local companies. Although TELECOM fell short of meeting its
targets, it made substantial progress in consolidating the sector and
developing telecommunication services in areas where the local Telcos did
not have the capacity to meet demand.



- 19 -
6.02     The consolidation program reqtired that by 1980 TELECOM would
purchase 26 Telcos and that by 1979 it would affiliate with six telcos.
However, by 1985 only 15 telcos were purchased and 8 telcos had signed
affiliation contracts with TELECOM (see Annex 15). The reasons for these
differences are explained in Annex 1 and summarized below:
a.   Of the 11 Telcos that finally were not purchased, one was
transferred to the affiliation program, and in two other cases
there was a force majeure reason. The 8 cases left correspond to
Telcos that did not want to negotiate or did not respond to
TELECOM's proposals, after an asset appraisal had been carried
out. In all cases, most of the negot 'ation effort was made during
1977-1982 and, apparently, after 198Ž negotiations were pursued
with less interest.
b.   The affiliation program was a success. Five out of the six Telcos
originally included in the program were finally affiliated, and
three Telcos that were not in the program, decided to affiliate
with TELECOM. In all cases TELECOM acquired a controlling
interest of the Telcos.
6.03     Although the consolidation program was effective in channeling
investment through TELECOM for improving telecommunication services in many
communities, in improving the planning, engineering and management of
medium- to small- size telephone systems, and in improving the financial
situation of these companies, it was not very effective in improving other
sector problems like the lack of standardization, and the lack of a
coordinated sector planning and procurement. As a matter of fact, TELECOM
has developed a network with several switching technologies that is
expensive to operate and to expand; it had to follow procurement procedures
established by law that made it very difficult to standardize equipment;
however, TELECOM has not yet developed an adequate planning process for
preparing long term develuApment plans for the national toll network in
coordination with the local Telcos.
6.04     The difficulties in implementing the consolidation program
mentioned above suggest that: (i) Consolidation of a sector in a single
entity by negotiated purchases or association may not be a feasible target.
It should be expected that negotiations would become very difficult or
almost impossible as larger telcos are considered for annexation; (ii)
creation of a single entity for operating the whole telecommunications
system may facilitate but would not solve other sector problems like the
lack of adequdte norms, standards, planning, methodologies, procurement
practices, etc., that were identified in 1975 in the Bank's
Telecommunications Sector Study.
TELECOM Management and Organization
6.05     TELECOM's organization did not suffer major changes during
1977-1985, and changes made were related to its growing operations as
explained below:



- 20 -
(i)  In 1978 the Rural Telecommunications Vice-presidency was created
tolprogram, execute and supervise projects in rural areas. It was
responsible for the execution of rural telephone works included in
the project financed by IDB. In 1985, the functions related to
the execution and supervision of rural programs was transferred
again to the technical vice-presidency and the rural vice-
presidency was left only with a promotional and programming
function.
(ii)   Two additional regional offices were created to manage operations
in areas around Cartagena and Cdcuta.
(iii)   A civil works engineering division was created in the technical
Vice-presidency to improve execution of civil works, an activity
that experienced some difficulties during project execution (para.
3.07 (c)).
6.06     Staff employed by TELECOM increased at a lower rate than expected
during appraisal, as shown below:
--------------------------------------------------------------------__--

6.07    One of the most .erious problems detected during project
implementation was the change of top management every four years with the
change of the national president. This, however, is an external problem
related to most governmental institutions, and was beyond the
responsibilities of TELECOM's management.
6.08    Another problem was the segmentation and lack of coordination in
the planning function:  The vice-president of integration planned local
exchange development; the rural services vice-president planned extension
of rural facilities; the technical vice-president planned long-distance
transmission and switching; and a planning unit was responsible for long-
term planning. Although the situation improved marginally with changes at
the rural services vice-presidency (para 6.05), the segmentation and lack
of coordination still persists.
6.09    The procurement problems experienced should not be associated with
management deficiencies at TELECOM, but with procurement procedures and
practices that were established all over the public sector and that give
too much importance to formalities and legalisms in evaluating bids.



- 21 -
6.10     Recording of project cost information experienced many
difficulties due to the fact that TELECOM did not and still does not have a
cost accounting system for recording individual expenditures by component,
subproject, currency, etc. Therefore, during the implementation of the
project, the Coordination Unit, responsible for the Bank's loan, had to
prepare the project cost tables based on accounting information of
individual contracts. This was a cumbersome and error-prone procedure that
was carried out quarterly. The Bank urged TELECOM several times to improve
the situation, but the problem remained unsolved.
Other Covenants
6.11     The loan agreement also required TELECOM to prepare and carry out
a plan for conducting studies of the economic benefits of telecommunication
services (LA Section 5.10). The intention was to help establish sound
economic criteria for planning and evaluation of telecommunication services
in rural areas and small locations.
6.12     Although the Bank reminded TELECOM continuously about the
implementation of these studies, the fact is that at the end, nothing was
accomplished. The Bank assisted the borrower in preparing detailed terms
of reference for the study, obtained several times commitments from TELECOM
to establish a team and to execute the study, and reminded TELECOM about
its obligation. On the other hand, TELECOM created working groups and
committees, but the effort made was of little avail for completing these
studies. The main reason for this is that nobody at TELECOM took the
initiative, the leadership and the responsibility for executing the
studies, and all groups that were created were multidisciplinary, with
people from several departments working on a part-time basis.
6.13     Although the aforementioned studies were not critical for meeting
the Project's major objectives, they were and still are important for the
economic evaluation of rufal telecommunications projects. Indeed, TELECOM
is currently developing an ambitious rural telecommunication project that
is not supported on a sound economic evaluation.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01     The project was justified qualitatively at appraisal by its
contribution to rationalizing and improving operations of the
telecommunications sector, to increasing development of services in rural
areas, and to providing employment opportunities in smaller urban centers.
Although the project fell short in achieving some of the original targets,
and there are still some queries about its impact on sector consolidation
(paras. 6.03 and 6.04), the project did represent a significant step
forward in meeting the goals indicated above. Operations were improved by
reducing the number of small and inefficient operators, the coverage of
telecommunication services in rural arees was substantially increased,
improving the infrastructure for development of rural areas, and local
services and access to long-distance services in small cities were
significantly improved, providing opportunities for new business in these
cities.

7.02     The internal rate of return was calculated in the appraisal report
by allocating to the project a portion of TELECOM's costs and revenues in
proportion to the number of additional lines provided under it.
Furthermore, revenues were taken as a proxy for benefits(a conservative
basis that omits any estimate of consumers surplus).   A 19Z rate of return
was estimated on this basis.
7.03     An ex-post economic evaluation of the project is difficult and
questionable because the project became a major portion of TELECOM's
investment program and did not represent by itself a well-defined component
whose benefits could be clearly segregated from those of the investment
program as a whole. Therefore, the rate of return of the entire investment
program was calculated. For this purpose, the rate of return was estimated
based on actual investment, operating expenses ard revenues for 1977-1985
and expressed in constant prices. The "without" project case was assumed
to correspond to the situation existing in 1977, and tht fore, it was
assumed that the benefits and costs related to the program were the
incremental costs and revenueb compared with that year. Details of the
calculation are shown in Annex 14. The rate of return was estimated at
9.52.
7.04     The ex-post rate of return is substantially lower than the
appraisal estimate. Although these results are not comparable because the
latter referred to a portion of a shorter investment program (1977-1982)
that was substantially increased during project execution, a low ex-post
rate of return of 9.5% may be due to the fact that a major portion of
TELECOM's investment program was related to improving the reliability and
quality of service (strengthening of long-distance network) and extending
telephone services to rural areas, which normally do not make a major
contribution to demand growth, and consequently, to increasing revenues.
7.05     The ex-post rate of return reflects only the adequacy of actual
tariffs and sharing agreements for long-distance revenues in providing
sufficient revenue to supi7ort TELECOM's investment program. In this
regard, it indicates that from the incremental point of view, actual
tariffs and costs do not provide an adequate rate of return on investment.
This may seem to be in contradiction with a 20X + financial rate of return
(see Annex 10). However, the latter differs in that it is calculated on
the basis of (a) total net incremental revenues and costs; and (b) existing
(and under-valued) assets, not incremental capital expenditures.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01     The project and the Bank's loan shared characteristics and
problems of a "typical" sectoral loan. On the one hand, its main objectives
were related to sectoral issues: consolidation of the sector, modernization
of a national long-distance network, extension of service coverage, etc.
Furthermore, the loan was used to finance procurement of a variety of
equipment to be installed in several places, and that were only components
of a much larger investment program. In retrospect, the Bank was right in
focusing on sectoral issues, specifically on the consolidation of the
sector through negotiated acquisition of small Telcos by TELECOM. The



- 23-
project was a step in the right direction and was an effective tool to
develop telecommunications services in medium and small cities served by
weak entities. However, as in the case of sector and program loans, a
single loan cannot change a sector. In this regard, the Fourth
Telecommunication Project was a logical continuation of the TiLird Project,
but it was not complemented by the Fifth Project. This project supported
basically the expansion of telephone services in the metropolitan area of
Medellin.
8.03     Project implementation had two phases from the Bank's supervision
point of view. From 1977 to about 1982 there was continuity and regularity
in project supervision. Only one team participate4 in project preparation
and appraisal.  From 1982 to 1985, on the other hand, there was a lack of
continuity in the supervision effort. Three different engineers and two
financial analysts participated in supervision. This change had some
effects on project execution: while during the first phase there was a
strong Bank representation before the borrower, during the second phase
apparently the emphasis was placed on disbursing the loan. Coincidentally,
the major advances in the consolidation program were made before 1982.
8.04     Handling of procurement problems by the Bank apparently was not
consistent. Although the Bank was diligent in processing procurement, it
entered into protracted discussions with the borrower about the application
of the Banks' procurement guidelines over the national law, that
jeopardized the whole procurement process. Of course, it was difficult to
anticipate at appraisal the conflicts created by the application of new
procurement rules in Colombia. Retrospectively, it would have been
necessary to agree with the Borrower on a standard text for the general and
special conditions to be used throughout the project.
8.05     Borrower staff responsible for the coordination of the project
appreciated the Bank's contribution in the following aspects:
a.   Providing support, credibility and continuity to the execution of
a development plan. According to them the Bank's presence during
project execution was a guarantee that plans would not be modified
arbitrarily.
b.   Facilitating the execution of a development plan. In their view,
it was better and faster to process a loan for a program than to
obtain authorization for financing individual components.
c.   Providing support to institutional chenges. In their view, the
Bank's presence was instrumental in implementing the consolidation
program.
d.   Supporting the implementation of tariff increases and other
remedial actions to improve TELECOM's finances.
8.06     The Bank's contribution to resolving the accounts receivable
problem was not effective.  Although it urged the Government and the
Borrower regularly to take immediate actions to solve the problem, the
results were not satisfactory (para. 5.11). Probably it is not an
effective solution to include a general covenant requiring the preparation
of a 'satisfactory" plan to solve a problem, like the one used in this case
(LA Clause 5.08), if the implementing agency lacks the authority or the
will to enforce the measures needed.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     In spite of major delays in completing the project, it was
successful in meeting many of the targets established at appraisal (para.
2.08).  It did upgrade and expand the long-distance network; it did
significantly develop local networks in small towns; it did help to improve
services in small towns served by municipal entities; and it did contribute
to expanding access to telephone services in rural areas. Of course, timely
execution of the project would have permitted the meeting of these targets
faster and probably at a lower cost.
9.02     Regarding the institutional objectives, the project contributed to
taking one step in the right direction, but did not make a major
contribution to the solution of many sector problems identified at
appraisal (para. 2.04). Retrospectively, one can say that the sector
consolidation program should have been complemented by some actions
regarding, among other things, standardization of equipment, improvement of
the planning process and improvement of procurement practices.
Lessons Learned
9.03     The problems caused by conflicts in the application of the Bank's
procurement guidelines slould not be underestimated. Usually the borrower
prefers to delay the procurement process rather than make concessions that
may be interpreted as going againbt the national law. It is preferable to
discuss these matters in detail at appraisal and try to reach an agreement
on a standard text for the general and special conditions of bidding
documents to be used throughout project execution. Sample bidding
documents for the power sector are in use from January 1, 1989.
9.04     A covenant establishing the Borrower's obligation "to prepare and
implement a satisfactory plan" to solve a specific problem would inot be
effective in solving it ui.less there is a clear understanding at appraisal
time of the solutions and their implications.
9.05     Loan conditions related to the execution of studies should not be
established unless, before the loan is signed, their terms of reference
have been prepared, discussed, and agreed with the Borrower's unit
responsible for its execution.
9.06     A stable management team at the executing agency is a key for a
successful project. Frequent changes at the top of public enterprises
(TELECOM case) represent a major risk during project execution because the
continuity of the management team throughout the project is lost.
9.07     The Borrower, in general, would have preferred a stronger project
supervision by the Bank (more frequent missions, continuity of the
supervision team, stronger representation before the Government) because it
considered that the Bank's presence is instrumental in ensuring the
implementation of needed remedial actions like tariff increases,
development plans and institutional improvements.



- 25 -
9.08     It would have been preferable to define this project as a time-
slice of the investment program, and to pay more attention to following-up
the implementation of the expansion program. Indeed, it is difficult to
try to supervise the execution of hundreds of components as is the practice
for a fully defined project. Instead, it is preferable to concentrate on
broader matters like sector policies, development targets, planning
criteria, equipment standardization and procurement practices.

FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (LOAN 1450-CO)
PROJECT COHPLETION REPORT
ASSU"PTIONS AND PROCEDURE USED TO CALCULATE PROJECT COST:
a.        Total cost in current prices broken down by component and currency were
taken from the Completion Report prepared by TELECOM.
b.        Annual investments in current prices for 1979 to 1984 broken down by
component and currency were taken from the progress submitted by
TELECOM.
c.        Annual Investments Indicated in (b) were accumulated and investment for
1985 was estimated as the difference between total cost in (a) and the
accumulated cost.
d.        The annual costs calculated above for 1979-1985 were compared with
total investment figures taken from TELECOM's financial statements, and
were adjusted so that they were consistent with the financial figures.
Specifically, total  cost for  1985 was reduced substantially   and
redistributed among previous years.
e.        Costs in current prices were converted to constant prices using the
consumer price Index and the MUV index as deflators for costs in local
and foreign currency respectively.

COMMENTS FROM THE BORROWER
Erapresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones
Ministry of Communications
Bogota
Republic of Colombia
June 12, 1989
Mr. Alexander Nowicki

Project Completion Report
Dear Mr. Nowicki:
We received the report on the above-referenced project on
May 11, 1989-
Having carefully examined it we would like to make the following
comments:
a.   We feel that the document gives a sound and objective analysis of
the various factors affecting project implementation and target
attainment and of the setbacks that prevented its complecion on time
and the causes involved.
b.   We should like to point out that, despite all the difficulties
examined in detail in the report, TELECOM did make every effort to
attain and exceed the project targets, as is clearly demonstrated by
the results eventually achieved.
c.   We acknowledge that some of the targets were only partially
attained, as in the case of the failure to acquire more Municipal
Telephone Companies and to establish an effective procedure for
reducing the number of delinquent accounts, which was basically due
to the fact that TELECOM lacks the legal mechanisms required to be
able to take more effective action in this area.
d.   In our Project Completion Report of June 1986 we included
information about project costs with the proviso that these did not
include certain minor costs relating to the engineering studies and



- 44 -                           ATTACHMENT 1

the purchase of lots.  In our opinion, these costs are not so high as to
distort the information given and we therefore feel that the figures we
provide in our report are sufficiently reliable.
In closing, we wish once more to express our appreciation to the
Bank for all it has done, through its loans, to help make TELECOM's
development plans more consistent and for its assistance with the planning and
management of this type of project. We hope that in the near future we shall
again be able to count on its valuable assistance.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Emilio Saravia Bravo
President, Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones

Informe de Terminaci6n del Proyecto
Apreciado seflor Nowicki:
Con fecha 11 de Mayo de 1.989, hemos recibido el documento sobre eva-
luaci6n del proyecto de la referencia.
Despues de una cuidadosa revisi6n del misio, podrla meencionar a usted
los siguientes comentarios :
a.-  Encontramos que, efectivamente, el documento contiene un awz-
lisis serio y objetivo sobre los diversos factores que incidie-
ron en el desarrollo del proyecto, las metas logradas, y los in-
convenientes que se presentzron para su oportuno cumplimiento  y
las causas que originaron esta situaci6n.
b.- Queremos seftalar qu, TELECQM, a pesar de todas aquellas dificul-
tades ya aqpliamente analizadas en el documento, puso todo su em-
pefio y esfuerzo para cumplir y superar las metas fijadas en el
proyecto, como se demuestra en los resultados reales finalmente
obtenidos.

SR. ALEXWN=  NOWCa
C.-  ReOB que algunas de las metas se lograron solo parcialmente
coaw es el caso de no haber adquirido un mayor n(5mero de Empresas
Telef&nicas Municipales, el establecimiento de un procedimiento
eficaz para reducir las cuentas 'orosas, debido a que fundamental-
mente TELECCM no dispone de los mecanismos de orden legal
suficientes quo le permitan una acci6n mSs efectiva en este
aspecto.
d..- Por otra parte, en nuestro Infol.me de Terminacidn de Proyecto de
junio de 1.986, inclutmos la informaci6n sobre los costos del pro-
yecto con la salvedad de que no se contemplaban algunos costos
menDres relacionados con estudios de IngenierIa, y adquisici6n de
lotes. En nuestro concepto, estos valores no tienen tal tras-
cendencia que Ileguen a distorsionar la informaci6n presentada,
por lo cual consideramos que las cifras de nuestro informe son su-
ficientemente confiables.
Finalmente, reiteramos nuestra apreciaci6n en el sentido de que el
Banco, a travGs de sus emprfstitos, ha constribuido de una manera im-
portante en garantizar una mayor coherencia en los Planes de Desarrollo
de TELECM por su aporte en cuanto a orientaci6n y administraci6n de
este tipo de pr   tos. Esperamos que en un futuro pr6ximo tengamos la
oportunidad do   tar nuevamente con su valiosa cooperacidn.
