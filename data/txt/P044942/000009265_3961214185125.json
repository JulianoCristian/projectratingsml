the Pilot Water\n            Supply Engineering Project are to: 1) improve the design and\n            implementation arrangements for the full scale project\n            through a \"learning-by-doing\" piloting approach\n            and by incorporating community participation into the\n            planning and implementation process for water supply and\n            distribution; 2) speed up implementation of the full scale\n            project through early completion of detailed engineering\n            design and preparation of bidding documents; and 3) develop\n            and test joint financing and cost recovery schemes to\n            improve the financial viability of the Vodokanals and the\n            sustainability of their investments. The project consists of\n            two components: 1) an investment component to finance a\n            pilot project for a community based water supply and\n            distribution scheme in Kizketken peri-urban area of Nukus in\n            the Republic of Karakalpakstan; and 2) a technical\n            assistance component for management and supervision of pilot\n            project implementation, and for preparation of tender\n            designs and bidding documents for procurement packages for\n            the full scale project, followed by preparation of detailed\n            engineering designs, project management plans and\n            implementation schedules."}, "docdt": "1996-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
