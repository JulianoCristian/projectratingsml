Governor

People’s Republic of China
Dear Sir/Madam:
Re:  Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (CR 2423-CHA)
Amendment to the Project Agreement
I refer to the Development Credit Agreement dated December 30, 1992 (as amended 
by the letters of amendment dated April 30, 1996 and November 8, 1996, respectively, 
the Development Credit Agreement) between People’s Republic of China (the Borrower) 
and International Development Association (the Association) for the Financial Sector 
Technical Assistance Project (the Project), and to the Project Agreement of even date 
therewith between the Association and People’s Bank of China (PBC) in regard to the 
Project (the Project Agreement).  I further refer to the communication dated March 15, 
2000 from the  Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Borrower, requesting a 
supplemental loan from International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the 
Bank) to help finance Part A of the Project.
I am pleased to inform you that the Association concurs with the Borrower’s 
request to the Bank and in support of such request the Association and the Bank agree 
that the Project Agreement shall be amended as follows: 
1.
The Bank shall be a party to the Project Agreement which shall be an agreement 
between International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International 
Development Association and People’s Bank of China.
2.
The Preamble to the Project Agreement shall be amended to read as follows:
“WHEREAS by the Development Credit Agreement of even date herewith 
between People’s 
Republic of China (the Borrower) and the Association, as amended, 
the Association has agreed 
to make available to the Borrower an amount in 
various currencies equivalent to forty-two 
million one hundred thousand Special 
Drawing Rights (SDR 42,100,000), on the terms and 
conditions set forth in 
the Development Credit Agreement, and by the Loan Agreement dated                                                 
, 2000, between the Borrower and the Bank, the Bank has agreed to make available 
to the 
Borrower a supplemental Loan in the aggregate amount of eight 
million Dollars ($8,000,000), 
but in each case only on condition that PBC agree to 
undertake such obligations toward the 
Association and the Bank as are set forth in 
this Agreement;
WHEREAS PBC, in consideration of the Association and the Bank entering 
respectively  into the Development Credit Agreement and the Loan Agreement with the 
Borrower, has agreed 
to undertake the obligations set forth in this Agreement;”
3.
Section 3.01 of the Project Agreement is amended to read as follows: “Section 
3.01  Unless the context otherwise requires, the several terms defined in the 
Development Credit Agreement, the Loan Agreement and the General Conditions (as so 
defined in the Development Credit Agreement and the Loan Agreement, respectively) have 
the respective meanings therein set forth, and, wherever used in this Agreement 
(except in Section 6.03), reference to the Association, the Credit or the Credit 
Account shall also be deemed as a reference to the Bank, the Loan and the Loan 
Account, respectively.”
4.
The Project Agreement shall include a new Section 6.03 as follows, and 
accordingly Section 6.03 shall be renumbered as Section 6.04:
“Section 6.03. As long as the Bank has not given notice to the contrary 
to PBC and so 
long as the Development Credit Agreement shall not have terminated 
prior to the termination 
of the Loan Agreement:

plans, reports, records and statements to, the Bank shall be satisfied to

performance in respect of such obligations is rendered to the 
Association;

the obligations of the Bank to consult with, and to furnish 
information to, 
PBC shall be satisfied to the extent such obligations are 
fulfilled by the Association; and
(c)
all actions taken (including the giving of approvals or granting 
of waivers) 
by the Association pursuant to the Development Credit Agreement shall be 
deemed to be taken 
pursuant to both the Development Credit Agreement and the Loan 
Agreement, and in the name 
and on behalf  of both the Association and the Bank.” 
5.
Except as specifically amended pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 2, 3 and 
4 above, all terms and conditions of the Project Agreement otherwise remain in full 
force and effect. 
6.
Please confirm PBC’s agreement to the amendments set out above by signing the
