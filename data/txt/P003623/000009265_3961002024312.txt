MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA FOR A
FINANCIAL SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
credit of SDR 42.1 million ($60.0 million equivalent) to the People's Republic
of China to help finance a Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project. The
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity. The Government
of Japan is providing a cofinancing grant of $4.6 million equivalent.
2.        Background.  Prior to 1979, China had virtually a monobank system in
which most financial transactions were handled by the People's Bank of China
(PBC) with two other banks--the People's Construction Bank of China (PCBC) and
the Bank of China (BOC)--providing specialized services, the former as channel
for budgetary funds to state-owned enterprises and the latter as channel for
all foreign exchange transactions. There was also a network of rural credit
cooperatives (RCCs). Allocation of resources was primarily by fiscal direc-
tive; nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) were virtually nonexistent; and
financial instruments were limited to cash and bank deposits. Financial
reforms started in 1979 with the restoration of PBC as the country's central
bank and the reestablishment of the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) as a
specialized bank to take over PBC's rural banking functions. In 1984, PBC's
formal establishment as the central bank was completec with the divestiture of
its urban commercial banking functions to the newly created Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Reforms began to deepen in 1986, and the
financial sector has since undergone a rapid transformation. Many advances
have been made, while significant development challenges remain, a number of
which are addressed under the proposed project.
3.        The financial sector has grown and diversified to include, in addi-
tion to the institutions mentioned above, two comprehensive nationally repre-
sented banks, a development bank, numerous urban credit cooperatives and a
large number of NBFIs of various types (trust and investment corporations,
leasing companies, security corporations and insurance companies). Moreover,
the range of financial instruments has broadened to also include government
bonds, commercial paper, bankers acceptances, trade bills and bond-like enter-
prise shares. PBC has begun to develop increasingly sophisticated indirect
tools for monetary control and to give a larger role to interest rates in
mobilizing savings and, to a lesser extent, in allocating resources. The
various reforms have led to considerable financial deepening and succeeded in
reducing the role played by the budget in investment financing, while substan-
tially increasing the role of bank finance. A voluntary market in government
securitier is beginning to develop and two formal stock exchanges have been
opened in Shanghai and Shenzhen, while informal securities markets exist in
many other cities. Financial institutions have developed some, albeit still
limited, autonomy in making lending decisions and most major banks are now in
principle responsible for their own profits and losses.



- 2 -
4.        Notwithstanding these advances, there remains substantial scope for
further strengthening. The system is still overwhelmingly dominated by insti-
tutions (mainly banks), accounting for more than 90 percent of total financial
assets, reflecting the still nascent money and capital markets. Financial
intermediaries continue to be characterized by rudimentary management skills.
Price competition exists only to a limited extent and government intervention
in credit allocation--directed credit--remains greater than desirable, even
for a country in which many prices remain distorted. While the rapid abate-
ment of the high inflation in the late 1980s caused most interest rates
(excepting some priority lending rates and some deposit rates) to reach posi-
tive real lev'ls, inflationary pressures have increased, wnich may lead to a
need for an   tard adjustment in the level of interest rates.  Moreover, the
interest rate structure is characterized by a large number and wide dispersion
of rates. Although firm data are lacking, there has been a deterioration in
the quality of bank portfolios, while the level of provisions for bad debt is
insignificant and inadequate as a consequence of Ministry of Finance (MOF)
guidelines limiting the allocations a bank can make. The financial stability
of banks has also been affected by the changing composition of their assets
and liabilities.
5.        Perhaps most importantly, a number of the essential institutional
foundations for the sound functioning of any financial system require further
strengthening.   Most of these fall under the current mandate of the PBC, with
some also under the purview of MOF. In particular, prudential regulations are
virtuslly nonexistent and PBC's capability to supervise banks is just develop-
ing; the accounting framework needs significant modernization and at present
does not permit an accurate reading of financial conditions; the absence of a
modern payment and clearing system results in inefficiencies in the movement
of funds; the legal framework for the sector remains incomplete; and the
strategy and tools for government domestic debt management and the conduct of
indirect monetary policy are currently just developing.
6.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  The Bank Group has
financed five loan and credit operations to the China Investment Bank (CIB) to
support the development of a term lending institution, which, in turn would
foster the development of light industry. Bank Group involvement also com-
prised four rural credit operations with the Agricultural Bank of China. Fur-
thermore, CIB, and, in recent years, a number of other financial institutions
have been channels for Bank Group support for industrial development and
restructuring in metropolises such as Tianjin and Shanghai through city-based
projects, in provinces such as Gansu through province-wide projects, and in
rural areas through the cross-provincial Rural Industrial Technology (Spark)
Project. The implementation record has generally been satisfactory with
respect to the specific objectives of the operations. However, the country-
wide economic reforms over the last decade that transformed today's China
virtually into a mixed economy have also meant that the financial system as
such as has come under increasing pressure to adjust as well. Achieving the
objective of efficient financial intermediation is predicated on the develop-
ment of a sound regulatory framework and solid institutions, he-e the atten-
tion given to the development of the financial sector infrastructure under
this operation. The earlier operations have provided the Bank Group with a
basic understanding of the Chinese financial system; this was further enhanced
through a Financial Sector Review (Report No. 8415-CHA, June 29, 1990). The



insights gained and analysis effected have served as the basis for the design
of this financial sect .r technical assistance project.
7.        Rationale for Bank Group Involvement. Development of an efficient
financial sector is crucial to the success of China's economic reform program;
enhancing PBC's institutional capabilities and relevant capabilities of MOP
are key to strengthening the sector. The Bank Group has played a role in
identifying sector issues and providing recommendations for their resolution,
most recently iia the framework of the Financial Sector Review. The proposed
project would provide a vehicle for supporting the implementation of the
report's key recommendations and help to ensure the success of other planned
Bank Group operations involving financial intermediation. These other opera-
tions would complement the proposed project in supporting institutional
upgrading of individual intermediaries. The proposed project would pave the
way for certain policy reforms (notably in the areas of bank regulation,
supervision and accounting) and would provide a forum for continuing dialogue
on other reforms (in the areas of interest rates, directed credit, bank finan-
cial condition and provisions policy).
8.        Proiect Oblectives.  The main objective of the proposed project is
to support the development of an efficient and stable financial sector by
strengthening key financial sector institutions. Achievement of this objec-
tive will in tur.n improve the efficiency and effectiveness of resource mobili-
zation and allocation. Other objectives include providing the Government of
China (GOC) a noninflationary means of budgetary financing through development
of the government securities market and providing PBC with tools to conduct
monetary policy in a way which is conducive to the maintenance of macroecono-
mic stability. It was agreed during negotiations that GOC, IDA ard PBC would
annually review progress in financial sector reform, with reference to
selected areas (interest rates, directed credit, financial sector legislation,
loar loss provisions policy and bank financial condition and performance).
These discussions would also serve as a vehicle for the Bank Group to update
its knowledge of the composition and structure of the financial sector.
9.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project will support technical
assistance, training and/or equipment for the following key compinents:
(a) strengthening PBC's functions in the areas of banking  system regulation,
supervision (including the conduct of portfolio reviews of selected branches
of the specialized banks) and accounting (including the development of new
accounting standards for the financial sector and strengthening of PBC's own
accounting f4nction); (b) helping MOF modernize the overall accounting frame-
work and helping the Audit Administration of the People's Republic of China
(MPRC) modernize audit standards; (c) supporting the development of a more
efficient payment and clearing ^ystem; (d) strengthening PBC's capabilities to
more effectively fulfill its role as a fiscal agent and MO's goverrnment
domestic debt management role; (e) strengthening PBC's statistics and research
and monetary policy functions; (f) supporting selected activities of PBC's
legal department; (g) strengthening PBC's Graduate School; and (h) undertaking
a study on the management of directed credit. The project would complement
support being provided to PBC by the Asian Development Bank to develop the
.igulatory framework for the capital market. A breakdown of project costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procure-
ment and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Sched-
ule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank



- 4 -
Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10072-CHA, dated August 25, 1992 is being distrib-
uted separately.
10.       Actions Agreed.  At negotiations agreements on the following were
obtained:  (a) PBC and MOF to conclude consultants' contracts for the PBC and
MOF accounting cumponents and PBC supervision component as a condition of
credit effectiveness; (b) PBC to develop its supervision capacity by carrying
out comprehensive asset reviews of the four specialized banks: the first round
of which will necessitate 6 years starting 1993; (c) MOF to raise the ceiling
on the permissible level of loan loss provisions to at least 0.5 percent of a
financial institution's portfolio by end 1992; (d) HOF to develop over three
years, new accounting standards in harmony with international generally
accepted accounting principles, following a schedule agreed with IDA, and
(e) PBC to present IDA a proposed timetable for enactment of prudential regu-
lations within four months of completion of related consulting services.
11.       Benefits and Risks.  By strengthening regulation and supervision of
financial intermediaries, the proposed project will help _o ensure that the
full benefits of financial sector reform and increased institutional diversity
are reaped and not outweighed by enhanced sector instability. Accounting
reforms will make it possible for banks to accurately evaluate potential bor-
rowers' financial conditir,.s., give bank and enterprise managers the tools to
understand their performance and accordingly adapt their management strate-
gies, and facilitate capital market development. A modern payments and clear-
ing system will make economic transactions more efficient, and strengthened
domestic debt management will enable the GOC to finance itself in a manner
conducive to price stability. One project risk is that implementation of
financial reforms will not proceed at the pace required to create a favorable
environment for project implementation. While the 1989-91 austerity program
has entailed some strengthening of administrative controls, the authorities'
commitment to economic, including financial sector reform remains firm, pro-
vided such reforms are consistent with macroeconomic stability. Moreover,
even if specific financial sector reforms are delayed, the project is still
considered justified, given the long-term nature of institutional development
and the need to prepare the ground now for the time when their implementation
becomes possible. To guard against the risk that the project will overtax the
absorptive capacity of beneficiary institutions, each institution has estab-
lished a project management team, while IDA will closely supervise the proj-
ect.
12.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
