Assistance Project for China was satisfactory, and\n            project sustainability is regarded as likely. While overall\n            performance of both the World Bank and the borrower were\n            both highly satisfactory. The project had an impact on the\n            reform and development of China's financial sector. It\n            helped to introduce new concepts and international\n            practices, and proved to be a successful vehicle for\n            substantial knowledge transfer and human capital\n            development. The change of mind-set of government officials\n            was visible through the process of project preparation and\n            implementation. Today, the landscape of China's\n            financial sector is quite different from that of early\n            1900s, and the Project made modest contributions to these\n            changes, as it facilitated acceptance by the government of\n            the purpose, principles and benefits of improved prudential\n            regulation and supervision, adoption of international\n            accounting standards, indirect instruments for monetary\n            policy execution, market based government debt management,\n            modern payments systems, and strengthening the People's\n            Bank of China (PBC)'s research and statistics function\n            to provide a more robust foundation for monetary policy decisions."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
