objective of the project\n            would be to supply the power needs of the potash complex at\n            Ghor Safi, the phosphate rock mining works at El Hasa, the\n            cement plant at Rashadiya, and the rural distribution loads\n            in central Jordan from the national power grid. In addition,\n            the project provides for continued Bank assistance for\n            institution building within JEA, and for further\n            improvements in the institutional and financial arrangements\n            in the power sector. The project would comprise: (a) about\n            225 km of 132-kV double-circuit transmission lines; (b) five\n            substations, with a capacity of about 221 MVA and extension\n            of two existing substations; (c) a system operations control\n            center, with power line carrier and related communication\n            equipment; (d) electrification of 33 villages in the Central\n            Region of Jordan; (e) consulting services for project\n            engineering and construction; and (f) a training program for\n            JEA's staff."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
