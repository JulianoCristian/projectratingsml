Some of the salient lessons were these: 1)\n            Continuity in dialogue. When a Government is receptive to in\n            depth discussion on development and sector policies, a long\n            implementation period of a project may promote continuity\n            and trust in Borrower and Bank relationship and prevent\n            disruption in dialogue. 2) Transition in team leadership.\n            Changes in Bank team leadership during project\n            implementation require careful management of transition to\n            ensure evolution rather than shift in dialogue. 3) Public\n            sector crowding out. The full impact of subsidized\n            government agencies crowding out the private sector\n            development is difficult to appreciate at the beginning of a\n            privatization program. Inter-island maritime transport\n            turned out to be more feasible than expected originally as\n            the government subsidized company began to withdraw from the market."}, "docdt": "2004-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
