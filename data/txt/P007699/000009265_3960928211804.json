supports a program of deregulation in the trucking\n            sector, and a program of privatization and regulatory reform\n            that will promote competition in the telecommunciations\n            sector.  Pricing and taxation distortions in the two sectors\n            are being eliminated, and the public sector institutions\n            responsible for overseeing the sectors are being\n            restructured.  The loan also includes measures to improve\n            highway safety, and to monitor compliance by trucks with air\n            pollution standards."}, "docdt": "1990-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
