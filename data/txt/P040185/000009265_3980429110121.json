Reservoir\n            Project mitigation measures include: (1) preventing seepage\n            from salinization by: (a) placing a soil film on the slope\n            of the box dam and connecting it with another soil film\n            vertically buried under the ground of the dam base; and (b)\n            redesigning and re-planning the discharge system for\n            adjacent farmland; (2) protecting water quality by: (a)\n            burying water delivery pipes underground; and (b) using\n            plowing to prevent the sedimentation basins and sand\n            stockyards from desertification. Mitigation measures taken\n            for the Wastewater Project include using advanced machines,\n            rationally arranging construction time, high construction\n            efficiency, spraying water and covering the soil to reduce\n            the impacts of noise and dust to minimum level. The Heating\n            Project will mitigate the environmental impacts during the\n            construction phase by: (1) burying the pipeline network\n            under land which does not have natural resources; (2)\n            strengthening traffic management so that construction does\n            not interfere with the main traffic arteries and commercial\n            streets; (3) using advanced low-noise machines to reduce\n            noise disturbances; and (4) spraying water on the sands and\n            soils at the roadsides to reduce raising dust. After\n            operation, the Heating Project will use the following\n            measures: (1) removing dust by water film, adding limestone\n            for desulfurization, and equipping the coalyard with a water\n            spraying instrument to reduce air pollution; (2) using low\n            noise machines and soundproof facilities; (3) transporting\n            ash and cinder to a brick factory; and (4) discharging\n            wastewater to a treatment plant. Mitigation during the\n            construction and operation phases in the CHP Project\n            comprise measures similar to those to be used in the Heating Project."}, "docdt": "1996-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
