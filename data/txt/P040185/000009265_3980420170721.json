The project, part of a phased development program,\n            comprises a blend of policy and investment initiatives,\n            which support municipal strategies for environmental\n            recovery and sustained use of natural water resources.  The\n            five core components are: 1) investments in the Jihan\n            Municipality for surface-water storage, pumping,\n            transmission, and distribution facilities to improve water\n            supply system reliability and protect groundwater; and\n            investments in wastewater collection and pumping stations to\n            protect Xiaoqing River water quality and fully use existing\n            treatment facilities; 2) investments in district heating\n            systems in Weihai Municipality, comprising combined heat and\n            power generation plant and facilities, distribution systems,\n            and support services for improved air quality; 3)\n            investments in district heating systems in Yantai\n            Municipality, comprising peak boiler and heat exchange plant\n            and facilities, distribution systems, and support services\n            for improved air quality; 4) environmental pollution and\n            control; and 5) investments to support and strengthen\n            provincial, municipal, project, and financial management, as\n            well as construction of supervision services, training in\n            sector and utility operations,  and updating of the Xiaoqing\n            River Basin water quality and management database."}, "docdt": "1997-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
