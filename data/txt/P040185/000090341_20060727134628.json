Lessons\n            learned from the project: Transfer of Bank procurement\n            administration to the Country Office specialists was\n            efficient and cost-effective, as it facilitated project\n            implementation through prompt reviews, improved\n            communication and follow-up. Achievement of project\n            objectives was greatly facilitated by the degree of\n            ownership demonstrated by the client. Fees charged for\n            wastewater services need to be converted to a wastewater\n            tariff so that the funds collected become legal revenue of\n            the wastewater company. As in other China urban\n            infrastructure projects of similar vintage, costs are\n            overestimated through mandatory use of government schedules\n            of rates (which have proved to be 20 percent to 30 percent\n            higher than contract awards). Public-private partnerships in\n            the form of management contracts and financial participation\n            through sale of stock is becoming increasingly popular in\n            the water supply and wastewater sectors. The experience with\n            the expansion of the Jinan water distribution network not\n            being completed per the dated covenant points to the fact\n            that works integral to the project should be included in the\n            project, at least as reserve procurement."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
