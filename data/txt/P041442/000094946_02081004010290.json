However, these legal\n            provisions have not been systematically implemented in the\n            country, neither has a detailed legislation been enacted,\n            though under the 1993 Law, environmental impact assessment\n            is a pollution control instrument, as well as a development\n            planning instrument, currently being revised in a European\n            Union assisted project. Thus, environmental indicators will\n            be monitored annually, in accordance with the Law, and, Bank\n            operational guidelines will be included in the contract with\n            the private operator. Impacts, and its mitigation measures\n            are as follows. Rehabilitation of water production\n            facilities, and distribution networks will induce soil, and\n            water contamination by water treatment sludge, including\n            groundwater pollution due to construction run-offs, improper\n            waste disposal, and/or spillage of fuel and oil, while\n            vegetation will be degraded: waste disposal sites will be\n            selected, and drainage and runoffs controlled, including\n            performance of bacteriological, and chemical tests, while\n            oil spillage will be stored in tank/drums, and vegetative\n            propagation enforced. Noise disturbances will be abated by\n            limiting working schedules to daylight hours only, while\n            noise suppression devices will be installed in construction\n            equipment. Dust pollution will be suppressed through water\n            sprinkling, and removal of excess material. Traffic\n            increases will have to be re-routed in coordination with\n            local authorities, and standard safety measures."}, "docdt": "2002-10-31T22:20:03Z"}
