Some lessons learned included:\n            investment budgets under management contracts should be\n            sufficient in relation to existing needs if they are to have\n            an impact on the quality of service in line with\n            expectations of the clients. Risks associated with staffing\n            reductions need to be highlighted upfront in project\n            appraisal documents (PADs), especially where project\n            outcomes are partly dependent on the reductions. Moreover,\n            where such reductions are recommended in a project, staff\n            should be recognized as key stakeholders and their concerns\n            considered in the social analysis. The quality of the\n            operator's individual staff is of paramount importance\n            to the success of management contracts. While originally\n            offered staff appeared to possess the required\n            qualifications, the operator changed the expatriate staff of\n            its management team three times. The frequent changes\n            increased the difficulties of operator staff to become\n            knowledgeable of the systems and of the sector governance\n            and in the end reduced their effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2010-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
