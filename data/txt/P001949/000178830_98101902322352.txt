FEEDER ROADS PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:            Republic of Niger
Amount:              US$10.0 Million
Terms:                Standard
Project              The proposed project aims primarily at improving 1,000 km
Description:        of feeder roads which support Government's agricultural
program and creating an appropriate structure for exe-
cuting comprehensive feeder road programs. The project
would finance: (a) highway construction equipment and
spare parts; (b) labor, materials and supplies for the
improvement program; (c) expert services to assist in
establishing a Feeder Roads Technical Section in the
Directorate of Public Works, in implementing and moni-
toring the above program, and in training technicians,
mechanics, equipment operators and training officers; and
(d) construction of offices for the newly created Feeder
Road Technical Section. The improved feeder road network
will substantially reduce vehicle operating costs,
ameliorate the present marketing and input distribution
system and decrease storage costs and losses to the
farmer from crop wastage in the field. A portion of the
savings in transport costs would reach the farmers and
villagers as higher farmgate prices and lower prices for
imported commodities: direct gains would accrue to
farmers/producers through decreased losses from the
improved distribution system. The project faces no
special risks.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR A FEEDER ROADS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Niger for the equivalent of US$10
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a feeder roads project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report, "Economic Memorandum:  Niger" (RN 1109a-NIR) was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors on May 13, 1976. An economic mission
visited Niger in October 1978, and is now preparing an economic memorandum;
its main findings are incorporated in the following paragraphs. Annex I
contains country data.
Background
3.        With a per capita GNP of about US$250 in 1978, Niger is one of the
poorest African countries and amongst the 29 "least developed countries" so
classified by the United Nations. The country faces a number of formidable
constraints to development including poor soils, unfavorable climatic condi-
tions, landlocked position, high energy costs, high dependence on foreign
factors and low levels of education and technical ability. Agriculture and
livestock together provide employment and livelihood to about 90 percent of
the population and account for nearly half of GNP and a sizeable portion of
export earnings. However, substantial growth was achieved in recent years
in industry and particularly in uranium mining which has become an important
factor in expanding the Government's tax base and diversifying the country's
exports. As a result, and in sharp contrast with past trends, domestic gross
savings, mostly from the public sector, increased to 12 percent of GDP in
1978.
Recent Developments
4.        Niger's recent economic developments have been characterized by
growth in the agricultural sector and rapid expansion in mining and related
activities, mainly transport and construction. Following the catastrophic
drought-induced losses in 1973/74, production of the main staples picked up
again in 1974/75 thanks to improved rainfall and increases in producer prices.
Output fell again in 1975/76 to about 80 percent of the pre-drought level
because of premature ending and uneven distribution of rainfall in some of the
principal cultivation areas. In 1976/77, rainfall was almost normal and the
food situation improved. 1977/78 production was relatively good compared with
other Sahelian countries where inadequate and untimely rainfall again caused
severe crop failures. The outlook for 1978/79 is good. However, production
of groundnuts, the main agricultural export, remains at one-third of the
pre-drought level.



- 2 -
5.        The dominant feature of the economy in recent years has been the
continuous expansion in uranium mining related activities. Between 1971 and
1976, foreign investment in this sector amounted to some $275 million. Thus,
production of uranium concentrates increased rapidly from some 400 tons to about
2,000 tons in 1978, thereby facilitating the economy's recovery from the
severe effects of the 1973/74 drought. For the period, overall real GNP growth
was about 9 percent and, in 1978, uranium mining accounted for about 13 percent
of GDP, about two-thirds of total exports, and provided over one third of total
Government revenue. Present forecasts indicate that uranium production will
reach about 3,500-4,000 tons by 1980 with the entry into production of a
second mine.
Public Finance
6.        Over the last seven years, austere spending policies together with
rapidly rising revenue, mostly from uranium mining, have enabled the Govern-
ment to generate substantial current budgetary surplus. It amounted to
about CFAF 8.3 billion (US$34 million) in fiscal year 1976/77 and may reach
CFAF 13 billion (US$53 million) in fiscal year 1977/78. Two features of
particular importance were introduced in the 1977/78 budget: first,
the elimination of the head tax levied on all citizens between the ages of
15 and 65 and of the income tax on wage earners with an income below CFAF
15,000 per month, with a view to reducing the tax burden on lower income
groups; and second, the rise in capital expenditures in absolute as well as in
relative terms, from CFAF 10 billion in 1976/77 (28 percent of total budgetary
expenditures) to CFAF 13 billion (31 percent) which was also accompanied
by a substantial increase in the share of rural development investments. Both
measures reflect Government's increasing concern with the problems of social
equity and economic growth. As a result of the substantial increase in
budgetary savings, French budgetary grants, which averaged about CFAF 1.2
billion (US$5.0 million) annually over the 1970-75 period were discontinued,
and the contribution of public savings to total public investment increased
from 10 percent in 1970-75 to more than 25 percent in 1977-78.
Balance of Payments
7.        The rapid increase in export earnings from uranium notwithstanding,
Niger's balance of payments continues to be characterized by a substantial
trade deficit: the imports required for operating the economy as well as for
new capital formation still exceed foreign exchange earnings. This trade
deficit was however more than compensated by the inflow of public and private
foreign capital, so that the overall balance of payments showed a substantial
surplus until 1977. At the end of 1977, Niger's foreign exchange reserves
amounted to some $90 million, equivalent to four months of imports. Preli-
minary estimates for 1978 appear less favorable. For one thing, the drought
impelled the Government to import foodgrains worth some US$15 million. For
another, the Government is intent on doubling imports of capital goods to
speed up the implementation of development projects. Therefore, despite
higher export proceeds from uranium, foreign exchange reserves declined
somewhat in 1978. Over the near to medium term, however, Niger's trade
balance deficit should be narrowing not only because of expected further
increases in uranium export earnings, but also because of the potential
recovery of agricultural production and exports.



- 3-
Development Issues and Prospects
8.        Niger's rural sector provides employment and livelihood to about 90
percent of total population. The Government's strategy assigns top priority
to efforts to improve agricultural productivity and to alleviate the economy's
vulnerability to the vagaries of the weather, with a view to ensuring some
degree of food self-sufficiency and promoting cash crops for export. The
basic constraints to be tackled are the poor and apparently deteriorating soil
fertility and the scarcity of arable land in relation to the rapidly growing
population: the cropping area amounts to about 10 percent of total land area
of which only one fifth is under cultivation at any given time under the
existing rotation system of cultivation. The Government has therefore
initiated a "productivity program" aimed at introducing more intensive farming
through provision of extension services, dissemination of adapted seed varie-
ties and introduction of appropriate agricultural techniques and implements.
Special efforts are needed to restore exports of groundnuts which suffered
from the drought in 1972/74 and pests in recent years. Increasing attention
is also given to forestry in recognition of the vital role of forests in
maintaining the country's fragile ecological equilibrium and as the most
important source of energy in the medium term.
9.        While on one hand the productivity program, which is expected
eventually to cover the entire rainfed agricultural area, represents the best
way to improve the standards of living of the vast majority of the rural
population, the Government has also begun the development of irrigation
schemes that could lessen the country's vulnerability to the vagaries of the
weather. At present there are some 16,000 ha which the Government is develop-
ing for double cropping at the rate of about 1,000-2,000 ha annually.
10.       A livestock herd reconstitution program initiated in 1976 is progres-
sing satisfactorily, but pre-drought cattle numbers cannot be achieved until
1990. To avoid overgrazing, the strategy for full development of the livestock
potential also aims at establishment of an organization for land use and
grazing patterns based on a better utilization of Niger's different ecological
zones.
11.       The Government also attaches priority to the exploration and ex-
ploitation of the country's mineral resources. As indicated above, uranium
already provides much needed momentum to the economy through substantial
Government revenues and export earnings. In addition, there are indications
of large but as yet unassessed phosphate deposits. Several foreign companies
are also actively engaged in oil and gas exploration. There is therefore a
considerable potential for mineral production; the judicious utilization of
the resulting mining proceeds could lay a sound basis for sustained economic
growth and diversification. The industrial sector offers reasonably hopeful
opportunities for Niger's urban and rural underemployed population. Through
technical assistance and increased investment funds Government is attempting
to improve its industrial policies.



- 4 -
12.       Despite considerable increases in the past two decades of primary
and secondary school enrollments, Niger's education base has improved only
marginally: more than 90 percent of the population is still illiterate.
The shortage of qualified manpower constitutes a critical development con-
straint in the medium term. There is increasing recognition within Govern-
ment that a major educational reform is needed.
Development Planning
13.       Government development objectives are broadly reflected in the
Interim Plan which proposed an ambitious program of public investments of CFAF
78.2 billion (US$320 million) during the 1976-78 period. This program emphasized
agriculture (33 percent), transport infrastructure (30 percent) and development
of human resources (18 percent). About one fourth of total investment was
expected to be financed by domestic resources, reflecting the Government's
determination to mobilize domestic savings to the fullest extent possible.
While the final outcome of the Interim Plan will not be known for some time,
indications are that actual implementation will fall short of the initial
provisions due to absorptive capacity constraints and delays in external aid
commitments. A new five-year plan covering the 1979-83 period is currently
under preparation. It is expected to further the general strategy initiated
under the Interim Plan. The recent expansion in uranium production has
undoubtedly strengthened the Government's capacity to contribute to the
financing of public investments. Nevertheless, in view of Niger's extreme
poverty, foreign aid agencies should continue to finance a high proportion of
total project costs, including local costs in appropriate cases.
Foreign Aid
14.       Between 1971 and 1977, Niger's total recorded net flow of re-
sources from DAC countries and multilateral agencies averaged about U$$80
million annually of which 95 percent was on concessionary terms. No reliable
information is available on external flows from other sources. The European
Developm2nt Fund (FED), France, Germany and Canada remain Niger's major
aid donors. In the last two years Saudi Arabia and Algeria have expanded
their programs of lending to Niger.
15.       At the end of 1976, external public debt outstanding amounted
to US$284 million, including an undisbursed amount of US$135 million.
The ratio of debt service to exports of goods and non-factor services was
3.5 percent in 1973 and 5.4 percent in 1976. No significant increase in
external debt has taken place over the last three years and no debt servicing
problems are foreseen in the near future. The Association ranked as Niger's
second largest creditor with 19.4 percent of total debt outstanding and
disbursed. However, the Association's share in total debt service payments
is insignificant as a result of the IDA terms and amortization schedule.

PART II - WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGER
16.        Beginning with a credit for road construction in 1964, fourteen
IDA credits, including two supplementary credits, have so far been approved for
Niger totalling US$78.0 million.   Past Bank Group lending was heavily concen-
trated in transport and communications, where inadequate facilities hampered
the development of the country: of the fourteen projects approved to date,
four aimed at expanding and up-grading the domestic road network, one provided
for improvement and extension of existing facilities at Niamey international
airport; and one for the installation of a more reliable telecommunications
system. In general, all operations are proceeding satisfactorily. Annex II
contains a summary statement of these credits as of December 31, 1978 and
notes on the execution of on-going projects.
17.       Future Bank Group lending will increasingly focus on efforts to
ensure self-sufficiency in food and to improve the incomes and standard of
living of the rural population; to gradually upgrade the physical infrastruc-
ture and improve its maintenance; to develop alternative approaches to train-
ing and educational reform; and to diversify the economic structure and expand
modern sector employment. We will also continue to advise Government on
policy issues and options through our economic and sector work.
18.       For the two fiscal years 1979-80, the bulk of the Association's
lending to Niger will go to the rural sector. A recently approved irrigation
project will assist in the expansion of cereal and vegetable production along
the Niger River and in creating the appropriate structure for the development
of the country's irrigation potential. A proposed livestock project would
support efforts to speed up the reconstitution of herds, to increase livestock
productivity and to promote effective participation of the pastoralists in the
management and improvement of communal rangelands and stock watering points.
A second rural development project, designed to increase rural incomes through
increased productivity in rainfed farming in the Dosso area, has also just
been appraised.
19.        In transport, we plan to place emphasis on assistance for the
construction of a network of secondary and access roads to support the Govern-
ment's agricultural program while continuing our support for maintenance of
the existing infrastructure; the proposed feeder roads project will mark a
first step towards this objective. In education, our objectives are to help
the Government to address the urgent problem of developing qualified high and
middle level manpower, particularly for agricultural development activities,
and to achieve some expansion in enrollment, improvement in the quality of
existing institutions and development of non-formal education programs. To
increase our knowledge of petroleum exploration and prospects and assist the
Niger Government in developing petroleum resources, a consultant engaged by
the Bank recently visited Niger to assess existing local expertise and current
policies. In general, all future projects will also include, as needed,
training, technical assistance, and other provisions necessary for strengthen-
ing institutions.

PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Transport System
20.       Niger's internal transport system consists of roads and air trans-
port and some river transport on the river Niger. External transport require-
ments are largely met by road/rail routes to the ports of Lagos (Nigeria),
Cotonou (Benin), Lome (Togo), and Abidjan (Ivory Coast).
21.       Road transport is the predominant mode.  The road system extends
for about 18,400 km of which 11,000 km are unclassified tracks and feeder
roads and 6,923 km are classified of which 1,761 km are paved. Most of the
road network is in the southern 25 percent of the country in the form of a
paved east-west trunk road.  In addition, there is a major north-south road of
about 650 km linking the uranium mining area of Arlit to the east-west trunk
road. The Arlit road is currently being upgraded to paved standards for most
of its length financed by the uranium mining industry in which Government
share is approximately one-third.
22.       Owing to the size of the country, internal air services assume a
considerable importance. Niamey, the capital, has an international airport
capable of serving jumbo aircraft. There are also five regional airfields
served by the Government owned Air Niger using DC 3, DC 4 and Fokker F 27 on
scheduled domestic services.
23.       The Organisation Commune Benin/Niger (OCBN) controls commercial
ground traffic between the Benin port of Cotonou and Niger using the Cotonou-
Parakou railway and road transport to Niamey. This is the main import/export
route (except for fuel which comes from Nigeria) and is jointly administered
by the governments of Benin and Niger.
Transport Sector Management, Investments and Bank Group Activities
24.       The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Urbanism (MPWTU) has
overall and direct responsibility for planning and executing works related
to classified roads, airports and public buildings. These responsibilities
are carried out through the Directorate of Public Works (DPW) and the Direc-
torate of Transport (DT). Unclassified roads which include most feeder roads
are the responsibility of local administrations responsible to the Ministry of
Interior. Interministerial planning is coordinated through the Ministry of
Planning's (MP) Directorate of Programming and Planning.
25.       Government objectives in the transport sector which will be detailed
in the Five Year Development Plan 1979-83 currently under preparation, include:
(a) improving the main and secondary road systems; (b) constructing and
improving the feeder road system; (c) studying the feasibility of extending
a rail service into Niger; and (e) improving internal air services.



26.       In the period 1970-77, investment in the transport sector totalled
over CFAF 38.7 billion (US$161 million equivalent) of which 90 percent was in
the road sub-sector. During these eight years, Niger has concentrated on
improving its primary and secondary road network. Less than 1 percent of
road investment has been spent on feeder roads which in many areas are in-
adequate. During 1972-77, road maintenance expenditures for classified roads
amounted to about CFAF 4.8 billion (US$21 million equivalent) which is one of
the highest expenditures per kilometer in West Africa (an average expenditure
of US$1,000 per km was attained at the end of the six year period). The level
of transport investment had not risen in real terms in recent years but
between 1974 and 1977 road maintenance expenditures showed an increase of 23
percent in constant prices.
27.       Since 1965, the Bank Group's first objective in the transport sector
in Niger has been to help Government improve its highway maintenance and
administrative organization including training of local personnel. Further
improvement is underway and planned under future highway projects. The second
objective of the Bank Group has been to assist Government in the development
of its alternative international access routes including financial and tech-
nical assistance for the improvement of the OCBN Cotonou-Niamey route through
expansion of the Cotonou Port (Cr. 826-BEN) and upgrading of the Cotonou-
Malanville road (Cr. 415-BEN), and provision of advice for a feasibility study
of the Agadez-Zinder (Trans-Sahara) road. Bank Group involvement in interna-
tional transport projects also includes implement and strengthening of the
Niamey International Airport (Cr. 673-NIR).
28.       Project Performance Audit Reports on the Maintenance and Second
Highway Project (Crs. 128 and 231-NIR) concluded that the two factors mainly
responsible for the successful implementation of these projects were Govern-
ment's positive attitude toward maintenance and the adoption of a staged
approach first concentrating on routine road maintenance and later on periodic
maintenance. The major difficulties resulted from overoptimistic assumptions
regarding training of mechanics using conventional techniques. Remedial
action to adapt training techniques is now in progress. The ongoing Third
Highway Project (Cr 612-NIR) reinforces the periodic maintenance program for
unpaved roads and staff training. This project will also finance a survey of
the local road construction industry.
29.       The proposed feeder road project represents the first major effort
in providing for feeder road needs and integrating their planning, construction,
improvement and maintenance into the overall transport strategy. In addition,
it establishes the institutional structure to improve coordination in feeder
road planning and execution between the Ministries of Planning, Rural Develop-
ment, Interior and Public Works, Transport and Urbanism.
The Highway Sub-Sector
30.       A recent estimate of the vehicle fleet gives a total of 13,470
vehicles (about 1 for every 370 inhabitants) of which nearly 80 percent are
passenger cars and vehicles with a carrying capacity of less than 2 tons, and



- 8 -
the remainder buses and trucks. Fuel consumption statistics indicate a growth
rate of between 5-6 percent per annum. The low level of rural development
and inferior standards of the 11,000 km of unclassified road network contri-
bute to scanty traffic flows. At most 5 percent of these roads carry in
excess of 10 vehicles per day. The majority of vehicles operating over the
feeder roads are four-wheel drive vehicles with high operating costs and low
load capacities.
31.       The Directorate of Public Works of the MPWTU is responsible for
the construction and maintenance of classified roads. Most construction and
supervision has been carried out by foreign contractors and consultants, the
local construction industry consisting of only two firms. Maintenance of
Niger's classified road system is generally of an acceptable standard.
Certain deficiencies in the periodic maintenance of gravel roads are being
addressed in the Third Highway Project (Cr 612-NIR).
32.       The Ministry of the Interior, through the local administrations
and employing DPW staff and equipment on a hired basis, is responsible for
the maintenance of the unclassified road network. Due to lack of technical
personnel and limited funds this maintenance has been restricted-to about 5
percent of the unclassified network. In many cases roads have deteriorated
to such an extent that reconstruction is required.
33.       The proposed project seeks to establish a rational organization,
initially under the aegis of the DPW, to improve and maintain the more
important feeder roads. Government has agreed to transfer responsibility for
these roads from the Ministry of the Interior to DPW. Eventually, the possi-
bility of decentralizing feeder road improvement and maintenance will be
re-examined. Government has also agreed to furnish to the Association, when
available, the sections of its Transport Plan relative to feeder roads (Section
4.03 of the Credit Agreement).
The Road Transport Industry
34.       The road transport industry is controlled by the Directorate of
Transport (DT) through regulation and licensing. The industry is dominated
by the Societe Nationale de Transports Nigeriens (SNTN) which is 49 percent
state owned and controls about 60 percent of road traffic operating on the
international routes and on the trunk road network. Most other transport
companies are grouped together in a Syndicat des Transporteurs. In all there
are just over 1,000 licensed transport operators licensed. There are probably
about 100 trader/transporters, operating on the average 5-6 vehicles each,
who are active mainly in the rural areas and among whom considerable competi-
tion exists, particularly where road standards are adequate.
Road Investment
35.       From 1970 to 1977, CFAF 35.5 billion (US$154 million) was invested
in road construction and improvement of which external financing provided 85
percent. Of this, the European Development Fund (EDF) financed about CFAF
12.7 billion (US$55 million) and the Association about CFAF 3.9 billion



(US$16.8 million). Road maintenance (excepting equipment procurement) is
financed from Government sources (National Budget and National Investment
Fund) derived from road user charges. Road user charges in Niger are rela-
tively low averaging CFAF 138,000 (US$600) per vehicle per year, but fully
cover road maintenance expenditure. There is scope for an increase if this is
required either for road construction or for maintenance of feeder roads and
tracks. Government will undertake maintenance of project roads and review
with the Association not later than May 31 of each year the budgetary proposals
for maintenance operations of the following fiscal year (Section 3.01(b) of
the draft Credit Agreement). By the end of the project period about CFAF 25
million (US$120,000) per annum will be required to maintain project roads.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       A report entitled "Niger Feeder Roads Project Staff Appraisal
Report" (No. 2219-NIR) is being circulated separately. Supplementary project
data is contained in Annex III. The proposed project is based on a con-
sultants' study financed from the Project Preparation Facility. A field
appraisal mission took place in April 1978, followed by a post-appraisal
mission in July, 1978. Negotiations were held in Washington from January 9
to 12, 1979. The Niger delegation was led by H.E. Andre Joseph Wright,
Ambassador to the United States.
Project Description
37.       The proposed project has as its main objective the construction,
improvement and subsequent maintenance of about 1,000 km of feeder roads
serving agricultural development areas. It would represent the first feeder
road project in Niger and would create the necessary institutional structure
for project execution and development of comprehensive feeder road programs.
Considerable emphasis will be placed on training local staff. The main
components of the project would be:
(i) purchase of equipment, spare parts and workshop tools;
(ii) provision of materials and supplies;
(iii) construction and repair of small structures
by local contractors;
(iv) construction of offices for the FRTS; and
(v) technical assistance of about 210 man months comprising
(a) about 150 man months to establish a feeder road unit
within DPW to implement the proposed feeder road program;
(b) 40 man months of training specialists for civil and
mechanical works; and (c) 20 man months of services of an
economist/cost accountant to establish a cost accounting
unit, to monitor and analyze the results of the project, to
prepare annual work programs and proposals for a long term
feeder road strategy, and to develop a follow-up program.

Feeder Road Program
38.       Feeder road improvement costs under earlier agricultural projects
proved to be quite high due to the use of conventional highway design stand-
ards. The proposed project will employ lower, more suitable standards based
on probable traffic flows during the next ten years, topographical and soil
conditions (Schedule 4 of the Credit Agreement).
39.       About 1,300 km of feeder roads and tracks of particular interest to
major rural development projects in Dosso, Tahoua, Maradi and Zinder provinces
has been identified. Approximately 1,000 kms of these roads will be improved
under the proposed four year program. Of the 1,300 km of roads identified,
preliminary studies show that 890 km yield an individual rate of return
greater than 10 percent. Based on priority needs of agricultural projects, a
firm first year's program for construction/improvement of 189 km of roads has
been identified from the 890 km cited above and agreed with Government. Roads
for the subsequent years of the project will be selected by an Interministerial
Feeder Road Committee (IMFC) and, following technical and economic analysis
and programing by the Feeder Road Technical Section (FRTS), a program for
construction improvement and maintenance will be submitted to the Association
for agreement two months before the start of each year's program. Government
has agreed that roads selected would (a) be essential components of economically
viable rural development projects, for which firm plans exist; (b) derive
benefits from transport cost savings, reduced spoilage of exported and imported
commodities and reduced crop storage costs; (c) include other important
socio-economic benefits in accordance with national development objectives;
and (d) show an economic rate of return of at least 10 percent (Sections
3.08(a) and (b) of the draft Credit Agreement). Physical execution of the
project is scheduled to begin in January 1980 and to be completed by
December 31, 1983.
Implementation
40.       The Ministry of Planning will have overall administrative responsi-
bility for the execution of the project, operating through an Interministerial
Feeder Road Committee served by a Feeder Road Technical Section in DPW's
Department of Roads and New Works (SCRTN). Establishment of the IMFC and the
FRTS would be conditions of Credit effectiveness (Section 5.01 of the Credit
Agreement). The head of the technical assistance team, the economist and the
costs/works accountant together with their Nigerien counterparts will be
located in the FRTS. The Feeder Road Technical Section will have direct
responsibility for the execution of the road construction and improvement
works, training and project monitoring and overall supervision of maintenance.
Actual maintenance of project roads will be undertaken by the maintenance
organizations in the sub-divisions of DPW.
41.       Road improvement and maintenance will be undertaken by (a) one heavy
mechanized brigade; (b) one heavy mechanized training brigade; (c) one light
mechanized brigade; and (d) two light routine maintenance units. The light
mechanized brigade will work essentially in those areas where soil and terrain
types do not warrant the use of more and heavier equipment. Major civil works



- 11 -
will be carried out by force account. Labor intensive techniques were examined
in Niger but were found to be ineffective owing to relatively sparse popula-
tion, the competing demand for labor in Nigeria and in the expanding uranium
mines at Arlit, and the poor working conditions due to very high temperatures
occurring for much of the year. However, considerable use will be made of
small contractors (tacherons) for the construction, improvement and repair of
small road structures using essentially labor intensive operations: the
performance of these contractors will be carefully monitored and related to
the results of the study of the local contracting industry which is to be
financed under the Third Highway Project.
Technical Assistance
42.        In view of the shortage of local qualified staff at all levels in
DPW, particularly those with experience of direct labor works, about 210 man
months of technical assistance would be provided under the project to the
Feeder Road Technical Section of DPW. Eleven experts including highway and
training engineers, mechanics and technicians would be employed to:
(a) define and implement the annual feeder road construction,
improvement and maintenance programs;
(b) monitor the engineering, economic and social aspects of the
project;
(c) train DPW staff at all levels but particularly senior civil
works technicians and foremen, mechanics, plant operators
and cost analysts through formal and practical training;
(d) determine the most appropriate construction technologies
to use including the use of small contractors; and
(e) elaborate a proposal for a strategy to identify and meet
feeder road needs including the definition of the most
suitable institutional structure.
Technical assistance staff will be phased out during the course of the proj-
ect, and in the final year, operations will be run entirely by Nigerien staff.
43.        Consultants will have qualifications and experience and be employed
in agreement with and under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Borrower
and the Association (Section 3.02(a) of the draft Credit Agreement). Local
counterpart and trainee staff will be appointed to all the technical assis-
tance staff. Where deemed necessary, these local staff will be rotated
into the training program. The selection of the consulting firm will take
place by April 30, 1979. The Chief of mission will take up his duties by
September 30, 1979 with other experts arriving as required by the project.
Key local personnel will be recruited and take up their duties in conjunc-
tion with the arrival of their consultant counterparts. (Sections 3.02(a)
and (b) of the draft Credit Agreement).



- 12 -
Training
44.       The main training effort will be carried out by means of the pro-
duction/training brigade and formal classroom/workshop training for which
two training specialists will be employed. This will be closely coordinated
with the training component of the Third Highway Project, making use of the
same facilities in Niamey. Classroom equipment and teaching materials
will be financed under the proposed feeder road project for the additional
students using the facilities. The training program will be submitted to the
Association for review no later than December 31, 1979 (Section 3.09 of the
Credit Agreement).
Cost Estimates
45.       Government has informed the Association of its intention to exempt
the project from import duties and taxes except for those taxes on civil
works carried out by local contractors. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$13.0 million including US$.12 million for the civil works
taxes to be paid by local contractors. Foreign exchange expenditures comprise
about US$9.3 million or 72 percent of the total. Associated with the project
but not included in the cost estimates are US$0.3 million for operating costs
of routine maintenance of the project roads during the implementation period,
which will be financed by Government. Cost estimates of equipment and tool
costs are based on April 1978 prices in Niger. Operating costs are based
on 200 workdays per year with 6 hours operation per day using current Niger
costs. The average productivity of a training brigade has been estimated at
70 percent of a normal brigade. Approximately 750 km of roads will be con-
structed/improved to Class II at a cost of US$6,000 per km, and 250 km to
Class III at a cost of US$8,700 per km. Technical assistance is to be pro-
vided by consultants at an average cost of US$7,500 equivalent per man/month
of which $5,500 will cover salary, overhead, social security and overseas
allowance with the balance comprising reimbursable expenses (housing, travel,
etc.).
Financing Plan
46.       The proposed IDA credit of US$10.0 million would finance about
77 percent of total project costs net of taxes, i.e., 100 percent of foreign
costs and 18 percent of local costs. Government will finance about 23 percent
of total project costs, representing the balance of local costs (US$3.0
million).
Procurement and Disbursement
47.       Use of small local contractors is envisaged for the building of
structures such as fords, small bridges, culverts and offices for the FRTS.
Civil works under this category total approximately US$580,000. The cost of
works carried out through force account would amount to US$8.3 million (of
which US$2.3 million is local cost). Procurement of equipment would, in
limited cases, be complemented by the rental of equipment from local con-
tractors at an estimated cost of US$.08 million.



- 13j -
48.        Equipment, vehicles, materials and supplies amounting to about
US$6.4 million (excluding contingencies and net of taxes) will be procured
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Group guidelines. Contracts for equipment, materials, vehicles and supplies
costing under US$60,000 may be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding following local procedures which are acceptable to the Association;
the aggregate amount of such purchases shall not, without the approval of
the Association, exceed US$400,000. Contracts for building small structures
and transport of materials totalling about US$300,000 will also follow
local competitive bidding procedures. Consultants for technical assistance
will be employed in agreement with and under terms of reference and conditions
satisfactory to the Association.
49.       The IDA credit would be disbursed to cover 100 percent of the
foreign costs of imported equipment, spare parts, materials and supplies
or 80 percent of the local costs if these items were purchased locally;
25 percent of local labor costs; 58 percent of civil works carried out by
small local contractors; 70 percent of office construction and equipment;
100 percent of training materials; and 85 percent of total expenditures
for technical assistance. Requests for disbursement will be fully docu-
mented except for those involving local labor in which case certif&icates
of expenditure will be used.
Benefits and Risks
50.       The roads to be constructed/improved under the project have been
identified as being important for agricultural development projects. However,
the benefits accruing to the agricultural development projects have not been
attributed to the roads. Benefits resulting from road construction and
improvement under the proposed project were calculated on vehicle operating
cost savings (76 percent of benefits) reductions in crop spoilage (16 percent
of benefits) and lower food crop storage costs (8 percent of benefits). All
road improvements will have a minimum 10 percent rate of return. The 890 km
of roads identified as yielding an individual rate of return greater than 10
percent, and representing 90 percent of the roads to be included in the
project, have an overall return of 21 percent. The first year's program of
189 km for which detailed calculations have been made has a rate of return
of 26 percent. Particular importance is placed on the institutional and
training aspects of the project which represent important non-quantifiable
benefits.
51.       The project faces no special risks.  The strong technical assistance
element should help to ensure efficient project execution. Road improvements
are economically justified independently from the agricultural projects which
they serve. Little can be done in the short term to avert the effects of
natural calamities such as drought but improved communications will ease
relief measures.
52.       An increase in project costs of 20 percent would reduce the economic
rate of return to 14 percent, and a decrease in project benefits of 20 percent
will reduce the economic rate of return to 13 percent. If only vehicle
operating cost savings are considered, the economic rate of return would still
be acceptable at 11 percent.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 441 - Drought Relief Project, US$2.0 Million; Credit of
December 7, 1973; Effectiveness Date: May 7, 1974;
Closing Date: Miarch 31, 1979
This credit aims at helping the population in drought-affected
areas to reestablish their self-sufficiency through redevelopment and improve-
ment of their farms and herds. The project is nearing satisfactory completion.
Out of the seven sub-projects, six (training scheme, construction of rural
warehouses, spot repairs of a feeder road, engineering studies of an irri-
gation project, construction of erosion control facilities and protection
of gum tree natural groves) are completed. Construction of the last one (con-
struction and operation of calf feeding units) has finished, but it is not
expected to be fully operational until mid-1979.
Credit 608 - Maradi Rural Development Project; US$10.7 Million;
Credit of February 6, 1976; Effectiveness Date:
October 8, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project includes provision of production packages to farmers
in 15 Associations Locales de Cooperatives; strengthening of cooperative in-
stitutions, expansion of training programs, study of optimum means to develop
the irrigation potential of the Goulbi de M4aradi, construction of 80 km of
roads, planting of 500 ha of woodfuel plantations and improvement of livestock
services. The second year of project implementation shows that reasonable
managerial and technical progress has been achieved. Most of the project sub-
components are progressing satisfactorily. The training of extension staff
and young farmers is successful and emphasis should now be put on their
follow-up at village level. The irrigation program under preparation is
expected to start in mid 1979 and will be used as test for a possible second
phase project which would include a major irrigation component.
Credit 612 - Third Highway Project; US$15.6 MIillion; Credit of March 5,
1976; Effectiveness Date: January 31, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
This project aims at assisting Government with the implementation of
a four-year program of periodic maintenance, including procurement of equip-
ment and training of specialized public works staff, construction and improve-
ment of the Zinder-Nigerian border road (113 km) and of the Mlaradi-Nigerian
border road (40 km). The project is about one year behind schedule due to
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report problems
which are being encountered, and the action taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

delays in signature and effectiveness of the co-financiers' loan agreement.
The first three members of the consultant team for technical assistance and
training have arrived in the field and three more are due in October 1979.
Orders for road maintenance equipment were placed in July and delivery is
expected in early 1979. The contract for the study of the domestic construction
industry is being negotiated. Construction of the Maradi-Nigerian border road
was completed ahead of schedule and that of the Zinder-Nigerian border road is
expected to be completed by June 1979.
Credit 634 - Telecommunications Project; US$5.2 Million; Credit of
June 11, 1976; Effectiveness Date: November 9, 1976;

This project includes installation of automatic switching equipment
with cable and subscriber distribution networks; provision of trunk switching
equipment, three VHF links and one HF radio link, overhead line and carrier
equipment; civil works, miscellaneous equipment, vehicles and tools and
services of engineering and financial consultants. Bid evaluation and award
recommendations for the main project components have been reviewed and approved
by the Association. On the basis of the bid prices it appears that the
project is likely to exerpience a 24 percent cost overrun. Progress has been
made in carrying out the institution building component of the project.
Credit 800 - Forestry Project; US$4.5 million; Credit of June 7, 1978;
Effectiveness Date: February 7, 1979;

training program in extension services; provide assistance to research and
a workshop maintenance unit. A project unit will be established within the
Forestry Department to assist in coordinating and monitoring the various
project activities, plan rural forestry programs and prepare a second phase
suitable for Bank support.
Credit 809 - Industrial and Artisan Sector Employment Creation Project;
US$5.0 million; Credit of June 7, 1978. Effectiveness
Date: February 7, 1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
This project aims at assisting Government in the promotion of more
labor intensive employment creation in Niger's industrial and artisan sectors
while strengthening the sector's institutional infrastructure, by providing
a line of credit, training and technical assistance to BDRN, including the

1979; Projected Effectiveness Date: May 15, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The project will assist the Government in expanding cereal and
vegetable production along the Niger River through development of a 1,550 ha
polder, provision of agricultural development services on neighbouring
irrigation schemes (1,215 ha), and dryland farming plots (9,000 ha); and in
creating the necessary institutional framework for the implementation of its
irrigation development program through establishment of a national agency
(ONAHA) which would integrate and strengthen the activities of construction
and management of the irrigation schemes. The project will also finance the
preparation of a feasibility study for a nearby polder, as well as the
services of a financial coordinator to be attached to the Ministry of Rural
Development to assist in accounting and financial management of the various
IDA-financed agriculture projects in Niger.
