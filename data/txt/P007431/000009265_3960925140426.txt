PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JAMAIC.A
THIRD POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2188-JM)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) is for the Third Power Project in Jamaica for which
a Loan (2188-JM) for an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$ 30.5 million was approved
on June 24, 1982. Tae Loan was made to Jamaica Public Service Company, Limited (JPS) with the
guarantee of the Government of Jamaica and signeJ on July 27, 1982. The Loan became effective
on February 28, 1983 and was closed on December 31, 1997, two years behind schedule. The Loan
was fully disbursed, except for US$160,398.82 million, which was canceled as of September 18, 1989.
The last disbursement was on July 13, 1989.
Parts I and El[ of the PCR were prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Division of
Country Department II, the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office. These Parts were
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements; supervision
reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; internal Bank memoranda; and a
Project Completion Report (Part II of the PCR) prepared by the Jamaica Public Services Company
(fJPS).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on March 28, 1991, and comments received on May
27, 1991 have been incorporated into the report to the extent deemed appropriate. The letter
containing JPS's comments is attached to Part II of this report.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CMAI
THIRD POWER PROJECT
ILOAN 2188-3M)
Evalugtign Summarv
Introducti2a
1.        In 1982, the unreliability of the public power supply was a serious
constraint to economic recovery in Jamaica. JPS, the government-owned company
responsible for the generation, transmission and distribution of power
throughout Jamaica, was in poor financial condition and lacked sufficient
skilled personnel. Although JPS had sufficient installed generating capacity
to meet the system demand, it was unable to meet peak demand, because the
company's generating plant needed rehabilitation and overhaul. These
deficiencies were attributed to lack of finance and adequately skilled
personnel. The Government of Jamaica and JPS requested Bank assistance in
fiziancing a project to help overcome the difficulties being experienced in the
power sector (Part I, para. 2.01).
Obiectives
2.        The principal project objectives were (a) the improvement of the
quality of service, (b) the reduction of system losses; (c) the rehabilitation
of power plants and the improvement of the thermal efficiency of these plants;
(d) the extension and upgrading of transmission and distribution; and (-) the
strengthening of staff and management skills (Part I, para. 3.01).
Imolementation Exoerience
3.        The project consisted of the 1982-84 investments portion of JPS's
1982-85 investment program, excluding ongoing works. (Part I, para. 3.03).
The project was originally scheduled for completion by December 31, 1984, but
this was too optimistic for this type of project. After initial delays in
contracting, JPS's implementation performance was good. The project was
completed in 1988 (Part I, para. 5.01-5.04).
Results
4.        With the exception of reducing power losses, the principal project
objectives were met. Efforts to reduce power losses met with limited success,
and are being pursued further under the Fourth Power Project (Part I, para.
6.01 and 6.02).
5.        Plant reliability was restored and generating plant fuel
consumption reduced by about 30%, from 15,000 STU per kWh in 1982 to about
11,616 BTU por kWh in 1987. Plant availability also improved and, at Old
Harbour, improved from 30% in 1983 to 83% in 1988. GWh sales increased from
1017 CWh in 1981 to 1,371 Ghw in 1988 an increase of 35% (Part I, para.
6.02).



- iil -
6.        JPSa financial psrformance improved significantly an a result of
higher operating efficiency, tariff increasse and better financial management.
In 1980 and 1981 there were operating losses, rates of return were negative
and internal cash generation was inadequate to fully meet debt service and
sufficient maintenance, or to provide funds for capital spending. Currency
depreciation also increased costs. Between 1984 and 1987 operating profits
were restored, and rates of return ranged from 5.6% to 6.6%. Although the
1984-87 rates of return were below the covenanted levels of 8% for 1984 and
8.5% thereafter, the Bank accepted them in view of JPS's substantially
improving financial performance. In 1988, JPS met the initial 5% rate of
return under the Fourth Power Project. Intornal funding of capital spending
between 1983 and 1988 ranged from 20% to 100% (Part I, para. 6.03-6.04).
7.        The project, through the training program, met with some success in
improving JPS's management and technical performance. However, there was
excessive turnover of staff, and this diluted the benefits from these effort.
(Part 1, para. 6.05).
SustainabilitY
8.        It is expected that JPS's improved operating efficiency will result
in the project benefits being maintained. Operating efficiency will continue
to be monitored by the Bank under the ongoing Fourth Power Project (Part I,
para. 7.01).
Findings and Lessons Learned
9.        The main findings and lea ons learned are as follows:
(i)       Financial viability can be maintained if early action is
taken to increase tariffs to compensate for Lncreased
costs caused by currency depreciation.
(ii)      Loss of qualified staff, through inadequate compensation,
can dilute the effectiveness of training programs.
(iii)     Where there are insufficient qualified local staff to
carry out timely procurement and construction steps,
consultants should be engaged to avoid delayed project
benefits (Part I, para. 8.03).
(iv)      Project implementation and disbursements can be seriously
affected and delayed because of lack of sufficiently
trained personnel and the high turnover of personnel
caused by low salaries.

2.   Background
2.01      JPS, a government-owned power utility, is responsible for the
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity throughout Jamaica.
In 1982, the unreliability of the public power supply was a serious constraint
to economic recovery. Poor operational and maintenance practices resulted in
frequent power outages. System energy losses were excessive. Although JPS
had sufficient installed generating capacity to meet the system demand, it was
unable to meet peak demand because the generating plant needed rehabilitation
and overhaul. These deficiencies were attributed to lack of finance and
adequately skilled personnel. The Government of Jamaica and JPS requested
Bank assistance in financing a project to help overcome the difficulties being
experienced in the power sector.
2.02      The first Bank involvement in the power sector in Jamaica was
through a US$22 million loan to JPS in 1966 to help finance the cost of a
generating plant and associated transmission lines in the Greater Kingston
area. This was followed by a second loan in 1978 of US$22 million to help
finance urban transmission and distribution, as well as technical assistance
for the preparation of operating and maintenance procedures. Following the
Third Power Project, which is the subject of this report, the Bank made a
fourth loan to the sector of US$18 million in 1987 to continue the
rehabilitation and institutional programs.
3.   Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.01      Project Objectives:  JPS's 1982-85 investment program was aimed at
improving the quality of service, reduclng system losses, meeting projected
demand through rehabilitation of power plants, improving the efficiency of
thermal power plants, extending and upgrading the transmission and
distribution lines and str-ngthening staff and management *kill.

3.02      Proaram Description: The planned 1982-85 investment program
includeds
(a)  rehabilitation of four existing steam UAits at Old Harbor (206
NW) and two steam units at Hunts Bay (84 MW), as well as
overhaul of three 20 MW gas turbines;
(b) improvements to the boiler foed water treatment systems at
Hunts Bay and Old Harbor;
(c) an expansion program for transmission lines and associated
substations, including about 25 miles of new kV lines and 6.25
MVA of 69-kV transformer capacity;
(d) construction of a 25-mile, 6P-kV line between Annotto Bay and
Port Antonio, reconductoring of about 105 miles of existing kV
wood pole line, a new substation at Port Antonio and an
extension of the Annotto Bay substation;
(e)  expansion of distribution, including the addition or
rehabilitation of 24-kV lines; 68 MVA of distribution
transformers; 60,000 meters; about 55,000 distribution
extensions; 30 MVAR of capacitors and 2,500 street lights; and
(f) expansion of the existing supervisory control and automatic
data acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as the procurement of
about 75 vehicles noedod for implementation of the program and
operation and maintenance of the system.
3.03      Prolect Description.  The project consisted of the 1982-84 part of
the 1982-1985 investment program, excluding ongoing works, and included the
following:
(a) rehabilitation of three of the four thermal units, totalling
146 MV, and the improvements in the boiler feed water
treatment systems at Hunts Bay and Old Harbor power plants;
(b) construction of the 25-mile, 69-kV transmission lines from
Annotto Bay to Port Antonio, with expansion of associated
substations and upgrading of about 53 circuit-miles of 69-kV
wood pole lines;
(o) upgrading and extending of about 272 circuit-miles of 24-kV
primary distribution lines and related expansion substation,
installation of 1S MVAR of capacLtors, 39,000 KwH meters, 47
MVA of distribution transformers, 36,000 secondary
distribution extensive service, and 1,300 street lights;
(d) upgrading and extending the SCADA equipment and providing 50
vehicles for operation and maintenance of the project; and
(e) consultant services to perform studies on long-range
generation expansion rehabilitation of thermal power plants of

improv- top- and middle-level power plant management, improve
transmLsion and dLitribution system operation and
maintenance, and train Borrower's personnel.
4.   Proiect Deaign and Oroanization
4.01      The four-year construction program was prepared by JPS, with the
aseLstance of consultants employed under the Second Power Project, and was
estimated to cost US$86 million. The firat three years that made up the
project were estimated to cost US$49.1 milllon, of whlch the Bank loan of
US$30.5 milllon covered the forelgn exchange costs, .ncluding a front-end fee
of US$0.5 million. However, the ongolng works for 1985 do not consist of all
the 1982-85 program, except the project, but excludes the 1982-84 ongolng
works. Taking into account JPS's poor flnancial position, the project was
desLgned to keep construction lnvestment consLstent wlth adequate service
during the project execution period. Investment ln feeders was limited to
those glving the highest economic rate of return.
4.02      There was no additional generating capacity in the proposed program
because JPS had sufficient installed capacity to moet projected loads.
instead, the project provided for the rehabilitation of the existing thermal
units. Taking into account the urgent need to improve electricity service and
the financial constraints facing JPS, the project's concept and design was
appropriate and timely.
4.03      JPS was responsible for the implementation of the project, and was
assisted by consultants in the supervision of the power plant rehabilitation.
5.   Project Imrlementation
S.01      Loan Effectiveness and Proiect Start-up:  Loan effectiveness was
delayed by about four months to February 28, 1983, until JPS produced
satisfactory financial plans for achieving a 5 rate of return in 1983.
Delays in materials procurement and in contracting consulting services caused
a 12-month implementation delay. Steps leading up to the award of contracts
were carried out by JPS' staff, but JPS did not have sufficient qualified
engineers to perform out this task well.
5.02      Imolementation Schedule:  The project was originally scheduled to
be completed by December 31, 1984, but it was not completed until late 1988,
when the substation and transmission works were completed. The original
implementation schedule of about two and a half years to completion was too
optimistic. Generally, project implementation proceeded satisfactorily after
the initial delays.
5.03      Proiect Costs:  Final actual project costs were estimated at
US$41.1 million, compared to $49.1 million at appraisal. The difference was
mainly due to the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar, which resulted in lower
local costs, expressed in US dollars.



5.04      Loan Allocation:  The original and actual disbursements by category
are shown in Part III (Section 5(b)). Unallocated loan funds were mainly used
to finance additional distribution works.
6.   Proiect Results
6.01      Project Obiectives:  The project was successful in meeting the main
objectives of improving the re-ability of the public electricity supply,
improving the thermal efficiesr-. f the generating units, meeting the demand
for electricity, improving ma. -..ent and staff skills, and strengthening
JPS's finances (Part III, Section 6).
6.02      Physical Results:  As a result of the rehabilitation of the steam
units at Old Harbor and Hunts Bay, fuel consumption was reduced by about 30%
heat rate was 15,000 STU per kWh in 1982 (compared to 14,650 SAR figure) to
about 11,616 BTU per kWh in 1986 (compared to 13,500 SAR figure for 1985,
latest date in which estimate was made). Plant availability also improved,
and at Old Harbor improved from 30% in 1983 to 88% in 1988. GWh sales
increased from 1017 GWh in 1981 to 1371 GWh in 1988, an increase of 35%.
However, sales growth rate during the period 1981-85 was very modest and
increased significantly thereafter. This is due to the fact that, after 1973
and through 1980, the economy experienced a period of sustained contraction
resulting from external shocks and domestic policies persued. From 1980 to
1985 the economy had deteriorated significantly. As a consequence, demand for
electricity slowed down and remained somewhat stagnant. After 1985, the
economy began to turn around, hence the high electricity sales growth rate.
The average minutes of service lost per customer declined from 7,059 in 1982
to 1,468 in 1988. The project was not successful in reducing the level of
total losses to 15% (SAR target for 1985), as anticipated at appraisal, and
these total losses were reported at 19% in FY88 compared to 21% in 1981.
Difficulty was encountered in fully identifying the causes of the losses.
While the result achieved is below the 35% peak reached previously, this
figure remains high. A first study to identify the causes for these high
looses was not very conclusive. It did point out, however, that more efforts
should be made to reduce consumer irregularities and theft, expand the voltage
standarization and upgrading of czerloaded circuits and improve measurement of
the company's own consumption. Efforts are still continuing, and JPS
a,ibmitted a loss reduction plan to the Bank under the Fourth Power Project,
mr1A this is being closely monitored.
6.03      Financial Performance:  SAR projected and actual financial
statements for 1983 to 1988 are given in Part III, Annex 1. In 1980 and 1981
operating losses were sustained, rates of return were negative, and internal
cash generation was Lnadequate to fully meet debt service and adequate
maintenance. There was no internal funding of capital spending. Receivables
were at a very high level.
6.04      Between 1983 and 1988, JPS's financial performance improved
significantly as a result of higher operating efficiency, tariff increases and
better financial management. In FY86, JPS incurred an income tax liability
for the first time for several years. Between FY83 and FY87, operating income
was restored, and rates of return ranged from 5.6% to 6.6%. These were lower



than the covenanted levels of 8% for 1984 and 8.5S thereafter, but the Bank
was reasonable in accepting them in view of JPS'r generally improving
financial performance. In FY88, JPS met the 5% rate of return covenanted
under the Fourth Power Project (Loan 2869 JAM). Internal funding of capital
spending between 1983 and 1988 ranged from 20% to 100% in 1987 and 1988 when
capital spending was relatively low compared to the increasing rate base. JPS
was successful in reducing its level of receivables from 75 days at the and of
FY81 to 46 days at the end of FY83. JPS coaled to require additional
government contributions as a result of this improvement, thus reducing the
sector's burden on fiscal resources. In addition, JPS current ratio improved
significantly from 1.0 in 1983 to 2.1 in 1988.
6.05      InstitutLonal Pgrformance:  The Project met with some success in
improving JPS's management and technical performanco through the training
program.  JPS staff banefitted from the experience of working with consultants
temporarily engaged to occupy management positions. However, there was
excessive loss of qualified technical staff which resulted in turnover of
engineering and technical staff, and this diluted the benefits from these
efforts.
6.06      While the Bank considers these institutional results and
achievements are quite important for JPS as a whole, the Borrower tends to
give more weight to the technical and physical results of the Project in its
conclusion in Part II page 21 and 22. However, the Borrower does declare that
JPS is in much better position in 1988 than 1983 (page 22 and 23).
6.07      Internal Rate of Return:  Although lower than the 23% rate of
return estimated at appraisal for JPS's 1982-85 investment program, the
estimated 13% rate of return for the 1982-88 investment program is good (Part
fII, Section 6). The lower rate of return is explained mainly by (i)
increased program costs, expressed in Jamaican dollars, as a result of
currency devaluations (not matched by comparable increases in the local
currency prices of the benefit); (ii) initial delays in project start-up;
(iii) longer implementation period (iv) lower than expected benefits from the
loss reduction program and (v) lower fuel cost savings because of relatively
lower fuel prices than expected.
7.   Prolect Sustainabilitv
7.01      It is expected that, because of the improvements in JPS's operating
efficiency, the benefits under the project will bo maintained. To help secure
this, a set of performance indicators was agreed with JPS under the Fourth
Power Project. JPS also agreed on the continuation of a comprehensive yearly
maintenance and spare parts stock program and the adeguate implementation of
such a program.
8.   Bank Performance
8.01      There were eight Bank supervision missions over the eight year
implementation period and this, while less than ideal, was adequate. More
supervision effort was rightly made in the early stages of project
implementation, when timely start-up was a problem.



- 6 -
8.02      Without the support of the Bank, the standard of electricity
service in Jamaica would have deteriorated further from its poor level.
Throughout the Third Power Project, the Bank missions played a positive role
by continually focusing attention on the measures being taken to improve
performanco standards, and encouraging appropriate actions. The help and
support of the Dank was useful in securing tariff increases in 1984, and in
the changes made in the fuel adjustment clause to consumers so that fuel cost
increases were fully recovered. Also, the Bank's persistence was helpful in
achieving some modest improvements in the level of JPS's compensation. This
was essential to help retain qualified staff. These efforts are being
continued under the Fourth Powen Project.
8.03      The main lessons learned were as follows
(a) Financial viability can be maintained if early action is taken
to increase tariffs to compensate for increasing costs caused
by currency depreciation.
(b) Loss of qualified staff, through inadequate compensation, can
dilute the effectiveness of training programs.
(c) Where there are insufficient local staff to carry out timely
procurement and construction steps, consultants should be
engaged to avoid delayed project benefits.
(d) Appraisal forecasts of the pace of implementation and
disbursement were too optimistic, particularly when the weak
situation of JPS is taken into account.
(e) Remedial actions should have been taken early, at appraisal,
to address the problem of salaries adjustment in order to keep
the personnel and to avoid negating the benefits of the
training program.
9.   Borrower Performance
9.01      Generally, JPS performed well during project implementation. There
were start-up delays in contracting, but these were due to a lack of qualified
staff. There were significant improvements in labor productivity because of
the reduction in the number of employees, theft prevention, as well as a
reduction in staff levels and some improvements in labor relations.
10. Proicet Relationshios
10.01     A co-operative spirit was establisned early between the Bank
missions and JPS, and this was helpful in addressing problems related to
projoct implementation. Relationships between the Government and the Dank
were good.



-7-
11. Consultina Services
11.01     Consultants had a significant role in the success of the Project.
In line management consultants, provided by the technical assistance program
played a significant role in the improvement of JPS performance.  In addition,
consultants assisted in the successful rehabilitation of the thermal plants.
The provision of consulting services for operation and maintenance, and the
provision of a managing director and financial manager were especially helpful
in improving JPS's local management capability. Contractors and suppliers
performed satisfactorily.
12. Proiect Documentation and Rata
12.01     The project Loan Agreement was adequate for achieving the project
objectives, especially in ftnance, and in assuring the appointment of key
personnel. The appraisal report provided helpful reference throughout project
implementation, and in the preparation of the Project Completion Report.
JPS's completion report, also, provided useful data.

PROJtCT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD POWER PROJECT
PART II: PROJECT RZVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PRSRPEC TIVE.Y
A) 35P93
1.*  ITRODUflI
Based on a Capital Investment Program developed by the Jamaica
Public Service Company Limited, for the period 1980-87, the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development war approached to fund some of the vital
projects to enable the upgrading and expansion of the electrical system to
meet the growing demand and improve on system rehabliltation.
On July 27, 1982 a loan agreement for United stat-z Thirty Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$30.5 M) Loan No.2188-JAM was signed between
the World Bank and the Jamaica Public Service Company for funding the "IBRD
ThLrd Power Project." This loan became effective in February 1983.
The duration of the loan was initially to December 31, 1985 but this
was extended to December 31, 1986 in September 1985 and further to December
31, 1987 on November 25, 1986. This was necessary to allow full utilization
of the loan.
The loan provided for funding of projects aimed at catering for
expected load growth, allow for more efficient generation, provide re-
enforcement of the transmission system, and assist in the reduction of energy
losses throughout the system by standardizing ome of the primary distribution
system voltage at 24 kV and installation of capacitors on the distribution
system which also served to improve overall system power factor. Also
included in the loan was provision for consulting services and training.
This Project Completion Report will provide information on the
utilization and administration of the loan in the various performance areas.
It forms a part of the requirements of the World Bank.
jj The Borrower prepared this text and Annexes as Part rI. The latter were
disregarded to avoid repetition with similar Annexes in Part rrr.
Accordingly, the text was slightly amended to accommodate this.

2 *DOJO  IDTIXCXMXOM. PREPANAMXON AND APPRAIXA
2.1      SAa
The capital investment program covered the period 1980-87. This
program outlined the necessary infrastructure expansion needed to meot the
growing demand in the Electric Power Sector.
The World Bank, having successfully funded two earlier development
projects was approached for the continued funding of the investment plan, and
a loan application dated March 27, 1981 was submitted to the Bank.
After meetings and discussions the projects constituting IBRD Loan
2188-JAM Third Power Project was decided on.
The application for the loan included the following projects that
were not included in the final loan agreement.
Transaissiogn
(i)      Establishing the DUNCANS/B-llevue 138-kV transmission
line (26 miles).
substation: 
(i)      Expansion of the Duncans Substation 138-kV facilities;
and.
(ii)      Expansion of Bellevue Substation 138-kV facilities and
installation of a 12.5 MVA 69/24-kV substation.
Project included under the Third Power Project that was not
originally in the loan application document is:
Trulsdzzsiont
(i)       Replacement, upgrading and reconducting of about 53
miles of 69 ky-wood pole line.
2.2   Prenaration a   Anpraisal
The Enginearing and Projects, Production and Finance Divisions
worked closely together to prepare Economic and Technical justifications for
the projects. Interim reports were passed to the Bank for evaluation and
comments.
The method of justification used was pro-design system planning
feasibility type studies. This involved simulation of various system
configuration by utilizing various computer applications programs and
analyzing the results.



- 10 -
The project was initially met for completion by December 31, 1985.
However, two *xtensions wer- granted in September 1985 and November 1986
respectively for extension of the loan to a final completion dato of December
31, 1987. One of the contributing factors to the delay was the fact that the
loan agreement only came into effect in February 1983.
The preparation of the economic and technical justification was done
solely by the Jamaica Public Service Company and accepted by the Bank.
Technical guidance was also provided in-house for the detailed design and
implementation stage.
2.3   Taroats and Goals
The project was aimed at improving the quality of electricity
service to the country by:
(1) Rehabilitating six electric power generating units.
(2) Improving the water treatment process at Old Harbor Power
Station.
(3) Constructing 25 miles of 69-kV transmission lines in order
to improve the standard of electricity service to the
eastern end of the island.
(4) Rebuilding 53 miles of selected 69-kV wood pole transmission
lines.
(5) Improving the distribution system by:
(5.1) Upgrading Primary Distribution Voltages of chosen
feeders to the 24-kV standard.
(5.2) Installation of capacitors to improve system power
factor.
(6) Trainlng, development and exposure of company staff in
technical and managerLal dLciplines beneficial to the
organlzation.
The overall goals were to:
(i) provlde capacity to meet the ever increasLng number of
customers and the increased demand in the commrcial,
industrial and resLdential sectorsl
(Li) improve efficiency of operationse and
(iLi) enhance the viability of the company.
The project at the governmental level could be seen as creating a
vehicle for developing a stable and efficient electricity supply company,



- 11 -
which would translate into a more productlve industrial sector by; (a)
Lnstilling mo.e confidence in the commercial areas# and (b) assi*ting in the
promotion of trade, manufacturing and tourism whlch are of major importance to
the country's foreign exchange earnings.
A review of the forecasts made ln the Least Cost Expansion Study
done by extornal consultants showed that the forecast was low as the average
growth rate of 2 6% assumed was surpassed in years subsequent to the study.
This is somewhat understandable as, at the tlme when the study was undertaken,
the economy waa in an unpredictable state experiencing minimal or no growth in
certain sectors.

- 13 -
(6) Training of JPSC's personnel in disciplines directly related
to the Electric Power Utility. This took the form of
participation in both overseas and local courses.
3 *    IfLUITATION
3.1   Stat Ug2
The project experienced start-up delays in part due to the loan
agreement with the World Bank which was signed in July 1982 becoming effective
February 28, 1983.
3.2    Revision
Changes of significance were made in the area of training and Phase
II of the proposed Energy Management System which was eventually omitted from
the program.
In March 1984, the Bank was provided with a revised training
program, which was accepted by the Bank.
3.3    Ipgleseptation sch-dul-
Many of the projects were complected on schedule, however, time
overruns were experienced on others.
3 4    Re2grtLag
The Bank was provided with progress reports on a quarterly basis.
These reports conformed to the format stipulated by the Bank.
In all, twelve quarterly reports were submitted.
3 5    Procuraemut
The procurement procedures adopted conformed to the guidelines as
stipulated by the Bank.
Materials for projects were obtained using international competitive
bidding, limited international bidding, local competitive bidding and direct
purchases.
The Bank was constantly given up-to-date information on method of
Purchase/Procurement being adopted and approval from the Bank was obtained on
all aspects of procurement for Material, Equipment and Consultancy Services.
For Consultancy Services, Technical and Financial proposals
submitted by firms were evaluated and selection made in consultation and
agreement with the Dank.



- 14 -
3.4    costs
At the time of preparation of thli Project Completion Report, a
comparison of overall estimated and actual costs revealed the followings
Overruns in the categories of Transmission, Distribution and General
Property.
However, the additional expenditures were funded from the
unallocated category and reduction in other categories. Other categories were
within reasonable levels of expenditure.
This indicates that in the areas of generation and substation,
disbursements did not exceed the amounts originally allocated.
3.7    Financial Sources
In summary, the company shows a shortfall in working capital for
the years 1983-85 inclusive and a significant improvement for the years 1986-
88.
In the 5-year period 1983-1987/88, the Company's gross internal
funding increased from J$89.1 million to J$267/8 million. Income before
interest charges moved from J$41.5 million to J$128.6 million. The
contribution from depreciation increased from J$47.8 million to JS165.8
million. Debt service requirements moved from J$94.3 million in 1983 to
J$120.6 million in 1987/88. Operating revenues rose from J$341.8 million to
J$907.6 million an increase of 165.5%, reflecting increases in rates, impact
of devaluation and some increases in sales. Revenues from base rates moved up
from JS173.8 million to J$393.2 million, an increase of 126.2%. Fuel Clause
revenues rose from J$166.9 million to J$512.2 million, an increase of 206.9%.
In that 5-year period annual electricity sales rose from 1,172.0 GWh in 1983
to 1,370.8 GWh in 1987/88, an increase of 16.96%. However, actual sales from
1986/87 were 1,542 GWh, which covered a 15-month period.
With rates of return in the 5-7% range the company recorded
significantly improved financial performance. Annual debt service coverage
was improved from 0.9 times in 1983 to 2.2 times in 1987/88. The debt equity
ratio ranged from 33/67 in 1983 to 39/61 in 1987/88. Customer accounts
receivable were reduced from 62.3 days to 46 days of revenue in 1987/88.
The forecasts at the time of loan appraisal were for revenues of
JS357.3 million in 1983 and J$450.4 million in 1985. Energy sales were
projected at 1,081 GWh for 1983 and 1,126 for 1985. Actual results were well
ahead of forecasts.
Operation and maintenance expenses increased from J$84.6 million in
1983 to J$184.9 million in 1987/88, a rise of 118.5%. Expenditure on fuel
rose from J$167.9 million in 1983 to JS427.7 million in 1987/88, an increase
of 154.7%, reflecting changes in oil prices and the impact of the devaluations
of the Jamaican Dollar.



- 15 -
Depreciatlon charges were JS47.8 million in 1983 and J$165.8 mlIlLon
in 1987/88, an increase of 246.8%, reflectLng additlons to plant in service
and revaluatlons of plant. Total operatLng expenses moved from JU303.3
million in 1983 to J$779 million in 1987/88, an increase of 159.4%.
Income before lnterest charges was J$41.5 million in 1983 and
J$128.6 million in 1987/88, an increase of 209.9%. Not interest charged to
operations increased from JS41.3 million in 1983 to J$72.2 million ln 1986/87
an increase of 74.8%. However, in 1987/88 not Lnterest charged to operations
declined to J$49.7 million, due maLnly to interest of J$25.8 million earned on
bank deposits.
In 1986/87 the Company had an ineome tax lLability for the first
time in several years.  Incom  tax liability of JS19.2 million was recorded in
1986/87 and J$26.4 million in 1987/88. The origlnal forecasts through to 1985
had not projected any income taxes.
3.8   P-rformance of Consultants, Contractors *sd  uoliers:
Consultants were *ngaged in areas where local expertise was not
available or was thought not to be adquately euipped to undertake specific
system development studies, project designs, to impl eme nt speciflc training or
effect changes to the organization's structure.
Consultancy services were obtained in the following specific areas$
System Expansion Study; Power Plant Rehabilitation, System Operations and
Maintenance; Generation Management Assistance and 3ngineering of the Annotto
Bay/Port Antonio 69-kv Steel Tower transmissicon line.
The services of the consultants were adequate to the needs of JPSC
and the performance was generally good with the exception of one firm whose
contract was terminated in December 1984.
The performance of contractors and suppliers throughout the project
was generally good.
4.0     OPDIZZ1Z P FlUC3
4.1     Performsance Indlcators
The key indicators of the Company's performance during 1983-87/88
have recorded improvements in almost all areas. To some extent these reflect
improvements in the nation's economy. However, in the main they are the
results of measures taken by the Company to reorganize its operatlons, control
costs, improve servlce to its customers and generally to achieve a tightly
controlled and more efficient company.
4.'2    ikstlPnetaiom
Electricity sales grew to 1,172 aWh ln 1983 but later decllned in
1984 and 1985 but rose in 1986/87 and were 1370.8 GWh in 1987/88, a net gain



- 16 -
of 16.96% for the 5-year period. Sales to residential customers rose by 7.78%
from 366 OWh to 394.5 GWh. Industrial and commercial customer sales moved up
by 15.4% from 671-OWh in 1983 to 774.6-GWh in 1987/88. Th- system peak demand
incroased from 254-MW in 1983 to 297.5-MW in 1988, a 5-year net increasc of
17.1%. Net generation increased from 1,459 GWh in 1983 to 1,702.9 GWh in
1987/88 a rime of 16.7%. The average number of customers increased from
247,000 in 1983 to 271,300 in 1987 a rise of 9.7 percent.
4.3     Ifficikng2
In the period under review the Company reorganized its commercial
and certain other operations. District offices were expanded and strengthened
and certain functions including billing, collections, customer contracts and
contacts were transferred from head office into the Districts.  Certain
services including disconnections and reconnections of customers were placed
with contractors. At the power stations certain maintenance and cleaning
functions were also placed with contractors. Electric Operations were re-
organized as were the arrangements for maintenance of company vehicles. In
th- process the Company rationalized and reduced staff.
In 1983, there were 1954 permanent employees; by the end of March
1988 the number of employees had been reduced to 1,604, a reduction of 17.9%.
The number of customers per employee was increased from 126.4 in 1983 to 169
in 1987/88, a 33.7% improvement.  Electricity sales per employee also moved up
by 50% from 0.6 GWh to 0.9 GWh in 1987/88.  The average heat rate on the
system war improved from 14,028/BTU/kWh in 1983 to 11,946/BTU/kWh in 1987/88.
The improvement of 14.9% in the heat rate was achieved through the power plant
rehabilitation program and the addition of the 40 MW slow speed barge-mounted
diesel plant at Rockfort. In the area of system losses, the position was
unchanged at the start and at the end of the period, 19.5% losses; although in
the intervening years there war minor improvement.
4.4     Overall Assessment
A direct result of the power plant rehabilitation was greater
availability of the company's generating plants. The Hunts Bay Steam Station
moved from 78.9% to 86% availability in 1987/88. The Old Harbor Steam Plants
moved from 30.4% in 1983 to an availability of 83% in 1987/88, the best in the
history of the station. Gas turbines also showed improvement from 70.7% in
1983 to 87% availability in 1987/88.
5 0     FINAN-1hL  EURPORSE
In the five-year period 1983-1987/88 the operating and financial
performance of Jamaica Public Service Company improved significantly. At the
start of the 1980's the Company suffered frequent power outages due to poor
plant maintenance and shortage of foreign exchange. A comprehensive power
plant rehabilitation program which was com nnced in 1981 and continued through
1985 restored plant reliability. By the end of the program 11 generating
units, steam, gas turbines and hydro-electric plants representing 345 MW had
been restored. The rehabilitation program resulted in significant
improvements in the reliability of service to customers in the efficiency of



- 17 -
the Company' system. Reserve plant capacity was also restored. The power
plant rehabliltatlon program was carrlod out at a cost of J$128.9 milllon.
In the four years prLor to 1983, the Company wam not coverlng its
costs and locecs for 1979-82 amounted to over J$100 million.  A slgnificant
part of the looses was due to the Company's lnabillty to recover its
expendltures on fuel through lt. fuel clause. In March 1983 the effleLoncy
factor in the fuel clause was changed from 13,500 8TU/kWh to 16,500 BTU/kWh
and the company for that year recorded a break-even pocltlon, showlng a proflt
of J$140,000 compared wlth a loss of J$39.46 mllion ln 1982.
In the period under revlew, there were sharp devaluation of the
Jamalcan Dollar which moved from an exchange rate of J$1.788125 * US$1.00 on
January 1, 1983 to JS5.50 - US$1.00 on November 15, 1985. On January 10, 1983
a dual (parallel market) exchange rate was Lntroduced through the Bank of
Jamalca. By June 27, 1983 the rate had doclined to J$2.72 and had reached
J$2.96 -US$1.00 ln November 1983. On 24th November 1983 the Jamalcan Dollar
was devalued to JS3.15 - US$1.00. At December 31, 1983 the exchange rate was
JS3.30 - US$1.00. By the end of 1984 the exchange rate had docllned to J$4.95
- US$1.00. Further deterioration continued. The exchange rate peaked at
J$6.40 - US$1.00 in October 1985 but stabllized at J$5.50 - US$1.00 ln
November 1985 and has remaLned at that level.
As a result of the sharp decllnes ln the exchange rate and
consequent rising costs, the Company was granted two lncreases in electrLcLty
rates - 40% ln January 1984 and 54% offectlve May 1, 1984. At the time of the
January 1?84 rate increase the fuel clause efficiency factor was changed from
16,500 BTU/kWh to 14,800 BTU/kWh, and the cout of service adjustment of 1% per
month which had been a feature of the electricity tariffs for several years
was removed. The rates which came into effect on May 1, 1984 are still in
force.
However, effective May 1986 a change was made in the Company's fuel
clause to allow a two-tier level of fuel cost recovery. The fuel clause
adjustment applicable to electricity supplied to Residential (Rate 10)
customers li based on the current cost of fuel. In March 1988 the adjustment
was 22.3 cents (Jamaica) per kilowatt/hour. In regard to commerclal,
industrial and other customers (includlng Government entLtiLe) the fuel
adjustment ls based on the cost of fuel ln October 1985. The fuel clause
adjustment for those customers has been fixed at 40.83 cents (Jamalcan) per
kilowatt/hour. The addltional charge. by the Company made to commercial,
industrial and other customers over and above the cost of fuel and reasonable
provisions for bad debt, are paid over by the Company to Government, and used
to subridy the cost of som bamic food items. The Company's basic electricity
tariffs provide for very minor fuel cost recovery, 0.41 cents per
kllowatt/hour. The balance of the fuel clause are recovered through the fuel
clause, whlch account for more than one-half of the Company's revenues.
Set out below are comments on the historical financial performance
of the Company: income and expense, balance sheots, source and application of
funds and performance indicators. In 1986 the Company decided to change its
financial year-end from December 31 to March 31 in order to fit in with



- 18 -
Governmnat's financial year. Accordingly, the pOrLod covered in this review
is January 1, 1983 to March 31, 1988.
5.1      r _l         u
During 1983-1987/88 the Company' operating revenues rose from
J5341.8 million to JS907.6 mllion, an Lncrease of 165.5%, roflecting
increases La rates, impact of devaluatlon and some increases in sales.
Revenues from bass rates moved up from. J173.8 mllion to JS393.2 million, an
increase of 126.2t.  Fuel clause revenues rose from JS166.9 million to JS512.2
million, an Lncrease of 206.9%. in that 5-year period annual electrlcity
sales rose from 1172.0 GWh ln 1983 to 1370.8 OWh in 1987/88, an increase of
16.96%. However, actual sales for 1986/87 woro 1,542 GNh, which covered a 15-
month period.
The forecasts at the time of loan appraisal were for revenues of
JS357.3 milllon in 1983 and JS450.4 million ln 1985.  Energy sales were
projected at 1,071 Glh tor 1983 and 1,126 for 1985. Actual results were well
ahead of forecasts.
Operation and maintenance expenses Lncreased from JS84.6 million
in 1983 to J5184.9 million in 1987/88, a rise of 118.5%. Zxpenditure on fuel
rose from J$167.9 million in 1983 to JS427.7 million in 1981/88, an increase
of 154.7%, reflecting changes in oil prices and the impact of the devaluations
of the Jamaican Dollar.
Depreciation charges were JS47.8 million in 1983 and JS1165.8
million in 1987/88, an increase of 246.8%, reflecting additlons to plant
service and revaluations of plant. Total operating expenses moved from
J.300.3 mllion in 1983 to JS779 million in 1987/88, an increase of 159.4%.
Incom  before interest charges was JS41.5 million in 1983 and
JS128.6 mllion in 1987/88, an increase of 209.9%. Net interest charged to
operations increased from JS41.3 million in 1983 to JS72.2 million ln 1986/87
an increase of 74.8%. However, in 1987/88 net interest charged to operations
declined to JS49.7 million, due mainly to Lnterest of JS25.8 million earned on
bank deposits.
in 1986/87 the Company had an inome tax liabLilty for the fLrst
time in several years. Incom tax liability of JS19.2 million was recorded in
1986/87 and JS26.4 mllion in 1987/88. The original forecasts through to 1985
had not projected any Lncome taxes.
5.2      alance Sheets 1983 - 1987188
In the 5-year period gross plant in service rose from JS1,909.5
mllion ln 1983 to J$4,581.2 million in 1987/88. Not plant in service moved
up from JS929.5 million to J$2,050.4 million. Accumulated depreciation
increasd from JS980 million in 1983 to JS2,530.8 million in 1987/88.  Net

current assets improved significantly durlng the 5-year perLod from
J$129.5 mllion ln 1983 to J$427.7 mLilLon ln 1987/88. Customer accounts
receLvable of J$84.3 mllion represented the maln component ln 1983 and were
J$151.3 million ln 1987/88. Cash and bank deposLts rose from J$2.6 mllion ln
1983 to J$198.5 mllion ln 1987/88. InventorLes rose from J$37.9 milllon to
J$70.2 milllon.
In the same perlod current llabilltles moved up from J$147.6 mllion
to J$207.4 milllon. Accounts payable remained the main component moving from
J$69.6 mllion to J$146.5 million ln 1985 and declinlng to J$130.2 mllion ln
1987/88. Demand loans and overdrafts whlch stood at J$32.8 milllon ln 1983
were ellminated by 1986/87 but were J$11.7 million ln 1987/88. Interest
payable, mainly on overseas loans, Lncreased from J$45.2 mllion ln 1983 to
J$96.7 million ln 1986/87 but declined to J$57 million in 1987/88. in 1983
current liabilLtles oxceeded current assets but that situation was reversed ln
1984 and since then the posLtLon has contlnued to lmprove.
The Company's equity recorded signlflcant increase movlng from
J$657.3 million ln 1983 to J$1,381.2 million ln 1987/68. PaLd-up share
capital was increased from J$100.9 milllon to JS168.4 milllon. Retalned
earnLngs rose from J$30 milllon ln 1983 to J$380.3 mllion ln 1987/88.
Capital reserves, derlved from revaluation of flxed assets, were Lncreased
from J$526.4 milllon (1983) to J$832.5 million (1987/88). Capltal reserves,
derLved from revaluatlon of flxed assets, were increased from J$526.4 milllon
(1983) to J$832.5 million (1987/88). Through a program of applicatlon of its
pollcies regarding customer deposLts, the Company lncreased thli source of
fundlng from J$15 mllion ln 1983 to JS46.6 mllion ln 1987/88.
Long-term debt whlch stood at J$336.2 million in 1983 had increased
to J$941.2 milllon in 1987/88. A slgnlficant part of the lncrease wcs due to
the impact of devaluatlons of the Jamalcan Dollar durlng the years 1983 to
1985.
During the porlod under review the Company achlived a much stronger
financial posLtion. The cash posLtLon was considerably better, receivables as
a percentage of revenues were much lower, the current assets ratlo was hlgh,
the pald-up equity had been increased and retaLned earnlngs were up by J$350
milllon.

over the perlod major changes have taken place in the Distrlcts
DivisLon and the Dlvision of System and Support Services was establlihed.
A major Management Audit was undertaken by a local firm and
resultLng from the exercise was a standardlzatLon and reclassificatlon of
Management grades. The internal reorganLzation of existLng departments along
with re-establilhing some departments were conducted to establish the DLvLiLon
of Systems and Support Servlces.
The management structure of the dLitrLcts was strengthened with the
establiahment of posLtLon of Operations Managers/SuperLntendents and
Commerclal Managers/Superirt-ndents. Also the posltlons of District Engineer
and later Maintenance Engineer were establlshed.
The structure was further strengthened wlth the establishment of two
Reglonal Managers in the District Dlvllson. These posLtLons became part of
the Senlor Management team.
The Systems and Support Servlces also experlenced changes ln lts
organizatLon structure with the most significant belng the re-establlshment of
the Transport Admlnlitratlon Group whlch was set up to deal wlth the
malntenance of the Speclalized VehLcles supplied under the project and
admLnLstration of the transport system for company's vehicles on a general
basLs.
The data center has also been expanded and li at present providlng
good support servlce to the commerclal aspects of the Company's operatLon.
A Management Informatlon and Inventory Control System has also been
established, lt li lntended that this wlll provlde the vehicle for the
computerizatlon of the stores functlons company-wide and to provider more up-

economically viablo and have provided a moral booster for the over 1600
employees.
6.2     Growth
Over th3 period, the Jamaica Public Service Company has experienced
a reduction in its number of employees. It has also experienced an increase
in the number of customeru, hence its Customer to employee ratio has moved
from 126.4 in 1983 to 158.7 in 1987.
With the decentralization of the District Operations, there has been
the establishment of other district and collections offices at strategic
locations across the island.
Electricity consumption has also increased over the period, both in
terms of energy usage and peak demand.
Annex 9.3.4 shows the following relationship, i.e. (standard
efficiency indicators), over the period 1983-1987/88.
(1) Number of employees/customers
(2) Sales GWh/employee
6.3     Staff Recruitment. Trainina and Dev-lopnent
over the period there was the continued high turnover of staff
aspecially in the Engineering and Technical Management area. This could be
attributed to uncompetitive salaries as the open market value of suitably
qualified professional personnel could not be matched by the company. This
was further affected by national wage guidelines.
Experienced personnel left critical positions for more lucrative
jobs within and outside of the sector. Migration to first world countries was
also a contributory factor.
This problem has been recognized and an attempt at addressing it was
made by adjusting the salaries of management personnel. It is at present too
early to assess if this action will alleviate the rapid loss of personnel in
this category or increase our capability of attracting the high calibre
personnel required for our continued growth and development.
On the other hand, the Company maintained a dynamic training program
and an ongoing reorganization of its structure, which provided motivation to
maintain the dedicated core of employees. This was necessary to enhance the
continued growth and development of the Company to meet the ever increasing
demand for a reliable supply of electricity to the customers. For example,
vacancies at the supervisory and lower levels were filled through promotions
and new employment.



- 22 -
The Company continues to maintain a vibrant training program both
in-house, external and overseas. Under the Third Power Project, employeso
were trained in different courses.
The average turnover of personnel during the period was estimated at
five percent (5%). This ranks as a reoaonable average for an organization of
this type.
7.0     ECOOMIC R-VaLUATION
In our economic and technical evaluation of the projects under Loan
2188-JAM each project has various levels of economic viability and hence each
project was justified on its own merit.
At Project Completion time, the project showing the most attractive
savings is the Installation of the Reverse Osmosis System at Old Harbor Power
Station.
The economic evaluation of the other projects at this time is
limited mostly to comparison of expected input cost and actual project cost.
The benefits to be derived from the investment are of a long term nature and
hence will best be reflected in an improvement in the operating parameters of
the sector. The projects undertaken, being only a part of a large investment
program cannot be singled out for specific economic viability as the detailed
level of monitoring necessary to extract this information is not at present in
place.
Over the period the system heat rate has moved from 14,028 BTU/KWh
to 11,946 reflecting quite an improvement in generating efficiency. System
Power Factor has also moved from 0.87 to 0.95 over the period indicating the
contribution achieved in loss reduction from the installation of capacitors.
These immediate upward trends are indicative that the Third Power
Project stands to gain its expected economic benefits over the economic life.
8.0     CONCLU8 W
The 1BRD Third Power Project loan was utilized to fund major
projects which were vital to tha improvement and upgrading of the Electric
Utility System in Jamaica.
Prior to the implementation of the Project, the generation system
reflected one of low reliability plagued by multiple loss of units and of more
significance, the inability to generate at name plate rating as a result of
plant defects.
The transmission system was at a stage where there was a need to
establish vital links in order to optimize the economic flow of power and
electrical energy to the load centers across the island, and associated
substation expansion was necessary.



- 23 -
BDand on an inventory of our installed distribution plant and as a
result of economic and technical evaluation, the voltage standardization
showed potential for trcmndous savings.
With the advont of improved technology in the power industry and the
installation of state of the art equipment, the component of Training and
Consultancy was invaluable to the dovelopment and exposure of local personnel
in the technical, operational and management categories.
A re-evaluation of the system at Project Completion time, has shown
that there is considerable improvement in the Electric Power Sector.
The generating system has become more reliable and the transmission
system is better equipped to transport power to the load centers.
The savings affected from installation of the Reverse Osmosis plant
is in fact better than was proposed.
The Voltag- Standardization Program has not realized the success
that was planned in teems of numb-r of circuit miles to be upgraded but there
have been definite benefits dorived from the program.
The system power factor has improved from 0.87 to 0.95 over the
period hence justifying the installation of capacitors on the primary
distribution system.
Over the period, the company has managed to move from a position of
loss to one of realizing a profit and has achieved a reasonable rate of
return.
Overall, the projects undertaken for utilizatlon of the loan have
proven to be of economic benefit, the loan itself was adequately administered
and utilized.
The Jamaica Public Service Company is in a much improved position in
1988 compared to 1983 when the loan was negotiated.
3)     0    OlUIENTS O         P0ERONUC  FROM JPS PRSPECVE
JPS staff is in general agreement with the view expressed by Bank
staff that, for the most part, the principal objectives of the project were
achieved.
We also concur with the view that the most important exception to
the above was that the objective of reducing system losses wras not met. The
report, however, stops short of attempting to identify the reasons for the
failure to meet this objective.
In this respct we would wish to see the report contain some
analysis which attempted to Ldentify the reasons for the failure to
significantly reduce the levels of losses. We are presontly grappling with



- 24 -
thli problm and have met with only limited success so far. Although Power IV
has been under implementation for about two years and approximately 44% of the
projected project expenditures dLibureed, losses still remain at a high level
of approximately 19% of net generation.
It is our vliw that both ourselves and the Bank should have paid
more attention to the monitoring of loss targets during supervisLon so as to
provide an early warning that the targets would not have been achieved. It
may have been useful for the project design to have incorporated features
which would have provided a more direct focus on loss reduction and for more
effectlve monitoring of loss targets during project implementation.
We are pleased to note that many of these deficiencies have been
corrected in the Power IV project as the monitoring of such targets as the
rate at which power factor correction capacitors are installed, and the system
power factor itself, are likely to improve the focus on loss reductlon.
It may have been useful, however, to have gone a bit further and
included a study component in Power IV, which would have sampled losses on
representative feeders throughout the implementation period so that the
efficiency measures contemplated could be more responsive to changing
situations. It is conceivable that system extensions could make measures
which were origlnally shown to be cost effective, uneconomic by the time
implementation of the component wae completed. WLthout a programe of on-going
assessment, it will be difficult to estimate how effective each loss reduction
measure has been or even what level of improvement has been attributable to
which element of the package of measures.
Prolect Supervision
JPS staff considers that the number and timing of Bank supervision
visits were adequate in the financial area but it was felt that in the
technical areas it would have been useful to increase the frequency of
superviLson visLts to about three year each year, particularly in the early
years of implementation. This would have assisted in resolving procurement
issues in a more timely manner at a time when staff would have been relatively
unfamiliar with the Bank procedures.

B. Economic Impact
Appraisal          Estimated
Estimete             Actual
Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR):       230                13%
1.        The SAR estimate was based on JPS's 1982-85 investment program as
the benefits of the project could not readily be isolated from those of the
investment program.  The program was assumed to yield benefits over a 20 year
period.
2.        In recalculating the IERR, a similar methodology has been used to
that in the SAR. Because of the longer period needed to implement the
program, the rate of return has been calculated for the 1982-88 poriod.
3.        Costs and benefits were recalculated using 1983 prices.
4.        Costs consisted of incremental inventment costs, as well as
incremental fuel and operations and maintenance costs.
5.        The benefits of the program includedt  (a) incremental sales over
the 1981 level. Sales above this level could not have been achieved without
ongoing and now program investments (b) improvements in generating plant
efficiency exprsseed in reduced fuel costs and calculated at the 1981 sales
level to avoid double counting these benefits (c) loss reduction benefits
where benefits from the reduction of outages and the associated losses in
industrial output have not been included in the IERR calculation. The latter
benefits were significantly lower than the SAR estimate.
6.        Comments on the IERR are given in para. 6.6 of Part I.

C. Financial Impact
1.        JPS's actual financial performance is compared to the SAR forecast
from 1982 to 1985, the last year of the SAR forecast, in Annex 1.
The Annex also gives actual figures for FY87 (a fifteen month period
to march 31) and FY88.
2.        Comments on JPS's financial performance are given in para. 6.04 of
Part 1.
