The proposed loan would primarily finance the\n            foreign exchange cost of JPS' 11982-84 investment\n            program, excluding ongoing works and interest during\n            construction. The program includes: the rehabilitation of\n            thermal generating capacity; construction of about 25 miles\n            of 69 kV transmission line with expansion of distribution\n            equipment; improvement of systems control and data\n            acquisition equipment; vehicles for operation and\n            maintenance of the project; and technical assistance and\n            training to strengthen top and middle management and enable\n            staff to operate and maintain the system effectively."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
