Nigeria, Second Health\n            Systems Development Project (HSDP II). The Bank has been\n            supporting the thirty-six states of the Nigerian Federation\n            through the HSDP II in improving the maternal and child\n            health (MCH) status in Nigeria, which is amongst the poorest\n            in Sub Saharan Africa. The additional credit will help\n            finance the costs that accrued after the project was\n            restructured in 2005 and implementation was accelerated and\n            effectively scaled up. Of the total proposed supplement is\n            allocated to 22 States and the Federal Ministry of Health,\n            that were selected based on their performance to date, and\n            will support the completion of original project activities\n            that had already been approved in work plans for the\n            improved delivery of primary health care services. The 22\n            states expected to participate in the first instance are:\n            Akwa Ibom, Abia, Anambra, Bauchi, Benue, Borno, Ekiti,\n            Enugu, Gombe, Imo, Jigawa, Kebbi, Kogi, Kano, Kwara,\n            Nasarawa, Ondo, Osun, Plateau, Sokoto Taraba and the FCT.\n            The additional credit will specifically support four sets of\n            activities within the broader context of strengthening\n            primary health care services, namely: (a) rehabilitation and\n            refurbishment of schools of health technology and schools of\n            nursing and midwifery, with the twin objectives of\n            augmenting the numbers of qualified health care personnel\n            and of having these schools secure relevant accreditation;\n            (b) support services, including the refurbishment and\n            equipping of primary health facilities at the community\n            level, training of health service workers, procurement of\n            drugs and other medical supplies; (c) immunization\n            activities, such as the procurement and repair of the cold\n            chain equipment and training of vaccinators; and (d)\n            strengthening of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems\n            and processes at both the State and Federal levels."}, "docdt": "2008-09-08T00:00:00Z"}
