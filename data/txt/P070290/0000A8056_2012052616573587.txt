                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overriding goal of this project is to assist the Nigerian Health authorities in their efforts to redress the serious deterioration in the delivery of basic health care
                         services following decades of neglect and build institutional capacities, paving the way for a more sustained development of the Nigerian health care system. More
                         specifically, the project would: (i) strengthen capacities for system management at the state level and encourage an environment of broad based consultation; (ii)
                         support improvements in the delivery of primary health care services with a particular focus on maternal and child health and reproductive health services; and (iii)
                         assist the Federal Government to strengthen its policy formulation and further develop a system to monitor the health sector performance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is approaching its Closing Date of May 30, 2012. Both the Original Credit and the Additional Financing are fully disbursed. Most states fully disbursed their allocations
                         (with some over disbursing their allocations) but a few states were not able to access their full allocations due to (i) XDR to US Dollar exchange rate reducing the amount of dollars
                         available under the Credit and (ii) the over-disbursement by some states. All states will have to ensure that Government Counterpart Funds are made available to pay all contractors
                         and suppliers that have provided services under the project and have outstanding payments. All States and Federal have commenced documentation of the advances to their
                         Designated Account with 21 states already fully documented.

                         There are some best practices supported by the project in some states such as the Abiye Program in Ondo which has improved access to and quality of maternal and child care
                         services. In one LGA in Kwara state, a health care facility renovated by the project contracted a private medical practitioner from the community under an agreement to run the
                         facility. In addition to providing a high level of care, the practitioner formed a micro community health insurance scheme which provides access to about 1500 enrollees. Jigawa State
                         simultaneously integrated and decentralized its primary and secondary health systems into 9 ‘Gundumas’ that oversees 3 LGAs each. The pooling of human resources and funds has
                         impacted significantly on the previously moribund PHC system in the state. In Ekiti state, the project supported the establishment of a Health Data Bank to strengthen the collation,
                         transmission and storage of health service data; to improve the analysis of data; and facilitate the production of timely health management information for policy formulation and
                         evidence-based decision making.

                         While there are examples of best case practice under the project, this is not reflected on nationwide when the data from all states is taken into consideration. All states (with the help
                         of M&E Consultants contracted under the Credit) prepared their results framework. Data reported by two states were very poorly done and were not included in the data aggregated
                         at the national level. Data was also not complete in most states making it challenging to assess the national impact of the project. Results in terms of project performance varies from
                         state to state but in general some progress has been made by the project in improving service delivery to women and children in health facilities supported by the project,
                         strengthening policy formulation, supporting a system to monitor the health sector performance through the joint annual review process and significantly increased in the accreditation
                         of health training institutes in the country. The project supported 321 health facilities nationwide (less than 2% of all facilities) and this modest and dispersed investments make impact
                         marginal when compared to the needs of the entire health system. It is therefore not surprising that the progress reported in project facilities has not been matched by national
                         surveys which have either shown no improvement or very little progress from 2003 to 2010. The data review also highlighted significant data quality issues and challenges of the
                         Health Management Information System (HMIS) which the project has not been able to address. HMIS has remained very weak at the LGA, state & federal levels, making it difficult to
                         access comprehensive information on health services, utilization and outcomes data in any one place.
