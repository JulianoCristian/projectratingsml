withdrawals  shall  be made  in accordance with the provisions of Annex B to this 
Schedule 1. 
3. 
Payments out of each Special Account shall be made exclusively for Eligible 
Expenditures.  For each payment made by the Borrower out of a Special Account, the

notify the Borrower of its determination.

-
6. 
(a) 
If the Association determines at any time that any payment out of any 
Special Account was made for an expenditure which is not an Eligible Expenditure, or 
was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Association, the Borrower shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Association, provide such additional evidence as the 
Association may request, or deposit into said Special Account (or, if the Association shall 
so request, refund to the Association) an amount equal to the amount of such payment.  
Unless the Association shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Association into 
any Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or 
made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 
(b) 
If the Association determines at any time that any amount outstanding in 
any Special Account will not be required to cover payments for Eligible Expenditures 
during the six-month period following such determination, the Borrower shall, promptly 
upon notice from the Association, refund to the Association such outstanding amount.

For the purposes of this Annex: 
(a) 
the term “Authorized Allocation” means:   
 
(i)

to $550,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and 
deposited into said Special Account pursuant to paragraph 2 of 
this Annex; 
(ii) 
in respect of the State Special Account, an amount equivalent to 
$18,100,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and 
deposited into said Special Account pursuant to paragraph 2 of 
this Annex. 
(b) 
Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) (ii) of this paragraph, the Authorized 
Allocation for the State Special Account shall be based on the number of Participating 
States and shall be reduced by any amount allocated to the Special Account of a 
Participating State opened under subparagraph (ii) above.   
2. 
Withdrawals of a Special Account’s Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish said Special Account shall be made as follows: 
(a) 
For withdrawals of said Special Account’s Authorized Allocation, the 
Borrower shall cause the Association to be furnished a request or requests for deposit into 
said Special Account of an amount or amounts which in the aggregate do not exceed said 
Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of each such request, the Association shall, on 
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit into said Special 
Account such amount as the Borrower shall have requested. 
(b) 
For replenishment of said Special Accounts, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Association requests for deposit into said Special Accounts at such intervals as the 
Association shall specify.  Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
cause the Association to be furnished the documents and other evidence required 
pursuant to Part B.3 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement for the payment or payments in 
respect of which replenishment is requested.  On the basis of each such request, the 
Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and

deposit into said Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have requested and 
as shall have been shown by said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of 
said Special Account for Eligible Expenditures.  Each such deposit into said Special 
Account shall be withdrawn by the Association from the Credit Account under one or 
more of said Special Account’s Eligible Categories. 
3. 
The Association shall not be required to make further deposits into a Special 
Account, once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Credit allocated to said Special 
Account’s Eligible Categories minus the total amount of all outstanding special 
commitments entered into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions in respect of expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit 
allocated to said Categories, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of said 
Special Account’s Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit 
Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Credit allocated to said Categories 
shall follow such procedures as the Association shall specify by notice to the Borrower.
 
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Association 
shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in said Special 
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible 
Expenditures.
