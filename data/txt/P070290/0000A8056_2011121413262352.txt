                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overriding goal of this project is to assist the Nigerian Health authorities in their efforts to redress the serious deterioration in the delivery of basic health
                         care services following decades of neglect and build institutional capacities, paving the way for a more sustained development of the Nigerian health care
                         system. More specifically, the project would: (i) strengthen capacities for system management at the state level and encourage an environment of broad based
                         consultation; (ii) support improvements in the delivery of primary health care services with a particular focus on maternal and child health and reproductive
                         health services; and (iii) assist the Federal Government to strengthen its policy formulation and further develop a system to monitor the health sector
                         performance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         An annual review meeting was held in September with participation from 27 of the 29 Additional Financing states and the Federal Ministries of Health and Finance (FMOH and
                         FMOF) to review the progress made on plans during the year; review the project financial status for each stateincluding the need to request allocation of the unallocated project funds
                         against disbursement categories, prepare and plan for the process of evaluating the project achievements as the project closing date approaches, reinforce the need to initiate project
                         account closing processes and discuss policy issues and agree on next steps. This meeting also provided a platform for the cross fertilization of ideas where states learn from their
                         various experiences.

                         The project is disbursing well with US$ 83.4 million- 92.5% already disbursed. 9 states, namely: Adamawa, Ebonyi, Edo, Gombe, Kogi, Nasarawa, Ogun, Ondo and Zamfara have
                         fully disbursed their allocations (some over-committed their allocations which means they will have to use their government funds to pay for these commitments). Another 10 states
                         are almost fully disbursed with less than US $500,000 of their allocations remaining. Four States have fully documented the advances to their Designated Account with another 4
                         having initiated the process.

                         During the Review Meeting, the government and the Bank reached an agreement on steps to take for each state and FMOH to document the project indicators to feed into a national
                         evaluation report including the project results framework ahead of the project closing date. States have commenced efforts to collect data at facility level and through the existing
                         health management information system (HMIS) as well as the contracting of M&E consultants to assist with data analysis and state reports to feed into the national report. At the
                         federal level, part of the Borno State project allocation canceled by the FMOF has been reallocated to the FMOH to carry out health facility surveys required to obtain data for
                         documenting project achievements. The FMOH is finalizing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Federal Bureau of Statistics to implement the facility survey on behalf of the
                         Federal Government.
