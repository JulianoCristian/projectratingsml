                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overriding goal of this project is to assist the Nigerian Health authorities in their efforts to redress the serious deterioration in the delivery of basic health
                         care services following decades of neglect and build institutional capacities, paving the way for a more sustained development of the Nigerian health care
                         system. More specifically, the project would: (i) strengthen capacities for system management at the state level and encourage an environment of broad based
                         consultation; (ii) support improvements in the delivery of primary health care services with a particular focus on maternal and child health and reproductive
                         health services; and (iii) assist the Federal Government to strengthen its policy formulation and further develop a system to monitor the health sector
                         performance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         An annual review meeting was held in December with all 29 states and the Federal Ministries of Health and Finance (FMOH and FMOF) to review the progress made on plans
                         during the year and highlight operational challenges; prepare work and procurement plans for the forthcoming year to be reviewed and cleared and discuss policy issues and agree
                         on next steps. This meeting also provides a platform for the cross fertilization of ideas where states can learn from each other.
                         The project is disbursing well with US$ 63 million- 72.6% already disbursed. 7 states, namely: Adamawa, Kwara, Ebonyi, Gombe, Nasarawa, Plateau and Ondo have no funds left
                         and Adamawa, Kwara and Ebonyi have over committed their allocations which means they will have to use more of their own funds and commitments these three states have
                         entered into would be paid from government funds. By September 2011, it is expected that more states would have exhausted their funds as currently, 12 states have less than US$
                         1 million left.
                         The government and the Bank have reached an agreement on how to strengthen monitoring and evaluation that will be implemented during the remaining life of the project.
                         The Borno State project allocation has been canceled by the FMOF as it had yet to become effective. These funds will be reallocated to the FMOH to carry out various surveys
                         required to obtain data to support the documenting of project achievements. The Bank is concerned that despite agreeing to the need for a reallocation, an official letter for this is
                         yet to be received from the FMOF.
