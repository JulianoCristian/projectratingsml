authorities in\n            redressing the deteriorated delivery of basic health care\n            services, and, to build institutional capacities that would\n            pave the way for a sustained development of the\n            country's health care system. Through its components,\n            the project will: 1) support all states in strengthening the\n            capacity of the State Ministry of Health in the areas of\n            planning, financial management, and monitoring and\n            evaluation, while a limited support will be provided to\n            improve the technical skills of trainers, and key health\n            providers. Support activities will cover managerial\n            processes and skills; technical skill development; improved\n            health management information systems, and, access to\n            information and communication technology, in addition to\n            research and studies; 2) finance, and support activities\n            that improve the delivery of primary health care services,\n            emphasizing on strengthening immunization services, safe\n            motherhood interventions, and communicable disease control\n            (both endemic and epidemic diseases). Access to health care\n            will be improved, as will the availability of essential, and\n            generic drugs in health facilities, in addition to quality\n            of training in nursing, mid-wife services, and health\n            technology schools; and, 3) support capacity building, and\n            strengthening of public health functions, and processes at\n            the Federal Ministry of Health, and, coordinate, monitor and\n            evaluate the implementation of the project. Support for the\n            formulation of health policy, and strategies, the health\n            reform process, and for strengthened management information\n            systems will be financed."}, "docdt": "2002-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
