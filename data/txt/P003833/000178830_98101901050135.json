be to\n            increase access to nonformal education, improve the quality\n            of nonformal education programs, and strengthen the\n            management capability of the Ministry of Education's\n            Directorate of Community Education (Dikmas). To achieve\n            these objectives, the project would: (a) expand learning\n            programs in basic education and employment-oriented\n            training; (b) improve the quality of educational programs by\n            developing relevant learning materials and providing staff\n            training. Furthermore, it would; (c) improve program\n            implementation by introducing better planning, monitoring\n            and evaluation systems and an applied research program at\n            Dikmas. The project would benefit about 800,000 Indonesian\n            illiterates and school dropouts in 17 provinces by providing\n            basic education and employment-oriented skill training."}, "docdt": "1983-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
