in a single\n            tranche. This project (the fourth in a series), is designed\n            to consolidate Sierra Leone's transition from\n            peace-keeping and relief aid, to equitable and sustainable\n            development, in the context of Sierra Leone's Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy. The ERRG4 will provide critical\n            resources to consolidate and deepen the agenda set by the\n            ERRC series, including progress made in governance,\n            decentralization of government, management of public\n            resources, human resource development, and private\n            sector-led economic growth. The grant will contribute to\n            economic recovery and growth, by providing foreign exchange\n            resources for the imports of essential commodities, by\n            providing financial resources to the Government budget, to\n            finance priority public expenditures, and by supporting\n            reforms to attract private investment. In helping to close\n            the financing gap in 2005, it will also contribute to\n            maintaining macroeconomic stability, and low inflation.\n            However risks include delayed or inadequate public services\n            that could exacerbate poverty, and possibly lead to social\n            unrest; the budget is heavily dependent upon external\n            assistance; macroeconomic stability could prove difficult to\n            maintain; and, weak institutional capacity could cause\n            delays in implementing the program; and, conflict in\n            neighboring Cote d'Ivoire may affect trade, or spill\n            over into Sierra Leone, while slow or incomplete disarmament\n            in Liberia could create tensions between Guinea and Sierra\n            Leone, which could spark a new war."}, "docdt": "2005-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
