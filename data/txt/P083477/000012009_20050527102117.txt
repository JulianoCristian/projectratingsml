                                      Grant and Program Summary

Borrower:                    Government o f Sierra Leone

ImplementingAgency:          MinistryofFinance

Amount:                      SDR 10 million (US15 millionequivalent)

Terms:                       IDA Grant


Tranching:                   One tranche, to be disbursedupon effectiveness.

Description:                 The proposed Fourth Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Grant (ERRG
                             IV)will provide quick disbursing support to the Government's 2005 budget
                             ina single tranche. The operationis designed to consolidate Sierra Leone's
                             transition from peace-keeping and reliefto equitable and sustainable
                             development inthe context o f Sierra Leone's Poverty ReductionStrategy.
                             It is the fourth ina series, following the ThirdEconomic Rehabilitation and
                             Recovery Credit. The grant complements similar support providedby the
                             AfDB, DFID,EC and the IMF.

Benefits:                    ERRGIV will provide critical resources to consolidate and deepen the
                             agenda set by the ERRC series including progress made ingovernance,
                             decentralization o f government, management o f public resources, human
                             resource development and private sector-led economic growth. The grant
                             will contribute to economic recovery and growth by providing foreign
                             exchange resources for imports o f essential commodities, by providing
                             financial resources to the Government budget to finance priority public
                             expenditures andby supporting reforms to attract private investment. By
                             helping to close the financing gap in2005, it will also contribute to
                             maintaining macroeconomic stability and low inflation.

Risks:                       Delayed or inadequate public services could exacerbate poverty and
                             possibly lead to social unrest. The budget i s heavily dependent upon
                             external assistance. Macroeconomic stability could prove difficult to
                             maintain either due to failure to maintain fiscal discipline or a shortfall in
                             donor funding. Weak institutional capacity could cause delays in
                             implementing the program or the broader Poverty Reduction Strategy.
                             Conflict inneighboring Cote d'Ivoire may affect trade or spill over into
                             Sierra Leone, slow or incomplete disarmament inLiberia could create
                             problems or tensions between Guinea and Sierra Leone could spark a new
                             war.

                                         I. INTRODUCTION

1.       This program document presents a proposed development policygrant to the Republic of
Sierra Leone for SDR 10 million (US$15 million equivalent) to finance the fourth in a series o f
Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery operations. The grant will provide quick-disbursing
budget support for the 2005 budget in one tranche and will cover policies to be implementedin
the period June 2005 through June 2006.                It is designed to help the Government make the
transition fiom post-conflict recovery to sustainable development inthe context o f Sierra Leone's
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). This would be achieved by promoting i)increased capacity
for good govemance, ii)human resource development and iii)economic growth led by the
private sector.

                                   11.       COUNTRY CONTEXT

                      A.        RecentEconomic Developmentsin Sierra Leone
2.        Sierra Leone has embarked on a transition from a nation focused primarily on post-
conflict needs to a nation poised for long-run growth and the implementation o f a Poverty
Reduction Strategy. The war ended inJanuary 2002, just over three years ago. Sierra Leone has
made substantial progress in consolidating social and economic security for its people. This has
beencomplementedby its efforts to promote transparent and inclusive govemance. While there
i s a continued need for rehabilitation and recovery, people are now increasingly looking ahead to
the economic growth andpublic service deliverythat will help them escapepoverty.

3.       There have been significant positive developments on several fronts since the Board o f
Executive Directors approved the Third Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit (ERRC
111) for Sierra Leone (IDA Credit 3765-SL) in April 2003.'                   The government wrapped up its   '

disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) exercise inFebruary 2004: 72,000 former
combatants have been disarmed and demobilized; over 56,000 ex-combatants have benefited
from the social and economic re-insertion programs; virtually all 200,000 internally displaced
persons and 100,000 former refugees have been resettled.                     In September 2002, the United
Nations Security Council agreed to a gradual, phased withdrawal o f the United Nations
Peacekeeping Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), inline with the strengthening o fthe national
security framework. This process began to accelerate in 2004 although a reduced presence will
be maintained through December 2005.* The process o f decentralizationbegan inFebruary 2004

governments were the first inover 30 yearsa3

4.      Sierra Leone's strong recovery continued into 2003 and 2004 when real GDP grew by an
estimated 9.3 percent and 7.4 percent respectively, despite increasing oil prices, marking five
years of sustained economic r e ~ o v e r y .(See Table 1 below.) This post-conflict recovery has
                                                    ~
been propelled by the growth o f donor-financed imports, large-scale resettlement and
reconstruction activities, increases in land under cultivation and growing remittances and
investments by the Sierra Leone expatriate communityand other investors. Cash crop production
increased sharply with resettlement, particularly for coffee, cocoa, groundnuts and palm kemels.
The officially registered output of diamonds in 2004 expanded to 691,757 carats, 37 percent over
the 2003 total o f 506,723 carats. A major kimberlitic diamond mine has begun producing inthe
first quarter o f 2004. Limited progress has been made in readying the Sierra Rutile mine for
renewed production at the beginning o f 2005.                   Offshore oil exploration i s expected to get
underway soon.

5,      Export growth has shown rapid post-war recovery growing at a rate o f 27 percent in2003
and 17 percent in 2004, mainly on the strength o f alluvial diamonds.                      The external current
account deficit (includingofficial transfers) stood at 7.6 percent o f GDP in2003 and i s estimated
to have improved to 4.9 percent o f GDP in 2004 due in part to a 10 percent contraction in
imports in 2004. This i s mainly due to a large reduction inUNforces, and the departure o f some
post-conflict NGOs, who are needed more urgently in other ,post-conflict countries now that
Sierra Leone has ~tabilized.~The current account deficit was financed mainly by concessional
extemal assistance.

6.      Fiscal performance in 2003 was complicated by delays in extemal budget support.
Expenditureswere adjusted downwards incompensation for the delays. This left a fiscal balance
o f -6.7 percent o f GDP, well below the program target.                   This adjustment was not enough,
however, to fully compensate the loss in expected external financing. As a consequence,
recourse to domestic credit and monetary growth were higher than programmed. Estimated
spending i s expected to have fallen in 2004, due in part to additional delays in budget support
which led to a reduction in the procurement o f goods and services. This left an estimated fiscal
balance equivalent to -3.5 percent o f GDP in 2004. The delays in extemal budget support
through the third quarter temporarily boosted recourse to domestic credit although this was
reversed as aid materialized.

7.      Price inflation hadbeen negative in 2002 as the end o f the war allowed renewed access to
goods, both domestic and imported. The situation in 2003-2004 has been more challenging due
to a combination o f extemal shocks, delays in aid disbursements and incomplete fiscal
adjustment.       Petroleum prices rose in 2003 and rose again in 2004 to historic levels with
concurrent increases in rice prices. These extemal price shocks, combined with delays in

  General elections were heldinMay 2002. The next general elections will be held in2007.
  The statistical authorities have provisionally revised their GDP estimates for 2001-03. These remain subject to
  review.
  Dutyfree importsbyNGOs and international organizations fellby 55 percent and 31percent respectively between
  2003 and 2004.

extemal financing, put pressure on the exchange rate which depreciated to an average o f 2,348
Le/US$ in 2003 and 2,691 Le/US$ in 2004. The period average inflation rate for 2003 therefore
grew to 7.5 percent and the average inflation rate for 2004 is estimated to be 14.2 percent. There
has also been a sharp increase in domestic interest rates. The nominal, end-of-period rate on
treasury bills was 20 percent in2003 and 28 percent in2004, up from an average o f 15 percent in
2001-02.

8.       The macroeconomic framework agreed by the authorities provides a strong foundation for
growth and poverty reduction. The average real GDP growth rate is forecast to start out at 7.5
percent in 2005 and gradually taper off to 6 percent by 2008-09. This generates an average rate
of 6.6 per annum for 2005-07. On the one hand, this is quite strong by international standards
since even 5 percent per annum would be considered quite healthy. On the other hand, it points
to the need for further increases in savings, investment and productivity after 2006 because 7

percent per annum i s estimated to be the minimumrate needed in order to ensure that the number
o fpeople inpoverty does not increase.6

9.      The projected slow-down in growth does not signal any policy failure. Rather, it merely
reflects the natural retum to normalcy after a conflict. Immediately after a conflict, growth rates
are often quite high as people retum to abandoned farms and factories and begin to rehabilitate
them.     As these quick gains are exhausted, the normal relationship between savings and
investment reappears a few years later. The projections also assume the resumption o f large
scale mining in 2006 and the maintenance o f an investment rate o f at least 21 percent o f GDP.
(See Table 1above.)         The investment rate target will require increases inbothprivate and public
savings rates because foreign savings are projectedto decline by 6 percent o f GDP between2004
and 2009.7

10.     The projected loss in foreign savings i s the natural consequence o f success. On the one
hand, the consolidation o f peace will allow donors to phase-out their post-conflict premiums and
retum to normal levels o f assistance.           On the other hand, increased security will allow more
export production and reduce the need for financing from foreign saving.                             Much o f this
improvement is expected to come from the resumptionof rutile and bauxite operations in 2006,
allowing exports to expand by 4 percentage points of GDP in that year.8 The current account
balance, after grants, i s projected to improve from -8.0 percent of GDP in 2005 to -3.7 percent
of GDP by 2009.          External reserves are to grow to 3.6 months of imports by 2009 from 3.1
months o f imports in2004.

11.      Cumulative financing requirements for Sierra Leone are reviewed on a regular basis as
part o f the PRGF. Financing requirements between 2005 and 2009 are projected to be US$996
million. (See Table 2 below.) Identified financing for fiscal operations, including the proposed
grant i s expected to total US$847 million for the five year period. This will come from US$452
million in grants (including those for H P C relief), US$218 million in loans and US$177 million
indebt relief. Financing for the Bank o f Sierra Leone is not specifiedinTable 2 beyond2005 as
the current PRGF expires in June 2005. Future IMF involvement with the country will be
considered in the context o f the assessment o f the long-term program engagement, which will be
undertaken in the context o f the sixth review o f the PRGF arrangement.                         Discussions on a
successor arrangement are expected to begin soon after the completion o f the sixth program
review. Financing for all other activities will be provided from a combination o f direct foreign
investment and loans. This leaves a residual gap o f US$193 million to be filled by the expected




6 The required growthrate is the result o fa very conservative assumption about the elasticity (-0.8) o fpoverty to
  growth inmean income. Simulations based on a range o f elasticities will be considered as part o fthe FY06 CEM
'Foreign
  and Poverty Assessment.
          savings are defined as imports o f goods and non-factor services less exports. Alternatively, they can be
  defined as balance o f payments financing adjusted for interest and transfers.
  The large inflows of foreign direct investment for rutile, bauxite and a kimberlite mine seenin2003, 2004 and
  2005 are projected to decline as mining preparations are completed and operations begin, eventually returningto
  the 2002 level o fUS$2millionby2007 before a new cycle o f investments begins inlater years.

12.      Fiscal savings are projected to increase by 4.7 percentage points o f GDP between 2004
and 2009. M u c h of this adjustment i s expected to be achieved through an increased revenue
effort as the Government aims to achieve macroeconomic stability without having to reduce
spending during a time when the PRSP i s being introduced. Several new tax measures planned:
new taxes on local telephone calls, the re-imposition o f a 17.5 percent sales tax, a 30 percent
excise tax on tobacco products, the elimination o f some exemptions such as a zero rated import
duty for raw materials, the imposition o f excise duty on older vehicles andvarious fee increases.
The Governmenti s also establishing a National Tax Fraud Unit.

13.      Increased revenues, and expected declines in domestic interest due, will allow a
substantial expansion in development expenditures beginning in 2005 and a reduction in the
deficit by 2007. The fiscal balance, after grants worth roughly 8 percent o f GDP per annum, i s
expected to improve to -1.7 percent o f GDP by 2009 from an -4.0 percent o f GDP in 2005.
Financing for the fiscal balance i s fully identified.

14.      The Government also aims to create a buffer against delays inbudget support from any o f
the four budget support donors by discountingthe level o f budget support in the macroeconomic
framework and by following a fiscal rule where spending does not exceed the discounted
envelope unless the full amount o f aid i s actually received.



  These numbers are consistentwith implementation ofPRSP priorities underthe macroeconomicframework agreed
  with the IMF on the basis of identifiedextemal financing. Implementationof the PRSP beyond core priorities will
  require additional financing.

15.      This fiscal tightening combined with prudent monetary policy will lead to a reduction in
the inflation rate to 4.0 percent in 2009 from an average o f 14.2 percent in 2004. Similarly, the
auction determined treasury bill interest rate i s expected to fall from 28 percent in 2004 to 14.0
percent in2007.

                                         C.       Debt Sustainability
16.      In March 2002, Sierra Leone reached the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
decision point which made it eligible for debt relief in the amount o f US$600 million in NPV
terms or 80 percent o f the country's outstanding (foreign) external debt as o f end-2000.               Under
the HIPC Initiative, ten out o f eleven Paris Club creditors have agreed to provide debt relief on
Naples terms. Recently, France has agreed to provide Cologne terms relief and has cancelled all
pre cut-off non-ODA debt. A draft agreement reflecting Naples terms has been submitted to
Japan and i s yet to be signed. A significant reduction inthe net present value of debt, relative to
projected exports i s expected after Sierra Leone reaches the HIPC completion point. All non-
Paris Club official creditors have agreed to deliver debt relief, or indicated their willingness to do
so. A second debt buy-back operation, to be financed by the Bank, for validated commercial
obligations i s under preparation.lo

17.      An external debt-sustainability analysis was recently completed by the IMF." The
historical data and projections have since been superseded by new numbers in the Sixth Review
o f the IMF PRGF reported elsewhere in this CAS. While a new exercise will be conducted for
the HIPC Completion Point in the fall o f 2006, the main conclusions are not expected to differ
substantivelyfrom those reportedhere, barring differences inmethodology or key assumptions.

18.      The analysis suggests that Sierra Leone faces moderate risk of external debt distress,
despite very low debt service requirements relative to exports, because o f the magnitude o f
shocks it could face in the future (GDP shortfalls, delays in aid, or higher spending).                    The
baseline scenario results assume that the highreal GDP growth seen inrecent years will taper o f f
to an average o f 6.0 percent per annum between 2010 and 2022 with export growth following a
similar path. The scenario also assumes continued improvement in the primary fiscal balance,
the clearance o f all outstanding arrears to official creditors by 2005, the full delivery o f Enhanced
HIPC reliefand additional voluntary relief provided by bilateral creditors.                   In the baseline
scenario, without any shocks, the ratio o f external debt service to exports o f goods and non-
factor-services i s projected to fluctuate around an average o f 5 percent for the period 2006-202 1,
The ratio o f the net present value of external debt-to-exports is projected to level off at around
120 percent over the same period. Interest on domestic debt, as a share of revenues and grants,
falls from 14 percent to 8 percent, again over the same period. This i s made possible by the
improving fiscal balance which takes pressure off the domestic interest rate. Total debt service
due (after all relief) falls from 19percent o frevenues and grants in2003 to 13 percent by2021.

19.      Under the baseline scenario, the total stock o f debt falls to 69 percent o f GDP by 2022
from 76 percent in 2003. Within this amount, domestic debt falls from 41 percent in2003 to 16

                         111. THE GOVERNMENTPROGRAM

                            A.      The Challenge of Pervasive Poverty
20.      The Government's program i s set out in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) o f
February 2005. The primary objective o f the PRSP i s the reduction o f poverty. The first
household survey since 1989/90 was recently completed. Preliminary results are now available.12
The proportion below the national poverty line (defined at L e 2,111 per day) i s inordinately large,
estimated at 70 percent o f the population in Sierra Leone. Some 26 percent o f the population
may be classified as extremely poor, that is, unable to meet 50 percent o f their daily needs. The
UN Human Development Index, based on social indicators, can be interpreted as another
measure o f poverty. Sierra Leone was ranked at the bottom o f the index for 2002.13

21.      Poverty is heavily concentrated inthe rural and other urban areas outside Freetown. The
proportion below the poverty line inFreetown i s estimated at 15 percent, compared to 79 percent
inthe rural areas and 70 percent inother urban areas. The Gini coefficient is 0.39, implyingthat
income distribution i s moderately skewed: the non-poor 20 percent o f the population accounts
for about 47 percent o f household spending compared to the poorest 20 percent, which accounts
for only 7 percent.      Income inequality i s relatively higher in the rural areas, compared to
Freetown andother urban areas.

22.      Preliminary estimates suggest that the economy of Sierra Leone has to grow by at least
4.7 percent per annum inreal terms to prevent the number o f poor people from rising. Such an
outcome will depend critically upon the resources available for investment, notably from the
donor community and from fiscal savings.

                               B.     The Poverty Reduction Strategy
23.       The Government has devised a set o f strategies and priorities that address the main
development challenges in Sierra Leone. The finalization o f the PRSP inFebruary 2005 was an
important step forward in launching a comprehensive development strategy focused on poverty
reduction andgrowth.

24.      The foundation of the PRSP is a series o f extensive consultations conducted throughout
the country. These consultations were characterized by open and frank dialogue between
government and the people representedby key stakeholders - cabinet ministers, parliamentarians,
NGOs, members o f civil society, the private sector, cooperative associations, local authorities,
religious leaders, development partners and beneficiary groups. The participatory methodologies
includedthe Strategic Planning and Action Process, Focus Group Discussions and Participatory
Poverty Assessments. Civic engagement on the PRSP was led by NGOs. National and District
consultations on the draft poverty strategy and validation workshops for the final draft PRSP


   These numbersare preliminary. A PovertyAssessment and CEM are plannedfor FY05-06.

were also organized.          Radio and television discussions were an important part o f the
communication and sensitization strategy.

25.       The central goal for poverty in the PRS i s a restatement o f the first Millennium
Development Goal: by 2015 the proportion o f people whose income i s less than one dollar a day
should be reduced to half the 1990 level o f 82 percent, from the current base o f 70 percent in
2003/04.14 This i s to be achieved through a very ambitious growth rate o f 8-9 percent per annum
(6-7 percent per-capita). This growth rate, in turn, will be promoted by actions to be taken under
the three pillars of the PRS: i) Good Governance, Security and Peace Building, ii) Pro-poor
Sustainable Growth for Food Security and Job Creation and iii) Human Development. Special
attention has been given to the topics o f food security and employment. The PRSP indicated that
the choice o f pillars derived from a number o f factors, including the recent emergence o f the
country from civil conflict, the status o f governance inthe country, and the need to reinvest inthe
productive sectors in order to promote growth in an effort to reduce the high level o f poverty in
the country. The pillars are backedby a wide array o f strategies and programs.

26.       The first pillar i s influenced by the recent emergence o f the country from a brutal
conflict that reduced the capacity for good governance and security. Although significant
progress has been made in re-building various institutions for governing the state and
safeguarding national security, there i s still need for deeper reforms and strengthening their
capacity for effective and efficient delivery o f basic services and long-term sustainable
development.      The participatory poverty assessment undertaken for the PRSP emphasized
various aspects o f bad governance as one o f the main causes o f their deepening poverty.
Consolidation o f peace and nation-wide reconciliation are also expected to provide the enabling
environment for the transition to medium and longer-term development.

27.       The key elements o f the Government program for good governance under the first pillar
include: i) public service reform aimed at better service delivery through improvements in
personnel management and remuneration; ii) decentralization o f service delivery; iii) continued
improvements in public financial management; iv) strengthening the anti-corruption agenda; and
v) better statistics for monitoring outcomes. Consolidation o f the peace, won in January 2002,
will be promoted through i) judicial reform; ii) tackling human rights abuses; iii) deepening
democratic institutions; iv) improving access to information; and v) continued strengthening o f
the police and armed forces.

28.       The second pillar emphasizes the continued implementation o f sound economic policies
to attain macroeconomic stability and a more favorable environment for private sector
development. A stable macro-economy will also underpin the sectoral and other more specific
interventions that have been designed through participatory processes involving consultations
with civil society and other community stakeholders in the country. The Government believes
pro-poor, economy-wide growth i s especially critical to strengthening food security systems for
the poor and job creation opportunities, especially for the growing number o f unemployed and
underemployedyoung men and women inthe urban and rural areas.


l4This is somewhat imprecise because the poverty lines are not the same inthe 1989190 and 2003104 household
  surveys.


                                                      - 8 -

29.       The key elements in the Government program for sustainable growth under the second
pillar include three broad objectives: the maintenance o f a conducive macroeconomic
environment; food security and job creation.                These are to be achieved through:            i) the
maintenance o f macroeconomic stability -- including appropriate fiscal and monetary policies
and effective debt management; ii) support to the productive sectors and especially agriculture
through the provision o f inputs, machinery, extension services and training;15 iii) investments in
infrastructure for power, roads and information technology; iv) improvements in the investment
climate including improvements in the legal framework and better access to credit and micro-
finance programs; and vii) divestiture o fpublic enterprises.

30.       The third pillar underscores the point that poverty reduction must be underpinned by
investment in human resources. Investments in the health and education o f the population and
the delivery o f basic services will provide the basis for sustained poverty reduction by enhancing
the capacities o f the poor and reducing their vulnerability.

3 1,      The third pillar includes several broad objectives:               expanded basic education and
training, expanded health and nutrition services, increased access to water and sanitation
facilities, affordable housing for the poor, HN/AIDS prevention and control, gender equality and
empowerment and better environmental management.                       Specific targets for various human
development outcomes are being developed by the Government to accompany the PRSP. The
key elements o f the Government program for human development under the third pillar include:
the decentralization o f many services, construction and rehabilitation o f facilities, subsidies,
school feeding programs, improved curriculums, training for teachers and health workers and
better administration including improved statistics for monitoring educational enrollment rates
and health outcomes.

32.       A Poverty Reduction Strategy Technical Secretariat will take the lead responsibility for
coordination o f all PRS monitoring activities. The Secretariat will oversee working groups that
monitor resource allocations and expenditures, survey and censuses results, community based
monitoring and a fourth group in charge o f research and dissemination.                          Monitoring and
evaluation activities will benefit from donor support in 2006 onward. Most critically, a new
household survey will be conducted in2008.

33.       Successful implementation will require mastering the organizational challenges o f
planning, budgeting, implementing and monitoring PRSP programs. Capacity building will need
to be an important building block supporting any successful PRSP implementation. T o make the
strategy stronger and more robust, it will be useful to: bring PRS expenditures into line with
available resources through further prioritization of programs; ensure priority programs and
projects are protected from internal and external shocks; strengthen revenue collection and seek
additional donor financing; and seek greater reliance on local governments and the private sector
to relieve constraints on the central Government.

         IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

                                     A.     Linksto the CAS
34.      A new CAS (ReportNo, 31793-SL) coveringthe period FY06-09 is to be discussedwith
the Bank's Executive Board in June 2005, concurrently with the proposed grant. Its predecessor
was the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) o f March 2002 (Report No. 23758-SL). The TSS
covered the period FY02-04.        The TSS followed Interim-PRSP priorities and focused on
providing a combination o f projects and budget support for urgent post-conflict needs as well as
decentralization, capacity building, human resource development, infrastructure and private
sector stimulation.

35.      The new CAS i s based on the recently completed PRSP. While it reflects many of the
same elements found in the Interim-PRSP, there are important differences: three years o f peace
have diminished the need for post-conflict assistance to address emergency needs and a medium-
term development vision has emerged. Poverty reduction, growth, food security andjob creation
have become pressing priorities. Inthis light, the proposed grant forms a bridge between the
post-conflict orientation o f the TSS and the growth and poverty orientation o f the new CAS.

36.      The new CAS i s explicitly rooted in a results based framework, which links the overall
goals o f the Government's new PRS to specific strategic objectives and outcomes which are
monitored, where appropriate and possible, by quantitative intermediate progress indicators that
are directly affected by Bank interventions. The focus o f IDA activities i s structured around the
three strategic pillars o f the PRSP: i) Governance, Security and Reconciliation, ii) Pro-poor
Sustainable Growth; and iii) Human Resource Development.

37.      The proposed CAS includes a series of programmatic Development Policy Operations
within the context o f a Framework for Multi-Donor Budget Support.          These operations will
support PRS policies and reforms and the progressive build-upo f PRS implementationcapacity.

38.      While the proposed grant bridges the two strategy documents, it i s fully consistent with
both. It provides for macroeconomic stability through budget support mandatedbyboth the TSS
and CAS, it provides support for key aspects o f the Government's poverty reduction strategy as
required by the TSS and CAS, the operation i s a grant as proposed in the CAS and it sets the
stage for the shift to programmatic lending mandated under the CAS. The latter objective i s
achieved by dropping the two tranche design used for ERRC I- I11in favor o f a more flexible
single tranche design. (See section IV.Dfor more o n this subject.)

                      B.       DevelopmentPartnership and Coordination
39.      This grant has beenprepared ina manner consistent with the IMF's PRGF, following the
agreed institutional division o f labor with the IMF taking the lead on macro-economic sector
issues while the Bank takes the lead on structural and social issues. The XMF agreed in2001 on a
medium-term economic program which i s supported under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 130.84 million (126 percent o f quota).        The
IMF concluded a successful fifthreview o fthe PRGFonNovember 12,2004. The completion of
this review enables the release o f an amount equivalent to SDR 14million (about US$21.1


                                                - 10-

million), which would bringthe total amount drawn under the arrangement to SDR 116.8 million
(about US$176.5 million). The IMF program will end on June 25, 2005 following an extension
bythe IMF Board, Discussions are underway for a new program and the prospects are good that
this program will be established on a timely basis. Inthe meantime the Bank and IMF staff will
closely monitor macroeconomic developments.

40.       The agreement on a Fundprogram motivated further budgetary support from the Africa
Development Bank (AfDB), the British Department for Intemational Development (DfD) and
the European Commission (EC). Most recently, the AfDB has programmed the equivalent o f
US$25 million for the period 2004-07 and discussions are underway for the 2005-07 round o f
support. DfD intends to provide up to 50 million pounds for the period FY06-08 while the EC
will provide 50 million euros for the period 2005-07.

41.       Donor coordination i s led by the Government through bi-monthly meetings o f the Sierra
Leone Development Partnership Committee, chaired by the Vice President o f Sierra Leone and
comprising Government and its development partners.          The first such meeting was held on
March 20, 2003. The topic o f that first meeting was a review o f progress in implementing the
framework for peace, recovery and development agreed at the 2002 Consultative Group meeting.
The current state o f progress towards meeting Consultative Group goals i s presented inAnnex 2.
The matrix shows that most goals have been substantively met and, further, that the Government
can work within the context o f multi-donor frameworks. Eleven DEPAC meetings have been
held through M a y 2005, each with strong donor representation, on a wide variety o f topics.

42.       Donor coordination has been, and will remain, particularly strong on issues o f
govemance and public financial management. This i s in recognition o f the damage done to the
capacity for good govemance by years o f corrupt govemance before the war and by the war itself.
A key focus area of DFID support is the improvement o f governance through strengthened
financial management systems and decentralization. Public finance management, incorporating
the overall budget process, regulatory framework, procurement, and financial management
remain key areas o f EC support.

43.       The key budget support donors (AfDB, DfD, EC and World Bank) have agreed in
principle to the development o f a Framework for Multi-Donor Budget Support to cover the
period 2006-08.    The framework will aim to coordinate donor support for the Government's
reform program and PRS. It will set out clear goals, monitorable progress indicators and areas o f
responsibility for Government and for each donor. The initial framework i s expected to be
negotiated in the first half of 2005, in time for the 2006 budget and the next round o f
Development Policy support from the World Bank.

                         C.      Relationshipto Other Bank Operations
44.       Performance under the proposed grant will benefit from a number o f other Bank
operations and vice versa. In general, the goal is to create mutually beneficial linkages where
investment credits supply necessary financing and technical knowledge and the Development
Support operation provides additional incentive to complete the work inthe investment credit. It
i s also the case that all Bank investment projects will benefit from the proposed grant to the
extent that budget support i s fungible and the grant supports a good policy environment.


                                                - 11-

45.       The chief Bank investment project supporting pillar one goals for good govemance i s the
Institutional Reform and Capacity Building (IRCB) project (Grant H0860-SL).                       The IRCB
project supports multiple objectives related to capacity building for decentralization, procurement
reform and better public financial management inthe Ministry o f Finance.

46.       Within pillar two, private sector reforms startedunder ERRC I11andcontinuedinERRG
IV will be further supported by an ongoing Foreign Investment Advisory Service investment
climate operation. This work will help set the stage for a private sector development project
included in the FY06-09 CAS. The Program objective o f increased power supply will benefit
from the Power and Water Project (Credit 39450-SL) which provides support for a management
contract for the power utility and for power sector legislative reform. The Program goals on
improving road maintenance and port operations will benefit from support from the Transport
Project (Credit 28950-SL) and preparation o f the new Infrastructure Development Project for
FY06 through restructuring o f the Sierra Leone Road Authority and the Sierra Leone Port
Authority. Work started under ERRC I11and continued into ERRGIV will help prepare the way
for a Bank project in support o f metals and minerals development, notably with regard to
regulatory changes and capacity building.

47.       Educational development under pillar three i s supported by the Bank's Rehabilitation o f
Basic Education Project (Grant H0200--SL) will assist participating schools to achieve basic
operating level standards and it will help build the capacity of the Ministry o f Education,
Science and Technology (MEST) to plan and manage the delivery o f education services. The
latter aspect will underpin the Program goal o f better administrative capacity to plan and deliver
educational services.

48.       The World Bank i s supporting the health sector development under pillar three through
two projects. The Health Sector Reconstruction and Development Project (Grant H0210-SL) i s
designed to help restore the most essential functions o f the health sector delivery system. Among
other things, it will support the development o f the private NGO health sector and involvement
o f the civil society in decision-making, help strengthen health sector management capacity and
promote the performance of key technical programs. The latter project element i s consistent with
the Program goal of reforms in the distribution o f essential drugs. The Sierra Leone HIV/AIDS
Response project (Credit 36270-SL) i s designed to help reduce HIV/AIDS prevalence and
mitigate the impact o f HIV/AIDS on persons infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. The success o f
thisproject will depend inpart on the reforms inthe distributiono f drugs.

                                         D.      Lessons Learned
49.       The design o f the proposed grant has benefited from a number o f lessons drawn from
guidance from Operations Policy and Country Services, Lmplementation Completion Reports for
ERRC I- I11and the Quality Assurance Group findings for ERRC                  III.16  Four key lessons are
highlightedhere:




l6Lessons from the Implementation Completion report for ERRC I11are preliminary: the report was incomplete at
  the time this was written. ERRC I11closed inDecember 2004.


                                                    - 12-

.   The QualityAssurance Group review o f ERRC I11included praise for its balanced approach
    to support for development policy. The proposed grant will therefore maintain the same
    balance   with program       support    aimed     at  macro-stabilization,    good   governance,

.   decentralization, selected aspects o f capacity building and stimulation o f the private sector.

    Lending for development policy should not rely on conditionality alone to catalyze and
    implement reforms. To be fully effective, the policy dialogue must be supported by other
    instruments that identify institutional weaknesses and help build country capacity step by
    step. (OPCS 2001) The proposed grant therefore seeks to capitalize, as much as possible, on
    existing project support and technical assistance. These supporting operations are referenced

.   insections N.C above andV.B.b below.

    The design o f Bank support for policy reforms should seek to integrate the efforts of other
    active donors. Inthis regard, the Quality Assurance Group noted that the ERRC 111was "the
    glue" that bound the efforts o f the Government, Bank and donors together. The proposed
    grant continues this approach through the use o f ongoing donor operations, in addition to
    Bank operations, to support agreed actions. This effort will be deepened as a Framework for
    Multi-Donor Budget Support i s established inthe near future. (See section n7.B above.)

    The all or nothing requirements for the release o f funds utilized by ERRC I11created an
    incentive to complete reforms but macroeconomic stability was reduced when weak capacity
    slowed the achievement o f required actions. Inessence, the design o f the credit did not fully
    anticipate the delays that are likely in post-conflict states. This problem i s addressed in the
    proposed grant by adopting a more flexible approach. The release o f funds i s limited to a
    single tranche on the basis o f prior actions supported under a previous credit. Similarly, the
    next Development Policy operation would be justified on the basis o f progress towards
    indicative "triggers" supported under the proposed grant. In this regard, the timing o f the
    next operation will take into account any emerging concems about the pace o f program
    implementation.

                                E.      Analytical Underpinnings
50.      The conclusions and recommendations presented in a number o f analytical documents
provide the foundation for the design o f the proposed grant. A Poverty Assessment i s scheduled
for delivery in FY06. In the meantime, the preparation o f the proposed grant has benefited from
a number o f technical notes on the results o f the 2003/04 household survey.              Additional
information on the incidence of poverty and public service delivery is available from the
Participatory Poverty Assessment conducted for the PRSP, pilot census results and pilot CWIQ
results. The deep poverty found in Sierra Leone highlights the need for rapid income growth
while the lower poverty in Freetown, relative to the rest o f the nation, provides an empirical
argument favoring Bank support for the decentralization o fpublic service delivery.

51.      The poverty analysis also shows that the two poorest groups, by productive sector, are
rural farmers and miners. This provides justification for the proposed grant's support for metals
and minerals development. Further analytical support for the metals and mineral sector was
found inthe draft Mineral Sector Review. Among other issues, the report i s clear on the need for
better extension services - not only to encourage production but also to encourage safer andmore


                                                - 1 3 -

environmentally responsible production. This document has been extensively discussed within
Government and the miningcommunityin a series o f two stakeholder workshops.

52.      The policy support for growth andjob creation i s informed by the Bank's annual "Doing
Business" publication as well as a preliminary investment climate report issued by FIAS for the
Government in 2004.        These analyses are clear that there i s a need for a conducive and
predictable legal and regulatory framework in addition to investments in key infrastructure. As
such, these reports help motivate the support for changes in business law and improvements in
the management o f electricity provision, the ports and road maintenance. A Government study
on the impact o f the ECOWAS Common Extemal Tariff (CET), mandated under ERRC 111,
helps inform the support for implementationo f the CET in2005.

53.      Key documents for issues related to good governance and public resource management
include the 2002 CFAA, 2004 HIPC AAP, 2004 PER, the corruption surveys used in the
Governance Report and the background papers for the IRCB.17 These documents provide the
rationale for, among other things, the support for the Government Budgeting and Accountability
Act, support for an anti-corruption strategy, procurement reform, the design o f a new chart o f
accounts and strengthened capacity in the offices o f the Accountant-General and the Auditor-
General.

                             V.      THE PROPOSED GRANT

                                   A.   OperationDescription
54.      The proposed Development Policy Operation will support the Government's PRS
described above and documented further inthe attached Letter o f Development Policy (Annex 1).
The proposed grant will provide critical resources to consolidate and deepen the agenda set by
the ERRC series including progress made in governance, decentralization o f government,
management of public resources, human resource development and private sector-led economic
growth particularly in mining. The grant will contribute to economic recovery, growth and
poverty reduction by providing foreign exchange resources for imports o f essential commodities,
by providing financial resources to the Government budget to finance priority public
expenditures and by supporting reforms to attract private investment. By helping to close the
financing gap in 2005, it will also contribute to maintaining macroeconomic stability and low
inflation.

                                      B.      PolicyAreas
55.      The policies areas supported by the proposed ERRG IV build on the results achieved
under ERRC 111. They are aligned with medium-term objectives under each o f the three PRSP
(and CAS) pillars and informed by recent analytical work, notably the PER and H P C AAP.
The choice o f policy areas and the proposed actions are the result o f consultations with all
stakeholder ministries. The content was also discussed with representatives of the IMF, AfDB,
DfID and EC. This coordination, from all parties, will lay the foundation for the planned


"A"mini-CPAR' wascompletedinJune2004. ThekeyrecommendationisforthepassageofaProcurementAct.
  This was achieved inDecember 2004.

Framework for Multi-donor Budgetary Support, as mentioned in Section IV.B above. This grant
therefore acts as a bridge between the ERRC series and the new series o f programmatic
Development Policy Operations inthe proposed CAS.

56.      The realignment with the PRSP and recent analytical work has confirmed the need for
continued support for the policy areas established under ERRC 111. These are: good governance,
public financial management, decentralization, the investment climate and mining. The
realignment also motivates opening up two new areas: the need to begin addressing public
service reform andmatching the PRSP emphasis on humanresource development.

57.      Sub-section B.l below will describe medium-term Program goals and describe what
Government has already done under ERRC I11in pursuit o f those goals. Sub-section B.2 will
then describe additional actions taken immediately prior to the presentation o f ERRG IV to the
Board and lay out agreed follow-up actions or milestones, eight o f which will serve as triggers
for subsequent support.

        1.Medium-termObjectives,ERRC I11and PriorActions for ERRGIV

58.      This grant is brought to the Board o f Executive Directors for approval upon the strength
o f the Government's commitment to its program o f reform and poverty reduction.             This
commitment i s demonstrated not only through the completion o f all ERRC I11conditions but also
by the completion o f a number of prior actions that build upon the Government achievements
under ERRC 111. These are documented below, arranged by PRSP/CAS pillars. Additional
action, buildingon these achievements i s discussed inthe next sub-section (V.B.2.).

        Objective 1: Goodgovernance.

59.      Government Budgeting and Accountability Act. Several damaging amendments were
made in 1996 to the Public Budgeting and Accounting Act o f 1992. These amendments had the
effect of reducing the oversight roles o f both the Office o f the Auditor-General and the
Parliament. The amendments also distorted the relationship between the Accountant-General's
Department (AGD) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The 2002 limited scope CFAA made
the correction o f these amendments a priority and work began under ERRC 111. The new
Government Budgeting and Accountability law corrects the 1996 amendments and more. It i s
the keystone o freform inpublic resource management. It clarifies roles and responsibilities, sets
out rules for the use of public funds, sets requirements for accounting and auditing and the
management o f Government stores. Enactment o f the new law by Parliament i s a prior action for
ERRGIV that was completed on February4,2005.

60.      Supporting decentralization. Government believes that a contributing factor to the ten-
year civil war was the antagonism between a large section o f the rural population, who were
marginalized from the political process and deprived o f social services and economic
development opportunities, and those who had access and control in Freetown.           Household
survey data for 2003/04 are clear that the problempersists with large inequalities betweenurban
Freetown and the rest o f the country.




                                               - 1 5 -

61.        Inthis light,it is Government's intentionto restore local governance anddecentralizethe
provision o f services. Government took the first steps in 2004 with the passage o f the Local
Government Act that created new local councils and mandated regular elections at the local
level."    The first local elections inmore than 30 years were successfully completedinMay2004.
The next step is to establish local council budgets for 2005 and begin the delivery o f
decentralized services.

62.        The Budget Speech for the 2005 budget, read before Parliament in December 2004, did
not include details o f the transfer formulas to be used for the allocation o f transfers to the newly
created local governments, nor the specific transfers to each local government. This i s because a
formal decision had not been taken to authorize the use o f proposed formulas. This, in turn, i s
because the Local Government Finance Committee had not yet been made operational with the
appointment o f its committee members. As part o f the agreed Program, and as a prior action,
Government had corrected this by appointing six o f seven required committee members to the
Local Government Finance Committee by the end of March 2005.                         The adoption and
promulgation o f the local government transfer formulas appears in section V.B.2 below as a
trigger.

63.        The IRCB project, in collaboration with the AfDB, DfID and EC, lays out a detailed
medium-term plan o f next steps for Local Government capacity building and public financial
management and sets standards which must be met for access to resources.               Progress in these
next steps i s included as part o f the ERRGIV program.

64.        Procurement reform.       There is a widespread perception in Sierra Leone that very few
public procurement contracts in recent years had been tendered through transparent and
competitive processes. Empirical data support this: between April 2003 and January 2004, only
10 percent o f the contract awards were made on the basis of an open tender process." To correct
this situation, interim rules and regulationswere approvedby the Cabinet inJune 2004 and new
legislation was signed into law in December 2004 under ERRC 111. As a result, the Ministryo f
Finance will be responsible for oversight o f procurement policy. Inaddition, under the new law,
all ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) are to form procurement committees and
provide acceptable procurement plans before expenditures can be approved. This new practice
will help reduce waste and fraud and it will also help inform the budget process. To begin
implementation o f the law, and as a prior action, Government established the boards for the
National Public Procurement Authority and the Independent Procurement Review Panel along
with procurement committees in key MDAs. A further trigger requiring additional progress is
included inthe next section below.

65.        Strengthening public financial management.                Much o f the fiduciary strength o f
Government depends upon the continued maintenance o f adequate quality and timeliness in the
operations in the Accountant-General's Department.                 The Accountant-General's Department
(AGD) has, however, recently suffered some losses in its senior and technical ranks. Key


   This was achievedunder the World Bank's ERRCI11and IRCBproject together with assistance from other
   donors.

personnel have departed for better paying jobs financed by the donor community while the
Accountant-General was removed inMarch 2004 for alleged corrupt practices in a previous post.
An acting Accountant-General has been put in place but a qualified applicant had not been
selected for the post by December 2004. As a consequence, there were no qualified accountants
in the AGD throughout most o f 2004. Resolving this situation is fundamental to the fiduciary
strength o f Government. To resolve this situation, and as a prior action, Government advertised
for the post o f Accountant-General and two deputies in December 2004. Fillingthese posts i s a
trigger for continued support.              This trigger and additional programs related to the AGD are
described in section V.B.2 below.

66.        Strengthening external audit. There i s an ongoing need for an effective external audit
function as a prerequisite for good govemance. Yet, the Office o f the Auditor-General has been
understaffed for many years due inpart to inadequate remuneration. This issue has been resolved
in 2004 with a new agreement on terms and conditions o f service.20 The new terms will,
however, have the effect o f increasing costs to Government. To move forward, and as part of the
agreed Program, the Minister o f Finance has agreed with the Auditor-General on a medium-term
 expenditure plan for the Office o f the Auditor-General for staffing to begin in 2005.
Implementation of the plan i s part o f the agreed Programunder ERRGN.

          Objective 2: Pro-Poor Growth and Job Creation.

 67.       Investment climate. One o f the medium-term priorities o f Government has been the
 improvement of the investment climate. It i s recognized within Government that this i s a multi-
 faceted task involving the quality o f infrastructure, the availability of an educated workforce and
the quality and predictability of the legal and regulatory framework. With regard to the latter,
under ERRC 111, Government enacted an investment code in August 2004 based o n intemational
best practices. The new law ensures that all enterprises - domestic, foreign, new or old will
benefit from and be subjected to the same laws and regulations. The investment climate will be
 further improved under the Program through additional legal and regulatory changes included as
triggers inthe next sub-section.

 68.       Investment climate and the trade regime. The trade and tariff regime i s an important
part o f the investment climate.               Overly high or inappropriate tariffs can inhibit or distort
 investment decisions. A high import tariff rate will reduce exports through real exchange rate
 over-valuation in addition to reducing the importation o f essential raw materials, spare parts and
machinery. In Sierra Leone's case, the unweighted average tariff rate o f 17.5 percent can be
broughtdown to 13.3 percent through the adoption of the Economic Communityo fWest African
 States (ECOWAS) Common Extemal Tariff (CET). The cost o f imports will be reduced and
 exports to ECOWAS members stimulated through implementation o f the CET. Under ERRC 111,
the Government finalized a study on the economic and fiscal impact o f adopting the CET and
prepared a phased action plan. As a prior action under ERRG N,Government has started the
 first phase this year with the adoption and implementation o f the new tariff schedule on January

1, 2005.*l Further analytical work on trade and international competitiveness will be scheduled
under the Integrated Framework for Trade. This is expected to lead to a programof support for
enhanced competitiveness and trade.

69.        Metals and minerals development. The investment climate for mininghas beenhindered
for many years by the lack o f effective administration and enforcement o f mineral rights. The
lack o f clear mineral rights also contributed to a lack o f security in the alluvial diamond mining
areas and reduced the ability of Government to monitor mineral revenues due. To correct this
situation, Government installed a mining cadastral system under ERRC I11in December 2004.
The Government has now taken the next step by adopting a plan for the phased implementation
of the cadastre, starting in Kono district in 2005 and then expanding to the rest o f the nation on
the basis o f lessons learned from the Kono phase, over a two year period. This prior action was
completed in March 2005. Implementation o f the plan i s a trigger for continued support, as
described below.

70.        Mining extension services.            Artisanal diamond miners often work under difficult
conditions that compromise safety, health and environmental standards. To help improve their
prospects, Government set up new unit for the provision o f pilot extension services inDecember
2004 under ERRC 111. This unit will help the mining community better identify reserve areas,
improve production techniques, increase safety and reduce environmental damage. Government
now aims to move to the full scale provision o f extension services. It has therefore adopted an
acceptable 5 year plan for the conversion o f pilot extension services to full scale services
beginning in 2005. This prior action was completed inMarch 2005. Implementation o f the plan
i s a trigger for continued support, as described inthe next sub-section below.

71.        Alluvial diamond miners are also benefiting from assistance from the Peace Diamond
Alliance, an organization consisting o f local communities, Government ministries, local and
external NGOs, private firms and external donors such as DflD and USAID. The Alliance helps
miners organize into cooperatives, sell diamonds at prices closer to world prices than what they
hadbeenreceiving andteaches methods o f conflict management.

          2. Triggers for the Next DevelopmentPolicy Operation

72.        The Bank's decision to proceed with the next Development Policy Operation in the new
series o f programmatic credits mandated in the proposed CAS will be informed by the degree o f
progress towards, or completion of, a number of indicative "triggers" identified in column 4 o f
the Program Matrix (Annex 3). These are tentatively expected to be completed by March 2006
or sooner. These nine triggers and other Program milestones are described below, arranged by
the three PRSPKAS pillars.

   include assistance incomputerizing customs procedures and the collection o f trade data. Additional assistance
   may be made available by AfDB through the proposed Institutional Support Project.

        Objective 1: Goodgovernance.

73.      Good govemance will be supported through four channels: the over-arching govemance
framework, decentralization, public financial management and public service reform.

        1.a. Governance Framework

74.      Government Budgeting and Accountability Act.           With the enactment o f the new
Government Budgeting and Accountability Act, the next step i s implementation. This will
require the adoption o f new regulations in support of the law.         Thus, the adoption of an
implementation plan for the revision o f regulations related to the Government Budgeting and
Accountability Act passed in February 2005 will be a trigger for the next operation. This work
will be supported by technical assistance from EC and the World Bank.

75.     Anti-corruption efforts. The Government has initiated several reforms aimed at fighting
corruption, including the passage o f an Anti-Corruption Act in 2000 and the establishment o f the
Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in the same year to investigate alleged or suspected
corruption. Since March 2004, the ACC has been implementing recommendations made in2002
for strengthening its operations. Investigative capacity has been improved by the recruitment o f
additional staff while the prosecution o f cases i s being expedited by the arrival o f three judges
and two prosecutors.     These efforts have begun to pay off:         the latest survey data from
Transparency International shows Sierra Leone has made some progress in the fight against
corruption. Still more needs to be done: Sierra Leone was 114th out o f 145 ranked countries in
2004.

76.      A proactive, preventive National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACS) was published in
February 2005. The adoption o f an acceptable strategy along with an accompanying detailed
implementation plan approved by the Cabinet i s a Program milestone. The implementation plan
should cover at least five key pilot ministries and should put emphasis on personnel
management, procurement, revenue collection and the dissemination o f information. The ACC
i s supported by DfD and GTZ.

77.      The Program supported by the proposed grant includes a number o f additional reforms
that will also contribute to anti-corruption efforts.    These include procurement reform, the
establishment o f intemal audit units, the publication o f clear and transparent procedures for the
divestiture o f public enterprises, the introduction o f model fiscal agreements for mining
operations and the introduction o f Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative principles into
miningpolicy. The details of each are summarizedinvarious sub-sections below.

        I,b.Decentralization

78.      As indicated in section V.B.l above, Government has appointed committee members to
the Local Government Finance Committee.            The adoption and promulgation o f the local
government transfer formulas by the committee i s a trigger for subsequent Development Policy
Operations due to the importance o fthe transfer formulas to the decentralizationprocess.




                                              - 19-

79.       N o w that the local councils have been established, additional work will need to be done
to bring them up to reasonable fiduciary standards. Thus, Government intends to help, with
assistance from the donor community, at least 5 local councils build capacity sufficient to meet
the conditions for accessing funds during 2005 specified by the Operational Manual for the Local
Government Development Grant facility. Support for decentralization i s provided by the World
Bank's IRCB project as well as DfID, EC and UNDP.

         I.c.PublicFinancial Management

80.       The proposed grant would support several aspects o f public financial management
reforms. These include planning and budgeting, procurement, accounting and auditing. Progress
will be monitored under the IRCB project and a pending Public Expenditure Review using
standard indicators developed by the multi-donor Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Secretariat.

81.       Planning and budgeting.22 The 2004 PER uncovered significant weaknesses in the
capacity o f the sector ministries to plan and budget.23 This will affect the ability to ensure that
the PRS i s well integrated into the budget framework for 2005-07. Under the proposed grant,
Government therefore agrees that key sector ministries and agencies will begin producing three-
year strategic budget plans with monitorable indicators, with the first such plans to cover 2006-
08. This milestone would be achieved in late 2005. This work is supported by technical
assistance from the EC for the ministries responsible for agriculture, education, health and public
works.

82.       As outlined in Section 1I.B above, Government will need to increase fiscal savings over
the next several years in order to maintain a high aggregate investment rate in the face o f falling
foreign savings. A t the same time, Government i s also facing pressures for wage increases. (See
sub-section below on public service reform.) As a consequence, Government will need to make
strategic decisions about key parameters o f the medium-term macroeconomic framework; trade-
offs between spending on personnel, recurrent goods and services and development expenditures
and trade-offs betweenkey ministries.

83.       This will require earlier and more frequent participation from the Cabinet inthe budget
process if the budget call circular i s to reflect Cabinet guidance.24 Thus, improvement in the
budget cycle i s an important milestone. The Cabinet will, in turn, require guidance from the
Ministry o f Finance on macroeconomic budget constraints and trade-offs. T o facilitate this, the
MOF will need to increase its capacity to operate simple macroeconomic models, analyze
economic indicators and produce reports.25




22Work related to the budget framework i s supported by the EC and the World Bank IRCBproject.
23ERRCI11included work onthe budget process and aimed for improvements inthe mediumterm expenditure
  framework. The 2004 PER found that some prerequisites for an MTEF were not yet inplace, namely strategic
  sector plans and a unified budget process encompassing personnel, other recurrent spending and development
  spending.
24This will also require earlier IMFmissions for the review o fthe macroeconomic framework.
25DfID expects to provide assistanceto the National RevenueAuthority andMOF for revenue forecasting.


                                                       - 20 -

84.      Procurement reform. While the Boards for the National Public Procurement Authority
and the Independent Procurement Review Panel were established in February 2005, it will now
be necessary to ensure these bodies are staffed and capable of performing their functions. Thus,
a trigger will require the Independent Procurement Review Panel and the National Public
Procurement Authody and its Secretariat to be adequately staffed and made operational in early
2005. Similarly, while procurement committees have been set up in key ministries, they will
now need to begin the work o f producing procurement plans for the 2006 budget year, to be
agreed with the MOF. These actions will be achieved with assistance provided by the World
Bank IRCB project, EC technical assistance and the UNDP.

85.       Public Accounts. Strengthening the capacity o f the Accountant-General's Department
(AGD)is vitally important. Several Programgoals are supported bythe proposedgrant:

    The Government advertised for the post o f Accountant-General and two deputies in
    December 2004. The next step i s to fill these posts.26 This i s a trigger for continued
    support.
    The financial       management accounting system (FMAS), installed in the AGD with the
    assistance of the European Commission, has enabled the Government to greatly improve
    accountability and transparency in the use of public funds. Recent diagnostic studies such as
    the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) have found, however, that the
    F M A S i s not fully functional and some o f the underlying components may soon fail. A
    decision has therefore been taken to replace the F M A S with a new Integrated Financial
    Management Information System (IFMIS) over 2004-05. A new chart o f accounts for the
    classification of revenues and expenditures, and at central and local levels, whether financed
    from domestic or external sources, is to be implemented as part o f the IFMIS. Installation
    and testing o f the IFMIS in the MOF (prior to its deployment for the 2006 budget year) and
    implementation o f the new chart o f accounts are key milestones.                           The work is already
    underway and i s supported by the Bank's IRCB project and EC technical assistance.
    The Ministry o f Finance produces ex-post reports o f poverty reducing expenditures but does
    not produce within year quarterlyreports. A milestone, to be achieved with IRCB assistance,
    i s the ability to produce quarterly reports for tracking poverty reducing expenditures by
    function in support o f the PRS.                It is expected that these will eventually be routinely
    publishedinthe Sierra Leone Gazette.

86.       Strengthen the internal audit function.               The intemal audit function has not been well
supported by the force o f law nor by adequate resources and talent. To rectify this, the new
Government Budgetingand Accountability Act allows the Minister o f Finance to require internal
audit units be set up in each ministry and it i s agreed this will be done.                            Monitoring the
implementation o f this aspect o f the Act i s therefore an important milestone:                       key MDAs will
have established functional intemal audit departments or units with staff operating under a Chief
Internal Auditor by the spring o f 2006 with all MDAs having achieved this by the end o f 2007.27


26The EC will support the recruitment o f an additional 10 qualified staff and accountants to assist and train the
  permanent public servants.
27The initial targets are likely to include the ministries for agriculture, defense, education, health and police.
  "Functional" is defined as two or more staff with a basic accounting qualification or better.


                                                           -21 -

In addition, an EC support program is expected to train vote controllers, heads of departments
and senior accounting staff on intemal auditing.

87.      Public expenditure tracking surveys (PETS) are another form o f intemal review and
these have been very useful in Sierra Leone.                    The PETS report on primary education, for
example, had a very positive impact on budgetary efficiency and public service delivery. The
completion and publication in the Sierra Leone Gazette o f the next PETS report on procurement
and distribution o f seed rice usingdata from 2003 i s an agreed milestone.*'

88.       Strengthen the external auditfunction. The Auditor-General and the MOF agreed on an
expenditure plan for staffing in early 2005. The next step i s to begin implementing the plan
through recruitment and improved accommodation for staff. Adequate progress, measured bythe
recruitment of at least 8 qualified professional staff in early 2006, i s a milestone to be carefully
monitored.29

        1.d.Public Service Reform

89.       Successful implementation o f the PRS requires adequate capacity in the sector
ministries.    That capacity, however, has been severely eroded by years o f weak governance
before the civil war and then by the war itself. To build capacity, the ministries need to recruit
more skilled staff and train others. As a matter o f expediency at the end o f the war, the donor
community reacted with ad-hoc solutions such as creating project implementation units and
paying for key government salaries from project funds. These solutions have not all been
productive and are not sustainable.             A more comprehensive solution to the recruitment and
retention issue is needed.            An important part o f the solution will be a more attractive
compensation package for staff. This implies a need for public service reform with strategic
decisions being made about salary structure, staff level and structure, and trade-offs between
paying for personnel, goods and services or in~estment.~'

90.       Inthis context, the PRSP commits Government to a number o f actions that will provide
a basis for additional reforms. These include i) the establishment o f a new Human Resources
Management Office; ii) a review o f public service grading and pay structure; iii) management
and functional reviews o f key ministries; iv) a review o f central policy making; v) new personnel
regulations; vi) the         development o f a new training policy; and vii) the development o f a
performance assessment ~ystem.~'

91.      There i s a general lack o f information, and therefore transparency, about the size and
composition o f the public service relative to the needs o f Government in the context o f the PRS
and the decentralization process. Many countries routinely publish this kind o f information as



28The PETS for seedrice is supportedby DfID andUNDP. Support for subsequent PETS is expected fromthe
  Bank's IRCBproject, DBD and UNDP.
29Additional institutional strengthening for the Office o f the Auditor-General i s expected to come from DfID.
30The Government has commissioned studies for Pay and Grading (CoEn May 2004) and the Senior Executive
  Service, No decisions based on either have been taken to date, perhaps because o f the cost implications.
3'These goals are supported by a DfID project. A preliminary review o f the pay and grading structure was made
  under a World Bank consultancy. UNDP has contributed to a review o f personnel regulations.

part of their annual budget speeches and include annual forecasts o f future needs. This i s not
done at present in Sierra Leone. This makes it difficult to take strategic decisions at the Cabinet
level on the trade-offs between personnel and other expenditures. To correct this situation, and
as a milestone for the next operation, Government agrees that the 2006 Budget Speech will
provide details o f personnel employment and expenditures for all MDAs and local councils for
2006 with notional estimates for 2007-08. An additional table for 2006 will summarize total
employment and salary ranges by grade. This data will also form a useful baseline for analysis
backing future reforms.

92.        Government also aims to better integrating manpower policies into the national budget
process.32 Inthis context, three planned reforms include legislation strengthening the mandate o f
the Establishment Secretary's Office (to be renamed the Human Resource Management Office),
the provision o f guidance on human resource policy to Ministries in the annual budget call
circular and the establishment o f annual formal manpower hearings as an integral part o f the
national budget process. Progress towards these goals are Program                       milestone^.^^   Government
also intends to develop a composite public service law that will provide the broader legal
framework for public service management and supporting institutions. Among other things, this
may include the formation o f a Senior Executive Service with performance based promotions and
remuneration.

           Objective 2: Pro-Poor growth andjob creation.

93.         The proposed grant will provide support for the broad PRSP objective o f job creation.
This will be achieved through improvements in the investment climate, divestiture and the
promotion o fminingactivity.34

94.        Business and investment climate. Job creation will be promoted through policy changes
aimed at improving the climate for investment and the entry o f new firms.                        Preliminary data,
however, show room for improvement in the regulatory side o f the business climate. The survey
conducted in Doing Business 2004, a World Bank Group publication, shows that Sierra Leone
does well with the number o f procedures required to start a business:                        nine step versus the
regional average o f eleven. On the other hand, the cost to register a business as a percent o f
income per-capita i s beyond the reach o f the common man if these fees are paid. Firmstherefore
often choose to remain in the informal sector. Sierra Leone requires eight procedures to transfer
a propertytitle from one business to another versus a regional average o f six.

95.        Beyond the new investment code mentioned above, business expansion andjob creation
would clearly be facilitated by the identification and elimination o f administrative barriers within
Government offices. T o this end, the Ministry o f Trade and Industry i s conducting a study o f
administrative barriers to trade and i n ~ e s t m e n t . ~The recommendations o f this study are
                                                                      ~


32The need to do so was flagged inthe 2002 CFAA and reconfirmedby the 2004 PER.
33 These goals will be supported by DfID as part o f its HumanResource Management Office project.
34 It i sacknowledged that the reduction o f rural poverty will require agricultural development and stronger
  urbadrural transport linkages. The Bank does not presently have an accompanying operation to underpinany
  potential agricultural program content inthe proposed operation..
35The Foreign Investment Advisory Service and DfID are providing support.

expected to be implemented by Government. Inaddition, the Ministry will establish an annual
Business Forum that would bring the private sector and Government together and allow a more
efficient dialog on needed reforms.           The Government has already setup a Law Reform
Commission which is, among other things, reviewing the scope o f important laws that were
regarded as binding for furthering the reform agenda and proposing amendments based on `good
 practice^'.^^   The Company Law i s being reviewed by a technical committee led by the Bank o f
Sierra Leone with the intention to simplify registration procedures and strengthen transparency
and d i s c l o ~ u r e .The same team i s preparing a new Bankruptcy Act. The revised legislation
                         ~ ~
would provide an institutional framework for corporate restructuring and exit mechanisms which
are a means for well functioning financial markets.38 Government also intends to begin drafting
a new law covering aspects o f competition policy in 2006.               Because o f their importance to
private sector development, bringing an acceptable Companies Act and Bankruptcy Act to
Parliament i s a trigger while progress towards a competition policy will be a milestone.

96.         Financing business start-ups and expansion i s another constraint on job creation. There
i s a general lack o f access to long-term bank credit in Sierra Leone. The capital market i s under-
developed and consists mainly o f short-term government debt instruments. Only a few company
equity shares have been issued and the only trading that has taken place has been the issue o f
rights that were issued in 2002 for a commercial bank and the capitalization o f a brewery in
2003. There i s strong anecdotal evidence that the lack o f access to credit and capital markets i s
constraining new business investments. This motivates another milestone: the initiation of a
Bank/Fund financed Financial Sector Assessment Program, upon request by the Government,
would help identify reform options for increasing access to long-term credit and capital for
business investments. In this light, it i s important to note that Government i s working o n the
development o f a Securities Act, the establishment o f a stock market and a venture capital
scheme to be supervised by the Bank o f Sierra Leone.39

97.         Reform of key public enterprises.        The poor management of several key public
enterprises has been a significant drag on the economy. Among these enterprises are the utilities
controlling the supply o f power, water and non-cellular telecommunications. Other choke points
include the public entities controlling most road maintenance and the port operations.                 In
recognition o f the problem, the Government set up a National Commission for Privatization
(NCP) in 2002 which is mandated to divest Government ownership and control over these and
other public enterprises. The Commission completed its divestiture plan in September 2003 and
issued a revised plan in December 2004.           The Budget Speech for the 2005 budget includes
several specific targets for divestiture and public enterprise reform.

98.         While Government i s committed to this element o f the Program, some additional
preparatory work i s required. Clear and transparent procedures for the sale, transfer or disposal
o f equity have not been published by the NCP. This lack o f transparency will inhibit serious
investors while encouraging those who might seek to take advantage. T o ensure transparency


36 This work maybe augmentedby the ongoing review of administrative barriers.
37 The Law ReformCommission is also reviewing laws relatedto property rights.
38 This work i s being supportedby the CommonwealthFundfor Technical Cooperation.
39 Assistance is provided by the CommonwealthFund and the multi-donor Financial Reformand Strengthening
   Initiative.

and accountability in these transactions, publication in the Sierra Leone Gazette o f acceptable
clear and transparent procedures will be a trigger.

99.       The transactions and reforms scheduled for 2005 are to include the National Power
Authority, the Sierra Leone Road Authority and the Sierra Leone Port Authority. Key aspects o f
these transactions will be reinforced by ERRGIV as outlined below.

    Power. One o f the most fundamental constraints on job creation and poverty reduction in
    Sierra Leone i s access to electric power. As o f 2003, there were no more than 42,069
    registered customers for the National Power Authority, most o f them in Freetown. Urban
    consumers therefore still rely to a surprising degree upon charcoal and kerosene for cooking
    and light while well-to-do families install their own generators. Electricity consumption in
    2004 was estimated to be only 55 kilowatt-hours per-capita compared to the regional average
    o f 495 kilowatt-hours per-capita and 8,503 kwwcapita in OECD countries. M u c h o f the
    problem can be traced to weak management: routine maintenance i s not performed and there
    are fundamental weaknesses inbilling and accounting procedures. It i s striking inthis regard
    that Sierra Leoneans pay one o f the highest tariff rates in the region at US$0.19per kilowatt-
    hour, yet this tariff i s not sufficient to cover costs due to inefficient operation^.^'

    This situation will be improved through the Bank's Power and Water project (Credit 39450)
    which includes components that will finance the upgrading o f the Kingtom power station in
    Freetown, rehabilitation o f the electrical grid and the establishment o f a management contract
    for the National Power Authority. 41 This i s a milestone. T o promote private participation in
    power generation, the project will also facilitate the drafting o f a new electricity law and the
    formation o f an independent regulatory agency.                   The achievement o f these two latter
    objectives i s a trigger due to their strategic importance to the future supply o f power.

    Road Maintenance. Only 8 percent o f the road network is paved, with the consequence that
    the remaining network i s under constant attack from annual rains and deterioration from
    normal use. Having usable roads promotes job creation and growth by holding down costs
    for both producers and consumers. By way o f example, poor roads in Uganda (where 7
    percent o f the road network i s paved) may boost farmer's costs by as much as 40 percent.
    These higher costs make it harder to hire additional labor. Usable roads also contribute to
    growth andjob creation by facilitating rural access to urban and world markets for the sale o f
    produce and the purchase o f inputs.42The poor condition o f the road network i s therefore a
    constraint on growth and poverty reduction. By contrast, road maintenance programs can
    help create jobs and reduce poverty.

    To promote better maintenance, the Government established a Road Maintenance Fund
    financed by a fuel levy. This fund suffers from poor management and a lack o f transparency.
    Severe under funding o f programmed maintenance has resulted from massive Government

  Government also aims to complete the Bumbuna Hydroelectric project.
42Usable roads also promote access to health clinics for rural families and access to education.

   demands for unprogrammed and emergency work and an inability to increase fuel levy
   funding,

   T o rectify the problem, Government i s committed to restructuring the SLRA. As part o f the
   preparatory work for the World Bank's proposed Infrastructure Development Project, an
   agreed Road Maintenance InstitutionalAction Plan i s being drafted.43 This plan includes:
   i ) refining the establishment o f the Road Maintenance Fund to limit its use to programmed
   maintenance, with the Fundmanaged and controlled by its own autonomous Board in lieu o f
   the current S L R A management; ii) the fundingo f all emergency road maintenance works will
   be by separate Government funding o f SLRA (with details drawn up under the Road
   Management Institutional Action Plan Study); and iii) the conversion o f the existing SLRA
   Mechanical Services Unit into an autonomous Mechanical Services Entity such that it i s
   separated entirely from SLRA and free to operate as a commercial plant hire company, hiring
   equipment to whoever has the money to hire its equipment, collecting revenue from all users
   o f its equipment; and reinvesting the revenue collected in procurement o f spare parts and
   replacement o f equipment.              Adoption o f these elements o f the Road Maintenance
   Institutional Action Plan i s a milestone.

   Ports. The cost o f doing business is also made higher than necessary by the inefficient
   operation o f the main port in Freetown. These extra costs reduce the ability o f firms to hire
   more workers. T o solve the problem, Government i s committed to the privatization o f non-
   core activities and the conversion o f the Sierra Leone Port Authority into a landlord port
   authority with technical regulatory powers. The following actions will be supported under
   the World Bank's Transport project and are included as a milestone: i ) SLPA will divest the
   ownership and control o f non-core activities o f the slipway and the ferry while port security
   will either be outsourced or restructured; ii) some port operations such as the container
   terminal concession and break-bulk operation will be privatized through concessions or
   licensing; and iii) SLPA will be restructured as a landlord port authority. This will require
   decisions about the kind o f port sector regulatory functions to be retained by SLPA and the
   design o f supporting regulatory or legislative changes.

100.     Metals and minerals development.               The production o f metallic, precious and semi-
precious minerals has historically been a potent source o f growth andjob creation in Sierra Leone
as well as a major generator of exports and government revenues. T o help reverse wartime
losses in large scale operations, it will be necessary to strengthen the investment climate and
improve the capacity to deliver key services to the mining community. In this light, several
ongoing initiatives in mining are to be supported through the proposed grant. These are detailed
below.

   The Ministry of Mineral Resources (MMR) and MOF agree to formulate and adopt an
   acceptable 5 year capacity building plan aimed at addressing the main technological and
   administrative constraints and issues that are adversely affecting mineral sector development.
   A key goal will be bringingMMRup to internationally competitive standards for the quality


43SLRA also benefits from a large EC program o f support amounting to 90 million for the rehabilitation and
  maintenance o f feeder roads and strengthening the capacity o f the Sierra Leone Road Authority.


                                                       - 26 -

   of regulation and services provided to investors and the miningcommunity. The designwork
   will be supported by ongoing assistance from DfD and a trust fund. This work will be the
   foundation for a metals and minerals development project inthe proposed CAS - included in
   the proposed CAS in response to a formal request from the Ministry o f Mineral Resources
   and endorsed by the Ministry o f Finance for assistance in developing an integrated mineral
   development program for support by the broader donor community. As such, this work i s
   included as a milestone. MMR will also benefit from EC support for the rehabilitation and
   restart o f operations by Sierra Rutile.

   The prior actions included steps aimed at the expansion o f the cadastral system and the
   extension services. Satisfactory progress on these two key areas o f the Program is therefore
   included as a trigger. The Ministry o f Finance will finance the recurrent costs o f operating
   the mining cadastre in the Kono District in 2005. MMR will maintain records o f mineral
   rights granted, denied, lapsed, renewed and transferred -- details should include type o f
   mineral right granted, owner, location, area, level o f production, fees and taxes due and paid.
   Expansion to the rest o f the nation, building on lessons learned in Kono, will follow in
   subsequent years.44 Government recognizes the importance o f extension services to poverty
   reduction through better methods o f production, increased safety and environmental
   responsibility. Government will therefore gradually begin providing a full range o f mining
   extension services across the nation in 2005.              MMRwill increase the number o f extension
   agents sufficiently      to allow them to visit each alluvial site at least once a month, with no
   more than 5 visits per agent per day in 2006 with 1,000 sites in Kono -- and no more than 3
   site visits per agent per day in2009 with approximately 2,000 sites nationally.

   The MMR will begin developing internationally competitive model investment agreements
   for investors and mine owners that will level the playing field, reduce the scope for
   discretionary policies and increase transparency. These agreements will govern investment,
   operation and taxation o f future mineral and metal activities. All preparatory fiscal work will
   be completed by March 2006, legal work will follow thereafter. This i s a trigger due to its
   importance in attracting serious investors, generating revenues and reducing the scope for
   discretion in mineral agreements. Assistance on fiscal aspects will be provided in late 2005
   by the IMF while the legal expertise required to initiate and sustain this work will be
   provided later with support from other members o f the donor community.

   The MMR adopted a new Core Mineral Policy in late 2003. The MMR has subsequently
   formed a technical sub-committee o f the Law Reform Commission to identify and propose
   changes in the legal and regulatory framework for consistency with the new Core Mineral
   Policy including implementation o f the Kimberly Process.45 Similar work will be requiredto
   implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to which Sierra Leone
   subscribes. Work on the Kimberly process will continue under existing funding. Work on
   the EITI will be supported by a dedicated EITI trust fund. Progress in this areas o f work i s
   included as a milestone.



44Technical assistance is expected to be provided by U N D P and DfID.
45DfIDare assisting the Law ReformCommission with this task.

        Objective 3: Human resource development.

101.     Education.46 The Government has made remarkable progress in doubling primary
school enrollments since 2001, to a current level o f roughly one million children. This success
can be attributed to efforts to increase the number o f usable schools, the abolition o f primary
school fees and feeding programs in the primary schools.                   Most recently, as part o f the
decentralization process, Government has devolved the District Education Schools (primary
schools) to the new local councils. This devolution will be guidedby the Education Act o f 2004
that coordinates the provision and regulation o f educational services.

102.     There is room for continued improvement, even after these substantial achievements.
For example, the actual enrollment o f pupils i s unknown:                 school censuses have not been
conducted on a regular basis for many years. Completing a census by the spring o f 2006 i s
therefore included as a milestone.

103.       Other areas where urgent improvements are needed include: the payment o f teachers
salaries and the distribution o f books, more delegation o f responsibilityand authority within the
Ministry,the promotion of school management committees with strong parental representation,
better statistical capacity for monitoring and planning purposes, better integration of planning
across educational levels via an enrollment and financial simulation model (the number o f
qualified teachers has not kept up with increases in enrollment), improved procurement systems,
stronger accounting and internal audit capacity and a computerized financial management system
including better payroll management.

104.     For the reasons above, the adoption o f a sector-wide development plan, following
Education for All / Fast Track Initiative standards in order to attract financial support, i s a
milestone. This sector i s currently supported by the Rehabilitation o f Basic Education Project
financed by the African Development Bank and the World Bank and by the Islamic Development
Bank.

105.     Health. Available date for Sierra Leone health outcomes suggest that a very strong
effort will needto be made. Matemal mortality rates, for example, are perhaps the highest inthe
region at approximately 2,000 deaths per 100,000 live births. The incidence o f tuberculosis is
also very high: roughly 628 cases per 100,000 people versus only 495 cases per 100,000 for the
region. HN/AIDS prevalence is low at 4.9 percent nationally but no basis for complacencywith
the Western Area prevalence at 6.1 percent.

106.     Under the PRS, the focus will be to increase access to a comprehensive package o f
affordable essential health care. The package will include the following: prenatal care and
delivery care; management o f high-risk pregnancies; well-baby services; vaccinations; family
planning; control o f priority communicable diseases, including malaria,                          tuberculosis,
Onchocerciasis (River Blindness) and Lymphatic filariasi, as well as HIV and other sexually
transmittedinfections; treatment for such common afflictions as diarrhea, respiratory infections;



46This sector is currently supportedbythe Rehabilitationo f Basic EducationProject financed bythe African
  Development Bank and the World Bank and by the Islamic Development Bank.

prevention of nutrition deficiencies, particularly amonginfants, young children, and pregnant and
lactating women. These services will be offered by decentralized entities through their primary
and secondary level health facilities in line with government's over-arching objective o f
decentralizing the provision o f basic services to the population. To support the development o f
these essential services, some priority areas o f tertiary care will be strengthened, especially for
the provision o f appropriate opportunities for the training o fhealthpersonnel.

107.      The success o f the health strategy outlined above will depend in part upon a well
functioning system for the distribution of essential drugs. The 2004 PETS report, however,
found serious and substantive book-keeping errors and losses in drug distribution based on data
from 2002.     To correct this situation, the Ministry o f Health is working with the European
Commission and the World Bank to reform the distribution o f drugs in the context of
decentralization. A particular feature o f the reform will be the ability o f the local councils and
hospital boards to procure from a semi-autonomous government body or from private suppliers.
Government has agreed that acceptable revised procedures will be published in the Sierra Leone
Gazette for an open and transparent distribution plan for health materials in 2005 including
essential drugs. In addition, to increase accountability, local councils will make public the
volume o f drugs to be obtained in 2005 by publishingin local papers and/or posting notices on
their noticeboards. From2006 onward, they will also publicize the amounts actually procuredin
each preceding year. Reforms in the distribution o f essential drugs are being supported by the
EC and Bank's Health Sector Reconstruction and Development Project. The achievement o f
these measures i s included as a milestone.

                         VI.     OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

                                 A.    Poverty and Social Impacts
108.      The proposed grant includes support for policies that are likely to have distributive
effects on the level and distribution o fpoverty. The data from the 2003/04 household survey and
pilot CWIQ show that the districts outside the Westem Area where the capital o f Freetown i s
located generally suffer higher levels o f poverty and reduced levels o f public services. The
support provided to the decentralization o f public services should therefore have the effect o f
reducing inequality. The data also show that those households relying primarily on mining
income are among the poorest of the poor.47 Thus, the support provided to the mining
community, particularly extension services, should help reduce inequality. The support for
privatization in the National Power Authority should help increase electricity supply and may
reduce costs, contributing directly to job creation and poverty reduction.          The support for
restructuring the SLRA to improve road maintenance should help reduce rural poverty, and thus
inequality, as farmers save costs on inputs and gain access to new markets. It is estimated that
farmers costs are increased as much as 40 percent inUganda where 7 percent o f the road network
i s paved. Further, road maintenance programs are often a good source ofjob creation.

109.      There were no empirical analyses available at the time this was written to assess the
distributional impact of the specific policies above. This will be redressed, at least inpart, with



47 Only farmingfamilies do worse.


                                                - 29 -

the completion o f a country economic memorandum and poverty assessment to be delivered in
FY06. The FY06-09 CAS may require a PSIA covering reforms in the power sector and in
mining. The PRSP calls for another household survey planned for 2008 as part o fits monitoring
and evaluation strategy. The PRSP monitoring and evaluation strategy also includes subsequent
rounds of the CWIQ which will be especially helpful in assessing the impact of decentralization.

                               B.      GrantAmount and Tranching
110.     The proposed grant will provide quick-disbursing support to the 2005 budget, to be
released in a single tranche o f US$15 million immediately upon effectiveness. Effectiveness and
release o f funds is justified by the maintenance o f an adequate macroeconomic policy framework
and by satisfactory completion o f the prior actions identified inthe ERRGIV program shown in
column 3 o f the Program Matrix (Annex 3).

                       C.      Implementation,Monitoringand Evaluation
111.     The administration o f this grant will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f Finance. T o
facilitate program implementation and the coordination o f activities, the Government has
appointed an inter-ministerial Steering Committee chaired by the Minister o f Finance. This
Committee is composed o f key Ministers and the Govemor o f the Bank o f Sierra Leone. The
Steering Committee will be assisted by a Technical Committee comprising high level staff from
various line ministries and the Bank o f Sierra Leone. The Technical Committee will be chaired
by the Financial Secretary and will be responsible for coordinating the activities o f all
Government agencies involved inprogram implementation.

112.     The Technical Committee will be responsible for monitoring the program and all
outcome indicators.     The Technical Committee will provide monthly reports to the Bank on
implementation progress measured against established timetables and agreed performance
indicators. These indicators can be found inthe Program Matrix inAnnex 3. The overall reform
effort will be reviewed by the Government in close coordination with regular Bank missions to
ensure continued implementation o f the program within an adequate macroeconomic policy
framework.

                                      D.     FiduciaryAspects
113.     Key documents for issues related to public resource management include the 2002
CFAA, 2004 HIPC AAP, 2004 PER, the corruption surveys from 2000 and 2002 andbackground
papers for the IRCB. As a consequence o f the issues raised, Government has embarked o n a
wide ranging series o f reforms including the establishment o f an Anti-Corruption Commission,
new legislation goveming public budgeting and accounting, strengthening the offices o f the
Accountant-General and Auditor-General, improved management information systems and a new
public procurement law. Some results are already beginning to show: Sierra Leone's score-in
the co'mption perception index prepared by Transparency International climbed to 2.3 in 2004
from 2.2 in2003.

114.     The Government is committed to these reforms and further deepening will be supported
as part o f a common action plan on Public Financial Management currently being negotiated by

Government, AfDB, DfID, EC, IMF and the World Bank.48 The plan includes actions designed
to strengthen the regulatory framework, such as passage o f the Government Budgeting and
Accountability Act; actions meant to improve the budget process such as capacity building for
strategic planning and budgeting in the sector ministries; procurement reform; better budget
execution (a new Integrated Financial Management Information System and chart o f accounts,
less arrears, minimal discrepancy between planned and actual spending et cetera); better internal
audit (including the establishment o f internal audit units in the line ministries); and better
external audit and accountability (including more trained staff in the Office o f the Auditor-
General).

115.       A safeguards assessment o f the Bank o f Sierra Leone was completed on September 26,
2001 by the IMF. The assessment concluded that substantial risks may exist in the financial
reporting framework. Corrective measures have been initiated within the prescribed timeframe.
An audit by an external firm is underway for 2003 and additional staff have been hired in the
Bank o f Sierra Leone's own Audit Department, including a qualified head. Computerization o f
record keeping is underway and will strengthen internal controls. The Bank o f Sierra Leone
needs to take additional steps towards implementation o f International Financial Reporting
Standards. The IMF staff continue to monitor measures with future deadlines.

                     E.      Disbursement,FinancialManagementandAuditing
116.       The proposed grant will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development
policy credits. The funds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the program
and will not be tied to any specific purchases. No procurement requirements are needed. Once
the grant i s approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds o f the grant will be
deposited by IDA in an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the
Bank o f Sierra Leone at the request o f the Borrower. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the
deposit o f the grant into said account, an equivalent amount i s credited in the Borrower's budget
management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank.

117.       The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency
account and credited to the budget management system. If the proceeds o f the grant are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Grant Agreement, then IDA will require the
Borrower to promptly refund to IDA an amount equal to the amount misspent. Amounts
refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

118.       Although an audit of the deposit account will not be required, the Bank reserves the right
to request an audit o f the receipt o f the disbursement through the deposit account and into the
budget management system of the Borrower at any time. Inthat event the Borrower would i)
report the exact sum received into the deposit account and its supporting details; ii) indicate to
the Bank details of the consolidated fund bank account to which the equivalent o f the
disbursement proceeds would have been transferred; and iii) submit a report on receipts and
disbursements for both the deposit account and the consolidated fund account to enable IDA to
review consistency o f the withdrawal with the development financing agreement and
achievement o f the objectives o f the operation.

                                   F.      EnvironmentalAspects
119.     The predecessor o f this operation, ERFK 111, was a structural adjustment credit govemed
by the environmental provisions o f the old Operational Directive 8.60. The proposed operation
i s subject to the new OPBP 8.60. The policies supported by the ERRGIV are not likely to have
any significant adverse effect on the country's environment, forests, and other natural resources.
Increased provision o f electricity, particularly from hydroelectric sources, could have the effect o f
reducing hydrocarbon emissions and reducing the rate o f deforestation, as charcoal, wood and
kerosene remain major sources o f urban energy consumption, although no formal impact studies
have been completed on this topic. The environmental implications o f the development o f the
miningsector are subject to the provisions o f the Mines and Minerals Act o f 1996 and National
Environment Protection Act, 2000.          There are, however, concems over the adequacy o f
regulation and on the institutional capacity to effect the legislation. A strategic environment
assessment o f the extractive industries including assessment o f institutional capacity in the
miningsector will be carried out inFY06 andthe recommendations of the review will informthe
broader country program. ERRG IV will, in the meanwhile via general budgetary support,
continue to reinforce the government's own capacity for assessing environmental issues and
implementing environmental assessment procedures under national regulation.

                                 G.       Risksand Risk Mitigation
120.     There is a risk that delayed or inadequate public services could exacerbate poverty and
possibly lead to social unrest. There i s another risk that triggers and milestones included in the
proposed grant may be completedpoorly or not at all. Both risks will be more likely to the extent
that predictable and adequate resources are unavailable or institutional capacity i s not improved.
There i s also a risk that macroeconomic instability could increase, leading to possible social
unrest and difficulties in the provision o f services. These three risks are rated medium. Finally,
there remains a low risk that conflict could spill over from neighboring countries. These risks
and mitigating design elements are explored below.

121.     Capacity. Weak capacity could put at risk the delivery o f essential public services
and/or the completion of various triggers and milestones. This risk i s ameliorated in two ways.
First, the choice and design o f prior actions and triggers has been calibrated to existing capacity
constraints.    Second, the achievement o f most agreed actions will be supported by ongoing
projects or technical assistance. These have been identified in advance and are cited throughout
Section V.C above.

 122.    Budgetary resources. The Government budget is heavily dependent upon external
assistance.     The predictability o f extemal budget assistance has generally been tied to
performance in meeting targets agreed to with various donors. The ability to meet some o f these
targets on time has been constrained by weak capacity. This risk is reduced by the adoption o f
the single tranche approach where funds are released immediately on the basis o f completed prior
actions. The risk posed by delays inthe programs o f other budget support donors will be reduced




                                                  - 32 -

as they also adopt the programmatic approach under a Framework for Multi-Donor Budget
support.49

123.     Other shocks. Stability could prove difficult to maintain either due to failure to
maintain fiscal discipline (perhaps due to wage pressures) or an external shock such as a
resumptiono f the upwardtrend incrude oil prices. This could impede the implementationo f the
poverty reduction strategy. This risk i s mitigated by the Government's commitment to a sound
mediumterm economic framework, supported under the Fund's PRGF, which sets spending at a
sustainable level that allows for some slippages in expected external aid.

124.     Conflict. Delays in disarmament and demobilization inneighboring Liberia could lead
to a spillover o f conflict into Sierra Leone. Conflict in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire could affect
trade or spill over into Sierra Leone. Tensions between Guinea and Sierra Leone over a section
o f disputed border could spark a confrontation. The extension o f the mandate o f U N A M S I L
through end-2005, albeit with a reduced presence, and the deployment o f a better equipped,
trained anddisciplined army and police force will mitigate these risks.

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn,


          FOURTH ECONOMIC REHABILITATION AND RECOVERY GRANT
                          LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY


1.      IamwritingonbehalfoftheGovernmentoftheRepublicofSierraLeonetorequestthat
you approve a fourth Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Grant (ERRG IV) inthe amount of
SDRl0 million (approximately US $15 million) to support the national development and poverty
reduction programme as articulated inthe full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which has been
prepared through wide-ranging national and international consultations, including civil society,
NGOs, parliamentarians, vulnerable groups, faith societies, the armed forces and the country's
international development partners (multilateral and bilateral donors). The PRSP i s anchored on
three main pillars: promoting good governance, peace and security; promoting pro-poor
sustainable economic growth,     food security and job creation; and promoting human
development,underpinnedbythe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

2.      This letter sets out practical policy objectives, actions and activities the Government will
undertake between now and March 2006, aimed at laying solid foundations for carrying forward
the development andpovertyreduction programme as detailed inthe PRSP.

3.      Mr.President, with strong support from the World Bank andother development partners,
the Government has made significant progress in addressing the most immediate post conflict
challenges,   including disarmament, demobilization, resettlement and reintegration. The
Government is now poised to make dramatic progress beginning in 2005 in rebuilding the
country by transiting from post conflict emergency relief to sustainable growth and development.
The Grant will particularly focus on building transparent and decentralized governance;
improving public financial management and capacity building; scaling up o f public and private
investments; strengthening service delivery and domestic resource mobilization; and promoting
private sector development.


                     BACKGROUNDAND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS


ConsolidatingPeace and Security

4.      The civil war was officially declared over in January 2002 and the entire country is now
accessible. Government has subsequently made significant progress in strengthening peace and
security to facilitate the smooth transition from post conflict situation to high growth and
sustainable development. The Disarmament,             Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR)
programme was concluded in February, 2004. A total o f 72,490 combatants were disarmed and
71,043 demobilized including 6,845 child soldiers. By end February 2004, 55,122 ex-combatants
had received support for reintegration into active community life. Virtually all Internally
Displaced Persons (IDPs), returnees and refugees have beenresettled.

5.      National presidential and parliamentary elections were successfully held inMay 2002. A
Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established to enhance peace building and political
reconciliation. The Commission successfully concluded its work in June 2004 and Government
i s committed to implementing the recommendations o f the Commission. A Special Court,
sponsored by the United Nations was also established in 2003 to prosecute those that `bear the
greatest responsibility for the war atrocities' and trials are ongoing. With support from the United
Kingdom, the Sierra Leone Police i s beingrestructured, focusing on manpower development and
logistics. The restructuring o f the Sierra Leone Army i s also progressing satisfactorily with the
aim o f enhancing operational efficiency.       The UN Peace Keeping Mission in Sierra Leone
(UNAMSIL) will phase out by end-December 2005. Government will need adequate funding to
continue to train and equip the police and military forces.




                                                 - 35 -

Local Government and Decentralisation

6.      Government has adopted decentralization as a key strategy for improving service delivery
and reducing poverty in the context o f PRSP implementation. The Local Government Act 2004
reinstatedthe decentralization o f governance and a democratic local government system that was
dissolved for 32 years. Local Government elections were held in 2004. All o f the 19 Councils
are now fully operational, largely funded by the World Bank-supportedInstitutional Reform and
Capacity Building (IRCB) project. A devolution plan was developed including a phased fiscal
decentralization plan commencing in fiscal year 2005 to facilitate the transfer o f functions from
line ministries to local councils. The devolution plan i s aimed at improving service delivery at
the grass roots level.

The Macro Economy

7.      Since the onset o f peace and in spite o f the adverse developments inthe world economy,
Governmenthas been pursuingprudent macroeconomic policies and implementing wide ranging
structural reforms to stabilize the economy and lay the foundation for sustainable economic
growth and poverty reduction. Economic growth has remainedrobust inrecent years, reflecting
broad recovery in key sectors including agriculture, mining, construction, manufacturing and
services. Real GDP grew by 9.3 percent in 2003 from 27.5 percent in 2002. The economy i s
estimated to have expanded by 7.4 percent in 2004.           Inflation fell sharply in 2001. It was
negative in most o f 2002 and was contained at single digits in 2003. However, inflationary
pressures re-emerged in 2004 owing to initially from the rise in the price o f petroleum products
and rice and later to an expansionary monetary policy and the depreciation o f the exchange rate
o f the Leone to the US dollar. The average inflation rate rose sharply from 7.5 percent at the end
o f December 2003 to 14.2 percent at the end-December 2004.

8.      Budgetary management in recent years was very challenging due to fiscal pressures from
shortfalls in donor disbursements. Even though revenue collection was broadly on target, the
degree o f fiscal adjustment was not always sufficient to compensate for the delays inexternal aid.
This requiredperiodic recourse to domestic financing, mainly from the banking system. This in
turn has led to a larger than targeted increase in the stock o f domestic debt and increased the
interest burden.

9.      Monetary policy during2003-2004 largely reflected developmentson the fiscal front. The
increase innet bank credit to Government, partly due to shortfalls in donor disbursement,ledto a
sharp increase in money supply. Broad money rose by 19.2 percent during 2004. Interest rates
on the three-month treasury bills rose to 28 percent at end December 2004 from 20.2 percent in
December 2003, reflecting higher Government borrowing andthe rise ininflation.

10.     Recorded exports f.o.b., largely diamonds, increased significantly during the period.
Total diamond exports rose from US$ 76 million at end 2003 to US$ 127 million at end
December 2004. Imports f.o.b.,       however, remained high on account o f the continuing
reconstruction activities and higher oil prices. Owing mainly to the strong export performance in
2004, the trade deficit narrowed to US$94.4 million from US$ 148.5 millionin2003.



                                                - 36 -

11.     After remaining relatively stable during 2001-2002 and the first half o f 2003, the
exchange rate depreciated by about 15 percent from an annual average o f L e 2,348 to the U S
dollar in 2003 to L e 2,691 in 2004, due to increasing foreign exchange demand as economic
activities expanded, combined with a significant reduction in supply o f foreign exchange
following the scaling down o f U N A M S I L and NGO activities.


StructuralPoliciesand InstitutionalReforms


12.     In addition to the relative success in the continued maintenance of macroeconomic
stability, significant progress was also made in the implementation o f structural reforms,
supported by the Third Economic Recovery and Rehabilitation Credit (ERRC 111), especially in
the areas o f public financial management, good governance, domestic revenue mobilisation and
private sector development.


     0  ImprovingGovernance

13.     Government recognises the need to strengthen governance and transparency in order to
ensure the prudent management of public resources. To this end, the Government established the
Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in 2001. The Commission was charged with the
responsibility o f investigating allegations o f corrupt practices in both the public and private
sectors. Since March 2004, Government has endeavoured to strengthen the enforcement capacity
o f the    Anti-Corruption    Commission by supporting the          implementation o f    several
recommendations contained in a review o f the organizational structure and activities o f the
Commission. The Education and Prevention wings o f the Commission have achieved greater
public awareness of the implications of corrupt practices. The support provided by DfID, UK in
the form o f two High Court Judges and two principal investigators and a senior investigator to
expedite alleged corruption cases have yielded 8 convicted cases within 9 months and limitingto
4 weeks duration o f alleged cases in the High Courts. A National Anti-Corruption Strategy was
completed with support by DFIDUK and was launched inearly February this year.


     0   StrengtheningPublicFinancialManagement

14.     Government also recognises that the transparent and accountable use o f public resources
i s a key requirement to restore public trust. To deepen the implementation o f the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) introduced in 2001,MTEF guidelines were prepared, approved
by Cabinet and circulated to all ministries,departments and other Government agencies MDAs in
August 2003. These guidelines stressed the importance o f strategic planning in the budget
process, which includes setting output/outcome (performance) indicators for MDAs to monitor
improvements in the delivery o f public services. Participation in the budget preparation and
execution has been broadened to include Cabinet Ministers, vote controllers, professionals and
programme managers in line ministries, civil society representatives, and NGOs. District Budget
Oversight Committees have been established with the collaborative efforts o f the Paramount



                                                - 37 -

Chiefs and Community representatives to fully participate in all stages o f the budgetprocess. The
Parliamentary Finance Committee also participates in the budget preparation and provides
oversight responsibilities inits execution.

15.    The World Bank incollaborationwith DFID conducted a limited scope Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in 2001, which identified the strengths and weaknesses o f
the financial management system and recommended ways to further improve financial
accountability, including the enabling legislation - the Public Budgeting and Accounting Act o f
1992 (amended 1996). To address the deficiencies, a new Government Budgeting and
Accountability Act was enacted inFebruary 2005. The principal objective o f the Act i s to secure
transparency, accountability and sound management o f the budget, assets and liabilities o f the
Government.

16.     Government i s aware that the successful implementation o f the pro-poor policies
articulated in the poverty reduction strategy requires an improved Public Financial Management
(PFM) system. With support from DFID, two diagnostic studies were conductedon the Financial
Management and Accountability System (FMAS) in the Accountant General's Department and
Chart o f Accounts in 2003. The results o f the study showed that the F M A S lacked
functionalities, such as automated bank reconciliation, user defined reports, audit trails and
screen viewing. T o address these problems, a new IntegratedFinancial Management Information
System (IFMIS) i s currently being developed to replace the FMAS. The IFMIS will meet the
control and information requirements o fthe decentralized system o f financial management.

17.    Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) are being conducted on an annual basis to
enhance transparency and accountability inthe management o f public resources. The third public
expenditure tracking survey for FY02 data was conducted in October 2003 to track the flow o f
school fees subsidy and teaching and leaming materials in the education sector and the
distribution o f essential drugs inthe health sector. The forth PETS for FY03 data was conducted
inSeptember 2004. The survey covered the distribution of: seed rice for the agricultural sector;
essential drugs for the health sector; and furniture for the educational sector. Government has
developed an Action Plan to facilitate the implementation o f the key recommendations from the
PETS. A Public Procurement Act 2004 has also been enacted with support by the World Bank
and UNDP, aimed at ensuring efficiency and value-for-money in public procurement. The Act
provides, among other things, for decentralized procuring entities including Local District
Councils, which will dictate their own procurement needs.



    0  PromotingPrivateSector Development

18.    Government's poverty reduction strategy recognises the leading role o f the private sector
in promoting economic growth and poverty reduction. To support private sector development,
Government in consultation with all stakeholders, has developed a transparent and competitive
Investment Code based on international best practice. The Code was promulgated into law in
2004.    A National Commission for Privatization (NCP) was established to implement
Government's divestiture programme, aimed at promoting operational efficiency o f public


                                                - 38 -

enterprises with a view to making them financially viable, better service providers and less
dependent on Government subsidies. This process ensures providing a scope for the private
sector to participate in the provision o f goods and services hitherto the preserve o f the public
enterprises, thus generating competition that should lead to better quality and lower prises. The
public enterprises include two commercial banks, several hotels, the national ports and power
authorities, and the information and broadcasting services. A joint venture company has been
established to transfonn the National Workshop into an economic and trade zone. Government
has also commenced a gradual adjustment o f tariffs as part o f the consolidation o f the ECOWAS
Common External Tariff programme.

The NationalPovertyProfile

19.      The results of the 2003/04 Integrated Household Survey indicate that poverty in Sierra Leone is
pervasive and deep-seated.About 70 percent of the population i s poor, while 26 percent lives in extreme
poverty. The total consumption expenditure of the poor i s 29 percent below the amount requiredto meet
basic needs. Poverty in the other urban areas outside Freetown i s also high with the poverty incidence
equal to the national average of 70 percent and 20 percent of the people in these areas also live in
extreme poverty. Freetown with a poverty incidence of 15 percent recorded the lowest proportion of the
poor. Interms of the distribution of poverty by districts, the poorest districts in order of the incidence of
poverty are Kailahun, Bombali, Kenema, Bonthe and Tonkolili. More than 8 out of 10 people in these
districts live inpoverty.

20.      Poverty i s heavily concentrated in the rural areas where nearly 80 percent of the people
are poor compared to 54.3 percent for the urban population5'. About one-third o f the ruralpoor in
Sierra Leone live in extreme poverty. With the exception o f Bonthe, Kambia and Koinadugu, the
incidence o f poverty i s relatively higher in the rural areas o f all the other districts. Kenema,
Kailahun, Bombali, Port Loko and Tonkolili districts have the highest incidence o f rural poverty.
Poverty i s also more severe in the rural areas with a severity index o f 17 percent compared to 11
percent in the urban areas. The rural areas contribute nearly 73 percent to total poverty,
exceeding their population share o f 64.4 percent.

21.      The incidence o f poverty i s highest in the agricultural sector with about 76 percent o f
those engaged inthe sector being poor. The second poorest group by sector are those households
where mining i s the main income. At 73 percent, the incidence of poverty i s extremely high
among households whose heads have no education

22.     Recent UNDP Human Development Reports show that Sierra Leone's social indicators
reflect an extremely low level o f human development. Life expectancy at birth declined to 34.3
years in 2002 from 42 years in 1990 and i s the third lowest compared to the average for Sub-
Saharan Africa.. Literacy rates and school retentionrates are also very low. At 31 percent, Sierra
Leone's adult literacy rate is one of the lowest in the world. Infant and maternal mortality rates
are about the highest in the world. Malaria and tuberculosis are prevalent and widespread. In
2002, infant and under-five mortality rates were estimated at 165 and 284 deaths per 1000 live
births compared to 185 and 323 respectively in 1990. The maternal mortality rate during 1985-
2002 was estimated at 1800 deaths per 100,000 live births. The status for other MDGs such as
reducing the proportion o f people suffering from extreme hunger, increasing access to safe
drinkingwater, and combating the spread o f communicable diseases and HIV/AIDS is o f a major
concern to the Government. The HIV/AIDS epidemic poses a particularly serious challenge for
the country. The estimated national prevalence o f HIV/AIDS i s 4.9 percent; the Western Area
has the highest, at 6.1 percent.

23.     Income distribution i s also heavily skewed in Sierra Leone. An estimated 10 percent o f
the population with the highest income accounts for 30 percent o ftotal consumption expenditure,
whereas the poorest 10percent accounts for only 2.7 percent o f aggregate consumption.

24.     The major causes o f poverty in the rural areas according to the qualitative data from the
Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs) and the Civic Engagement are mainly:the wide gap in
the availability o f social services (health, education, safe water and sanitation) between the urban
and rural areas; lack o f agricultural inputs, market access and low incomes from the sale of
produce; weak infrastructure (poor trunk and feeder road networks, lack o f storage facilities);
lack o f economic and employment opportunities; and a variety o f social barriers including large
family sizes within the rural communities and a high dependency rate at the household level.
Poverty in the country i s also the result o f a combination o f inappropriate domestic policies and
adverse external developments over many years. These factors, combined with bad governance
and the devastating effect of the decade-long civil war, resulted in weak economic growth, high
unemployment, poor service delivery, and social exclusion and marginalisation o f a significant
proportion o f the population, especially inrural areas.



The PovertyReductionStrategyPaper

25.     T o reverse the pervasive and high incidence o f poverty and its underlying causes, and
make significant progress towards the MDGs, Government has prepared a comprehensive
poverty reduction strategy with appropriate macroeconomic, structural and sectoral policies,
measures and institutional reforms in the context o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP). As indicated earlier, the PRSP, which was prepared through extensive nationwide
consultations and in collaboration with the Government's development partners including the
World Bank, i s anchored on three mainpillars, viz:

(i)Promoting good governance, peace and security
(ii)Promoting pro-poor sustainable growth for food security andjob creation


                                                 - 40 -

(iii)Promoting human development

26.     These pillars are closely interrelated and mutually reinforcing to enhance their impact and
effectiveness inthe fight against poverty while attaining the MDGs.

27.     The first pillar i s influenced by the recent emergence o f the country from a brutal conflict
that reduced the capacity for state governance and security. The people's assessment of the
poverty situation has emphasised various aspects o f bad governance as one o f the main causes o f
their deepening poverty. Consolidation o f peace and nation-wide reconciliation are also expected
to provide the enabling environment for the transition to medium and longer-term development.
The security sector, including the military, police, prisons, intelligence coordination and
immigration, will be restructured and enhanced to ensure internal and extemal security, while
preventing the recurrence of military coups.

28,      The second pillar emphasises the continued implementation o f sound economic policies
to attain macroeconomic stability and a more favourable environment for private sector
development. Pro-poor economy-wide and sectoral growth i s critical to strengthening food
security systems for the poor andjob creation opportunities, especially for the growing number o f
unemployed and underemployedyoung men and women inthe urban and rural areas. There i s the
need therefore to re-organise and re-invest in sectors that both promote broad -based economic
growth and bring benefits to a larger number o f the poor.

29.      The third pillar underscores the point that poverty reduction must be underpinned by
investment in human resources. Rational investment in the health and education o f the
population and increasing access to basic services provide the basis for enhancing the capacities
o f the poor and reducing their vulnerability for sustained poverty reduction. This will also
accelerate progress towards the MDGs.

30.      The full PRSP has been submitted for your consideration. W e are confident that its
implementation will help Sierra Leone reach its completion point under the enhanced H P C
initiative, thereby accessing the much needed debt relief for promoting the fulfilment o f the
PRSP agenda.

Medium-Term Challengesand EconomicStrategy for 2005-2007

31.      Mr.President, as a post-conflict country, Sierra Leone's developmentneeds are immense
despite the significant progress made so far in addressing the immediate post conflict challenges.
Apart from economic growth, our experience in the last three decades o f progressive economic
and social decline means that the continued strengthening o f peace, security and governance i s
critical for underpinning economic confidence. The President o f the Republic o f Sierra Leone in
his Address on the Occasion o f the State Opening o f Parliament delivered inJune 2004, assured
Sierra Leoneans of his government's commitment to the tenets and aspirations o f the poverty
reduction strategy for sustaining peace and security, ensuring higher growth and rebuilding the
nation. Government's medium-term strategy in the context o f the PRSP will therefore focus on
the following key areas:



                                                  -41 -

(i)     consolidating peace, security and good govemance;
(ii)    sustaining highreal growth and a stable macroeconomic environment;
(iii) raisingsavingsandinvestment;
(iv)    scaling up spending ininfrastructure and ensuringgreater effectiveness;
(v)     promotingprivate sector development and private sector- ledjob creationby further
        liberalizing the trade regime and pursuingthe divesting strategy; and
(vii)   implementing sectoral reforms aimed at improving strategy;
(viii) improved management ofpublic resources.

32.     Considerable resources and strong policies will be needed to advance the strategy. Thus,
while continuing to rely on enhanced donor resources, Government will aim at reaching the
country's full revenue potential, including mineral revenues.


Medium-term Macroeconomic Objectives and Policies

33.     The medium-term macroeconomic framework (2005-07) projects the economy to grow
by 6.5 - 7.5 percent per annum during 2005 - 2007. The rise inGDP is expected to come from
expansion in agricultural activities as the food security programme takes hold; expansion in
mining activities, public investment infrastructure projects and broadly sound macro-economic
management. Inflationi s expected to revert to low single digits. 'Average inflationi s projected to
fall from 8.5 percent in2005 to 5.7 percent in2007. This will be achieved through the pursuit o f
prudent and complimentary fiscal and monetary policies. Domestic revenue is projected to
increase from 13 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 15.8 percent in 2007. Total expenditure and net
lending will average 25 percent of GDP during the period. The overall budget deficit, including
grants, i s projected to fall from 4.0 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 2.2 percent o f GDP in 2007.
Domestic financing of the deficit i s programmed to decline from 0.9 percent o f GDP to a net
repayment to the banking system o f 0.9 percent over the same period. The current account
deficit, includingofficial transfers i s expected to narrow down from 8.0 percent o f GDP in 2005
to 4.8 o f GDP in 2007 following the resumption o f rutile and bauxite exports and the gradual
reduction in reconstruction imports. Gross foreign reserves of the Bank o f Sierra Leone are
programmed to rise to just over 3 months o f imports cover by 2007.


    0   Fiscal Policy

34.     Government's medium term fiscal strategy aims at achieving a more sustainable fiscal
position in order to address the emerging domestic debt problem and support macroeconomic
stability.  A key objective o f fiscal policy in the medium is also to phase out the domestic
financing o f the budget deficit.      Fiscal Policy will continue to be driven by measures to
rationalize the tax system; and strengthen control over spending while reorienting expenditures
towards investment and poverty reduction.

35.     Several new tax measures are for 2005:           new taxes on local telephone calls, the
reimposition o f a 17.5 percent sales tax, a 30 percent excise tax o n tobacco products, the
elimination o f some exemptions such as' a zero rated import duty for raw materials, the


                                                - 42 -

imposition o f excise duty on older vehicles and various fee increases. The Government i s also
establishing a National Tax Fraud Unit.

36.     Inthe medium term, Government will focus on domestic revenue mobilization so as to
reduce the heavy reliance on external budgetary support. In an effort to broaden the tax base,
Government intends to introduce the Value-Added Tax (VAT) by 2007.                Government will
establish model tax and investment agreements for the mineral sector and incorporate the
projected revenues for active mineral projects into the medium-term revenue framework.
Government will sustain efforts to minimise revenue leakages through the elimination o f
discretionary tax and duty exemptions and strengthen the anti-corruption drive o f the National
Revenue Authority.

37.     Increased revenues, and expected declines in domestic interest due, will allow
Government to make a modest expansion in development expenditures in 2006 and 2007 and a
reduction in the deficit. The fiscal deficit, after grants i s expected to improve to 2.2 percent o f
GDPby2007 from an estimated deficit o f4.0 percent o f GDPin2005.

38.     The Government also intends to create a buffer against delays inbudget support from any
of the four budget support donors. This will be achieved by discounting the level o f budget
support inthe macroeconomic framework and by following a fiscal rule where spending does not
exceed the discounted envelope unless the full amount o f aid i s actually received.


    0   Monetary Policy And Financial Policies

39.     Monetary and financial policies in the medium-term will continue to aim at subduing
inflation and maintaining positive real interest rates in order to promote domestic savings and
ensure efficient allocation o f financial resources.

40.     Within the medium-term macro economic framework, broad money is projected to
expand on average by 12 percent over the next 3 years to 2007. The Bank o f Sierra Leone will
manage its net domestic assets to achieve these targets whilst at the same time ensuring that
sufficient credit o f a longer term nature i s available to the private sector to support economic
recovery andjob creation.

41.     To further improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Bank will continue to adjust
the statutory reserve requirements o f the commercial banks to control the excess liquidity in the
system. This requirement will be extended to foreign currency deposits. It will also seek to make
the open market operations more effective by introducing a wide range o f securities and
strengthen its monetary operations. In this respect, securities repurchase agreements (REPOs)
and dematerialized form o f government securities will be introduced inthe medium-term.

42.     Development of an efficient payments system to foster monetary policy operations will
continue to receive the attention o f the central bank inthe short and medium term. The Bank will
pursue modernization o f the national payments system by developing a payments system
framework and strategy that will encompass a comprehensive review o f legislation, rules,



                                                 - 43 -

regulations and procedures in support of the system. These reforms will also be undertaken
within the framework o f the proposed harmonization o f national payments systems inthe West
African MonetaryZone (WAMZ).

43.     The main objective of financial sector reforms in the medium term i s to ensure a
competitive and efficient financial sector to support private sector development. Inthe medium
term, B S L will intensify supervision and regulation o f commercial banks and strengthen
prudential controls. The B S L will also seek to improve credit risk assessment capacity o f
commercial banks and establish a Credit Bureau to improve the flow o f information on current
and potential bank clients. Government i s also exploring the establishment o f a stock exchange.

    0   Trade and Exchange Rate Policies

44.     The medium term objective o f trade policyis the adoption ofthe Common External Tariff
(CET) as part o f the consolidation of the ECOWAS integration process. The adjustment o f tariff
to the CET will be implemented in three phases. The first phase has already commenced from
January 2005. Sierra Leone has already submitted its CET harmonizationplan to ECOWAS.

45.     Government i s committed to maintaining a liberalized trade regime and a market
determined exchange rate to promote and diversify exports. The flexible exchange rate system
will continue to be centred on the weekly foreign exchange system though efforts are underway
to develop an inter-bank foreign exchange market


    0   ExternalDebtPolicy

46.     The Government will continue to maintain a prudent external debt policy and i s
committed not to contract or guarantee non-concessional external loans. It will continue its
efforts to seek from the non-Paris Club bilateral and private creditors' debt relief on terms
comparable to those granted by Paris Club Creditors. In the medium term, Government's key
objective i s to eliminate the external debt overhang and its associated debt service burden, which
crowds out private investment as well public expenditures in the social sectors. Regarding
commercial creditors, the Government i s engaging them with a view to rescheduling the verified
arrears over along period o f time, but so far it has met with only limited success. Inan effort to
maintain credibility, Government will complete due diligence and identify all valid outstanding
commercial claims and adopt an acceptable plan for their elimination. This will include a second
debt buy-back operation.


   FOURTH ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND REHABILITATION GRANT (ERRGIV)


47.     Mr.President, the resources we seek fromthe IDAunderthe proposedcredit will be used
to finance the poverty reduction programmes articulated in our Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper. The resources will also be used to support Sierra Leone's weak balance o f payment and
thus facilitate the importation of essential imports required for the continuing reconstruction
activities. The proceeds o f the grant will also assist in reducing domestic financing especially



                                                - 44 -

from the banking system to fund critical poverty reduction programmes, thereby help in
maintaining macro economic stability. The proposed grant will also assist Government to further
the implementation o f structural reforms in support o f our three PRSP pillars: (a) good
govemance; (b) pro-poor growth andjob creation; and (c) human development.

Good Governance


    0   Governance Framework

 48.    Government recognizes that the transparent, accountable and efficient use o f public
 resources i s a pre-requisite for the effective implementation o f government's poverty reduction
 strategy. T o improve the quality o f govemance and ensure the proper use o f public funds,
 Government will complete a credible implementation plan for the National Anti-Corruption
 Strategy. The plan will include resources and capacity building to reduce corrupt practices in
 personnel management, procurement and revenue collection.

 49.    Government has also enacted, in February this year, a new Government Budgeting and
 Accountability Act that sets out clear rules for the proper management o f public resources. T o
 ensure strict adherence to the provisions o f the new Budgeting and Accountability Act, an
 implementation plan for the revision o f regulations supporting the Act is being developed and
 will be adopted.


    0   Fiscal Decentralization

 50.    A s mentioned earlier, Government has adopted decentralization (both political and fiscal)
 as a key strategy for poverty reduction. T o facilitate the decentralization process, Government
 appointed six o f seven members to the Local Government Finance Committee inFebruary 2005
 in accordance with the Local Government Act. Approval by Parliament o f the appointment o f
 the seventh required committee member i s expected by end-May or sooner. Furthermore, as a
 demonstration of its commitment to transparency and accountability in fiscal decentralization,
 Government has published the details o f local government transfers to local councils in the
 Sierra Leone Gazette.       While there are many activities associated with the process o f
 decentralization, one of them i s capacity building. T o this end, Government intends that all
 Local Councils will meet the minimum conditions for grant disbursements under the Local
 Government Development Grant Manual.            It is expected that at least 5 Councils will achieve
 this byMarch2006.



    0   Budget Process

 51.    Government i s facing the challenge o f implementing the PRSP and increasing the rate o f
 investment in the face o f wage increases.        This will require strategic decisions about the
 medium-term macroeconomic framework and the kinds o f trade-offs required for a well
 functioning MTEF process.        These decisions are best made by the Cabinet.          Government
 therefore proposes to invite earlier and more frequent participation from the Cabinet in the


                                                 - 45 -

budget process. T o further deepen the MTEF process and promote strategic planninginMDAs,
the Ministries o f Agriculture, Education, Health, Mineral Resources, Transport, Works and
Defence will begin to prepare 3 year strategic budget plans. The plans will clearly indicate the
MDAmissionstatement, list o fobjectives andmonitorable indicators.


   0   Public Procurement

52.    T o ensure the effective utilization o f public resources and eliminate leakages and
wastage, Government has established procurement committees in key ministries including
Agriculture, Education, Health, Mineral Resources, Transport, Works, Defence and the Sierra
Leone Police. The procurement plans for these key ministries, and the Sierra Leone Road
Authority, will be completed for the 2006 budget. Government has also established the Boards
for the National Public Procurement Authority and the Independent Procurement Review Panel
in accordance with the Procurement Law. These two bodies will be staffed and made
operational in2005.


   0   Internal and ExternalAudit

53.    T o strengthen the capacity o f the Accountant General's Department, the Ministry o f
Finance in collaboration with the Establishment Secretary's Office will develop a capacity
buildingplan for the AGD. The plan will indicate immediate and long-run staffing needs o f the
Department and the associated costs.         As a first step, in December 2004, Government has
advertised positions for the post o f the Accountant General and two deputies. These posts will
be filled in 2005. To further strengthen the AGD, the new IFMIS and the new chart o f accounts
are to be installed and tested in 2005.        This will allow the AGD and MOF to issue routine
quarterly reports, includingthose for poverty reducing expenditures by function.

54.     Similarly, in February of this year, to enhance the audit capacity o f Government, the
Ministryo fFinanceandthe Auditor General's office have agreedon a medium-term expenditure
plan for the short- to long-term requirements o f the Audit Service and the associated costs. By
the start o f 2006, it i s expected that the Office o f the Auditor-General will recruit at least 8 audit
staff with professional accounting qualifications.

55.    The new Government Budgeting and Accountability Act allows the Minister o f Finance
to require internal audit units be set up in each ministry. By late 2005 or early 2006, key
ministries including Agriculture, Education, Health, Mineral Resources, Transport, Works,
Defence and the Sierra Leone Police will have established functional internal audit departments
or units with staff operating under a Chief Internal Auditor. It i s expected that all MDAs will
have achieved this by the end o f 2007. Government will also continue to conduct annual Public
ExpenditureTracking Surveys (PETS).


   0   Public ServiceReform

56.    To build capacity, the ministries need to recruit and retain more skilled staff and train
others. A comprehensive solution i s needed to the recruitment issue. An important part o f the



                                                  - 46 -

solution will be a more attractive compensation package for staff. Government therefore intends
to undertake a number o f reforms that will lay the foundation for a more robust public service.
The medium-term goals include the transformation o f the Office o f the Establishment Secretary
into a Human Resources Management Office, a review o f public service grading and pay
structures, a review the management o f key ministries, new personnel regulations, the
development o f a new training policy and the development o f a performance assessment system.
The immediate plans for 2005 and early 2006 include progress towards legislation for the
Human Resource Management Office, the provision o f guidance on human resource policy to
Ministries in the annual budget call circular and the establishment o f annual formal manpower
hearings as an integral part o f the national budgetprocess.

57.    The 2006 Budget Speech will provide details o f personnel employment and expenditures
for all MDAs and local councils for 2006 with notional estimates for 2007-08. An additional
table for 2006 will summarize total employment and salary ranges by grade. This data will
enhance transparency and form a useful baseline for analysis backing future reforms.

PromotingGrowththroughPrivateSector Development

58.    Government i s aware that providing a conducive environment for private sector
development i s key to achieving its overarching goal o f poverty reduction in the medium term.
Inthis context, a comprehensive programme for private sector development will be developed
and submitted to donors for support. In the meantime, Government will review the Companies
and Bankruptcy Acts with the aim o f bringingthese business laws to international standards. A
new Competition Law is also envisaged. Government seeks the elimination o f barriers to the
provision o f long-term credit for business investment and seeks Bank/Fund assistance through a
Financial Sector Assessment Program. As mentioned above, Government i s also stimulating
exports and lowering the cost o f imports through its implementation o f the ECOWAS Common
Extemal Tariff beginninginJanuary 2005.

59.    In an effort to further the divestiture programme in a transparent manner, the National
Commission for Privatisation (NCP) will publish clear, transparent procedures to be followed
for the sale, transfer or disposal o f equity and assets o fpublic enterprises.

60.    The National Power Authority Act i s beingreviewed to allow the creation o f a regulatory
body for the energy sector. A management contract will also be put into place for NPA in2005.
The Ports Authority Act is also beingreviewed to facilitate the conversion o f the Ports Authority
to a Landlord Port. The Sierra Leone Road Authority will also be reformed through a new Road
Maintenance Institutional Action Plan.

61.    Inthe mineral sector, Government has adopted an implementation plan for the operation
and expansion o fthe cadastre inthe medium-term. The first step will be full operation inthe




                                                - 47 -

Kono District beginning in 2005.         Government has adopted a plan by the MMR for the
 conversion o f the pilot extension services to full scale nation wide services to begin in 2005. T o
promote mining investment, Government will begin developing model agreements governing
 operations and taxation o f future mineral sector investors. Government will also implement its
new Core Mineral Policy.

 62.    In the light of significant revenues that are expected from the mineral sector in the
medium to long term, Government will participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) to ensure maximum transparency in the collection o f revenues and implement
the Kimberly process. In order to further strengthen the MMR, Government will also formulate
 and adopt a 5 year capacity buildingplan.

HumanResourceDevelopment

 63.    Government will encourage key MDAs to prepare capacity building plans to enhance
 their capacity for the implementation o f the PRS. The Ministry o f Education, Science and
 Technology will adopt a phased plan for building capacity in the medium-term, including the
 conduct o f annual school censuses. This plan will meet the standards required for the Education
 for All and Fast Track Initiative.

64.     Government will ensure that the Ministry o f Health and Sanitation implements the
recommendations of the Third PETS relating to the distribution o f essential drugs. Inthis regard,
the M O H S will gazette acceptable procedures for an open and transparent distribution plan for
the distribution of drugs and medical supplies. The local councils will also make public the
volume o f supplies expected each year along with supplies actually received inprevious years.

Conclusion

65.     Mr. President, Sierra Leone's requirements to move from the post conflict phase to
sustainable growth and development are immense. The challenges involved require substantial
financial and technical resources. While Government will continue to strengthen measures to
enhance domestic resource mobilization, the continued support o f the international community
remains critical. Your approval of this request, therefore, will contribute immensely to
Government's efforts in addressing the desperate poverty situation in the country, thereby
mitigating the potential for renewed conflict.

OnNovember 12,2004. the ExecutiveBoard o f the InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultationwith Sierra Leone.'

Background

The authorities have been implementing wide-ranging structural reforms andpursuingprudent
macroeconomicpolicies, supported by the PRGF arrangement since 2001,With enhanced
economic and political stability, real GDP growth has picked up while inflation has remained
moderate. During2003, the economy enjoyed a robust recovery, reflecting robust activity in
agriculture, mining,manufacturing, and services, but inflation accelerated. Average inflation in
June 2004 reached 12 percent.

Further progress was made in2003 towards completing Sierra Leone's post-conflict transition. The
government concludedthe disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) exercise in
February 2004. Security inneighboring Liberia has improved and will enhance stability in Sierra
Leone.

Growth prospects inthe mediumterm are encouraging, largely based on some miningprojects
coming to fruition, agricultural expansion, and service-related activities. Real growth i s projected in
the range o f 6-7 percent in2005-07 (with higher growth in 2005 ledby mineral exports), reflecting
these activities in the country's post-conflict phase. Inflation i s expected to revert to low single
digits, while the current account deficits would narrow, aidedby growth inmineral exports. The
projected strong growth will, however, still leave Sierra Leone quite far interms o f achieving the
MDGs.

The authorities' overall medium-term strategy for promoting growth andreducingpoverty focuses
on six key strategic areas: continued strengtheningo f state security; aiming at a more sustainable
fiscal position; raising domestic savings and investment; strengthening infrastructure; agricultural
and rural development; and the promotion o f the private sector.
Fiscal performance in 2003 was somewhat weaker than envisioned, largely due to domestic
expenditure overruns. External program financing (5.5 percent o f GDP inthe original program)
only materializedat slightly over 3 percent o f GDP. This ledto much larger than programmed
domestic financing o f the budget, especially from the banking system. Poverty-related outlays were
above the programmedlevel. Fiscal pressures continued inthe first quarter o f 2004. While the
government made an effort to scale down its outlays, this was insufficient to offset the large
shortfall in external non-HPC grants and program loans. Therefore, domestic financing o f the
budget exceeded the program target by a large margin.
Monetary policy in2003 was expansionary, as Bank o f Sierra Leone allowed private sector credit
to continue growing at a rapidpace. Monetary policy also accommodated the expansionary fiscal
policy. Treasury bill interest rates began to rise inlate 2003 inresponse to inflation expectations
and large government borrowing. As a result, broad and reserve money growth rates were higher

than programmed for the year as a whole. A rapid monetary growth has continued in2004.

The external current account weakened further in2003, While export performance duringthe year
improved, particularly for diamonds, imports remained highdue to continued expansion in
reconstruction activities and the highcost o f fuel. Gross official reserves fell to 1.5 months o f
imports, which was well below the program level. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by
17 percent in2003, partly reflectingthe highforeign-exchange demand o f the private sector as a
result o f higher oil prices.

Debt relief agreements with most official creditors have beenreached, but there has been little
progress with commercial creditors. Debtrelief agreements on Naples terms have been signed with
Paris Club creditors except Japan, and seven out o f eleven agreements on Cologne terms have been
signed. Significant reduction in the NPV o f debt to exports i s expected after Sierra Leone reaches
the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries (HIPC) completion point. All non-Paris Club official creditors
have agreed to deliver debt relief, or indicated their willingness to do so, even though the terms in
some cases fall short o f what i s expected under the HIPC Initiative. The authorities have also
requested the World Bank for a debt buyback operation under the htemational Development
Association facility in order to continue addressing the problem o f commercial debt arrears.

The authorities have completed the first draft o f the full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
and have indicatedthat a final version o f the PRSP would be ready by end-2004. The exercise to
prepare the document had beenundertaken inbroad consultationwith various sections o f society.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the authorities on concluding the disarmament, demobilization,
and reintegration (DDR) exercise for over 72,000 former combatants inFebruary 2004, which led
to a significant improvement in the security situation of the country. Directors welcomed the United
Nations' decision to maintain a presence inthe country at least untilmid-2005, thus providing
additional time for the Sierra Leonean government to train and equip its police and military forces.

Directors noted that Sierra Leone's economic recovery had been broad-based, reflecting improved
business confidence. Significant output gains had been made from post-conflict low levels,
especially inagriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services. Real output in2003 i s estimated to
have increased by 9.3 percent. However, Directors expressed concern that inflation had accelerated
resulting initially from higher fuel costs, but later also reflecting expansionary monetary policy and
a depreciating currency.

Directors supported the authorities' overall medium-term strategy for sustaining high growth and
reducing poverty. The strategy focuses on the strengtheningo f state security; the attainment o f a
more sustainable fiscal position; raising savings and investment; strengthening o f infrastructure;
agricultural and rural development; and the promotion o f the private sector. Directors also endorsed
the authorities intentionto maintain a floating exchange rate system, given the open economy and
the needto maintain a competitive external position.

Directors encouraged the authorities to continue addressing structural reforms and governance
issues with the aim o f attracting both domestic and foreign investors. Inthis context, Directors
welcomed the finalization and imminent adoption o f the new investment code. They also
commended the authorities on expressing interest inparticipating inthe Extractive Industries

Transparency Initiative (EITI), which would address governance concerns and enhance the
transparency o f reporting on mineral revenues. Looking forward, Directors pointed out that the
mainriskto the medium term growth strategy lies inthe area o f saving and investment; therefore,
the policy and institutional measures requiredinthis broad area would remain critical.

Directors broadly endorsed the macroeconomic objectives and policies for the remainder o f 2004.
They concurred with the need to tighten fiscal policy to bring domestic expenditures, excluding as
much as possible poverty related expenditures, closer to projectedresources. Inorder to reduce
inflationary pressures, Directors also emphasizedthe needto maintain an appropriately tight
monetary policy, including the authorities' planned reduction ingovernment borrowing from the
banking system inthe second half o f the year.

Inlight of the proposed policy framework for the remainder o f2004, Directors granted waivers for
(i)theceilingonnetbankcredittothegovernment,whichwasexceededafteradjustingforthe
shortfall in the external program support, (ii)          the introduction o f new personnel management
regulations, which was not introducedby end-May 2004 as envisaged, pending the finalization o f a
new employment scheme for senior public servants, and (iii)                 reconciliation o f fiscal and monetary
data for 2000-02, which was not completed by the end-May 2004 deadline, as the provision o f Fund
technical assistance was not forthcoming as projected. Inaddition, Directors agreed to extend the
arrangement for a three-month period.

Directors commended the authorities on the completion o f a comprehensive first draft o f the full
PRSP, which was producedby a relatively broad based national participatoryprocess. Given the
requirement to implement the full PRSP at least a year before reaching the HIPC completion point,
which i s envisaged for end-2005, Directors urged the authorities to complete the PRSP document
by end-December 2004. Directors also recommendedthat the full PRSP serve as an active vehicle
for pursuingmedium-termobjectives as well as the longer term MDGs.

Directors commended the authorities for the progress made inimplementing the recommendations
o f previous statistics technical assistance missions. To further enhance the surveillance o f the
economy, they urged the authorities to continue their efforts to improve the statistical base,
especially the national accounts, through Fund and other technical assistance.
