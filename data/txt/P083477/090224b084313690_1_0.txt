            IEGWB Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.

About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the expected
results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons
drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Bank’s lending operations
through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or
complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank
management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examines project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and
other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local
offices as appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the
document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the
Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance
of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s objectives are
consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance
strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector
Strategy Papers, and Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project’s design is consistent
with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is
expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to
alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome:
Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation
and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition
arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the achievement of
development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for
Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency
or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward
the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing
agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

        ERRC-I was supported by an initial IDA credit of SDR 21.9 million (US $30.0
million equivalent) approved in February 2000 and a supplemental IDA credit of SDR
7.9 million (US $10.0 million equivalent) approved in December 2000. The credit was
disbursed in three tranches: the first upon effectiveness in March 2000, the second in October
2000 upon successful review of the macro situation, and the third (floating) tranche upon
satisfactory review of the Public Enterprise Reform Strategy, just before closing on June 30,
2001.

        ERRC-II was supported by an IDA credit of SDR 39.4 million (US $50.0 million
equivalent) approved in December 2001. The credit became effective on December 20, 2001
and closed on March 30, 2003. It was disbursed in two tranches: the first following
effectiveness and the second in December 2002.

        ERRC-III was supported by an International Development Association (IDA) credit
of SDR 22.0 million (US $30 million equivalent at appraisal) approved in May 2003. It
became effective on September 16, 2003 and closed on December 31, 2004. It was disbursed
in two equal tranches: the first following effectiveness in May 2003 and the second upon
meeting the agreed conditionality in December 2004.

       ERRG-IV was supported by an IDA grant of SDR 10.0 million (US $15 million
equivalent) approved in June 2005. It became effective on August 3, 2005 and closed on
June 30, 2006. The grant was disbursed in a single tranche based on prior actions.

        This PPAR is based on a review of relevant World Bank documents, including the
President’s Reports, Credit and Grant Agreements, Implementation Completion Reports (ICR),
other project documents, country program and (interim and transitional) strategy documents
and pertinent economic and sector work, the government’s poverty reduction strategy and
other reports, and reports from other agencies. An IEG team, led by Dusan Vujovic, visited
Sierra Leone in March 2009 and interviewed government officials, representatives of the
private sector, academia, think-tanks, NGOs, other donor agencies, and Bank staff at
headquarters and in the Freetown office. When relevant, that information has been
incorporated in the report. The cooperation and assistance of the resident mission,
government officials, management and staff of implementing agencies and other parties
concerned are gratefully acknowledged. This report was prepared by Dusan Vujovic (Task
Manager). Vikki Taaka provided administrative support.

Summary
        This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews four closely related
Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery (ERR) operations in Sierra Leone over the FY
2000-2007 period, in support of the country’s strategy to sustain peace, restore security and
revive economic activity after eight years of devastating civil war. Through most of this
period the country did not have an agreed medium-term development and poverty
reduction strategy, despite Government’s persistent efforts to firm up the hard-won
political consensus and move the country on the path of stability.

        The initial strategy, formulated as the National Rehabilitation and Recovery
Program (NRRP), was prepared immediately following the July 1999 Lome peace accord
and was primarily concerned with emergency issues in a precarious post-conflict situation.
With modest delays, caused mainly by the recurrence of hostilities in May 2000 and
continued absence of full political consensus, the Government strategy evolved into an
Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper finalized in June 2001, and discussed by the
Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Boards in September 2001. Due to many
remaining political obstacles and capacity constraints, it took almost four additional years
before the Government program eventually became a full Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) finalized in February 2005, and discussed by the Bank and IMF Boards in
May 2005.

         Out of the four International Development Association (IDA) Economic
Rehabilitation and Recovery operations reviewed in this PPAR, three were funded by IDA
credits and the fourth by an IDA grant. Although they were designed as stand-alone
operations and were approved before a broader medium-term Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) framework was in place in FY2006, they were mutually consistent and fully
integrated into a much broader international effort involving the United Nations, the IMF,
the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Kingdom Department for International
Development (DFID) and a large group of other bilateral donors supporting the
reconstruction and development efforts of Sierra Leone. The IDA resources under the ERR
operations amounted to US$135 million over the first eight fiscal years following the civil
war, contributing a large portion of the concessional aid provided to Sierra Leone during
this critical post-conflict period. The three IDA credits were disbursed in multiple tranches
following the achievement of corresponding sets of policy and institutional (prior and
tranche release) actions. The grant was a single tranche operation but it contained a
number of triggers for the start of a subsequent series of development policy credits
envisaged under the 2006-2009 CAS.

       The main objective of these fast-disbursing funds was to provide urgently needed
budget support to cover vital expenditures in the post-conflict period mainly related to
demobilization efforts and costs of reconstructing and repairing infrastructure, basic social
services and foreign exchange for imports of essential consumer goods, energy, and
intermediate goods needed for the reconstruction effort. The common objectives were to
achieve and consolidate stability, improve governance, revive economic growth and
incomes, and provide access to social services throughout the country. The ERR
operations aimed to achieve these objectives by helping to: (a) implement the
                                             x


Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program; (b) promote reallocation of
budget resources towards more efficient social and economic uses, and secure their
efficient and equitable implementation; (c) improve access to and quality of basic social
services; and (d) promote better governance.

Principal Findings

The principal findings of the review are:

    The ERR operations were timely and effective in providing critical budget support
     to the Government of Sierra Leone during the initial post-conflict years. They were
     also effective in mobilizing and coordinating donor support, and in increasing the
     Government’s capacity to develop and implement its own policy program.
    The IDA program was effective in directly supporting the demobilization effort
     under the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program, achieving the
     initial protective, social, and economic security advances, and in accomplishing
     procedural improvements, and partially effective in achieving better governance,
     improved allocation of budget resources and development results.
    To produce sustainable longer-term development results on the ground, the Bank
     needs a stable multi-year strategy with a predictable resource envelope, more
     realistic project design, sustained capacity-building effort, and stronger results
     orientation in identifying prior actions and tranche release conditions. Although
     outputs achieved under the four ERR operations appear to be highly positively
     correlated to desired outcomes, the absence of fully defined development results
     chains and continuously monitored performance indicators makes it more difficult
     to assess the outcome of the Bank program on key development objectives,
     particularly in achieving sustainable advances in decentralization, public
     governance and better management of public resources.
    The Bank team reacted very promptly to the narrow window of opportunity created
     by the 1999 Lome peace accord and skillfully use stand-alone operations to emulate
     a more desirable programmatic approach. This was accomplished by fitting
     individual operations through a gradually emerging country development
     framework and Bank assistance strategy, which evolved from an interim support
     strategy, via two transitional support strategies to a full-fledged CAS produced only
     towards the end of the four operations.
    Finally, the four ERR operations proved that it is possible to find a good balance
     between Government’s incentives to implement reforms and policies embedded in
     the prior actions and tranche release conditions, on the one hand, and those
     contained in the ongoing policy dialogue and capacity building efforts, on the other.
     While the former firmly rest on a clear incentive to obtain budget support resources
     and therefore get political attention, the latter are often based on less visible
     incentives to seek longer-term gains from improved efficiency and transparency,
     and may require a stronger commitment to and ownership of proposed reforms and
     policy improvements.

Assessment and Lessons

        The four ERR operations sought to help the Government resolve some of the most
difficult problems faced in the post-conflict period, including reestablishing protective
security, restoring incomes and basic standards of living, and extending core social services
throughout the country. The relevance of objectives was substantial for all operations as
the Bank consistently sought to address the most important problems identified in the
evolving national priorities. In three out of four operations the relevance of design was only
modest, as it fell short of developing a consistent results chain between the proposed policy
actions and the intended results.

        The efficacy in achieving development objectives was mixed. Efficacy was
substantial in the areas of security (addressed in ERRC-I and II) and economic growth.
After the final peace accord signed in January 2002, the country has enjoyed more than
eight years of peace and stability. Indicators measuring democracy (voice and
accountability) and political stability quadrupled during the 2000-2004 period and
remained stable since then. Economic revival was also impressive. During 2001-2008 GDP
grew 11 percent annually, real incomes doubled and poverty headcount declined from 67.5
to 61.6 percent. By contrast, in all four ERR operations efficacy was predominantly modest
in achieving better quality of governance, public resource management, and provision of
quality social services. Despite notable improvements in reallocating budget resources
towards education, health and other social services, and greatly improved primary and
secondary school enrollments, Sierra Leone is still close to the bottom of human
development index and lags considerably behind in the achievement of important
millennium development goals.

        While the relevance of objectives was substantial in all operations, due to
weaknesses in the relevance of design and mixed achievements in development objectives,
the outcome rating for all four operations is moderately satisfactory. Although the main
types of risks to development outcomes shifted in line with the content of objectives
supported under individual ERR operations, the level of risk remained moderate for all four
operations.

        The following main lessons for the design of future support programs in post-
conflict situations are derived from the review:

    An early start and informed risk taking can consolidate the peace process: The
     Bank was right to quickly respond to a limited window of opportunity created by
     the initial peace accord (July 1999). Despite obvious risks, an early effort to create
     a sensible interim assistance strategy and prepare a development policy operation
     (DPO) was well justified. The first ERR credit provided critical budget support to
     restore basic state functions and initiate economic and social recovery. This clearly
     demonstrated the benefits of peace, curbed the impact of renewed hostilities (May
     2000), and tilted the balance in favor of achieving a firm peace settlement (January
     2002).
    Delayed adoption of a country strategy and programmatic budget support
     weakens ownership, creates funding uncertainty, and hampers capacity-
     building: Under the circumstances, more could have been done to secure an early
                                        xii


  adoption of a multi-year country strategy and programmatic budget support. In
  substance, the interim PRSP provided a sufficient basis for a country assistance
  strategy, while the IMF’s 2001-2005 Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
  rendered a solid macroeconomic backing for a programmatic series of DPOs.
  Instead, formal criteria prevailed and the Bank postponed the adoption of the first
  post-conflict CAS and the programmatic DPOs till FY2006, almost six years after
  the Lome peace accord. Over time this weakened ownership of the reforms,
  introduced additional uncertainty in the budget process, and inadvertently destroyed
  the continuity of the decentralization and capacity building effort.
 Stronger signaling of longer-term resource availability for budget support and
  capacity-building substitutes for the lack of formal programmatic framework:
  In situations where programmatic instruments were not possible due to funding or
  other constraints, Bank efforts to secure as much continuity as possible in the
  content and design of stand-alone operations were well justified. More could have
  been done if these efforts were supplemented with stronger signaling of potential
  longer-term resource availability for budget support and capacity building.
 While project/program designs were kept simple and realistic, more could
  have been done to develop an appropriate results framework calibrated to
  post-conflict country circumstances. Additionally, more resources could have
  been allocated to adequately monitor the achievement of outcome indicators.
  Critical outcomes, especially in the area of better governance, could then be more
  fully owned by the Government and other stakeholders and implemented in time.
  This would also help achieve a better balance between government efforts aimed at
  satisfying conditionality and participating in other Bank supported activities,
  including sustained capacity building.
 The Bank is (often) expected to assume a leading role in mobilizing and
  coordinating external donor assistance in post-conflict situations, and is not
  always adequately resourced to do this. In recognition of this, post-conflict Bank
  programs may benefit from senior management support that would enable country
  teams to more appropriately structure and adequately resource their efforts in
  mobilizing and coordinating donor assistance. Alternatively, other viable solutions
  would need to be found and endorsed by the Consultative Group meetings and other
  donor fora.

1.     Country Context and Macroeconomic Performance

Country Context
1.1     After more than a decade of economic turmoil and decline, in 1993 Sierra Leone
descended into a rebel-instigated civil war ignited by systematic insurgent attacks from
Liberia-based groups. During the extended civil war public revenues collapsed,
economic and social infrastructure was devastated, and basic social services were reduced
to a minimum or were completely discontinued in large parts of the country. Planning,
policy, design and implementation capacity in Sierra Leone were among the poorest in
the world.

1.2      Eight years of bitter civil war were ended with the Lome peace accord, signed in
July 1999. Sierra Leone adopted a National Rehabilitation and Recovery Program
(NRRP) and within months formed a national coalition government that brought about
initial security, political social and economic stability, and growth. The main strategic
objectives of the Government were to promote sustainable economic growth and to reduce
poverty. Improved public revenues and greater fiscal discipline were the central elements
of the program necessary to increase social security and provide basic social services
throughout the country. Concurrent economic revival was predicated on increased
reliance on markets and the opening of the economy.

1.3     The Bank responded promptly. Initially, in the absence of a Poverty Reduction
Strategy, Bank support was based on interim and transitional strategy formats. As
detailed in Table 1, the first Interim Support Strategy, presented to the Board in
December 1999, relied heavily on the first Economic Recovery and Rehabilitation (ERR)
operation, which received more than half of available resources. This was followed by
two transitional strategies (presented to the Board in December 2000 and April 2002),
which continued to channel a large albeit declining share of available resources to ERR
operations. Finally, a full-fledged Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the FY 2006-
2009 period was presented to the Board (together with the last ERR operation) in June
2005.

1.4     This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews four Economic
Rehabilitation and Recovery (ERR) operations for a total of $135 million that supported
the Government programs during the FY2000-2006. The ERR operations, comprising
three budget support credits (one with supplementary financing) and one grant, sought as
their ultimate objectives to reach and consolidate stability, revive economic growth and
incomes, and provide access to social services throughout the country. They aimed to
achieve these objectives by helping to: (a) implement the Disarmament, Demobilization
and Reintegration (DDR) program; (b) promote reallocation of budget resources towards
more efficient social and economic uses, and secure an efficient and equitable use of
public resources; (c) improve access to and quality of basic social services; and (d)
promote better governance.

Macroeconomic performance 2000-2008
1.5     At the end of the civil war, the overall economic situation was very difficult. The
collapse of agricultural production, mining, and trade had reduced real incomes by more
than 60 percent and seriously eroded the fiscal revenue base to around 6 percent of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in 1999. The rebound of trade and economic recovery in
2000-2001 helped increase public revenues to 12 percent of GDP, the highest level
recorded since 1990. However, this was not sufficient to contain the widening fiscal gap
caused by the increase in recurrent and capital expenditures needed to provide basic
social services and respond to post-war needs for demobilization and critical
infrastructure reconstruction. As a result, the Government’s fiscal deficit was projected
to be 16-20 percent of GDP in the immediate post-conflict years, calling for substantial
budget support from the International Development Association (IDA), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF, see Box 1), and other donors.

Box 1. IMF programs in Sierra Leone
Throughout the conflict years (1991-2001) Sierra Leone had the continuous presence of
International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs. Initially the Fund used structural adjustment
facilities to provide the necessary policy advice and balance of payments support: a one-year
SDR 27 million standard Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) approved in 1994 was followed by
a multi-year SDR 100 million Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) during the 1995-
1998 period. A series of three annual post-conflict assistance programs were used to provide
assistance during the last years of the war (1998-1999) and fragile initial peace (2000) totaling
SDR 37.5 million. With the exception of a relatively short period in 1995 when the ESAF
program was put on hold following the escalation of rebel activities, the IMF programs stayed on
track and disbursed on a regular basis. The first Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) was
approved in September 2001 as the final peace agreement took hold. It covered a four-year
period (2001-1005) and the second PRGF was approved in May 2006 and is still active. Overall,
although Sierra Leone suffered a huge economic and social cost during the war years, the
continuous presence of the IMF programs considerably helped in avoiding the destruction of the
financial system and the collapse of country’s credit worthiness.

1.6    Sierra Leone's post-conflict macroeconomic performance has been quite robust
(see Table 2). Income has rapidly rebounded in a seemingly inclusive way, yet this has
ushered in new institutional and policy challenges that must be dealt with over the
medium term to secure continued private-sector based growth. Following a decade of
economic decline and destruction of physical and social infrastructure during the civil
war, Sierra Leone has enjoyed an eight-year long period of revival and sustained
economic growth. The average GDP growth rate for the entire post-conflict period
(2001-2008) was an impressive 11 percent per annum.1

1.7    Expectedly, the pattern of economic revival was uneven. The highest growth
rates were recorded in the early post-war years as GDP strongly rebounded with the
normalization of economic activities, strong recovery in agriculture and mining, and
ample injection of donor assistance. Peak growth rates were recorded in 2002
(27.5 percent) and 2001 (17.9 percent), which brought the cumulative GDP increase to
over 64 percent in the 2001-2003 sub-period.

1.8     During the implementation of the ERR program (2000-2006), real GDP more than
doubled and continued to grow at around 6 percent annually through 2008. Sierra Leone
thus reached the pre-civil war level of real GDP and real GDP per capita in 2007. Based
on present population growth rates and past income distribution patterns (with a high and
increasing Gini coefficient), United Nations Development Program (UNDP) estimates
that a 6 percent annual growth rate is needed to ensure that the number of poor people
does not increase in the medium run.

1.9     On the supply side, the economic recovery has been propelled by agriculture and
mining. Much of the initial activity took place in informal activities concentrated in the
agriculture, fishing, mining and service sectors. Over time, formal economic activity

1
 The average growth rate stays above 10 percent per annum even if the year 2000, marked by renewed
hostilities and hampered economic performance, is included in the calculation.
                                            4


(government, large scale mining and construction) has also become an important
contributor to economic growth and employment.

1.10 Agriculture accounts for around 45 percent of the GDP and provides the main
source of income for about 70 percent of the population. The main factors behind recent
agriculture revival and growth have been increases in land under cultivation and
productivity improvements based on better inputs, including greater availability of
imported equipment and energy financed mainly through donor assistance.

1.11 The mining sector accounts for an estimated 20 percent of GDP and contributes
significantly to export earnings. In the past, diamonds and iron ore (supplemented by
rutile and bauxite) were the most significant determinants of Sierra Leone’s economic
prosperity. After the war, the officially registered output of diamonds picked up fairly
quickly and has been growing considerably since then, while bauxite and rutile
production lagged initially but started to pick up in 2006. Offshore oil explorations
started during the program period have recently identified considerable reserves with
potentially large impact on GDP and exports.

1.12 The service sectors (transport, communications, and Government) account for
almost all the remaining 35 percent of GDP, with the exception of a small manufacturing
sector engaged mainly in import-substitution.

1.13 On the demand side, real consumption increased and the quality and availability
of consumer goods greatly improved. The share of private consumption in GDP
gradually declined as GDP recovered and increased domestic production and greater
availability of donor-financed imports led to lower prices and better quality of basic
consumer goods, energy and durables. Despite the continuous decline, the consumption
share in GDP still remains at over 80 percent and thus contributes to chronic external
imbalance and heavy dependence on donor funding. Investment demand increased
driven by large-scale resettlement and reconstruction activities, and the share of gross
fixed capital formation in GDP almost tripled (from 6.9 percent in 2000 to around 17

  1.14 In terms of growth accounting, improved productivity was by far the most
  important source of growth. A recent IMF study (IMF 2009b) estimated that in the
  2002-2007 period, labor contributed 2.4 percent to the average 10 percent annual GDP
  growth rate, capital contributed 1.6 percent, and the remaining 6 percent were owed to
  improvements in total factor productivity.
  1.15 Export growth has been very strong (averaging 18.5 percent per annum in
  the 2000-2009 period) and has become more diversified in recent years. Sierra Leone
                                                    6


has moved from large concentration on diamond exports2 to a more balanced export
structure that now includes other mining products (rutile, bauxite) and cash crops. Oil
exports may also become available soon, given positive results of recent off-shore
explorations.
1.16 However, the need for imports has remained high throughout the post-war period,
leading to a large trade and current account deficits. Initially, large imports were needed
to supply much needed basic consumer goods, and to secure fuels and intermediate
inputs. In later years sizeable imports were needed to provide equipment and investment
goods. As a result, the share of imports in GDP remained fairly stable at around 40
percent and significantly contributed to large albeit declining current account deficits
(from 20.5 percent of GDP in 2001 to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2007) financed in large part
through donor contributions (official transfers). The improving current account trend was
reversed in the wake of the global financial crisis. The current account deficit increased
to 10.3 percent of GDP in 2008 and is projected at close to 10 percent in 2009. Given the
country’s limited ability to incur domestic and foreign debt, confirmed in a recent debt
sustainability analysis, external deficits or that magnitude could only be sustained if
additional donor funding is secured.
1.17 On the fiscal side, Sierra Leone adopted a range of reforms and recorded
continuous improvements in the fiscal balance. The primary domestic fiscal balance
improved from 7.7 percent of GDP in 2001 to around 2 percent in recent years. The
overall balance has also been improving between 2002 (-9.9 percent of GDP) and 2007
(-2.0 percent of GDP), but then worsened in 2008 (-4.8 percent) due to late reduction in
the level of grants which could not absorbed in the current budget, as expenditure
commitments had already been made.
1.18 Although Sierra Leone has made notable progress in reviving the economy and
achieving macroeconomic stability, inflation has remained a problem. With the
exception of the immediate post-conflict period (2000-2002), marked by deflation from
war time prices to competitive market prices, inflation has averaged 12.4 percent per
annum. The Bank of Sierra Leone has not had adequate instruments to affect price
stability in the presence of the expansionary fiscal policy enabled by (otherwise
necessary) donor financing. As detailed in the recent IMF studies (IMF 2008, 2009b),
the CPI basket in Sierra Leone is dominated by food and energy items, with a large
portion of imported goods. Hence, the CPI depends largely on supply factors (world
prices), exchange rates (for many imported consumer goods), taxes and, possibly,
administrative price-setting mechanisms. The study concludes that the monetary policy
which operates almost exclusively through the demand side, impacts the CPI only
indirectly through incomes and inflationary expectations and appears to be less effective
in post-conflict environments.
1.19 The remainder of the review is organized follows: the next chapter provides an
overview of the collective accomplishments of the four operations; chapters 3-6 provide
evidence and ratings for each of the operations individually; and chapter 7 discusses
lessons.

2. Achievements under Economic Rehabilitation and
   Recovery Operations

2.1     The ERR operations, comprising three credits and one grant, became the principal
instruments for IDA support to Sierra Leone’s efforts to achieve protective, social and
economic security in the years following the civil war, as well as to promote transparent
and inclusive governance. They supplemented investment operations in the transfer of
resources and facilitated sector-wide as well as macroeconomic policy reforms. The
three ERR credits were stand-alone multi-tranche budget-support operations. The fourth
ERR was a single tranche grant, which also contained triggers for a follow-up
programmatic series of credits implemented under the first full country assistance
strategy for FY2006-2009. ERRs were timed to be disbursed as annual support to the
Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) national budget and became the preferred and
relatively reliable mode of financing the Government.

2.2     In the absence of a longer-term national development strategy or a formal multi-
year Bank support strategy, the ERR operations had to be designed as individual stand-
alone operations. The Bank team made a considerable effort to ensure continuity in
policy content and capacity building effort. The expectation was that a national
development and poverty reduction strategy would be prepared soon after the end of the
war, thereby enabling the creation of an adequate CAS framework. Unfortunately, that
did not happen for the duration of the ERR series. The first credit (ERRC-I) was prepared
in only few months in response to a clear need to act quickly and use the window of
opportunity created by the Lome peace accord and the political commitment to peace,
disarmament and stability forged in the late 1999. ERRC-I was based on a brief short-
term-focused Interim Support Strategy. The re-emergence of hostilities in May 2000
inevitably led to significant delays in the preparation of the full Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) and caused the next two ERR credits to be presented to the Board
also as stand-alone operations. Only the last operation (ERRG-IV) served as a bridge
towards a new programmatic series under the first post-conflict CAS.

2.3     Although the ERR credits / grant were not designed as a programmatic set of
operations, there was a lot of continuity in the development objectives and areas of
interventions over the six-year period, which addressed important issues for post-conflict
stabilization and development. These included areas of consolidating peace, providing
protective security, improving governance, and restoring basic functions of the state,
while reviving the economy, securing access to basic social services, and reducing
poverty.

2.4      Notwithstanding the temporary security setback caused by the recurrence of
hostilities in May 2000, the sequence of operations evaluated under this PPAR played a
significant role in moving Sierra Leone from the state of destructive civil war to a
reasonably stable democracy, enjoying sustained economic growth and growing incomes
in a stable macroeconomic environment, providing better access to health and educational
services, and achieving moderate results in reducing poverty.
                                              8


2.5    Greater political stability is best confirmed by significantly improved legislation
which enabled two complete and very successful rounds of transparent and credible
presidential, parliamentary and local elections held in the post-conflict period. The
process of political maturity continues to this date as confirmed by a recent Joint
Communiqué of all political parties issued in April 2009. It outlines a new political code
of conduct, a stark contrast to the political divisions that fueled the civil war two decades
ago.

2.6      Economic revival was strong and sustainable in the post-conflict period. After a
major economic rebound recorded in the years following the war (that is, the 64 percent
cumulative real GDP increase in the 2001-2003 period), Sierra Leone enjoyed five years
of strong economic growth at over 7 percent annually in a stable macroeconomic
environment. Most importantly, strong economic growth produced substantial increases
in real incomes which, in turn, led to a large reduction in poverty headcount (from 66.4
percent in 2003 to 56.6 percent in 2007). Despite these achievements, poverty remains a
problem, especially in rural areas, where almost 70 percent of people were below the
absolute poverty line in 2007, as does unemployment, especially among the young.

2.7     Results in the areas of improved access to social services are more difficult to
assess. Better access to education services supported under the ERR operations have
already resulted in notably higher gross (over 101 percent) and net enrollment ratios. This
will lead to higher literacy rates (presently at 34.8 percent) and, via better education
outcomes, to improved labor force skills and productivity increases in the future.
Likewise, better access to health facilities and health services enabled under the broader
government efforts supported by the ERR operations are expected to produce improved
health indicators with some lag. Presently, life expectancy at birth is still less than
42 years, while under-5 child mortality (per 1,000 live births) is at 286. Overall, Sierra
Leone remains at the bottom of the UNDP’s Human Development Index ranking.

2.8     In sum, improved political stability and strong economic growth can be attributed
to coordinated government effort substantially supported by the Bank and other donors
both at the level of policy design and of significant resource transfer. In other words, it
can be very plausibly argued that the Bank made a positive contribution to growth
outcomes. Outcomes in the area of social services also appear positive but are
significantly more difficult to assess due to large lags and lack of reliable indicators.

2.9    Although the four ERR operations exhibited a considerable variation in defining
and presenting development objectives detailed in subsequent chapters on individual
operations, they shared the emphasis on the four objectives which capture the essence of
the post-conflict state-building, reconstruction and recovery effort supported by IDA.

Security
2.10 Security issues (restoring security, state authority, and legitimacy) dominated the
ERR agenda in the first two operations, particularly following the resumption of
hostilities in May 2000. In the longer run, support to demobilization, reconciliation, and
peace building efforts proved to be effective and have yielded sustainable results to this
date. Now, eight years after the final peace document was signed in January 2002, Sierra
                                             9


Leone enjoys a stable security situation. However, clashes between rival political groups
in March 2009 provided a reminder that political and social tensions still persist in and
continue to be fueled by low incomes and high unemployment rates among the (urban)
youth. But the incident also demonstrated Government’s ability to quickly and
effectively resolve the conflict, and defuse future tensions through appropriate changes in
the political election campaign rules.

Governance and public resource management
2.11 The four operations aimed to improve governance, the rule of law, transparency
and efficiency of public resource management. In ERRC-I the emphasis was on
combating corruption and promoting transparency through anti-corruption legislation.
The second operation put emphasis on the decentralization agenda and supported the
introduction of local elections and a decentralized system of government with substantial
devolution of powers to chiefdoms and local councils. It also provided critical support
for improving public expenditure management.

2.12 The third ERRC continued to support decentralization and anti-corruption
activities. It also initiated actions to improve management of public resources through
decentralized open budget preparation and better budget implementation (through
enhanced procurement, financial management and expenditure tracking surveys).

2.13 The last operation (ERRG IV) expanded the support to decentralized budget
implementation and a range deeper reforms promoting enhanced accountability in the use
of public resources (that is, procurement reform, financial management reform and new
audit systems).

2.14 Despite considerable policy actions and intermediate results achieved in the area
of governance, political and fiscal decentralization, and better management of public
resources, many issues still remain. The governance problems continue to pose a
challenge for Sierra Leone. The decentralization process has to be continued to devolve
more power and resources to local levels of government, and resolve tensions between
local councils and chiefdoms as they compete for legitimacy and power.3

Economic growth
2.15 The four operations aimed to promote economic growth by securing
macroeconomic stability and promoting private sector based employment and growth.
The first operation adopted a modest objective of seeking basic economic security in the
post-war environment by providing income opportunities for the population and
improving conditions in the markets for essential consumer goods. It also initiated
activities that would form a basis for future private sector growth (i.e. the resolution of
government payment arrears to the private sector and the adoption of a strategy for public
enterprises).

2.16 The second operation successfully maintained the macroeconomic stability and
expanded support for private sector development in three main directions: (i)
privatization of public enterprises; (ii) promotion of formal activity in the mining sector;
and (iii) provision of micro-finance services for the private sector.

2.17 The third ERRC sustained the earlier achievements and added activities to
promote West Africa regional trade through the adoption of common export tariffs and to
create a better investment climate for domestic and foreign private investors.

2.18 The last operation in the series sustained the drive to improve the investment
climate by implementing the new export tariff schedule and passing the laws critical for
greater private sector participation in the economy (Company Act and Bankruptcy Act).
It also supported efforts to improve the quality of management in the mining sector (by
accelerating the introduction of the mining cadastre and mining extension services).

2.19 The immediate impact on the institutional framework for investment and private
sector development was only partial: Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS)
studies4 duly noted the efforts supported under the ERR series, but concluded that
investment promotion activities remained largely ineffective. In the longer run, however,
the reforms started under the ERR operations created the necessary foundation and set the
pace for continuous improvements in the legal and regulatory environment for the private
sector investment and operations. With a time lag of few years there was a cumulative
positive impact on the overall business environment which was recorded in the Doing
Business reports for 2009 and 2010: Sierra Leone substantially improved its ranking in a
few visible dimensions (for example, registering new business, obtaining credit, and
protecting foreign investors) but still has to close the gap in other areas of critical
importance for private investors (such as obtaining construction permits and registering
business property).

2.20 The power sector, recognized rightly as one of the priorities in the PRSP II,
presently faces problems both in: (a) providing reliable supply of electricity at
competitive prices indispensible for private sector operation, and (b) signaling lack of
GOSL readiness to resolve issues related to public sector projects / enterprises in an
orderly and transparent fashion.

Social services (human development)
2.21 The operations sought to achieve full access to and better quality of basic social
services (health and education), and improve municipal utilities. The first operation
helped restore the provision of basic social (health and education) and utility services
throughout the country, a relatively straightforward but daunting task given the fragile
security situation through much of the country and the damage done to schools and health
facilities during the decade long war.

2.22 The second operation took this further by securing increased budget allocations
for social services at the regional level, improving the supply of teaching materials and
expanding the schools nutrition and health programs. It also supported clean water and
sanitation programs.

2.23 The third ERR continued support to health and education by focusing on the
quality of delivered services. Public expenditure tracking surveys introduced in the first
ERR operation were put to use to demonstrate the actual use of budget resources
allocated for health, education and other social services.

2.24 The last operation continued to support better provision of health and education
services within a broader human development framework which also includes water and
sanitation, social protection, gender equality and employment generation.

2.25 Taken together, the four ERR operations provided an important impetus to the
restoration of basic education and health services.

2.26 The revitalization and rapid recovery of the Sierra Leone education system is
attributed to strong government commitment, decentralization of education service
delivery, increased access to education (higher enrollment ratios for primary and
secondary schools and substantially higher number of students taking examinations),
accompanied with no decline in examination results.5 Strong government ownership of
this education reform agenda was forged through continuous ERR policy dialogue and an
education reform project.

Achievements in the health sector are not as obvious due to long lags between
interventions, better health services, and changes in key health indicators. The
devolution of financing and management of primary health care to district councils has
been completed. Repaired and equipped health facilities (including peripheral health
units) have already been providing better health services to the majority of the
population. A measurable impact on key health and quality of life indicators is expected
in the years to come. In the meantime, however, Sierra Leone remains close to the
bottom of the UNDP’s Human Development Index.

3. First Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit
3.1     The first Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit (ERRC-I), which was
approved in February 2000 and closed in June 2001, was the first of four Bank operations
aimed at assisting the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) in the implementation of the
National Rehabilitation and Recovery Program (NRRP). ERRC-I was designed soon
after the Lome peace accord as part of the Bank’s Interim Support Strategy (ISS)
approved by the Board in December 1999. The ISS was an interim short-term emergency
support framework which defined the Bank’s participation in an integrated and
cooperative multi-donor effort to provide Sierra Leone with critical support for short-
term security improvements, humanitarian and early reconstruction assistance.

3.2      ERRC-I was therefore the core implementation platform of the ISS, and a key
instrument to test the possible pillars of the forthcoming medium-term country and Bank
strategy. Its straight, no-frills design features and implementation experience provided
critical inputs into the preparation of new strategy with great degree of realism.

3.3     The ERRC-I was centered around the strategic objectives of sustaining peace,
restoring security in its protective, social and material dimensions, as well as improving
governance. It was a quick disbursing budgetary support credit in the amount of US$40
million (comprising US$30 million approved in the initial credit and US$10 million in
supplemental financing). Credit proceeds helped finance the 2000/01 slice of the
Government’s foreign exchange and domestic budgetary costs of enhancing and
sustaining protective security, social and economic security and transparent and inclusive
governance.

3.4     The Credit was part of a broader coordinated macro financial support provided by
the UK Department of International Development (DFID), the European Union (EU) and
the IMF, and was implemented in parallel with the IDA-assisted Community
Reintegration and Rehabilitation (CRR) project approved in December 1999. The CRR
project provided US$25 million equivalent to help reintegrate demobilized combatants
into civil life through training and employment program, and assist internally displaced
persons by facilitating social and economic recovery of communities affected by the war.
Although IDA funds were not used to disarm the ex-combatants, the CRR project
contributed over 43 percent of the overall cost of the program and had close to
1.5 million of direct and indirect beneficiaries until it closed in June 2003. The CRR was
instrumental in attracting substantial additional donor support of US$32.9 million
channeled through a multi-donor trust fund administered by the Bank, as well as
providing financial and capacity-building support to the National Committee for
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration and the National Commission for
Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation.

Objectives and Components
3.5     Objectives. The objectives of the ERRC-1, according to President’s Report6,
were to: (a) achieve protective security, secure peace building, and reconciliation; (b)
provide social and economic security; and (c) establish transparent and inclusive
governance systems. As indicated in Table 3, these objectives were closely aligned with
the three pillars of the government’s NRRP. Understandably, approved only months after
the Lome peace accord, the program placed very strong initial emphasis on achieving
protective security (individual safety and human rights) by fending off the real risks of
renewed fighting and possible reversals in commitment to peace. The core actions were
directed at creating new army and security forces, promptly disarming all irregular forces
and forming a National coalition Government. In a lesser way ERRC-I supported actions
that would lead to greater social and economic security, as well as improved governance
in the somewhat longer run.

3.6     Components. To achieve the above objectives, the ERRC-I identified 9 policy
areas mapped into 15 core actions, 7 of which had already been carried by the
Government as prior actions before the Board presentation in February 2000. As detailed
in Table 4Error! Reference source not found., the prior actions were directly related to
the three objectives outlined in the President’s Report. The credit addressed 12 of the 21
action areas considered relevant to the achievement of the NRRP objectives. Table 4

Relevance of Objectives and Design
3.7     Objectives. After eight years of bitter civil war, which created enormous human
suffering, destroyed economic and social infrastructure and decimated the economy, the
immediate priority was to disarm and demobilize multiple military formations,
reintegrate former combatants and restore a sense of protective security, while also
providing the much needed social and economic security through improved basic health
and educational services and greater income opportunities for the entire population.

3.8     During the eight war years income levels and all social indicators had declined
precipitously. Despite the complete absence of any official statistics until 2000, available
informal data suggest that during the civil war years, primary school enrollment rates fell
below 50 percent, the number of schools was reduced, and schools were damaged,
destroyed, closed or used for military purposes. Teachers left the countryside. Books and
teaching materials were not available. Illiteracy rates increased. In health the situation
                                             16


was even worse: Health facilities were damaged and destroyed, the provision of health
services declined, all health indicators worsened, and life expectancy at birth declined
below 40 years. Growing mortality rates in all age groups provided a somber summary
indicator of the poor provision of health services.

3.9     The ERRC-I sought to support Government efforts to restore basic education and
health services by bringing schools and health facilities back to their original use through
repairs and reconstruction effort, better supplies, and return of teachers and doctors to
their non-urban posts where ever possible.

3.10 This effort was to be enabled by an adequate reallocation of public resources
towards education and health and other areas with the highest return. In addition, the
improved use of public resources would be achieved through better management systems
and practices in agencies responsible for allocation and utilization of budgetary resources,
and a quick introduction of new accountability procedures and systems that would
prevent leakages and shield public funds from misuse and corruption.

3.11 Under such circumstances, the National Rehabilitation and Recovery Program
appropriately identified immediate priorities centered on sustaining peace, restoring
protective, social, and economic security, and enhancing governance. The same set of
objectives was adopted by the Bank’s Interim Transition Program discussed by the Board
in December 1999 and fully embraced by the ERRC-I. The first ERRC credit was,
therefore, fully consistent with the Bank’s short-term emergency support strategy and
represented the main vehicle for providing financial assistance and policy and
institutional support. The objectives supported under ERRC-I had substantial relevance.

3.12 Design. The ERRC-I was designed as a multi-tranche budget support operation
to address the prevailing security risks and the untested ability of the national coalition
government to implement the agreed actions. The conditions for the release of three
tranches – two fixed and one floating based on performance indicators – over a 12-15
month period were based mainly on preparation and passage of legislation, administrative
and process actions and outputs. There were seven prior actions related to all three
objectives and ten additional conditions / triggers for the release of subsequent tranches.
Seven triggers (related to social and economic security and enhanced governance) needed
be met for the release of the second tranche, and additional three triggers (related to
governance) were required for the third (floating) tranche.

3.13 The President’s Report (World Bank 2000b, Annex D) identified seven
performance indicators based on data, monitoring and media reports, and special surveys.
In addition, it has also identified six specific outputs related to the achievement of key
development objectives detailed in Table 3Error! Reference source not found. above:

3.14   Objective A:
          Contribution to DDR with 2 performance indicators;

3.15   Objective B:
          Basic services re-launched with 2 performance indicators;
                                            17


          Economic activity revived with 2 performance indicators;
          Public resource management strengthened with 4 performance indicators;
          Private sector revitalized with 6 performance indicators; and

3.16   Objective C:
          Public sector corruption lowered with 3 performance indicators.
3.17 Although some of the indicators are associated with the stated development
objectives, the ERRC-I documentation does not provide an explicit results chain
connecting triggers and prior actions to key performance indicators and to outcomes. In
the absence of explicit links between process actions and conditions on the one hand, and
outcomes on the other, the relevance of selected actions cannot be demonstrated or
evaluated easily. The 17 procedural actions and conditions identified under the ERRC-I
may indeed be important and necessary for achieving certain administrative and policy
goals, but their relevance and impact can only be assessed if they are explicitly associated
with specific results. On that basis the relevance of project design is rated modest.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
3.18 This section assesses to what extent the three objectives stated in Table 3 have
been achieved and relates these outcomes to the implementation of ERRC-I supported
policy and reform actions.

3.19 Achieve protective security, peace building, and reconciliation. The
Government carried out the prior actions specified in the credit agreement (see Table 3)
and continued with the implementation of the program to retrain and build capacity in the
Sierra Leone army and the police force (Box 2). By the end of April 2000, 54 percent of
ex-government forces had been disarmed and demobilized. Demobilization of
combatants from other groups continued at a slower pace than anticipated: roughly
60 percent of the total target of 40,000 had been demobilized by end-August 2001. Partly
this was caused by the temporary disruption due to recurring hostilities in May 2000, as
many demobilized soldiers returned to combat. The DDR program was soon revised and
re-implemented. It regained positive momentum by the Credit's closure in June 2001 and
US$10 million of supplemental financing to ERRC-I was approved in September 2000.

3.20 Despite the setback caused by recurring hostilities in May 2000, the support to the
revised DDR program was soon resumed under an expanded resource envelope. This
PPAR concludes that the achievement of this objective was substantial.

Box 2. Results of the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) Program
The disarmament and demobilization of the combatants in Sierra Leone went through three
main phases. Phase I was launched during the war (September 1998 – December 1998).
Phase II commenced after the Lome peace accord (October 1999 to May 2000) and phase III
officially lasted from May 2001 – January 2002. The period from the recurrence of hostilities
in May 2000 till May 2001 was considered an Interim Phase.

The specific achievements in terms of combatants disarmed during these phases can be
summarized as follows:

By disarming 72,490 ex-combatants, the DDR program went far in excess of the original
planned figure of 45,000. The program disarmed and demobilized most of former
combatants. The only exception were 1,447 members of the former Sierra Leone Army
and or the regional forces (AFRC), who disarmed but did not demobilize as they planned
to return to the new National Army.

Demobilization was followed by a range of reinsertion and reintegration activities. Reinsertion
cash benefits were paid to almost 54,000 ex-combatants, while almost 57,000 former combatants
benefited from one or more reintegration activities offered in the areas of: (a) post-discharge
resettlement support, (b) referral and counseling services, and (c) reintegration opportunities
including short-term employment, skill acquisition, formal education and support for self-
employment provided under a Training and Entrepreneurial Program (TEP).

3.21 Promote social and economic security: The funding made available under the
Credit and conditions associated with the release of the second tranche facilitated the
provision of key social and economic services and helped the revival of economic
activity.

3.22 In the social sectors, budget allocations to education and health were substantially
increased in late 1999 and during 2000 to restore the provision of key social services
outside of Freetown where the delivery of education and health services had virtually
stopped due to large-scale destruction of infrastructure, lack of funding and of
professional staff. In the 2000-2007 period GOLS allocated between 18.1 and 22.5
percent of its recurrent expenditures on education. Despite significant annual variation,
resources dedicated to education followed an upward trend. By contrast, budget
expenditures on health peaked in 2003 and followed a downward trend since then (Figure
1).

3.23 During the Credit period (February 2000 – June 2001) access to primary health
care centers improved; universal free primary education commenced and primary school
enrollment increased by 39 percent in rural areas (Box 3); free textbooks and teaching
materials were provided to all primary and secondary schools in rural areas, and free
primary health care was extended to all school children.

Box 3. Education and health in the post-conflict period
There is limited information about primary school enrollment during the war years (1991-1999).
Estimates for academic year 1996/97 suggest primary enrollment of around 370,000. Following
the Lome peace accord the primary enrollment substantially increased to 548,000 in academic
year 1999/2000, and continued to grow in the subsequent years. Similar trends were observed in
secondary and tertiary enrollments.

3.24 Settlement of pension arrears and past due social payments provided significant
income relief to public sector pensioners and vulnerable groups in all accessible areas of
the country. At the same time foreign exchange proceeds from the Credit enabled
imports of essential consumer goods, energy, and intermediate goods needed by domestic
service providers and producers of consumer goods and food. There was a five-fold
increase in petroleum imports and a 55 percent increase in rice imports.

3.25 Government macroeconomic targets were broadly achieved in 2000 as real GDP
rose by close to 4 percent, inflation declined from almost 40 percent to zero, and the gap
between official and parallel market exchange rates narrowed significantly. The
Government maintained a solid fiscal stance and repaid loans to the banking system
owing to good revenue performance and ample external budget support. Improvements
on the expenditure side can be attributed to the implementation of a computerized
expenditure and commitment control system and completion of a verification of payroll
exercise supported under the ERRC-I.

3.26 Concerning public enterprise reform, financial and performance indicators were
published for seven public enterprises and a participative strategic plan was prepared for
the remaining Government enterprises.
                                                    21


3.27 ERRC-I played a key role in restoring macroeconomic stability necessary for the
revival of private sector activities and restoration of consumers’ and investors’
confidence.7 Consistent with the agreed conditions under the Credit and in line with the
IMF program, the Government maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic framework
throughout the Credit period which contributed to growing numbers of new businesses
and a revival of production in traditional domestic industries (food and beverages,
construction materials). Resumption of extension services and input delivery contributed
to higher agricultural output, initially in safe areas and starting in 2002 in the whole
country leading to a cumulative growth in agriculture value added of more than
76 percent in the 2002-2006 period. The settlement of private sector claims on the
Government provided a key stimulus to the private sector activity. ERRC-I played a
critical role in defining the necessary actions (the establishment of a committee, approval
of a plan for domestic arrears settlement, and development of procedures for classifying
and verifying claims) and providing the necessary funds to commence orderly
repayments of private sector claims in late 2000. Overall, the efficacy in achieving this
objective was substantial.

3.28 Promoting transparent and inclusive governance. The NRRP recognized poor
governance as one of the key reasons for the general discontent of the population,
especially in rural areas, that had contributed to the civil conflict. To get an early start in
addressing this issue, the Parliament approved an overall anti-corruption strategy
focusing on three related dimensions: (i) investigation and effective enforcement;
(ii) prevention through the elimination of opportunities for corruption and misuse of
public resources; and (iii) public education. An Anti-Corruption Act passed in February
2000 put this strategy into effect, and an Anti-Corruption Commission soon became
functional and led the implementation of the new legislation. This resulted in improved
control of corruption in 2002 (see Figure f in Box 4), which has not sustained.

3.29 In the area of prevention of corruption, a major step forward was made through
the introduction of a new computerized accounting in 2002, budget management and
expenditure control systems which provided greater transparency, efficiency, and
accountability in the use of public funds. The Government also completed a validation
and verification exercise of the personnel function to establish a "ghost-free" payroll and
eliminate the possibility payroll misuse and corruption.

3.30 The Government also conducted focus groups and a national baseline service
delivery survey, within the context of the existing Strategic Planning and Action Process
(SPP) framework, to provide baseline data for monitoring improvements in service
delivery and to establish meaningful benchmarks and accompanying strategies for
benchmark implementation.

  The return of consumer confidence is perhaps best illustrated by a one-time increase in private net
transfers from US$7.2 million in 2001 to US$98 million in 2002 (IMF 2009b, page 55). The reversal of
private financial outflows recorded during the war was reflected in a large improvement of gross national
savings from -9.5 percent of GDP in 2001 to +5.3 percent of GDP in 2002 (IMF 2009b, page. 34).

Box 4. Sierra Leone: Quality of Governance
Figures a-f provide a time series of six aggregate governance indicators for Sierra Leone produced by
Worldwide Governance Indicator (WGI) for the 2000-2008 period. They suggest that there were sustained
gains in voice and accountability and political stability during ERR operations. By contrast, improvements
in the control of corruption recorded in 2002 and 2004 were not sustained in the subsequent years.

3.31 These measures were all supported by the ERRC-I and represented the second
tranche conditions. Their efficacy appears quite high on the process level but this does
not guarantee the achievement of the objective of reducing corruption. Direct evidence
on achievement of this objective is unavailable until 2003 or even 2004. Data for the
period covered by ERRC-I (2000-2001) is at best very partial, weak, and unreliable.
Overall, the efficacy in achieving the objective of promoting transparent and inclusive
governance was rated as modest.


Ratings
3.32 Outcome. Overall, the relevance of the objectives under ERRC-I is judged
substantial, but the relevance of design was modest. With respect to efficacy, the actions
carried out under ERRC-I substantially helped to achieve and sustain protective security
despite the recurring hostilities in May 2000. They also substantially improved social
and economic security though increased access to health services and education, stable
macro environment, greater availability of essential imports, and resolution of pension
and payment arrears. Finally, actions taken in the area of public sector governance were
judged to be modest as they provided some legal basis and improved process for further
improvements in governance. With appropriate content mapping between program and
project objectives, and equal weights for the three objectives, this review rates the
outcome of the first operation in the ERR program as moderately satisfactory.

3.33 Risk to Development Outcomes. The risks of sustaining the political
commitment to peace and protective security were the highest in the initial period as
demonstrated by recurring hostilities in May 2000. The initial achievement of planned
intermediate results (outputs) in the implementation of the DDR program could easily
have been reversed by a lack of political consensus. By contrast, the risks related to
economic and social security were ameliorated in the initial period as ample foreign
assistance enabled improvements in the wellbeing of the population and created a surge
of optimism and positive expectations. Over time, these risks moved in the opposite
direction.

3.34 The formation of a National Coalition Government, successful resumption of the
implementation of the DDR program and completed modernization of Sierra Leone
military and police force have cemented reforms and effectively eliminated the risk of
political instability and protective security after 2003 (see the political stability indicator
Figure b in Box 4).

3.35 The question remains as to whether actions taken under ERRC-I led to stable and
sustainable social and economic security. Advances made in the area of improved access
to social services and greater income opportunities are impressive, but levels of
educational and health outcomes and GDP per capita are still very low by both regional
and world standards. A concerted effort will be needed to consolidate the initial gains
and carefully prioritize scarce public investment resources to secure permanent advances
in the access and quality of key social services. Last but not least, growing youth
unemployment despite years of good economic performance and high growth rates,
seems by far the most serious risk going forward.
                                             24


3.36 Finally, the Government has taken a bold step in the direction of promoting
transparent and inclusive governance. A multi-pronged approach minimizes risks but
requires more time to launch the public education campaign, reduce the scope for
corruption through improved procedures and public resource management systems, as
well as initiate early legal enforcement actions. Given the size and scope of the
governance problem, significant improvements can be expected only in the medium run.

3.37 Overall, risks to development outcomes in the areas supported under the ERRC-I
have substantially declined over time and are rated as moderate.

3.38 M&E: The M&E arrangements were influenced by the stand alone nature of the
first operation, the choice of project objectives, and the incomplete development of the
results chain. Although it was clear that measurable progress towards protective,
economic and social security, and better governance would take years, the design and
implementation arrangements were limited to the project time horizon (till June 2001).
The President’s Report (World Bank 2000b, Annex D) identified seven performance
indicators related to the overall project development outcome, and a list of 19 indicators
pertaining to six outputs to be monitored during implementation.

3.39 During implementation ERRC-I collected factual data on all policy actions and a
relatively small subset of proposed output (6 out of 19) and outcome (4 out of 7)
indicators. In addition to falling significantly short of the list of indicators specified in
the project documents, the quality and reliability of monitored indicators appeared low
which explains infrequent use of monitoring results. On the positive side, ERRC-I
helped introduce a baseline survey and the first focus group survey to measure the quality
of social services which became a useful monitoring device for subsequent ERRC
operations. The Ministry of Finance, the key executing agency for the project, faced
serious capacity constraints in carrying out the M&E function on top of other
responsibilities in the broad fiscal and budgeting area. Nevertheless, the Ministry was
instrumental in developing and monitoring intermediate performance indicators not
envisaged in the original M&E design.

3.40 For these reasons M&E design, implementation and use of monitoring results
(data) are all rated modest. Overall, this review rates M&E as modest.

3.41 Bank Performance. The Bank promptly reacted to the narrow window of
opportunity created by the appointment of the National Unity Government and the
adoption of the NRRP in late 1999.

3.42 Quality at Entry: In the span of few months the Bank team was able to put
together the first ERR operation that met quality at entry requirements while allowing for
the necessary level of realism in addressing pressing security considerations on the
ground. The Bank support was fully aligned with the objectives of the national program
(NRRP), which ensured national ownership of the program’s objectives and the actions
initiated by the credit. While the areas of focus for Bank assistance in ERRC-I were fully
appropriate, realistic and duly implemented by the Government as prior actions (and
triggers for the second and the third – floating -- tranche), the program design did not
have a sufficiently developed results chain to ensure that the expected outcomes would
                                              25


indeed be achieved. First, the ERRC-I did not adequately spell out the framework for the
results chain. Second, the objectives lacked clear and measurable results indicators, even
in areas like education, health, settlement of pension and payment arrears where
quantitative indicators either existed or could be easily calculated on the basis of data
collection within the project. Third, most prior actions consisted of process actions that
did not guarantee the achievement of underlying results.

3.43 Quality of Supervision: During supervision, the Bank team continued productive
follow-up dialogue with the key implementing agencies to ensure implementation of
agreed actions and achievement of project objectives.

3.44 In summary, due to weaknesses in the results framework, this review rates Bank
performance in securing quality at entry as moderately satisfactory. The Bank discharged
satisfactory supervision effort during a difficult time marked by the resumption of
hostilities in May 2000. Overall, this review rates Bank performance as moderately
satisfactory.

3.45 Borrower Performance. The Credit was largely based on the Government’s
NRRP which fully utilized a program of national consultations launched before the Lome
peace accord was signed. The Borrower was fully committed to its reform program and
demonstrated continued strong ownership through all stages of project preparation and
implementation. This was best demonstrated during the upheaval of May 2000, when the
Government made the necessary adjustments and continued to implement its recovery
and reform program while maintaining a sound macroeconomic framework and
delivering fully on substantive commitments outlined in the LDP. Reforms were
undertaken in a transparent fashion, and frequently benefited from participatory
exercises, including surveys, workshops, and focus group discussions, to ensure broad
public consensus.

3.46 Despite obvious capacity constraints, the Ministry of Finance put in an enormous
effort in facilitating the implementation of reforms supported under the ERRC-I. All
policy documents prepared for GOSL consideration and approval were of high quality.
The Ministry of Finance worked closely with the Bank in developing and implementing
four broad sets of intermediate performance indicators to regularly monitor progress
towards the program's goals. In addition, the Government produced and disseminated
regular monthly financial monitoring reports, including reports on the use of donor funds.
The Borrower implemented the program with vigor, often exceeding the required
conditions for tranche releases, and fully upheld the agreed reforms and policy measures.

3.47 Based on its strong commitment to NRRP development objectives supported
under the ERRC-I and ability to prevail during the time of instability caused by the
reemergence of fighting, Government performance is rated as satisfactory. The
performance of the Ministry of Finance as the implementing agency is also rated
satisfactory based on its relentless efforts to sustain the reform effort despite adverse
circumstances and its own capacity constraints. Overall, this review rates Borrower
performance as satisfactory.
                                                                               26


4. Second Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit
Objectives and Components

4.1    The Second Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit (ERRC-II) continued
the support to the NRRP as it evolved into an Interim PRSP (I-PRSP). ERRC-II was also
conceived as a stand-alone operation under a forthcoming Transitional Support Strategy.

4.2      Objectives. The four objectives established under ERRC-II are closely related to
and build upon the set of objectives defined in ERRC-I. As detailed in the President’s
Report (World Bank 2001, Annex B), the ERRC-II objectives were: (a) Improved
national security and good governance, (b) Revival of the economy to be achieved by
facilitating private sector development in a stable macro environment; (c) Improved
public expenditure management for efficient and equitable use of public resources; and
(d) Better access to basic social services.

4.3     Components. The ERRC-II consisted of 6 core conditions (prior actions) that the
Government carried out prior to Board presentation of the Program Document, and four
conditions for the second tranche release. Table 7 lists the objectives, action areas and
conditions of the credit. The subsequent section on achievement of objectives discusses
further achievement and efficacy. The credit was approved on December 13, 2001,
became effective on December 20, 2001, disbursed in two tranches as scheduled and
closed on March 30, 2003, as planned.

Relevance of Objectives and Design
4.4     Objectives. ERRC-II was a policy-based credit designed to provide critical
budget support related to the implementation of the Government’s first Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP) after the civil war. ERRC-II built on the design and results
achieved under the ERRC-I and closely mirrored the strategic objectives of the I-PRSP:
to firmly establish national security and good governance, revive the economy and
restore basic social services throughout the country.

4.5      ERRC-II proceeds provided critical balance of payments and budget support to
cover the increased costs associated with the implementation of the I-PRSP. Most
notably, the proceeds allowed continued imports of essential consumer goods, energy and
raw materials. They also enabled the Government to continue the rehabilitation of basic
social and economic infrastructure and secure improved delivery of basic social services
in all accessible parts of the country.

4.6      On the Bank side, the ERRC-II was fully aligned with the Transitional Support
Strategy (discussed by the Board in December 2000) and carried the brunt of the TSS
initial implementation effort. Jointly with the Bank-financed Community Reintegration
and Rehabilitation project and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund administered by the Bank,
ERRC-II was expected to provide both the critical financial support to the budget and
substantive assistance in the design, implementation and monitoring of the national
priorities identified in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (I-PRSP), which
essentially continued to support the same security priorities identified in the National
Rehabilitation and Recovery Program. The first I-PRSP pillar focused on protective
security (i.e. the completion of the DDR Program), but it also included essential
improvements in the public governance. The second pillar emphasized economic
security (revival of economic growth). Finally, the third pillar supported social aspects of
security (access to social services).

4.7     The ERRC-II credit represented the main vehicle for providing financial
assistance and policy and institutional support to Sierra Leone under the TSS. ERRC-II
continued the good practice established in the first operation by helping the Government
in prioritizing and sequencing actions and steps needed to successfully implement the I-
PRSP and achieve its objectives under very challenging circumstances, and, hence, had
substantial relevance.

4.8     Design. The ERRC-II design followed the national priorities set forth in the I-
PRSP, but also reflected the implementation experience of ERRC-I and other operational
considerations. Instead of following the structure based on three security pillars
advanced in the I-PRSP, ERRC-II additionally recognized public expenditure
management as a fourth objective. As detailed in Table 7, the first and third I-PRSP
pillars were directly mapped into the first and fourth ERRC-II objectives, respectively,
while the second I-PRSP pillar (re-launching the economy) was broken down into two
separate development objectives under ERRC-II: revival of the economy, focused on
establishing conditions for sustainable economic growth; and improved public
expenditure management, primarily focused on public expenditure stability and
                                             29


predictability (through an Medium Term Expenditure Framework - MTEF), reallocation
of budget resources towards social and economic sectors, and greater financial
accountability.

4.9     Given that the additional Public Expenditure Management (PEM) objective was
heavily based on selected governance considerations, this led to an asymmetric treatment
of governance in ERRC-I and II. In ERRC-I, governance was merged with the
“protective security pillar” and it included a subset of cross cutting thematic issue
pertaining to all aspects of security (i.e. the general aspects of governance, quality of the
budget process, and quality of service delivery). In ERRC-II, few aspects of governance
considerations were selected to underpin the improved public expenditure management
(through the introduction of MTEF and FIS mechanisms to ensure greater financial
accountability). It is not clear why governance did not continue to be treated either as an
integrated separate objective, like in ERRC-I, or as a true cross-cutting theme (as an
additional consideration that augments each of the three security pillars). The approach
chosen in ERRC-II aimed to emphasize selected aspects of the public expenditure side of
governance at the cost of sacrificing clarity, consistency with the government program,
and continuity with ERRC-I.

4.10 Prior actions and tranche release conditions listed in Table 8 were mostly process-
oriented. The results chain was poorly defined or missing entirely, making it very
difficult to relate policy and institutional actions to performance indicators, and to
monitor outcomes. Therefore, this review rates the relevance of design as modest.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
4.11 Overall, the government carried out all the agreed prior actions and met the
conditions for the release of the second tranche in a timely and responsive fashion,
making the necessary adjustments to evolving circumstances, and often exceeding the
extent of agreed interventions.

4.12 Promoting National Security and Good Governance. The program supported
the Government’s effort to establish peace and strengthen governance. The objective
was substantively achieved:

               Demobilization of ex-combatants and reform of security forces: Peace
                and security in the country were gradually consolidated through
                continued implementation of the DDR program covering 72,490 ex-
                combatants; by the end of the ERRC-II in 2002, the DDR program was
                completed, while the military forces and police had been restructured
                (refer back to Box 2);

               Decentralization of government functions: Decentralization, seen by
                many as essential for peace consolidation, had been successfully achieved
                by strengthening local governments and decentralizing government
                functions to local levels. Paramount chiefs had been elected and
                preparations for local government, municipal, and rural council elections
                were held in late 2003. This contributed to a substantial devolution of
                                                  30


                  powers to chiefdoms and local councils and provided critical support in
                  improving public expenditure management based on more decentralized
                  preparation and execution of the budget.8

                 Budgetary transparency: Transparency in the budget process was
                  increased by the creation of Budgetary Oversight Committees (BOC), its
                  activities in the determination of priorities in MTEF process, and by the
                  regular production of monthly budgetary monitoring reports; and

                 Participatory budget outcome tracking: Tracking expenditures from
                  central to regional and local levels was improved by setting up a
                  participatory system of Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS).

4.13 Despite the apparent lack of specific performance indicators, based on
documented progress in achieving the four components, this review concludes that
efficacy for this objective was substantial.

4.14 Reviving the Economy. The operation sought to: support the Government in
securing a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to private sector growth and
foreign investment; reform public enterprises; foster development of formal activities in
the mining sector; secure greater access to micro-financial services; and support
resettlement and reintegration program.

4.15 As detailed below, during the life of the project, satisfactory progress was
achieved under each of the five components, and the objective of reviving the economy
was substantially achieved:

                 Economic growth and macroeconomic stability: During 2002 GDP grew
                  by 6.3 percent. Macroeconomic stability was maintained throughout the
                  year: The price level was lowered by 3.1 percent (deflation) and the
                  fiscal deficit was below 10 percent of GDP, below projected and well
                  within the available external financing;

                 Improved access to micro-finance services: A new micro-finance policy
                  framework was adopted by the Cabinet;

                 Increased scope for formal activities in mining: A new mining policy
                  framework was adopted by the Cabinet in 2002 leading to a substantial
                  increase in official mining activities and exports; 9

                 Resettlement of ex-combatants and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs):
                  The Resettlement, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation (RRR) program for
                  ex-combatants, refugees and IDPs was successfully implemented through

  The official diamond mining output (measured in carats) increased seven times between 2000 and 2003.
IMF 2009b, Table 3, page. 37. During the same time period the US$ value of official diamond exports
increased almost eight times and further tripled in the 2003-2007 period.

                   re-integration payments, training and employment programs (under
                   another Bank-financed project, the beneficiaries were provided in
                   addition farm inputs, and extension services – see Box 2);10 and

                  Advanced public enterprise (PE) divestiture: Progress under the PE
                   divestiture strategy lagged behind because the detailed plan for a full
                   implementation of the strategy was not prepared.

4.16 While the program helped achieve many of the planned policy inputs (approval of
the necessary legislation and policy documents) and selected outputs, the effect of these
actions on the outcome (sustainable economic revival) is more difficult to establish. As
already analyzed in Chapter 2, strong revival of the economy that took place in the 2001-
2003 period was, indeed, partly due to growth in formal mining production and exports
supported under ERRC-II. Another basis for attributing economic revival to ERRC-II
policies is the underlying support to improved efficiency found to be the major source of
growth.11

4.17     Overall, efficacy in achieving economic revival is rated substantial.

4.18 Improving Public Expenditure Management: The objective of improving
public expenditure management was to be achieved through:

                  The adoption of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in
                   2001 and its use in the preparation of the 2001 and 2002 budgets. This
                   helped improve budget planning and priority allocation of resources over
                   a three-year time horizon leading to enhanced efficiency and
                   effectiveness of public expenditures.12 The capacity to effectively use
                   MTEF in the budget process was gradually transferred from the Ministry
                   of Finance to all participating ministries and later on to lower levels of
                   government;

                  Modernization of financial information and management systems: The
                   ERRC-II helped initiate the review of the existing system and implement
                   minimal revisions and updates needed to sustain its operation in the short
                   run. Country Financial and Accountability Assessment conducted in
                   2002 found weaknesses in the structure and functionality and
                   recommended improvements which were implemented during 2004-2005
                   period.13

   The relevance of resettlement programs for economic revival is two-fold: On the one hand these
programs contributed to improved security (particularly in rural areas) as a precondition for normalization
of economic activities. On the other they enabled the return of internally displaced people to their land and
provided them with the necessary training, extension services and initial resources to resume farming and
non-farming activities.

                 Improved allocation of budget funds: Allocation and utilization of budget
                  funds were improved through the budget oversight committees and
                  PETS.14 The surveys identified considerable leakages in education and
                  health sector and enabled significant savings.15

4.19 The institutional reforms, policy inputs and outputs supported under ERRC-I
clearly made a positive contribution towards improving systems for public expenditure
management. However, in the absence of clear performance indicators, it remains
unclear to what extent the specific improvements supported under this operation led to
more efficient management and use of public resources and the achievement of improved
availability and quality of key public services. Overall, efficacy in achieving improved
public expenditure management is rated modest.

4.20 Improving Access to Social Services. Improving access to social services was
partially achieved. The program sought to improve access to and the quality of education
and of health care, and to improve access to and equity in the use of water and sanitation.
Specifically:

                 Restoration of budget flows throughout the country: In the 2002 budget,
                  non-wage current expenditures for the social sectors were restored to
                  their normal pre-war levels throughout the country, including in
                  provinces not under the control of the Government during the conflict
                  where expenditures were at zero levels through 2001;

                 Free primary education: In 2002, free primary education was extended to
                  all grades and the program of subsidizing books and teaching materials
                  was extended to all parts of the country;

                 Nutrition and health programs in schools: The funding was restored for
                  the provision of school nutrition and health programs in the four pilot
                  provinces which was an important contributing factor to higher
                  enrollment and attendance rates; and

                 Improved water and sanitation services: Two-thirds of the 2002 budget
                  allocation for the Ministry of Energy and Power was used to improve
                  water supply and expand services throughout the country, including in
                  major provincial towns. The results are not visible yet.16



14
   PETS have been designed in consultation with the civil society to follow the expenditure flows and to
assess improvements in service delivery. The first survey was piloted in 2000 followed by a large scale
exercise in 2001 which had limited coverage due to ongoing conflict. PETS with improved design were
being implemented on an annual basis since September 2003.
15
   The Public expenditure review (World Bank 2004b) documents a case of reducing a leakage in school
subsidies from 55 to 22 percent based on the PETS findings.
16
   The latest MDG data for 2006 show that only 53 percent of the population has access to safe drinking
water and 12 percent has access to modern sanitation. Human development report (UNDP 2007) indicates
a slightly higher number with access to safe water (59 percent) with a considerable difference between
urban (74 percent) and rural (46 percent) population.

4.21 The very limited data available suggest that in many of the targeted areas results
have not been achieved. On that basis the review concludes that efficacy in achieving the
objective of improved access to social services was modest.

Ratings
4.22 Outcome. The relevance of ERRC-II objectives was substantial, but the
relevance of design was modest. The efficacy in achieving greater security and better
governance and in reviving the economy was substantial, while the achievements in the
area of improved public expenditure management and improved access to social services
were modest. In a precarious post-conflict situation the achievements in the area of
improved security (full demobilization, greater decentralization, and participatory budget
process) and revival of economic growth (macroeconomic stability, efficiency and
productivity gains) deserve greater weight as they pave the way to stable long-term
development. Overall, therefore, this review rates the outcome of ERRC-II as
moderately satisfactory.

4.23 Risk to Development Outcome. The security, political and economic conditions
in Sierra Leone temporarily deteriorated during the ERRC-I implementation due to the
resumption of hostilities in May 2000, but then steadily improved following
Government’s demonstrated ability to adjust to changing circumstances and continue to
deliver on all agreed actions. This trend of improvement was continued into ERRC-II.
Security risks almost disappeared in 2002 after the completion of the DDR program.
Strong economic recovery during 2001-2003 led to higher incomes and improved
wellbeing of the population, thereby significantly lowering social tensions and risks of
public unrests. The internal political support was broadened through successful
decentralization efforts (restoration of chiefdoms, local elections, participatory budget
process and gradual devolution of expenditure management). The extensive international
support and favorable external economic environment also contributed to lowering risks
to achievements under ERRC-II.

4.24 Overall, the review concludes that the risk to outcomes for ERRC-II is marginally
lower than the previous operation and rates the risk to development outcome as moderate.

4.25 M&E: Instead of sustaining and improving the M&E arrangements established
under the first operation, the ERRC-II project document defined a new set of outcome
and output indicators. The document identified the likely sources of monitoring
data/information, but did not explicitly specify detailed M&E arrangements or position
the set of indicators in a transparent causal results chain from intervention to outcomes.
Specifically, the President’s Document produced a list of seven outcome indicators and
an identified five outputs to be monitored via a set of 21 indicators. Four out of five
proposed output indicators substantively coincided with project objectives: improved
governance; economic revival; strengthened PRM; and better access to social services.
The fifth, “improved business environment and revitalized private sector”, subsumed
under the “economic revival” objective, was singled out as a separate monitoring item to
emphasize the importance of private sector development. Unfortunately, the
comprehensive set of performance indicators was mostly focused on process actions (and
documents), with only implicit linkages to the achievement of related objectives.
                                            34


4.26 During implementation ERRC-II diligently collected factual data on all policy
actions and most of the proposed indicators (six out of seven proposed outcome
indicators, and 18 out of 21 output indicators). Unfortunately, the four missed indicators
appear highly relevant for the achievement of project objectives:

          Reduction in the number of violent military clashes;
          Availability of micro-credit services;
          Simplified procedure for registration of businesses; and
          Pass rate for national basic certificate examination.

4.27 The quality and reliability of indicators was improved compared to the previous
operation. The baseline and the first focus group surveys introduced under ERRC-I
enabled the measurement of the delivery and quality of social services. Capacity
constraints faced by the Ministry of Finance were gradually removed regarding its direct
role in M&E as the key executing agency for the project, but remained regarding its
broader responsibility (to build capacity in all other ministries and agencies). The
effective use of M&E data increased but still remains low.

4.28 Allowing for limitations caused by project design and very difficult post-conflict
situation prevailing on the ground, the M&E design, implementation and use are all rated
modest. Overall, this review rates the M&E as modest.

4.29 Bank Performance: Bank performance is judged largely on the basis of: (a) its
ability to ensure quality at entry while reacting promptly to fast evolving country needs
and allowing for the necessary level of realism in a post-conflict situation; and (b)
securing quality implementation of agreed actions through continued productive follow-
up dialogue with the key implementing agencies and capacity-building effort.

4.30 Quality at Entry. ERRC-II identification was consistent with the Government’s
development priorities, and with the Bank’s transitional support strategy for Sierra
Leone. The Bank supported local teams in project preparation and supplied specialized
expertise when and where needed. The overall project design was adequate. The Bank
reacted in a timely fashion and paid particular attention to the borrower’s institutional
weaknesses and capacity constraints. Appropriate arrangements were made to address
them by providing timely advice, building capacity and ensuring support from other
donors. This resulted in improved design of policy actions and implementation measures,
and easily measurable performance indicators. The results matrix was spelled out with
more clarity than in the first operation, although the results chain remained
underspecified. The choice of the lending instrument a two-tranche stand-alone
adjustment budget support credit) was effective and appropriate given the circumstances.
A programmatic PRSC would have been a better fit for the country needs (to secure a
medium-term financing for large structural budget deficit, as well as obtain credible
policy and institutional support necessary to reverse the negative impact of the conflict,
secure peace, stability and economic revival). Unfortunately, in the absence of a clear
and firm medium-term PRSP framework and a full-fledged CAS based on it, the optimal
multi-year approach was not feasible under IDA resource allocation rules. The Bank
team has to be commended for making an extra effort to substantively approximate the
                                           35


policy and institutional continuity of a programmatic approach through a series of
evolving multi-tranche stand-alone operations.

4.31 Quality of Supervision. The Bank mounted a significant supervision effort
(comprising three full team missions and two additional sector missions) to sustain
quality dialogue, ensure timely implementation, and provide specific assistance and
expertise as needed (particularly in the areas of privatization, micro-financing,
community participation and mining development). Joint missions with the Fund (to
ensure the introduction of the MTEF and quality budget preparation and review) are
particularly noteworthy. Coordination with multilateral and bilateral agencies was well
organized; inter-agency cooperation was close and productive.

4.32 In summary, due to design weaknesses, the Bank secured moderately satisfactory
quality at entry and provided satisfactory supervision effort. The Bank’s overall
performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

4.33 Borrower Performance. The Credit supported the Government’s evolving
national program which built on the initial NRRP, the difficult implementation
experience during 2000 and the need to quickly consolidate security gains and stabilize
the economic and social situation in the country. Although this program was still
evolving towards an Interim PRSP, the Borrower was fully committed to the reform
content of the program and actively participated in the preparation of this Credit. It
demonstrated high commitment to the objectives of its interim poverty reduction strategy
(I-PRSP) and the Bank’s Transitional Support Strategy by implementing a number of key
actions prior to Board presentation: (i) a satisfactory macroeconomic framework; (ii)
budget implementation reports for the first three quarters of 2001; (iii) public accounts
for 1999 and 2000; (iv) public expenditure tracking surveys for the first six months of
2001; and (v) a payment plan for clearing cross-debts between Government and
parastatals.

4.34 Government departments and units at the central, regional and district levels
participated actively in the rehabilitation and recovery program supported by the Credit.
The Government has actively and successfully mobilized the participation of the
population in economic recovery and rehabilitation through budget oversight committees
and expenditure tracking surveys, as well as in the implementation of its reinsertion
program for ex-combatants and displaced people.

4.35 The Borrower implemented the program with full commitment, took full initiative
to implement agreed policy actions and often exceeding the required conditions for
tranche releases, fully owned and upheld the agreed reforms and policy measures.
Overall, both the Government and the implementing agency (Ministry of Finance)
demonstrated satisfactory performance, yielding satisfactory Borrower performance.

5. Third Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit

Objectives and Components
5.1     The third ERRC operation, approved in May 2003 and closed in December 2004,
continued the support to the Government of Sierra Leone started under ERRC-I and II. It
was a quick-disbursing credit in the amount of $30 million equivalent that supported selected
aspects of the Government’s reform program spelled out in the Letter of Development
Policy.

5.2     Objectives. ERRC-III aimed to assist the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) in
moving from the transitional post-conflict phase of peace building to a medium-term phase
focused on defining a comprehensive development and poverty reduction strategy. In
addition, ERRC-III sought to provide critical knowledge and resources to finance activities
needed to consolidate progress made in governance, improve social service delivery, and
stimulate economic growth through enabling the environment for private sector-led
investment. It also aimed to help coordinate large external support and, indirectly, sustain
domestic political and broader social commitment to reform. The mapping between the three
pillars of the Government development agenda and ERRC-III objectives and sub-objectives
(components) is presented in Table 9.

5.3    Components. The ERRC-III consisted of core prior actions carried out by the
government before Bank management presented the credit to the Board and six actions which
represented conditions for the release of the second tranche. Table 10 lists the objectives,
                                                               37

Relevance of Objectives and Design
5.4     Objectives. As an integral part of the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS)
and a continuation of the program supported by the previous Economic Rehabilitation and
Recovery operations, ERRC-III followed the same reform framework and employed similar
set of objectives and with the main focus on improving governance and promoting economic
revival based on private sector development, although it merged the objectives of governance
and improved social services. In the third operation this context was further supported and
enhanced by the Consultative Group Results Framework which sets out agreed benchmarks
for and implementation status of ERRC-III and the supporting programs of other partners
including DFID, the EC, IMF, and AfDB. The objectives of ERRC III were fully relevant to
consolidating peace and stability, and improving Sierra Leone's short and longer term growth
prospects. In this respect, the relevance of objectives for the ERRC-III is rated substantial
and consistent with the previous ERRCs.

5.5     Design. The ERRC-III followed the substance of the evolving national program.
Prior actions and tranche release conditions listed in Table 10 are mostly process oriented.
The results chain is not well defined, making it very difficult to relate policy and institutional
actions to performance indicators, and to monitor outcomes. Therefore, this review rates the
relevance of design as modest.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
5.6     The credit was successful in assisting the Government of Sierra Leone as it moved to
define a comprehensive post-conflict development and poverty reduction strategy. ERRC-III
provided the necessary knowledge and resources to consolidate progress made in improving
governance and environment for private sector-led growth. Reforms and policy dialogue
supported under ERRC-III provided the basis for coordinating a large external support and,
indirectly, for sustaining domestic political and broader social commitment to reform. The
major achievements of the credit go beyond specific objectives identified in the project
documents as it provided confidence, knowledge and continuous support to the Government
team in conceptualizing, developing, sequencing and carrying through a complex set of
actions initially related to specific outputs, but subsequently leading to the achievement of
key I-PRSP and PRSP outcomes echoed in project.

5.7     Despite obvious improvements brought by the results framework adopted by the
Consultative Group, there is still a lack of a clear link between the agreed actions (prior
actions and 2nd tranche release conditions) mostly focused on policy inputs and outputs, on
the one hand, and the expected outcomes on the other. Likewise, all performance indicators
were focused on measuring outputs and there was a clear absence of well designed results
indicators for the project objectives. Limited data on outcomes and program impact available
in project documents was supplemented with data from non-project sources (often produced
long after project closure) and information collected during interviews.

5.8   With strong support from the donor community including AfDB, DfID, EC, IMF and
the World Bank, the Government made good progress in carrying out the reform program.
                                            39


5.9     Improved Governance: The specific actions listed in Table 10 have all been
achieved except the implementation of the MTEF across all ministries which was delayed
due to capacity constraints. More specifically the following actions were implemented:

     A Local Government Act was signed into law in February 2004 and the first local
      government elections in 32 years were completed in May, 2004. The Act defines the
      roles and functions of local councils, and establishes a regular election cycle. It
      mandates the fiscal and fiduciary standards, audit requirements, transparency and anti-
      corruption measures.
     Annual Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) were continued, focusing on
      transfer of budget resources for education and essential drugs. As already indicated
      (see para 4.18 and World Bank 2004) the results of PETS were used to improve
      resource transfer arrangements leading to substantially reduced leakages.
     A new organic budget law (Budgeting and Accountability Act), was approved by
      Cabinet and adopted by Parliament.
     The GOSL embarked on a comprehensive public procurement reform. A new
      procurement legislation was signed into law on December 7, 2004. The Act
      established appropriate institutional and organizational arrangements as well as clear
      and transparent procurement rules. The legislation was supported by new regulations
      and extensive training and it applied to all government ministries, all local
      governments and all parastatals that use public funds.
     Financial Management and Accounting System (FMAS) was extended to Budget Bureau
      and strengthened through improved documentation and training. In June 2005 FMAS
      was upgraded to a new and improved Integrated Financial Management Information
      System (IFMIS) financed by the Bank's separate Institutional Reform and Capacity
      Building project.

5.10 On that basis, the review concludes that the efficacy in achieving the improved
governance objective was modest.

5.11 Stimulating Economic Growth: The Government pursued a two-track support to
economic growth by securing a stable macroeconomic environment and continuing structural
reforms.

5.12 The Government had an impressive performance in sustaining macroeconomic
stability and growth. It successfully completed six reviews under the PRGF. In 2003 and
2004 GDP grew stronger than expected: 9.3 percent and 7.4 percent respectively. The
sustained post-conflict recovery was based on consumption growth, large-scale resettlement
and reconstruction activities, and major increases in land under cultivation. Strong demand
growth was largely financed by donor contributions, but new stability and broadly sound
economic policies contributed to increased investor confidence, large tourism revenues and
growing remittances. As a result, actual external and fiscal deficits were lower than
projected, but still very high. For 2004, the current account deficit was 11.5 percent of GDP
(well below the projected 16.3 percent of GDP), mainly due to higher exports of diamonds;
the fiscal deficit fell somewhat but remained at 20.2 percent of GDP. Lack of fuller fiscal
adjustment, external shocks and delays in aid disbursements led to higher inflation (14.2
                                                 40


percent), pushed up interest rates and created foreign exchange pressures (leading to
depreciation).

5.13     The following structural reforms were launched during ERRC-III:

        A new Investment Code (enacted in August 2004) contained specific provisions on
         investment procedures, incentives, guarantees and the settlement of disputes. More
         transparent and predictable procedures and the removal of discretionary powers from
         officials were expected to create a level playing field and attract more investors.
        GOSL (National Revenue Authority) completed a study and implementation plan on
         the economic and fiscal impact of the adoption of common external tariffs (CET)
         among West African States (ECOWAS). The CET were expected to promote exports
         from Sierra Leone to the region and lower the cost of business through duty free
         imports from ECOWAS member countries. The CET was implemented from January
         2005, making Sierra Leone the first ECOWAS country to implement the CET.
        The National Commission for Privatization (NCP) prepared a comprehensive
         implementation plan for the Government’s divestiture strategy. NCP commissioned a
         proposal to privatize the Ports Authority, and established a joint venture company to
         create an economic and free trade zone. In synch with the completion of a new
         electricity law which envisaged the establishment of a regulatory body, NCP
         evaluated management contract bids for the National Power Authority (NPA).
        GOSL also completed three reforms to facilitate private investment in the mining
         sector, historically a key sector for growth, exports and job creation in Sierra Leone.
         The reforms included: (i) the installation of a GIS and GPS-based mining cadastre
         that would enable effective administration and enforcement of mineral rights;17 (ii)
         the approval of a new core mineral policy aimed at creating an internationally
         competitive legal and regulatory environment; and (iii) improved extension services
         to miners based on the hiring of 30 additional mine wardens and the creation of a
         specialized unit within the Ministry to provide extension services for improved
         identification of best reserve areas, enhanced mine planning and processing activities,
         improved mine safety and adherence to labor standards, improved metal and mineral
         marketing and assistance with reclamation and rehabilitation of mined out areas.

5.14 On that basis this review concludes that efficacy in stimulating economic growth was
substantial.

Ratings
5.15 Outcome. In a precarious post-conflict situation prevailing in the country, policy
actions taken under ERRC-III represented important policy and institutional reform inputs,
and indispensable outputs that would enable the achievement of project outcome in the


17
  With assistance from DfID and UNDP, the Ministry of Mining and Resources (MMR) began work on a
mining cadastral system in August 2004. The new GIS-GPS system has been populated with preliminary data.
MMR staff has been trained and assigned to work on the cadastre. Support procedures and changes in
regulations have been drafted.
                                            41


future. As already indicated, the results chain linking actions to outputs and outcomes could
have been developed more fully and, hence, facilitate accurate monitoring of outcome
performance indicators in a difficult situation on the ground. Taking into account substantial
relevance of objectives and achievement of economic growth objective, but modest relevance
of design and the achievement of the governance objective, this review rates the outcome of
ERRC-III as moderately satisfactory.

5.16 Risk to Development Outcome. The ERRC-III continued to build on the design and
implementation experience from previous operations, as well as reflect the changes in the
evolving medium-term national development and poverty reduction strategy. Although the
ERRC-III focused on only two objectives, compared to four objectives in ERRC-II, the
content at the component level and the nature of the prior and tranche release actions
remained essentially unchanged in most areas. One notable exception is protective security
where the situation has improved significantly and no longer represented a high risk. Actions
taken to enhance local government, secure broad participation in the budget process, and
ensure orderly procurement and financial management practices received wide support and
growing ownership. Associated risks of possible reversals therefore diminished. Similarly,
actions taken to stimulate private-sector based economic growth received growing
acceptance, particularly regarding improvements in the investment climate, creation of
mining cadastre, and mining extension services. The review considers the challenges faced
by ERRC-III to be very similar or lower than the challenges faced by the first two operations
and rates the risk to development outcome as moderate.

5.17 M&E: M&E arrangements proposed under ERRC-III made an effort to establish
continuity with the two previous operations. The ERRC-III defined a new and indeed
improved, but complex system of indicators and benchmarks to monitor the achievement of
agreed actions and project objectives. They included:

          Matrix of policy actions (World Bank 2003c, Annex B) containing mapping
           between two objectives structured via 11 strategies and measures, 25 actions
           under ERRC-I, II and III, and 14 expected outcomes;

          The multi-donor Consultative Group Results Framework containing 27 specific
           benchmarks;

          A set of 16 key performance indicators for activities and outputs envisaged under
           the two development objectives (World Bank 2005c, Annex 1).

5.18 Expectedly, the project documents did not resolve possible overlaps and
inconsistencies between the three sources, nor specify the details of the M&E arrangements
that would provide guidance in resolving these and other pending issues including the
missing elements in the causal results chain from intervention to outcomes. Most
performance indicators continued to be focused on processes, laws and policy documents.
Modest monitoring expectations are partly understandable in difficult post-conflict situation
prevailing on the ground.
                                            42


5.19 During implementation, ERRC-III was committed to follow the same pattern already
established under ERRC-I and II in collecting the factual data on all process actions and
proposed performance indicators. The quality and reliability of indicators was hard to
evaluate as they were not reported in the supervision or the completion reports. It was
expected that the ongoing PETS surveys would provide important additional information
related to the quality of public services.

5.20 Given the proposed improvements, M&E design is rated as substantial. M&E
implementation and utilization are rated as modest. Overall, this review rates M&E
arrangements as modest.

5.21 Bank Performance: Bank performance is again judged largely on the basis of: (a) its
ability to ensure quality at entry while reacting promptly to country needs and being realistic
about the country circumstances; and (b) securing quality implementation of agreed actions
through continued productive follow-up dialogue with the key implementing agencies and
capacity-building effort.

5.22 Quality at Entry. The credit was prepared in close partnership with the Government
with participation from several donors on specific issues (EU on financial management, DfID
on PETS, USAID on mining extension service, and IMF on the PRGF). The Bank had a
consistently good working relationship with the Borrower during preparation and appraisal.
Extensive stakeholder consultations were also made during preparation. The Country
Director, TTL, and the task team were highly committed to the objectives of the credit, and
they were flexible and responsive to local needs. The project received a satisfactory rating
from QAG for the quality at entry, praising the quality of the team, documentation and
efficient preparation (less than three months). QAG stressed as particularly noteworthy
“team’s ability to place the whole operation within an honest and realistic framework of risk
and risk management” associated with a post-conflict situation. In that context, the Bank
could have done better in recognizing the ministerial conflict over the provisions of the
Investment Code and in better communicating the technical and financial requirements of
some complex reforms (such as the mining cadastre). Taking into account continued
weaknesses in the results framework, the Bank provided moderately satisfactory quality at
entry.

5.23 Quality of Supervision. The Bank's performance during the implementation of the
credit was satisfactory. The credit received close and detailed supervision with the cost that
rightly exceeded the original supervision budget. This enabled early detection of
implementation problems and adequate corrective action in close collaboration with the
Borrower and other development partners. The collaboration proved critical in addressing a
variety of difficult implementation issues (such as preparation of mining cadastre and new
Investment Code). This review concurs with the ICR that the Bank could have helped the
Government better plan implementation costs for complex legal and institutional reforms and
properly include them in the budget or identify alternative sources of donor financing and
technical assistance as necessary.

5.24 The Bank’s overall performance in both securing quality at entry and supervision is
rated moderately satisfactory.
                                           43


5.25 Borrower Performance. The Borrower was consistently committed to the
objectives of the credit. This commitment was strengthened through leadership at the highest
level of Government and an active role in the coordination of all donor assistance.

5.26 Strong ownership of the project and commitment to ERRC-III objectives translated
into strong implementation performance. The Government made good progress in
maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment and carrying out the agreed reform
program described in the Letter of Development Policy. With strong support from the donor
community the Government was resolved to consolidate peace and gains in governance, and
improve the wellbeing of the population through private-sector based economic revival and
provision of basic social services. Government performance is, therefore, rated satisfactory.

5.27 Some implementation difficulties were encountered due to inadequate availability of
budget and human resources to cover all implementation costs and overcome capacity
constraints to implement agreed reforms on a timely basis. Nevertheless, the Ministry of
Finance implemented the program with full commitment, took full initiative to implement
agreed policy actions, fully owned and upheld the agreed reforms and policy measures. The
implementing agency performance is rated satisfactory.

5.28   Overall, Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Fourth Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Grant

Background
6.1     The Grant was the fourth in a series of ERR operations designed to help Sierra Leone
emerge from a decade of civil war. While the initial two operations were primarily aimed at
short-term objectives of securing peace and stability, and supporting post-conflict
reconstruction, ERRC-III started supporting the move towards a medium-term development
and poverty reduction phase. This effort was continued in the ERRG-IV Grant which helped
the Government of Sierra Leone make the transition from post-conflict recovery to
sustainable development in the context of the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)
finalized in February 2005 and discussed by the Bank and IMF Boards in April 2005.

6.2     The first post-conflict country assistance strategy for the FY06-09 period was
prepared soon thereafter and discussed by the Board in June 2005. The new CAS was fully
aligned with the PRS and its main thrust was to launch a PRSP-based development
framework supported, inter alia, by a programmatic series of three IDA Credits (FY07-09).
Thus, the ERRG-IV Grant, approved in June 2005 and closed in June 2006, was conceived as
a single tranche operation acting as a link between the ERRC series and the new
programmatic series. This provided a much needed longer-term framework and enabled and
improved results orientation absent from the previous operations. The Grant was designed to
provide quick-disbursing budget support for the 2005 budget and cover policy reforms to be
implemented in the 12-month period from June 2005.

Objectives and components
6.3     Objectives. The over-arching objective of ERRG-IV was to help GOSL make the
transition from short-term post-conflict recovery to medium-term sustainable development
framework defined in the new PRS. This was expected to be achieved by promoting: (a)
increased capacity for good governance; (b) economic growth led by the private sector; and
(c) human resource development. Table 11 maps the ERRG-IV objectives to the main pillars
of the PRSP.

6.4      Components. ERRG-IV had eight core prior actions that the government met prior to
Bank management presenting the operation to the Board. They supported the first two pillars
of the PRS and sought to contribute to the achievement of seven out of 11 sub-objectives
identified in the PRS program document. In addition ERRG-IV included 10 triggers for the
start of a series of programmatic operations to be supported under the new CAS, as well as
19 other agreed actions (Milestones) with the Government designed to foster the institutional
and policy reforms supported under current and future Bank operations.

Relevance of Objectives and Design
6.5     Objectives: The relevance of the objectives was substantial. The objectives of the
Grant and the areas of reform supported by the project were consistent with the
Government’s PRSP and with the priorities identified in the Bank's 2006-2009 CAS. As
indicated in Table 12, ERRG-IV objectives were fully aligned with the three pillars of the
PRSP (governance, security and peace; pro-poor sustainable growth for food security and job
creation; and human resources development). They were also relevant to the economic and
social circumstances prevailing in the country at the time and remain so.

6.6        Design: The design of the project was also substantially relevant:

           a single tranche operation was an appropriate instrument to conclude the initial series
            of economic recovery and rehabilitation operations and pave the way to
            programmatic Credits under the new CAS;
           the timing and the amount of the Grant were well calibrated to meet the expected
            financing gap for 2005;
           policy actions (Table 12) were relevant for the improved governance, pro-poor
            sustainable economic growth, and human development;18
           reforms supported under the Grant rightly focused on the decentralization agenda,
            public financial management (PFM) and on the important mining sector;
           the triggers for the future programmatic operations were well aligned with the
            actions taken prior to Board approval, albeit the time allowed for the preparation and
            submission of agreed legislation to Parliament proved not be realistic;
           expected reforms in education and health supported under ERRG-IV were fairly
            limited (with no prior actions or triggers) but secured continuity with previous
            operations and stressed the importance of the future HR development agenda;
           a more developed results framework was provided with specific performance
            indicators focused on the achievement of project objectives (World Bank, 2005d,
            Annex 3); and
           actual risks were well evaluated.


6.7     Considering the circumstances, the ERRG-IV was well and realistically designed. It
struck the right balance in seeking important and ambitious but still doable reforms,
introducing the right level of complexity in policy and institutional reforms, and realistically
identifying and managing risks.

     No policy actions were envisaged for the human resource development objective.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
6.8      The Grant continued the support initiated under previous ERRCs and assisted the
Government in moving from the short-term transitional post-conflict phase of peace building
to a medium-term phase focused on defining a comprehensive development and poverty
reduction strategy. The Grant provided critical knowledge and budget support resources
needed to increase capacity for better governance, support pro-poor economic growth based
on private sector-led investment, and enhance human resource development through health
and education services. The Grant also provided a platform for sustaining the Bank’s
valuable input into coordinating large external support and, indirectly, sustaining domestic
political and broader social commitment to reform. Much like the previous operations in the
series, the major achievements of ERRG-IV went beyond specific project objectives and
standard capacity building efforts. The Bank team was able to sit on the same side of the
table with the Government team and provide them with the necessary support in finalizing
the first PRSP, developing and implementing a consistent set of actions initially supporting
specific outputs, and leading to the achievement of key PRSP outcomes in the longer run.
This support was of particular importance at the point of starting the implementation of a
comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, which put additional burden on GOSL’s limited
capacity and necessitated continuous leadership and quality oversight.

6.9     As detailed below, on the governance side, the activities included improved budget
process, further decentralization efforts, development of an organization structure for a
comprehensive procurement reform, improvements financial management and audit
functions. Concurrently, economic growth was supported through macroeconomic stability,
import tariff reform, company and bankruptcy legislation, and improved environment for
mining activities (mining cadastre and extension services). Despite the apparent lack of
explicit actions in health and education, support to human resource development was
sustained through improved budget allocations and continued monitoring through PETS
surveys. As before, the grant provided foreign exchange resources for imports of essential
consumer goods, energy and intermediate goods.

6.10 Based on improvements brought by the integrated Consultative Group (CG) result
framework and the comprehensive assessment contained in the full PRSP document, a gap
between process oriented actions and outcomes was largely closed in the fourth ERR. Unlike
previous ERR operations focused on policy actions and institutional inputs, ERRG-IV
developed a fuller results framework with performance indicators focused on the
achievement of project objectives (World Bank, 2005d, Annex 3).

6.11 Improved Governance: As summarized in Table 11, in the governance area GOSL
implemented five prior actions for ERRG-IV and five triggers towards the next series of
development policy credits. The main achievements were:

              Improved budget process through enactment of the new Budgeting and
               Accountability Act in February 2005 and the start of the process of bringing
               existing regulation in compliance with the new Act.
                                             49


              Greater efficiency of government through creation of structures needed to
               enable decentralization / devolution of functions (for example appointment of
               Local Government Finance Committee envisaged under the Local
               Government Act of 2005) and improved transparency of local government
               transfers (publication of formulae and disclosure of the actual transfers).
               Better use of public resources through comprehensive procurement reform
               led and coordinated by the National Public Procurement Authority (NPPA),
               and implemented by procurement committees in key ministries following
               detailed procurement plans for the 2006 budget. Despite some delays and
               difficulties in hiring qualified staff, these activities have been accomplished.
              Strengthened public financial management through better staffing (qualified
               Accountant-General and deputies) and use of modern financial management
               systems (such as the new Integrated Financial Management Information
               System – IFMIS introduced under ERRC-III).
              Enhanced accountability and transparency in public resource use through
               better staffing (of the Office of the Auditor-General), the adoption of MTEF
               and continuous expenditure tracking surveys (PETS).
              More efficient public service through reformed human resource management
               was planned but did not receive adequate funding and recognition in the 2006
               budget.
6.12 Although these qualitative assessments have not been supported fully by hard
evidence collected under the project, independent sources seem to suggest a mild
deterioration in governance indicators (see the Control of Corruption Indicator in Box 4),
while perceptions from interviews in the field suggested modest improvements in the various
dimensions of the quality of governance.

6.13 Overall, the review concludes that the efficacy in achieving the improved governance
objective was modest.

6.14 Pro-Poor Sustainable Economic Growth: The Government continued to follow a
two-track support to economic growth: by securing a stable macroeconomic environment and
continuing structural reforms.

6.15 Despite increasing oil prices, Sierra Leone’s strong economic recovery continued into
2004 and 2005. Real GDP grew by over 7 percent annually completing seven years of post-
conflict growth based on increases in consumption, large-scale resettlement and
reconstruction activities, as well as strong agricultural production growth in cash crops.
Strong demand growth was still based on donor financing, but private investment, tourism
revenues and remittances gained importance. As a result, external and fiscal deficits were
lower than projected, but remain high. The current account deficit increased from 4.9
percent of GDP in 2004 to 7.3 percent in 2005 mainly due to a large increase in petroleum
price and a concurrent slight decline in diamond exports. The fiscal deficit was reduced from
6.7 percent in 2003 to 3.5 percent in 2004 and only 2.7 percent in 2005 (which is still short of
the expected target deficit of only 1.3 percent of GDP). Expenditures on health and
                                            50


education were the main reason for larger deficit as revenues fell only slightly below target.
Inflation decelerated from 14.2 percent in 2004 to 12.1 percent in 2005. There was a sharp
decrease in domestic interest rates: for example, T-bill rates fell from 28 percent in 2004 and
16 percent in 2005. The exchange rate depreciated by about 10 percent. Overall, despite
some weaknesses, the macro-economic framework remained stable and GOSL successfully
negotiated a second Three Year Arrangement under the IMF’s PRGF program in May 2006.

6.16 Although poverty remains a huge problem in Sierra Leone, the poverty headcount
improved between 2003 and 2007. Based on asset ownership, the number of people below
poverty line declined by 5.9 percentage points (from 67.5 to 61.6 percent). Based on
consumption, the poverty decline was 9.8 percentage points (from 66.4 to 56.6 percent)
confirming a pro-poor nature of GDP growth in the post-conflict years.

6.17 On the side of structural reforms, the government implemented three prior actions for
ERRG-IV and two triggers towards the next series of development policy credits. The main
achievements were:

              Improved general investment climate through: (a) adjustment of national
               tariffs to the CET ECOWAS levels which was expected to send a strong
               positive signal to regional and global investors; (b) better performance of
               public enterprises through the adoption of clear and transparent procedures for
               the privatization process; and (c) transparent environment for the operation of
               private companies through (submission to Parliament of) new company and
               bankruptcy acts.

              Greater opportunities for investment and growth in the priority mining and
               metals sectors through operation and expansion of the mining cadastre and
               mining extension services.

6.18 On that basis, the review concludes that the efficacy in achieving the objective of
providing stimulus for pro-poor private-sector based economic growth was substantial.

6.19 Human Resource Development: Although no specific prior actions or triggers were
agreed in this area, the Government continued to increasingly allocate budget resources
towards education which resulted in higher enrollment ratios (Box 3). Improvements in
indicators focusing on the quality of education are inconclusive (World Bank 2007).

6.20 By contrast, health has been receiving a stagnant or even declining share of budget
resources (see Figure 1) and most health indicators have improved only marginally, if at all.
Sierra Leone remains close to the bottom of the human development index ranking and lags
considerably behind in the achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDG) gals for
2015.

6.21 Expanded access to basic social services throughout the country and for all social
groups claimed in the second PRSP (GOSL 2009), and the use PETS surveys to constantly
monitor and improve the quality of social services are encouraging signs, but results in the
broad human development area are lagging behind.
                                            51


6.22 On that basis, the review concludes that the efficacy in achieving the objective of
supporting human resource development through basic social services was modest.

6.23 With regard to progress on triggers for the ensuing of the new series of programmatic
credits, the results are more mixed due to delays in several areas caused by weak capacity
and shortage of skills, as well as overly optimistic expectations at the time of ERRG-IV
design rather than lack of commitment or political will. Actual implementation of plans and
regulations proved to be a real challenge in post-conflict circumstances.

Ratings
6.24 Outcome. Although the project does not provide hard evidence (i.e. measurable
outcome /performance indicators) that ERRC-IV contributed to improved governance or
helped generate pro-poor sustainable economic growth, it is clear that it supported the
achievement of important policy and institutional reforms without which the achievement of
project outcomes in the future would not be possible. As in previous operations, a stronger
effort to develop more fully the results chain linking these actions to outputs and outcomes
would have been well justified, despite the fact that difficult prevailing conditions on the
ground would severely constrain accurate monitoring of reliable outcome indicators.
Overall, based on substantial relevance of objectives and design and achievement of pro-
poor sustainable growth, but only modest achievement of project objectives, mainly due to
slow progress in governance and human development, this review rates the outcome of
ERRC-IV as moderately satisfactory.

6.25 Risk to Development Outcome. On the positive side, the combination of prior
actions for the current operation and triggers for the future development policy set of credits
enhanced the scope, importance and visibility of the ERRG-IV Grant. But this also opened
certain risks inherent in the difficult leap from the short-term post-conflict recovery to
sustainable medium-term development framework. Most notably, the complexity of policy
actions and institutional reforms associated with a medium-term PRS framework increased
much faster than the available capacity and, thus, created processing and procedural
bottlenecks. This created delays, generated tensions and tested the true commitment to a
wide range of reforms aimed to improve governance, create better investment climate for
private sector-led growth, and improve access and delivery of social services. Key areas of
friction revealed in this process (i.e. the application of new procurement and financial
management rules, new company and bankruptcy legislation, and regulatory structure for the
power sector) have remained a source of risk to this day. In other areas the risks have
remained largely the same. The review considers the risks to development objectives
supported under ERRC-IV to be similar to risks faced by the previous operations and rates
the risk to development outcome as moderate.

6.26 M&E: The ERRC-IV further refined a complex system of indicators and
benchmarks introduced in the previous operation to monitor the achievement of agreed
actions, triggers, and project objectives. They included:

          A program matrix (World Bank 2005c, Annex 3) which provided a detailed
           mapping between 11 policy areas, 9 prior actions under ERRC-IV, 7 triggers for
                                            52


           the future programmatic series of credits, and 23 specific results (expected
           outcomes and/or performance indicators) to which the policy actions and triggers
           are expected to contribute; and

          The multi-donor Consultative Group Results Framework containing 27 specific
           benchmarks.

6.27 This integrated framework represented a significant step forward from ERRC-III, but
gaps still remained as project documents did not make an attempt to resolve possible overlaps
and inconsistencies between the two sources, nor specify the necessary M&E implementation
arrangements to effectively monitor outcome indicators. As a result, most performance
indicators effectively monitored were still focused on process actions (laws and documents)
and the utilization remained sporadic.

6.28 In short, ERRC-IV was committed to follow a more ambitious exercise of collecting
data on policy actions and triggers, as well as the proposed performance indicators defined in
the result matrix (World Bank 2005c, Annex 3). Based on improvements in the results
framework, the quality of the M&E design is rated as substantial. However, M&E
implementation and utilization of monitoring results remained modest. Overall, the M&E
arrangements are also rated as modest.

6.29 Bank Performance: Bank performance is judged on the basis of its ability to secure
quality at entry and effective implementation of agreed actions through continued dialogue
and engagement with key implementing agencies and through capacity-building effort.

6.30 Quality at Entry: Over the years the Bank has developed a very good working
relationship with the Borrower which came to fruition during preparation and appraisal of
ERRG-IV. Additionally, unlike previous operations in the ERR series which were prepared
in the absence of a medium-term development framework, ERRG-IV was able to utilize the
strategic insights provided in the already completed PRSP and the new CAS (discussed by
the Board at the same time as ERRG-IV). On that basis the Grant chose objectives consistent
with both Sierra Leone’s and Bank strategies. The objectives identified priorities and critical
gaps in the governance area, as well as opportunities to enhance general investment climate
and foster the investment and production possibilities in the mining sector.

6.31 At a more detailed level, the choice of key policy areas and specific actions was
determined in an iterative way utilizing a highly participatory approach based on
consultations with stakeholder ministries and development partners (IMF, AfDB, DFID and
EC). In that context the grant helped further operationalize and sequence development
priorities identified in the PRSP. It also acted as a bridge between the ERRC series and the
new series of programmatic Development Policy Operations as envisioned in the new CAS.
Finally, it promoted a coordination effort which laid the foundation for the then forthcoming
Multi-donor Budgetary Support Framework.

6.32 The entire Bank team (including Country Director, Country Manager, TTL, and the
task team) supported the objective of the grant, its flexible design and responsiveness to local
needs, and frank assessment of project benefits and external risks in the project document.
                                            53


The only downside of the exemplary relationship between the government and the Bank
team, was a tendency to over-commit on the action front and underestimate the internal
processing risks, first and foremost those related to technical and professional capacity
constraints. As a result, some of the triggers were not met on time which delayed the
forthcoming programmatic series of operations.

6.33 The Quality of Supervision: The Bank's performance during the implementation of
the grant was fully satisfactory. The implementation of the project was intensively
supervised (four missions) and closely monitored. This enabled an early detection of
problems and proactive stance in addressing the outstanding issues. The Bank continued to
work together with the Borrower and other development partners during project
implementation. Collaboration was particularly effective in implementing the mining
cadastre system and assessing the investment climate.

6.34 The Bank’s performance in securing quality at entry and in supervision is rated as
satisfactory. This review rates the overall Bank performance as satisfactory.

6.35   Borrower Performance.

6.36 Government Performance: During ERRG-IV preparation the Government sustained
high level of commitment to the objective of the Grant and the entire ERR series. The
commitment was most visible in the smooth operation of the Development Partnership
Committee, chaired by the Vice President of Sierra Leone, and close collaboration with
Government officials on the design and elaboration of the reform program contained in the
PRSP and Letter of Development Policy, including specific prior actions and triggers under
ERRG-IV. Government performance is, therefore, rated as satisfactory.

6.37 Implementing Agency Performance: To enable and facilitate implementation of the
project the Government put in place an elaborate coordination and implementation structure.
The Ministry of Finance administered the grant while an inter-ministerial Steering
Committee facilitated program implementation and the coordination of activities. The
Committee was chaired by the Minister of Finance and included key Ministers and the
Governor of the Central Bank. A Technical Committee provided the necessary assistance to
the Committee and coordinated the activities of Government agencies involved in program
implementation.

6.38 Like in previous operations, some implementation difficulties were encountered due
to inadequate availability of budget and human resources to cover all implementation costs
and overcome capacity constraints to implement agreed reforms on a timely basis. In
addition, project documents (the ISRs and the ICR) and interviews with key stakeholders
indicate that the Ministry of Finance was not always fully informed about program
implementation and was, hence, unable to effectively monitor all elements of the reform
program. This could explain some of the delays in the implementation of the more
demanding actions/triggers related to procurement reform and cadastre implementation. The
main reason for the slippages (which delayed the next series of operations and thus
postponed the anticipated budget support) can be traced back to capacity constraints to
develop, implement and monitor policy and institutional actions and triggers. In the short
                                           54


run, this could have been avoided through a better fit between commitments and capacity to
deliver, and a more adequate flow of information. In the medium run, solutions can be
sought in more elaborate capacity building effort based both recruitment and training
programs aimed at skilled technical staff.

6.39 The Ministry of Finance implemented the program with full commitment, took full
initiative to implement agreed policy actions and triggers, and fully owned and upheld the
agreed reforms and policy measures. The implementation agency performance is rated
satisfactory.

6.40   Overall, this review rates Borrower performance as satisfactory.

7. Findings and Lessons
What worked well
7.1     In a precarious, fragile and quite risky post-conflict situation, the four ERR operations
constituted an effective mechanism to:

               react very promptly to the narrow window of opportunity created by the
                Lome peace accord (July 1999) and the recurrence of hostilities (May 2000);
               provide critical budget support for the demobilization effort under the DDR
                program, as well as improvements in protective, social and economic
                security;
               boost Government confidence and true ownership of the program;
               help build capacity, provide knowledge and assistance in prioritizing,
                sequencing, developing and implementing policy and institutional reforms;
                and
               initiate donor coordination, mobilize and firm-up multi-donor support.

7.2     Although the ERR operations were done in the absence of a formal medium-term
country development strategy or Bank assistance strategy, and hence had to be conceived as
stand-alone operations, they had a high level of continuity at the component level and
effectively represented a coherent series of interventions. Additionally, the Bank team
managed to sustain the critical aspects of capacity building in the Ministry of Finance and
other key implementing agencies.

7.3     The project design was appropriately kept simple and straightforward by mirroring
the priorities in the evolving Government strategy and limiting the scope of interventions to
doable policy inputs and outputs, including a gradual evolution in scope and coverage.

What did not work
7.4     The lack of a multi-year framework (both on the country program side and the
programmatic lending instrument side) undermined broad-based commitments, increased
risks and weakened leverage in sustaining efforts aimed at improving capacity throughout the
government and across regions of the country, particularly in M&E activities. Lending and
policy discontinuities limited the positive impact of initiatives started under the ERR
operations, including the PETS. On the resource transfer side, stand-alone operations created
an additional risk in the already difficult budget process and diverted Government attentions
away from the critical priorities at hand. With hindsight, the standard requirements set for
the production of a full PRSP might have been overly demanding for a country that has just
emerged from a decade long civil war, has suffered a significant destruction of social and
economic infrastructure, and has fairly limited capacity in key economic ministries.

7.5     Likewise, results frameworks for post-conflict countries need to be more realistic,
taking into account severely hampered or destroyed statistical systems, and limited data
                                            56


gathering and monitoring capacity at project, sector, and country level. Simple policy and
institutional inputs, as well as outputs (such as school enrollment ratios) that are positively
correlated with intermediate and final outcomes are often the best that can be expect in
difficult post-conflict circumstances. Although these are not a substitute for proper outcome
indicators, they can help build a simple results framework that can guide government policies
until reliable data on education and health outcomes become available.

7.6     Notably, the third and especially the fourth ERR operation developed more detailed
result matrices and provided improved M&E designs. Unfortunately, the implementation
effort was not sufficient to provide the critical information necessary to determine if the Bank
was supporting the right policy and institutional actions and quantify the linkages between
actions to the achievement of intended outcomes. This was especially true in the case of
triggers for the subsequent programmatic series of operations under the new 2006-2009 CAS.

7.7     Budget support and improved public resource management systems provided under
the ERR series are unlikely to lead to sustainable development outcomes envisaged for the
economy unless supported with better resource allocations and capacity building in all
important ministries. In addition, in order to be sustainable, resource inflows under the IDA
supported operations should gradually be matched with higher local revenues resulting from
the economic revival associated with the operations. Particularly from formal activities in
mining and new FDIs. This will also help create public demand for improved governance
systems supported under the ERR-type credits in all aspects of accountability in the
allocation and use of public monies. Otherwise, improved procurement, financial
management and audit systems would serve a much more limited purpose barely exceeding
the exogenously set expectations of the donors and special watch-dog groups created within
the country.

Lessons
7.8      Overall, the ERR operations were effective in providing critical budget support to
GOSL during the initial post-conflict years. The effectiveness was greater in directly
supporting the demobilization effort under the DDR program, achieving the initial protective,
social, and economic security advances, and in accomplishing process improvements, than in
achieving better governance, improved allocation of budget resources and development
results in the longer run.

7.9     The following main lessons for the design of future support programs in post-conflict
situations are derived from the review:

7.10 Early start of Bank interventions and informed risk taking can help consolidate
the peace process: The Bank team reacted promptly to the narrow window of opportunity
created by the initial Lome peace accord (July 1999) and skillfully used stand-alone
adjustment operations fitting them pragmatically with the slowly evolving country
development and Bank assistance strategy. Despite obvious risks, an early effort to create a
sensible interim assistance strategy and prepare a development policy operation was well
justified. The first ERR provided critical budget support to restore basic state functions,
initiate economic and social recovery. This clearly demonstrated the benefits of peace,
                                            57


curbed the impact of renewed hostilities (May 2000), and tilted the balance in favor of
achieving a firm peace settlement (January 2001).

7.11 Delayed adoption of country strategy and programmatic budget support weakens
ownership, creates funding uncertainty, and hampers capacity building: Under the
circumstances, more could have been done to secure an early adoption of a multi-year
country strategy and programmatic budget support. In substance, the interim PRSP provided
a sufficient basis for a country assistance strategy, while the IMF’s 2001-2005 PRGF
rendered a solid macroeconomic backing for a programmatic series of DPOs. Instead, formal
criteria prevailed and the Bank postponed the adoption of the first post-conflict CAS and the
programmatic DPOs till FY2006, almost six years after the Lome peace accord. This
weakened ownership of the reforms, introduced additional uncertainty in the budget process
and inadvertently destroyed the continuity of the decentralization and capacity building effort

7.12 To produce sustainable longer-term development results in a typical post-conflict
situation, the Bank needs a stable strategy, much more careful project design, greater quality
of prior actions and tranche release conditions derived from a detailed results chain and
strongly related to expected outcomes. Although outputs achieved under the ERR series
appear to be highly positively correlated to desired outcomes, the absence of fully defined
developed result chains and well specified performance indicators makes it very difficult to
assess the outcome of the Bank program on program objectives, particularly in achieving
sustainable advances in improving decentralization, public governance and better
management of public resources.

7.13 Stronger signaling of longer-term resource availability for budget support and
capacity building substitutes for the lack of formal programmatic framework: In situations
where programmatic instruments were not possible due to funding or other constraints, Bank
efforts to secure as much continuity as possible in the content and design of stand-alone
operations were well justified. More could have been done if these efforts were
supplemented with stronger signaling of potential longer-term resource availability for
budget support and capacity building.

7.14 While project/program designs were kept simple and realistic, more could have
been done to develop an appropriate results framework calibrated to post-conflict
country circumstances. Additionally, more resources could have been allocated to
adequately monitor the achievement of outcome indicators. Critical outcomes, especially in
the area of better governance, could then be more fully owned by the Government (and other
stakeholders) and implemented in time. This would also help achieve a better balance
between government efforts aimed at satisfying conditionality and participating in other
Bank supported activities, including sustained capacity building.

7.15 The Bank is (often) expected to assume a leading role in mobilizing and
coordinating external donor assistance in post-conflict situations, and is not always
adequately resourced to do this. In recognition of this, post-conflict Bank programs may
benefit from senior management support that would enable country teams to more
appropriately structure and adequately resource their efforts in mobilizing and coordinating
                                            58


donor assistance. Alternatively, other viable solutions would need to be found and endorsed
by the Consultative Group meetings and other donor fora.

7.16 Discussions in Sierra Leone confirmed that the Bank’s significant role in mobilizing
donor support, administering a multi-donor trust fund, and in coordinating donor activities
(see paragraph 3.5 on page 12) represented a heavy demand on limited operational budget. In
the absence of adequate funding, this invariably diminishes resources available for other
critical activities in the immediate post-conflict period, including the necessary ESW to gain
improved knowledge of the economy, support for capacity building in the Government, and
the establishment of an effective results monitoring system.
