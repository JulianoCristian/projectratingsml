sustainable, and has a\n            substantial institutional development impact. The\n            performances of both the Bank and the Borrower are\n            satisfactory. The lessons cited from this project echoed\n            lessons learned from ERRC I-III, and are recommended for\n            other countries characterized by low capacity, resulting\n            from conflict or other causes, and high aid dependency. They\n            include: not relying on the single tranche model as a\n            guarantee of predictable funds release; being proactive in\n            facilitating good outcome; reducing the number and\n            complexity of conditions and aligning them with the\n            administrative and implementing capacity of Government;\n            finding an   empowered leader from within the Government to\n            coordinate implementation of the reform program; being\n            prepared to invest extra resources into the supervision\n            effort; seeking a better fit between triggers, the degree of\n            consensus within Government leadership circles, and the\n            degree of technical and administrative capacity within\n            implementing ministries; and  embarking on a medium-term\n            comprehensive program of capacity building. The report also\n            pointed out that the partnership and coordination between\n            the World Bank, the Government, and other international\n            donors can lead to successful achievements as demonstrated\n            by the outcome of the credit; Bank support for policy\n            reforms should therefore continue to seek to integrate the\n            efforts of other active donors."}, "docdt": "2006-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
