   Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit is to support the\n            Government's program to resume structural adjustment in\n            agriculture following the January 1994 devaluation. The\n            credit will support a program of policy reforms needed to\n            establish an environment conducive to supply-response and\n            self-sustained growth of the agricultural sector. The reform\n            program aims at: 1) liberalizing the domestic marketing and\n            pricing of rice at both producer and consumer levels and\n            privatizing the processing of rice, thereby eliminating\n            subsidies in local rice production; 2) reforming the\n            agricultural trade regime; 3) privatizing the production,\n            processing and marketing of agricultural products in those\n            subsectors still dominated by parastatals, namely groundnuts\n            and rice; and 4) preparing a three-year rolling investment\n            program for the agricultural sector which respects clear\n            sectoral priorities established in consultation with donors."}, "docdt": "1995-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
