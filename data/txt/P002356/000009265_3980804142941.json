          Adjustment Credit Project for Senegal were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, project sustainability was not\n            applicable, Bank performance was satisfactory and Borrower\n            performance was not applicable. Some lessons learned\n            included: any transition process needs to be well planned\n            with accompanying measures put in place in order to prevent\n            unwanted side effects of reform measures. Continuous\n            monitoring is needed to fine tune the reform process. In the\n            case of his program, the transition from rice imports\n            controlled by price stabilization agency to private sector\n            imports was not well planned, did not go smoothly and led to\n            unnecessary destabilization of national rice markets. Once\n            needed corrective measures were taken, things went fairly\n            smoothly even under difficult world price conditions.\n            Unambiguous consensus among donors and government is\n            essential in the successful implementation of structural\n            reforms. The greatest success of the program has been in the\n            rice sub-sector largely because donors and the government\n            have agreed on and supported a clearly-stated reform\n            process. The government eventually went beyond the letter of\n            the agreement in eliminating the rice marketing parastatal.\n            On the other hand, little progress has been achieved in\n            solving the institutional problems of the groundnut\n            sub-sector largely because a consensus was not developed\n            among donors and government."}, "docdt": "1998-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
