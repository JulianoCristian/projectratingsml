The project suffered a nine month slow\n            down due to lack of funds.  The slowdown resulted in a slow\n            disbursement of loan money. The Bank was flexible in\n            agreeing to emergency repair and rehabilitation works being\n            completed on the basis of contracts with unit rates,\n            determined in advance and agreed to by all contractors,\n            proved to be expedient. The borrower requested that the\n            Investment Bank of Titograd act as fiscal agent for this\n            single Republic loan, instead of the Council of Republican\n            and Provincial Road Organizations. The Bank agreed and the\n            arrangement was satisfactory and sped up document\n            transmission which resulted in quicker loan disbursements."}, "docdt": "1984-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
