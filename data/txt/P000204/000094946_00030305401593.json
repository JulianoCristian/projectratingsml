However, project sustainability is\n            deemed uncertain in the absence of the implementation of\n            reforms in the management and funding mechanism of the road\n            sector. Overall, the World Bank's performance in\n            preparing and supervising the project was satisfactory. The\n            Borrower's performance was mixed (less than\n            satisfactory and partially satisfactory in various issues)\n            between effectiveness and 1996, then it improved to\n            satisfactory thereafter. The environment under which the\n            project was designed changed drastically due to various\n            factors that impeded the project, the most significant being\n            the civil strife that broke out in 1993 and thereon,\n            hampered the implementation of the project. A follow-up\n            project is planned for FY2001. The key lessons learned are\n            to: 1) keep the objectives few and simple; and 2) be less\n            ambitious in planning different reforms in a country in\n            which political risks are high and that has had no past\n            experience with the private management and implementation of\n            civil works."}, "docdt": "2000-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
