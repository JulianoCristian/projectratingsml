1.  OVERVIEW
The National Highway-2 (NH-2) connecting Delhi with Kolkata is one of the most important high-
density corridors in the country. The 1400km long NH-2 falls in the Upper Gangetic Plain in
northern India and traverses through the states of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Jharkhand
and West Bengal. The NH-2 carries between 12,000 and 33,0000 passenger car units (PCUs)
daily (1998 estimates). Of which, a substantial part (48% to 86%) of the traffic is goods traffic.
The traffic volume on most of the sections is projected to grow up to 40,000 PCUs between
2005-2010 AD and in some sections would be as high as 1,25,000 PCUs by 2015 AD. The
existing highway is a two-lane carriageway, with traffic bottlenecks, various highway deficiencies
as well as lack of proper facilities. To cater to such increased high volume of traffic, there is an
urgent need for capacity augmentation of the highway.
Capacity augmentation of the NH-2 is proposed under the Golden Quadrilateral Project (6500km
highway joining Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata) of the National Highway Development
Programme (NHDP) of the Government of India (GoI). As part of the Delhi-Kolkata section of
the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ), the Delhi-Agra section (210km) at the west end, and Barwa Adda
- Kolkata section (278km) at the east end of the NH-2 have already been 4-laned with assistance
from the ADB. For the remaining sections, the following projects are proposed:
The Third National Highway Project (TNHP) involving 4-laning of 8 contract packages
between Agra and Barwa Adda, with World Bank (WB) financing (477km, under
implementation);
The Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project (GTRIP) involving 4/6-laning of 7 contract
packages between Agra and Barwa Adda (422.8km, with proposed WB funding);
Etawah Bypass 4-laning project (13.6km, to be implemented with NHAI funding); and
Allahabad Bypass 4-laning project (87km, to be taken up in 2001AD with proposed WB
funding).
All the above projects are scheduled to be completed by the last quarter of 2003 A.D.
1.1      THE GRAND TRUNK (GT) ROAD
The present Grand Trunk Road is one of the most ancient historic transport routes dating back to
as early as 15t1' century B.C. A major initiative to re-establish this road system was made by
Sher Shah Suri, 16th century AD, and the "Sarak-I-Azam" about 1500kms in length was
constructed, from Sonargaon (near Dacca) to the Indus connecting the important towns falling in
between. During 1790 and 1890, this road had been reconstructed by the British, between
Pesawar and Kolkata, and renamed as the GT Road.
The GT Road between Wagha border (Amritsar) and Kolkata traverses across the seven Indian
states of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, UP, Bihar, Jharkand and West Bengal. The importance of the
project corridor in the region and the country can be ascertained from the following, which
further justify the improvement of the highway between Delhi and Kolkata:
The highway falls in the fertile Indo-Gangetic plains, which accounts for 30% of the
agricultural produce of the country and supports 25% of the country's population;

Folcw-up Public Consultation Programme: Grand Trunk Road lmprovement Project
This highway has been the conduit of development for the past several centuries, and 7 of
the 23 metropolitan cities of the country are located along this highway.
As a result of the intense developmental activities along the highway, this area (10km on
either side) supports a population of over 40 million;
The highway between Agra and Dhanbad passes through three of the most populous and
the least developed states in India. Any improvement of this important corridor will improve
their ability to participate in the economic development and,
The corridor opens up the vast hinterland of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand to the Gateway ports
of the East Coast (at present, nearly 40% goods of UP moves through the western coast).
1.2   THE GRAND TRUNK ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
For project preparation, the Agra-Barwa Adda section was divided into 5 consultancy packages,
and further into 16 contract packages. Eight of the 16 contract packages were selected for TNHP
(see Table 1), depending on the project preparedness, progress on land acquisition and utility
relocation. Of the remaining eight packages, seven will be taken up under the GTRIP. The
Allahabad Bypass (Contract Package III-B) has not been included as part of TNHP or GTRIP, but
will be taken up subsequently for construction by NHAI with funding from the World Bank (WB).
GTRIP includes the contract packages A, B & C of Consultancy Package I, B of Consultancy
Package II, A & C of Consultancy Package IV, and B of Consultancy Package V.

Follow-up Public Consu/tation Programme: Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
1.2.1    OVER-ALL SCOPE OF PROJECT WORK
The objective of the project is to widen to four/six lanes, the existing highway between Agra to
Barwa Adda to meet the traffic needs for the next 20-30 years. It entailed detailed analysis of
the present traffic, and future projections, pavement and soil conditions, materials available,
cross-drainage structures, and environmental and social/resettlement features.
The widening to four-lane will be confined to within the existing Right of Way (RoW), avoiding
land acquisition as far as possible, except for locations where it is absolutely essential from
traffic, engineering, environmental and social aspects and where a diversion from the existing
alignment is absolutely necessary.
1.2.2    PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT OF THE PROJECT HIGHWAY
The existing project highway (between Agra and Barwa Adda) has a two-lane (2x3.5m)
bituminous carriageway, with paved/unpaved shoulders. It is now proposed to widen this
highway by adding a new 2-lane carriageway with paved shoulders and strengthening the
existing carriageway by overlays/rehabilitation/reconstruction (including, in places replacing the
existing bituminous pavement by cement concrete rigid pavement). It also includes
repair/rehabilitation of existing cross-drainage (CD) structures on the highway and provision of
new CD structures on the new 2-lane carriageway. The road will be six-laned in the first 21km
stretch of Package I-A.
In addition to strengthening the existing carriageway, the project would improve the geometric
deficiencies including the improvement of the various intersections. The proposed improvement
aims at improving the riding quality and journey speed, and reducing congestion of traffic on the
highway. It is proposed to provide service roads, proper drainage, grade-separation, road
furniture, utilities and amenities wherever required.
The project highway passes through 4 cities, 19 towns and 253 villages. To minimize the adverse
impacts on the various settlements and to minimize acquisition of land and structures, short
bypasses and realignments have been proposed. In all, a total of 14 short bypasses have been
proposed apart from the 20km long bypass at Sasaram. The total length of bypasses proposed
on this highway is 73.16km (i.e., 17% of the total length of the project highway).
1.2.3    ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT IN THE PROJECT
The project preparation activities for the entire stretch between Agra and Dhanbad (both TNHP
and GTRIP stretches) have commenced from early 1998. Incorporation and consideration of the
environmental and social issues have been taken up at an early stage of the project. The
Environmental Assessment has been taken up as an integral part of the project preparation, and
assigned due importance. Community Consultation Programme has been an important part of
this process.

closing the gaps found during the independent review.
1.2.4    COMMUNITY CONSULTATION IN THE PROJECT
Community consultation has been taken up as an integral part of social and environmental
assessment process in the GTRIP. The Community Consultation Programme has been carried out
at various stages of project preparation, including at the environmental screening stage,
Feasibility Study stage and the Environmental Assessment Preparation stage.
1.2.5    FOLLOW-UP PUBLIC CONSULTATION
A "Feed-back or follow-up process" was initiated and concluded (as part of the Community
Consultation component in GTRIP) in March 2001. This was an attempt to reveal all the relevant
facts, figures and decisions made in the Project to the people so that they can be made fully
aware about the likely positive and negative benefits arising out of the Project.
1.3      STRUCTURE OF THIS REPORT
This report on the "Feed-back or follow-up" of Community Consultation Programme, initiated in
GTRIP, excluding the first chapter, has been structured into the following:

2.  COMMUNITY CONSULTATION IN GTRIP
2.1      INTRODUCTION
Community consultation was an integral part of social and environmental assessment process in
the GTRIP. The process has been carried out constantly at various stages of the project
preparation. Community Consultation was viewed as a continuous two way process, involving
promotion of public understanding of the processes and mechanisms through which
developmental problems and needs are investigated, and resolved.
Consultation was used as a tool to inform stakeholders about the proposed action both before
and after the development decisions were made. It assisted in identification of the problems
associated with the project as well as the needs of the population likely to be impacted. This
participatory process helped in reducing public resistance to change and enabled the
participation of the local people in the decision making process.
2.2      OBJECTIVES OF COMMUNITY CONSULTATION
Community consultation in GTRIP was taken up in the various stages of project preparation, with
the following objectives:
To promote public awareness about the project, especially amongst the potentially impacted
communities/individuals;
To solicit the views of affected communities/individuals on social/environmental components
and the significance of impacts due or consequent of the project;
*   To inform the potentially impacted communities/individuals about the project alternatives,
and the proposed course of action;
*   To enable the affected communities/individuals to provide input into crucial decisions in the
design of the project, and the selection of mitigation, compensation and monitoring
strategies before any irrevocable decisions are taken;
To stimulate community self-evaluation and analysis with regard to local needs and
priorities;
To ensure lessening of public resistance to change by providing them a platform in the
decision making process;
To inform  Project Affected Persons (PAPs) about the entitlement framework and
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), and to settle their problems with mutual consent and to
evolve a framework to assist them during relocation and resettlement.
2.3      COMMUNITY CONSULTATION IN GTRIP
Community Consultation has been carried out at various stages of project preparation, including
at the environmental screening stage, Feasibility stage and the Environmental Assessment
Preparation stage. Table 2 gives a summary of the public consultation sessions that has been

Fo1/owv-up Pub//C Consultation Programme: Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
Community Consultation sessions started with familiarization of the people with the basic
concept of the project and the proposed improvements. The extent or the likely level of adverse
impacts was one of the major criteria in deciding locations for community consultation sessions.
Data collection was not restricted to simple question and answer sessions, but an effort was
made to address the apprehensions and queries of the people living along the project highway
and therefore likely to be impacted by the project. Further, Focus Group Discussions were held
at locations where a specific type of community was likely to be affected. Annexure 1 lists the
locations, and the type of participants in the community consultation sessions conducted along
the project highway.

2.4    COMMUNITY CONSULTATION PROCESS IN GTRIP
The consultation process established for the project has employed a range of formal and
informal consultation tools including, in-depth interview with key informants, focus group
interviews (FGDs), village or settlement level meetings, workshops and even door-to-door
personal contacts. These consultation sessions have been carried out at different stages of
project preparation and will be continued during the implementation stage as well. The entire
consultation process will subsequently be monitored during the operation of the project.
The community consultation programme in GTRIP has covered the following stakeholders:
Heads of the households likely to be impacted;
Members of the households likely to be impacted;
Clusters of PAPs;
Villagers;
Village Panchayats (or local self government bodies);
Local voluntary organisations, community based organisations (CBOs) and non-government
organisations (NGOs);
Government agencies and departments;
Other project stakeholders, such as women, tribal and ethnic communities, road user
groups, health professionals, etc.
A 100%  sample was taken up for individual household consultation (door-to-door personal
interviews), and about 10% for the focus group discussions (by conducting consultation sessions

at 30 villages). Consultations were carried out at four levels for each type of stakeholders, during
the preparation of the project. The levels were:
*   Local/Village level Consultations
*   District Level Consultations
*   State Level Consultations
*   District Level Public Hearings
2.4.1     STATE LEVEL CONSULTATIONS
State level consultations were conducted involving the concerned state organizations such as
state pollution control boards, public works departments, etc. The consultation sessions are
proposed to continue during the implementation and monitoring stages of the project. See
Annexure 1 for details.
2.4.2     DISTRICT LEVEL PUBLIC HEARINGS
Realizing that the public hearings serve as excellent means of consultation and participative
process, the MoEF has made public hearing at the district level mandatory for projects requiring
environmental clearance. Public hearings were conducted (through the state pollution control
boards) at various districts (the meetings were chaired by the respective District Magistrates).
The details of the public hearings have been listed in Table 3.

2.4.3     DISTRICT LEVEL CONSULTATIONS
The second phase of public consultation was conducted at the district level wherein concerned
government officials, NGOs and the project-affected groups were involved. The District
Magistrates of the concerned districts were involved in these Consultation Sessions. See
Annexure 1 for details.
2.4.4     LOCAL/VILLAGE LEVEL CONSULTATIONS
Several village meetings were organized in the settlements along the project highway. These
sessions were held in rural, sub-urban and urban areas to inform people about the purpose and
preliminary design of the project in order to get their opinion and identify their issues of concern.
Village/local level consultations were held at locations having a substantial number of likely

project affected people. In all, 30 village meetings were organized in different project corridors.
See Annexure 1 for details.
2.5   COMMUNITY CONCERNS
Consultation with the communities resulted in arriving at design solutions, appropriate and
conducive to the felt needs of the people. Some of the concerns and issues raised by the people
were applicable for the whole project whereas some were specific to certain locations. The
issues pointed out by the people were related to both the natural as well as the social
environment, particularly on impacts to individual properties, displacement of people etc.
The key issues/concerns made by local residents, focus groups and government officials are
summarized under the following heads:
c    Air and Noise Pollution
In places like Kanpur, Rania Padao, Rama Devi, Chandagra (Package II-B), Sasaram (Package
IV-A), Barhi, Sherghati, Champaran, Bagodar, Isri Bazar (Package V-B), much concern was
raised about the poor air quality and dust due to the traffic. High noise pollution was cited as a
major problem in places like Jaipur, Rania, Rama Devi, Chandagra and Aung (Package II-B),
Singhirawan Barhi, Isri and Gorhan Bridge (Package V-B). In Maheba (Package IB), the local
residents complained about the vibration felt in the buildings due to the heavy vehicular traffic.
Apart from these specific locations, there was a general concern about the vehicular pollution at
congested locations all along the corridor. It was also felt by the public that the widening of the
highway or provision of bypasses and service roads would reduce the pollution levels.
Traffic Congestion
At a number of places traffic bottlenecks exist, which result in low speed, delays and traffic jams.
The width of the road at such locations is highly inadequate and this makes the area prone to
accidents. The local people from Ekdil (Package I-B), Chandagra, Bhognipur, Rania, Rama Devi,
Fatehpur, Bilinda Mureedpur, Usraina and Kanpur (Package II-B), Raja Ka Talab (Package IV-A),
Singhrawan, Barhi and Isri (Package V-B) were concernd about the traffic congestion. In most of
these locations, it was felt that widening to four lanes of the corridor will decongest the highway
and will facilitate smooth traffic flow especially within the settlements stretches. At critical
locations, where widening was not feasible, like at Ekdil, a bypass was proposed. At other
locations, underpasses were desired to reduce accidents.
zi   Road Safety Issues
There are a number of schools, colleges, and hospitals along the corridor, which are sensitive to
hazards due to the highway traffic. In all the sensitive receptors and at various settlements, road
safety issues were the major concern expressed during consultation. At places like Etawah,
Kuberpur, Chaleswar, Etmadpur, Mainpuri, Firozabad, Bakewar (Package I), Kanpur, Thariyon,
Bilinda Thooman (Package II), Raja Talab, Mohania, Sasaram (Package IV), Singhrawan,
Champaran, Barachathi, Sherghati, Dhobi, Isri, Gorhar, Barhi, and Madanpur (Package V) road
safety concerns were raised by the local people.

,'Folfcv-up Puib/ic Consuftat(on Programme: Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
Local residents, truck drivers, teachers from various schools and colleges expressed worry about
the increasing accidents around the area, which involved school children as well. Speed
breakers, subways, widening and bypasses were suggested as general solutions to these
problems. Service lanes and underpasses had been to avoid accidents; bypasses were desired at
Raja Ka Taal and Sirsa Ganj. Other traffic safety measures and signs were desired at sensitive
locations.
o    Cultural Properties
The local community expressed their concern for minimum disturbance and proper relocation of
the cultural properties along the Project Corridor. The religious structures impacted by the
widening process were desired to be relocated in discussion with the communities. At places like
Auriaya and Kanpur Dehat (Package I), Kanpur (Package II), Chandauli, Sasaram and Mohania
(Package IV) specific issues were raised regarding religious structures. Design options like
shifting the alignment was discussed for avoidance of structures, such as at Khwaja Ka Phool (a
historic wall and a water body). Communities desired that the religious structures along the
highway need enhancement by the project.
l    Fauna and Flora
Local people as well as the government officials were concerned about the trees to be cut along
the National Highway. Issues were raised about the impacts on the fauna and flora in the
stretches of Wild Life Sanctuary and Reserved Forest Areas. In Agra and Kanpur Dehat in
Package I, demand was raised for plantation of better quality saplings and mixed tree plantation
that improve soil and ground water conditions in the area. In Package II, at Bilinda and Rooma,
Agriculturists and officials suggested planting fruit bearing trees and to remove the existing
eucalyptus plantation. In Gautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary, suggestion was made to improve
tree density by planting traditional species.
o    Roadside Drainage
During consultation, water logging was raised as a major concern along the National Highway.
This problem is more prominent in settlement areas. In places like Agra, Etawah, Maheba, Auriya
in Package I, Chandauli, Mohania, Sasaram in Package IV and Isri, Champar, Bagodar etc. in
Package V, this problem was raised. Disposal of water in habited areas, water logging on the
surface etc is considered in the design, at various locations, where a drainage schemes is
provided and necessary changes are incorporated.
o    Water Bodies
Concern was shown towards the quality of water in the ponds and streams along the National
Highway. In Mohania (Package IV) and Madanpur and Bagodar (Package V), the protection of
community ponds was requested. The local people welcomed the idea of taking soil from the
ponds, as it will increase the depth of the water body and hence increase the capacity.
o    Roadside Amenities
Local people and the truck drivers discussed the need for various roadside amenities, which are
either lacking in some areas or not evenly distributed. At Agra, Etawah and Auriya (Package I),

parking facility was stressed upon. In Chandagra, Bhognipur (Package II) Raja Talab and
Mohania (Package V) the stress was more on utility areas, public toilets, shopping areas and rest
areas.
D      Resettlement and rehabilitation
Social issues were the main theme discussed in the consultation sessions. These issues mainly
relate to the resettlement and rehabilitation amenities in the PAPs. Table 4 describes the issues
related to resettlement and rehabilitation, which were raised by the communities, including the
suggestions from the communities.

2.6.2   ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC ISSUES
The issues identifled during the community consultation exercise formed valuable inputs into the
design process and subsequently formed the basis for design of mitigation measures for specific
locations. The community consultation exercise not only helped to identify and prioritise the
issues of concern but also provided solutions for the same through this interactive process.
Various mitigation measures suggested by the people themselves have been listed in Table 4
and Table 6. The measures have been weighed for their suitability and accordingly incorporated,

Fo//ow-up Public Consultation Programme: Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
2.7      CONTINUED CONSULTATION IN GTRIP
In all the 7 contract packages of the project, it has been fully realized that, to redress the
environmental issues likely to surface during construction and operational phases, a constant
communication needs to be established with the affected communities and the road users. This
has been ensured by regular progress monitoring of the construction and inviting suggestions/
complaints through Grievance Redressal Cells (GRCs) under the PIUs and with co-operation of
the NGOs. Meetings will be organized with the Project Affected Households and the various
stakeholders at regular intervals at the potential hotspot/sensitive locations before and during
the construction period.
A plan for the continued participation of the various stakeholders, especially the project affected
has been already worked out to ensure time bound and effective achievements of the
implementation of the various EA measures proposed. This plan covers the following main
elements -
2.7.1    INFORMATION DISCLOSURE FOR PUBLIC REFERENCE
The EIA / EMP has been disclosed at several locations, for the benefit of the interested
community, and the stakeholders. The summary EA Report has been kept for public reference in
order to disclose the project information to the interested individuals and groups. The EIA has
kept for public reference at the following locations -
*   State Public Library at Patna, Bihar   *   State Public Library at Ranchi, Jharkhand
*   State Public Library at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh  *   Benaras Hindu University (BHU) Library at Varanasi
In addition to these, copies of the EIA/RAP report will be available at the NHAI headquarter
library at New Delhi, and at the NHAI Project Implementation Unit Offices at Agra, Kanpur and
Varanasi (all in Uttar Pradesh), and Jumri Talaiya (Bihar). The report from these places will be
available to the public on request for reference. Moreover, NHAI proposes to include the report
in the NHAI website in near future. The reports will also be available to the public at the WB
Infoshop at Washington DC, and WB New Delhi as per the WB disclosure policy.
2.7.2    INFORMATION SHARING AND TRANSPARENCY
NHAI project implementation units' (PIUs) offices in the 4 major settlements along the stretch
(Agra, Kanpur, Varanasi and Jumri Talaiya) will provide factual information on environmental /
resettlement issues to the people, in a continuous manner.
2.7.3    FOLLOW- UP PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROGRAMME
Thee NHAI, as part of the continued community consultation programme in the GTRIP, and on
the basis of recommendations made by the World Bank (during the appraisal of the project in
February 2001) has conducted the "Follow-up Public Consultation" during March 2001.
During the follow-up consultation, an attempt has been made by the NHAI to reveal all the
necessary facts, figures and decisions made in the project to the people (so that the people can
become fully aware about the likely positive and negative benefits arising out of the project). To

3.   ORGANISATION OF FOLLOW-UP PUBLIC CONSULTATION
Public consultation is a continuous, two-way communication process, which involves promoting
full public understanding of the processes and mechanisms through which developmental
problems and needs are investigated and solved by the responsible agency. It is a technique, or
a series of techniques that is designed to benefit both project proponents, the target beneficiary
groups and/or potentially affected communities/individuals.
Consultation with the community and their involvement in different stages of project planning
and implementation is often used as a tool to inform and educate the stakeholders about the
proposed action both, before and after the development decisions have been made.
It can assist in the identification of problems associated with the proposed project, the needs
and values of the population likely to be impacted by a project. It can also act as a means of
increasing the proponent's credibility and lessening public resistance to change by providing
them a platform in the decision-making process.
3.1      APPROACH TO THE FOLLOW-UP PUBLIC CONSULTATION
Community Consultation has been a major component in project preparation of the GTRIP.
Beyond the scope of conventional consultation, the Project has incorporated views of the
community in all stages of project preparation. This has helped in generating of a positive
outlook and has helped in confidence building of the concerned community towards this Project.
3.1.1    OBJECTIVES OF THE FOLLOW-UP CONSULTATION
The follow-up public consultation was carried out in the project with the following objectives:
To disclose the details of the project, including discussing the actions/measures taken in the
project on issues raised by the communities earlier (during the feasibility study and detailed
engineering stages of the project preparation);
To assure the public that adequate care has been taken in the project to minimise probable
negative impacts and to maximise the overall and specific benefits of the Project; and,
To ascertain that people appreciate the relevant (local) components of the project, including
that they are happy with the solutions (mitigation and/or management measures) provided
vis-a-vis the issues earlier raised by the communities;
To identify the issues, which remain unresolved, or the issues, which have not been taken
care during project preparation, if any, or, to identify where further action is necessary from
people's perspective;
*  To call upon the people, including the stakeholders to contribute positively to the project.
3.1.2    INFORMED CONSENT
In its broadest terms, 'informed consent' means that a person agreeing to something does so
voluntarily and on the basis of a full understanding of the reasons for and consequences of his
acceptance or refusal. This approach of 'informed consent' empowers the communities and
Lea Associates
22



Fc/loaw-up Public Consultation Programme: Grand Trunk Road lmprovement Project
encourages them to express their demands/priorities through institutional channels rather than
in ways that may exacerbate conflicts.
In this Project, 'informed consent' has been adopted as the keynote in the consultation sessions.
Disclosure of relevant information and voluntary participation on part of the people (including the
PAPs) were the two key elements that were adopted as a part of the "informed consent"
approach.
3.2      INFORMATION SHARING AND DOCUMENTATION
In the follow-up public consultation, considerable attention has been paid to the design and
method of information sharing. The various methods used are described below.
3.2.1    PUBLIC NOTICE & NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS
Advertisements and public notices were published in the leading daily newspapers (of the
respective areas) regarding the organization of the follow-up consultation sessions. All interested
individuals and groups were invited to attend the sessions.
Samples of the advertisements published for the 4 consultation sessions are attached in
Annexure 2.
3.2.2    BRIEFING MATERIAL
A leaflet was designed in the Hindi (which is the vernacular and state language of all the three
states - UP, Bihar and Jharkhand) consisting of brief notes on the GTRIP, agencies involved,
NHAI's perspective of community consultation, etc. It also outlined the benefits associated and
created by the project. The leaflet included a map of the 3 states, clearly showing locations of all
the contract packages of the GTRIP.
The leaflets were distributed to all the participants of the follow-up consultation sessions. These
leaflets were also given in large numbers to the participants to be distributed among the other
members of the community who were unable to attend the consultation sessions. A sample of
the leaflet is attached as Annexure 3.
3.2.3    MAPS, CHARTS AND BANNERS
A number of drawings and maps were mounted on cardboards and put up on display for public
reference. The maps that were put up for display included the following:
*   A map showing the GTRIP project corridor, including the location of contract packages;
*   A map showing the alignment details, including the location and alignment of the bypasses;
A map showing the location of environmentally sensitive zones/elements;
A map showing, by location the issues raised by the communities, and the measures taken
in the project to resolve the issues.

Foilow-up Pub//c Consultation Programme: Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
The large number of drawings put up for display included two classes of drawings, such as,
A number of drawings giving the details of the generic mitigation measures those have
been suggested in the project, and are of uniform standards across all contract packages;
and,
A large number of drawings giving, by location, details of the enhancement and mitigation
plans, which were specific to the respective contract package.
Also, banners announcing the time, venue and summary objective of the follow-up consultation
were put up outside the venue of the consultation sessions in advance (so that people in general
could be made aware and informed about such sessions).
3.2.4     READING MATERIAL
o    Summary Environmental Management Plans
For each of the 4 contract packages, where a follow-up consultation session was organized,
separate short summaries of the respective environmental management plans (EMPs) were
prepared in the vernacular (Hindi) and were distributed among the participants.
The summary EMPs contained the following:
A brief project background and the improvement proposals therein;
Description of the major issues relevant to the respective contract package; and,
The environmental management and mitigation measures included in the project, relevant
to the contract package.

Ez   Photographs
A number of photographs were taken during the consultation sessions.
o    Video Records
The entire proceedings of all the 4 follow-up consultation sessions were video recorded. The four
cassettes of these meetings will be available at the NHAI Corporate Office. To make the use of
these cassettes convenient, all the recordings were transferred onto to CDs, which will be kept in
the concerned site offices of NHAI, and are submitted along with this Report.
3.3      SELECTION OF VENUES FOR FOLLOW-UP CONSULTATION SESSIONS
The follow-up consultation sessions were held at the following four locations,
Agra (in Contract Package I-A);
*   Kanpur (in Contract Package II-B);
*   Sasaram (in Contract Package IV-C); and,
*   Barhi (in Contract Package V-B).
3.3.1    BASIS OF SELECTION
The venues were selected on the basis of critical or sensitive issues (either already existing, or
are likely to emerge due to the project). During the appraisal of the project, it was agreed
between the WB and the NHAI that follow-up consultation was necessary at Agra and Gautam
Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary, to ascertain that the environmental mitigation/management actions
proposed in the project with respect to the Taj Trapezium (Package I-A) and the Wildlife
Sanctuary (Package V-B) are acceptable to the public and the stakeholders. The NHAI decided to
hold two additional follow-up consultation sessions at Kanpur and at Sasaram, so as to cover all
4 packages included in the GTRIP (and these locations also have possible significant impacts due
to the project).
3.3.2    MAJOR ISSUES IN THE SELECTED CONTRACT PACKAGES
A brief description of the 4 contract packages, selected for the follow-up consultation programme
(along with the critical or likely to be critical issues) is provided in the following sub-sections.
o    Package I-A (Consultation at Agra)
This package is between km199.66 of NH-2 at Agra (the end of the existing bridge over River
Yamuna) and km250.5. Due to the heavy volume of traffic predicted, the first 21km section
between Agra and Tundla would be widened to 6-lanes (including 2 flyovers at Rambagh and
Tundla). The major settlements along Package I-A are Tundla (km222) and Firozabad (km235-
242). The important villages along the Corridor are Etmadpur (km217), Raja ka Tal (km233) and
Thana Mathesana (km248).
Agra Reserve Forest: Between km204 and km206, the project corridor cuts across the Agra
Reserved Forest. The Agra reserved forest is a degraded area, the green cover is thin, and no

wildlife has been reported apart from monkeys. This Reserve Forest stretch close to the road is
used as garbage dumping site, which includes unprotected disposal of slaughterhouse waste.
The Taj Trapezium Zone: The entire length of Contract Package IA falls within the Taj
Trapezium Zone. The Taj Trapezium Zone houses for over 40 protected monuments, four of
which are listed as World Heritage Site (WHS) namely the Taj Mahal, the Agra fort and the
Fatepur Sikri and a the Bird Sanctuary within the Bharatpur National Park. The tomb of Akbar (at
Sikandra) and Itmad-ud-Daula's tomb have been proposed for designation as the World Heritage
Site. None of the aforesaid monuments are within 2km of the highway, and therefore, are not
directly impacted.
Keeping these two sensitive issues in mind, a decision was made to organise the meeting for
Package I in Agra.
3.3.3    PACKAGE IIB AT KANPUR
Package II starts from km 393.000 at Sikandra and ends at km 115.000 near Khaga. This
package has been further sub-divided into three contract packages namely, IIA, IIB and IIC.
Only contract Package IIB is part of GTRIP.
Package IIB starts at km 470.000 and goes via Kanpur bypass (km 473.200 - km 491.992) to
end at km 38.000. Its total length is 51.33 km. Major industries located along this stretch are
LML Scooters, LML Ancillary of scooter parts, Duncans Fertilisers, Indane LPG Gas Plant,
Rajendra Steel Pipes and SAIL warehouse. Stretches with high-density commercial development
are located at Bhaunti (km 470.000 - km 471.000), Panki (km 471.000 - km 472.000), Gujaini
(km 5.000), Barra (km 9.000), Naubasta (km 11.000), Kidwai Nagar (km 12.000) and Rama Devi
(km 19.000).
Certain issues such as provision of fly-over at Rama Devi, raised carriage-way in certain sections
of the package, provision of under-passes, extensive water logging along the Highway and heavy
congestion were crucial from the local point of view. In an effort towards continued participation,
a meeting was organised in Kanpur to inform and freely discuss about all such critical local level
issues with various stakeholders.
3.3.4    PACKAGE IVC AT SASARAM
Package IV starts at Varanasi km 317.000 and goes south-east via Chandauli, Naubatpur,
Karamnasa, Mohania, Sasaram, Dehri-On-Sone, Aurangabad and ends at km 180.000, about 18
km east of Aurangabad - a total stretch of 193 km. This package has been subdivided into
contract packages i.e., IVA, IVB, IVC and IVD. Package IVA and IVC form part of the GTRIP,
while Packages IVB and IVD are being taken up as part of TNHP.
Package IVC starts at km 110.000 and ends at km 140.000, between km.111.000 and 130.000
the existing NH-2 passes through the Sasaram town.
Keeping in mind the congestion in the town and the presence of cultural properties, that would
have been affected had the four-laning of the Highway been carried out within the town, a

bypass has been proposed in the Project. There have been a few instances where the people
have expressed their apprehensions about the by-pass proposals in the past. In order to clarify
and inform the various stakeholders in the area about the specific decisions and design that has
been made, a meeting was organised in Sasaram town.
3.3.5    PACKAGE VB AT BARHI
Package VB falls in the states of Bihar and Jharkhand, starting from km 240.000 to km320.000.
This 80km  long corridor passes through the districts of Gaya and Hazaribagh.  Sparingly
inhabited area, rolling agricultural terrain, hilly protected forest area, deficient geometric
alignments, uncontrolled ribbon development at four locations and severe pavement conditions
are some of the characteristics of this stretch of the Project.
Gautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary: The highway passes through the buffer area of the
sanctuary and has been operational for the last 400 years. The major threat to flora in the area
comes for deforestation fuel, overgrazing and illegal felling. The presence of endangered fauna,
especially the tiger, in the area was a major driving force in the declaration of the sanctuary. The
other important species of fauna include the wolf, the leopard, hyena, jackal, spotted deer,
sambhar, barking deer, Chinkara and Nilgai. In addition, the Langur and Rufous-Tailed Hare
have also been recorded. A number of bird species have been recorded within the sanctuary. It
has 20 species of reptiles including lizards, python and snakes like Russel's viper.
Keeping in mind, the sensitivity of the issue, a meeting was organized in Barhi, which is the
major settlement along this corridor.
3.4       ORGANIZATION OF THE FOLLOW-UP SESSIONS
The Project Offices of NHAI organized all the meetings. The officials of the concerned Govt.
Departments such as those from Forest Department and Revenue Department, Block
Development Officers, Village Panchayat members, Project Affected Individuals and Groups and
local organizations etc. were specifically invited for the meetings.
It was ensured that people have sufficient (at least 7 to 10 days) notice before the final meeting
was held. Also, in some cases NHAI officials reminded the people again a day or two in advance
about the meeting. The Village Panchayat members and local representatives were specially
invited for a discussion and for an update on the Project.
An attempt was made to reach the venue of the meeting at least one hour before the meeting
actually started. This gave enough opportunity for an adequate warm-up period, enabling
participants, especially the Project Affected Persons to be comfortable and open with the officials
of the NHAI as well as to the members of the Consultant 's team. Two persons took down notes
in detail. After the meeting was formally over, more informal discussion was carried out with the
participants.

3.5      STRUCTURE OF MEETINGS
Every meeting followed almost a similar format. However, the initial discussions varied from
place to place according to the interest of the people. The following structure was broadly
adopted in the follow-up meetings that were organised as a part of the Community Consultation
Programme in GTRIP -
The persons making presentations were introduced
The participants were also made to introduce themselves.
In all the cases, the names of the participants were recorded, both on paper as well as in
the video.
An over-view of the entire Project giving broad details about the Project, its length,
packages, objectives, conceptualisation etc. was explained by the Project Director of the
concerned Package.
The Project Director explained an over-view of planned activities in the Project and specific
details about the package in greater detail. The location or a cross-section in question was
discussed with the aid of graphics.
T The relevant features of the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy were also explained.
T he Consultants then, discussed the objectives, methodology adopted and planning stages,
with respect to the Environmental and Social aspects of the Project.
The information dissipation further covered guiding parameters for deciding design and
alignment alternatives, final highway alignment, issues raised by the people in the past,
consultations held, places where reports have been kept for display etc.
The avoidance, minimisation and mitigation measures specific to the Package were also
discussed at length.
All cases - specific to the concerned package where some mitigation measures are being
provided and those sites for which specific enhancement drawings have been prepared
were also discussed and explained with the help of photographs, maps, sketches and other
graphic aids.
The negative impacts, especially relevant to the local areas of a particular Package were
discussed in detail.
The benefits arising out of the project - both general and specific (to the concerned
Package) were also pointed out in order to present a complete scenario to the participants,
especially those who are being negatively affected by this Project.
The observations of the participants on matters of relevance to them were noted down and their
questions answered. The participants were provided details regarding the Grievance Redressal
Mechanism and support mechanisms and systems through which the people can continue to
participate in this Project
In the end, the closing remarks from community leaders/ representatives or participants were
also entertained. In all the cases, the participation and initiative to effectively carry out the Public
Involvement Programme was found to be very high among all the concerned NHAI officials.

4.  FOLLOW-UP PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROGRAMME
Community Consultation and consultation with the communities is a useful tool in both Project
planning stage as well as during the implementation of the Project. Effective and sincere efforts
in this direction would mean that the Project affected individuals/ groups along with other
stakeholders are informed and educated about the proposed action both before and after the
project development decisions have been made.
The follow-up process, when initiated increases the Project proponent's credibility and helps in
reducing public resistance towards the changes anticipated while planning and executing
development decisions. The people get a platform in the decision-making process and this
increases their confidence in the proponents of the Project.
During the Follow-up sessions, it was by and large observed that the people did not point out
any major issues. Most of the elements that were discussed were certain apprehensions related
to the Project or were clarifications and confirmations that they were seeking regarding local
issues directly from the officials of the implementation agency.
In general, initial interaction with the people revealed their encouraging and co-operative
attitude towards the four-laning project. In all the meetings, the communities already had a
good level of awareness regarding the Project. The main apprehension among the Project
affected people was related to either their sudden and large-scale relocation or amount and
timely payment of compensation in case of land acquisition. The people were repeatedly assured
that land acquisition has been minimised and that the compensation will be paid before the
initiation of the construction activity. They were also provided details regarding the resettlement
policy, entitlement framework that has been prepared for the Project and that in any case no
person - whether a squatter or an encroacher shall be suddenly or forcefully evicted.
4.1      MAJOR CONCERNS RAISED BY THE PEOPLE
The meetings for "follow-up" initiated as part of the Community Consultation Programme in
GTRIP were held at four different locations, namely Agra (Package IA), Kanpur (Package IIB),
Sasaram (Package IVC) and Barhi (Package VB). Some of the concerns and questions raised by
the people in all these four meetings revolved around similar issues, while some other concerns
were specific to that particular package. The documentation on the specific discussion and issues
has been done separately, which can be referred ahead in this Chapter. The major concerns that
were common to all the four follow-up meetings are being described below -
* Widening and Alignment of the Highway
The extent of proposed widening of the Highway along with the direction in which the alignment
has been fixed was a common concern. In all the four meetings, project affected persons
enquired about the exact and location specific details regarding the stated issue. The Project
Directors of the respective packages gave details in this regard and discussed this further with
the interested individuals after the meetings were formally over.

*  Land Acquisition
The concern about the land that has been proposed for acquisition for improving geometric
deficiencies and construction of by-passes was high among the participants. The people were
concerned about how much land would be acquired in particular villages, the amount of
compensation that would be paid and the time period within which the legal formalities are likely
to be completed.
* Encroachments and Squatters
One of the common issues raised in all the four follow-up meetings was that of encroachers and
squatters, who are likely to be impacted. The people were very concerned about the impact of
the Project on their residential and commercial properties. Kiosks owners were mainly concerned
about the impact on their livelihood. Some of them pointed out the problems of low levels of
income, unemployment, dependent members, lack of economic opportunities and insecurity -
due to which a negative impact on livelihood becomes a primary concern. However, they said
they willing to shift laterally along the road in the light of their weak status.
a Road Safety
Safety was a major concern, which was pointed out in each of the follow-up meetings. People
were concerned about the safety of school children and pedestrians. They felt that four laning
would induce many more vehicles and higher speeds, which may lead to an increase in the rate
and number of accidents. People pointed out that provision of road safety measures should be
an important consideration during design and construction of the Highway.
a  Cultural Properties
During the meetings, some representatives also pointed out that the Highway alignment should
not impact the sensitive or locally important religious structures including temples, dargahs,
graveyards, mosques etc. The people appreciated the enhancement plans proposed for some of
these cultural properties located along the project corridor.
4.2      MEETING-WISE DETAILS
The common issues in all the four follow-up meetings have already been discussed above. The
details about the specific presentation made by the representatives of the Project Proponent and
the concerns that were raised by the people thereafter are being mentioned below.
The specific details of each meeting have been summarized under two heads, namely
presentations by the officials and representatives of NHAI and concerns or issues raised by the
people.
4.2.1    MEETING AT AGRA
As mentioned ahead in the text, the follow-up meeting of the Community Consultation
Programme for Package IA was held at Agra. The meeting was organized in the premises of the
office of the District Magistrate, Agra District and was held on 20th March 2001. The basic data

sheet of the meeting can be referred in Annexure 8. In Agra, participation of women in the
meeting was a positive side of the Community Consultation Programme. In all, three women
were present and they participated in the proceedings of the Meeting.
Presentations made by the Officials and Representatives of NHAI
The presentations made by the officials and representatives of the NHAI covered the following
main aspects -
.   An over-view  of the entire Project, including details related to its length, packages,
objectives etc. was explained by the Project Director. An over-view of the various activities
that have been planned for in the Project was also stated.
The specific details about the package such as its length, projected traffic, cost, highway
configuration were presented in greater detail. The Project Director also explained the
relevant features of the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy and the Entitlement
Framework that has been evolved for the Project.
The emphasis in the second presentation made by the Consultants was to make the people
familiar with the objectives and methodology adopted in the Project for integrating
environmental and social aspects. Another important objective was to inform the people
regarding the development decisions that have been made so far and to give an elaborate
feed back on how the issues raised by them in the past were integrated into Project design.
People were also informed about the places where the reports have been kept for public
reference and in the case of problems or grievances during implementation, how and where
they can contact the concerned authorities, including Project Implementation Unit and
NGOs, who will be responsible for implementing the RAP.
The information that was given to the people also covered the basic parameters that were
considered for deciding design and alignment of the Highway. The local details in this
regard were explained with the help of maps.
The details of various existing and project induced issues with respect to Package IA such
as land acquisition, tree cutting, air and noise pollution, relocation of squatters and
encroachers, resettlement etc. were also provided. This discussion also included sensitive
issues related to Taj Trapezium Zone and Agra Reserve Forest, which were explained with
the help of maps and drawings.
Thereafter, various package specific avoidance, minimisation and mitigation measures were
also discussed at length. The mitigation measures proposed for resolving some of the
important issues such as the measures proposed for Taj Trapezium zone, preventive
measures for prohibiting garbage dumping along the highway, mitigative measures adopted
in the Agra Reserve Forest stretch were explained with the help of drawings, sketches and
photographs. Drawings of other general mitigation measures proposed in the Project were
also shown.
The enhancement spots in Package IA were shown on a map. The detailed drawings of
some of these enhancement plans, namely those of Temple at Etmadpur, Dargah near
Mohamadabad, incidental enhancement at Rambag and the space between two Yamuna
bridges etc. were shown and explained to the participants. A few general enhancement
drawings like those of bus-stops, community seating areas, road side plantation, hand
pumps, ponds, wells etc were also shown and discussed with the participants.
The benefits arising out of the project - both general and specific to the Package were also
pointed out in order to present a complete scenario to the participants, especially those who
are being negatively affected by this Project.

Fo/,'ow-up Public Consultation Programme: Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
Concerns or Issues Raised by the People
The specific issues raised by the participants were very broadly related to land acquisition and
local environmental problems. The following main points were raised -
One of the concerns raised in the meeting related to ground water recharge. It was pointed
out that the four-laning of the Highway will substantially increase the black top or hard
surface, resulting in more surface run-off and lesser recharging of the ground water in the
area.
The people were interested in knowing about the measures that have been taken up in the
Project with regard to ground water recharging. The measures proposed in the Project
including recharge pits in the urban drains were explained to the people with the help of
drawings.
The project affected persons and other representatives of the community were more
interested in the amount of compensation and the time period within which it will be
cleared. The land owners on the other hand asked for clarifications regarding the amount of
land being acquired in particular villages and the time period that will be required to solve
the related legal proceedings.
The people requested that delays or prolonged period of waiting should not be reduced the
bare minimum and that at all points of time the authorities should be able to clarify their
doubts and apprehensions. Nonetheless, they did state that the people do support the
Project and were willing to extend a helping hand whenever required. But at the same time
their interests and rights should be protected and taken care of.
The relevant features of the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy, Entitlement framework,
NGO involvement, support to vulnerable groups and Grievance Redressal Mechanism were
explained and people were asked to contact the site office of the NHAI in case they face
any problems during any stage of the implementation of the Project.
*   A few people did reflect their concern regarding traffic congestion and safety of pedestrians,
which is especially a matter of serious concern in the heavily developed sections of the
settlement areas.
*   Another important issue raised by an official representing the Forest Department, Agra
Circle relates to road-side plantation. It was pointed out that after four-laning of the
Highway, with utilities, settlements, squatters and encroachers there is hardly any space left
in the RoW for road-side plantation. The problem becomes grave since most of the
stretches in the densely populated and congested sections remain unavailable for
Compensatory Reforestation programme. The officials cited similar problems they have
encountered during reforestation along the National Highway in Delhi-Agra section. Under
such circumstances, the Forest Department and NHAI together will have to identify areas or
wastelands where the compensatory reforestation programme will be executed.
*   It was also suggested that the material to be used, as a fill-up in the median or the divider
should be good quality so that it can support survival and proper growth planted species.
*   The people also pointed out a concern towards garbage dumping along the Highway and
after the explanation on measures that have been proposed in the Project expressed their
satisfaction regarding it.
People also showed interest in the various landscape plans and enhancement plans and
drawings that have been prepared for the Project.
The officials from the Forest Department were very much interested in the mitigation
measures proposed to avoid collision of wild animals with speeding vehicles along the
stretch where the Highway passes through the Agra Reserve Forest. The officials discussed
in detail the type and size of under-passes that have been proposed. The need for provision

Follow-up Pfublic Consultation Programme: Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
of underpasses was emphasised since the existing culverts are filled with water during
monsoon, which forces the animals to use the Highway for crossing over.
The NHAI officials have assured that both before and during implementation, there will be a
continuous interaction with the Forest Officials on all matters pertaining to Agra Reserve
Forest and Compensatory Forestation among others.
4.2.2    MEETING AT KANPUR
Package IIB passes through periphery of Kanpur Metropolitan Area and is lined with industries,
squatters, schools, hospitals,and other public facilities. Public participation exercise was held in
Kanpur city, with the meeting being held in the premises of the Project Implementation Unit,
NHAI on the 17th March 2001. The meeting helped in adjudging the view-point of the people
about the project on one hand and on the other removed certain apprehensions related to
design in the Kanpur section. The basic data sheet of the meeting organized at Kanpur can be
referred in Annexure 8.
o    Presentations made by the Officials and Representatives of NHAI
The presentations made by the officials and representatives of the NHAI covered both the
general as well package specific details, which can be summed up in the following main points -
*   The presentation was initiated by the Project Director with the usual description of the
Project and its over-view, including details related to length, packages, objectives etc. Also,
the various activities that have been planned for in the Project were also stated. The
specific narration about the package such as its length, projected traffic, cost, highway
configuration were presented in much greater detail.
*   The Project Director also explained the relevant features of the Resettlement and
Rehabilitation Policy and the Entitlement Framework that has been evolved for the Project.
*   The emphasis, as stated earlier in the second part of the presentation made by the
Consultants was to make the people familiar with the objectives and methodology adopted
in the Project for integrating environmental and social aspects.
An important objective was to inform the people regarding the development decisions that
have been made so far and to give an elaborate feed back on how the issues raised by
them in the past were integrated into Project design.
People were also informed about the places where the reports have been kept for public
reference and in the case of problems or grievances during implementation, how and where
they can contact the concerned authorities, including Project Implementation Unit and
NGOs, who will be responsible for implementing the RAP.
   Most of the package specific details were explained with the help of maps, drawings and
sketches. The emphasis was more on describing the main elements by directly using village
or settlement names than by stating chainages, which may be difficult for a common man
to comprehend.
*   The details of various existing and project induced issues with respect to Package IIB such
as provision of access in the raised carriage way section, Ramadevi fly-over, affect on
commercial properties, road safety, noise and air pollution through out Kanpur by-pass
section, water logging, impact on cultural properties such as Brahmadev temple etc. were
also provided.
*   After this discussion on existing and project induced issues, the various package specific
avoidance, minimisation and mitigation measures were discussed at length. The mitigation
measures proposed for resolving some of the important issues such as under-passes, noise

barriers along sensitive locations along the Kanpur by-pass, provision of drainage,
segregation of traffic stretch etc. were explained with the help of drawings, sketches and
cross-sections. Drawings of other general mitigation measures proposed in the Project were
also shown.
The detailed drawings of some of these enhancement plans, namely those of Brahmadev
Temple, an old Shiva temple etc. were shown and explained to the participants. A few
general enhancement drawings like those of bus-stops, community seating areas, road side
plantation, hand pumps, ponds, wells etc were also shown and discussed with the
participants. All the enhancement locations in Package IIB were shown on a map. The
benefits of the project - both general and specific to the package were summarised in the
end.
Concerns or Issues Raised by the People
The specific issues raised by the participants were related basically to Ramadevi Fly-over and
affect on encroachments and squatters. The participants raised the following main points -
The people reacted positively to the Project and emphasised again and again that they will
continue to support such an ambitious Project. They appreciated the incorporation of
environment and social issues in a road project and were hopeful of a successful
implementation of the entire Project.
*   Some of the village heads or sarpanchs such as that of Purvamir village stated that they will
fully support the project and will help in all possible ways including provision of gram
panchayat land for resettlement, reforestation, establishment of hot mix plants and labour
camps etc.
D   The participants raised many questions about the proposed fly-over at Ramadevi crossing.
The Project Director answered all queries in this regard. The common inquiries related to
the starting and end point of the fly-over and affect on the near-by residential and
commercial areas, including squatters and shops. People were also concerned about the
impact on a major residential colony (HAL township), located close to the crossing and
asked whether the fly over will obstruct the main entry of this colony. People stated that the
fly-over should restrict or affect the main entry of this township.
T The details were given regarding the exact points of construction and people were assured
that the neither the entry nor the residential structures along the proposed fly-over will be
impacted. However, there are a few small kiosks and other shops (about 5 to 7), which are
likely to be affected due to the construction of this fly-over.
When the cross-section of the raised carriage-way in the Kanpur by-pass section was being
explained by the Project Director, the immediate question raised by the people was that
related to access across the road.
The details about the under-passess and accesses along this stretch were provided to the
people and explained with the help of a typical cross-section of this stretch.
*   During the presentation when use of fly ash was being discussed one or two participants
reflected their interest in knowing about the quantity of fly ash that will be used and the
place from where it will be procured.
*   The details in this regard were given and it was specified that fly ash would be used in the
construction of embankments along the Highway.
A few participants appreciated the concept and designs of enhancement of community
properties that is being taken up in the Project. They also enquired about the number of
hand pumps being enhanced and areas or villages were these enhancements would be
carried out. All these details were provide to the participants and explained with the help of
drawings and sketches.

FoAi,wv-up Pub/ic Consultation Programme: grand Trunk Road improvement Project
The most significant concern among the project-affected persons has been the impact on
their residential properties. People stated that the hardest hit groups during relocation are
the ones who lose their shelter. They further said that in such circumstances, the most
vulnerable are the women and children of the household.
They repeatedly said that these considerations should be kept in mind and compensation
should be adequate enough to cover the expenses of building a new shelter. It was also
stated that house-for-house was a much better option than cash compensation since it is
possible that this cash is either not appropriately used or used for clearing past dues etc.
The legal owners of the land asked for clarifications regarding the amount of land being
acquired in their villages and the time when the authorities will notify them. They were keen
to know more on the Market Value Assessment Procedure.
The Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy, Entitlement framework, support to vulnerable
groups and Market Value Assessment Procedure was explained and people were asked to
freely contact the site office of NHAI in case of any difficulty or enquiry, during the
implementation of the Project.
4.2.3    MEETING AT SASARAM
Sasaram bypass is a part of Package IVC where the thid Community Consultation Meeting was
organized. The stretch is crucial from the point of view of land acquisition and has been a matter
of concern for many people ever since the proposal to construct a by-pass came up. A large part
of the land that will be required to construct this almost 20 km long by-pass is agricultural land.
The meeting was organized in the premises of the office of the District Magistrate, Rohtas
District and was held on 22nd March 2001. The basic data sheet of the meeting can be referred in
Annexure 8. The most significant concerns that again and again re-emerged during the
discussion at Sasaram were related to the proposed by-pass of the town, road safety and impact
on cultural properties.
3    Presentations made by the Officials and Representatives of NHAI
The presentations made covered the following main aspects -
The initial portion of all the presentations was basically the same in every meeting covering
an over-view of the entire Project, including details related to length, packages, objectives
etc., which was covered by the Project Director. The specific details about the package and
the relevant features of the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy and the Entitlement
Framework were presented in greater detail.
The second presentation made by the Consultants aimed at familiarising the people about
objectives and methodology adopted for integrating various environmental and social
aspects in the Project. An important objective was to inform the people regarding the
decisions and progress that have been made so far and to give an elaborate feed back on
how the issues raised by them in the past were integrated into Project design. People were
also informed about the places where the reports have been kept for public reference.
The information that was given to the people also covered the basic parameters that were
considered for deciding design and alignment of the Highway. The local details in this
regard were explained with the help of maps.
The details of various existing and project induced issues with respect to Package IVC such
as land acquisition for Sasaram by-pass, loss of agricultural land, road safety, impact on
cultural properties such as Roza Mazar etc. were also provided.

Thereafter, various package specific avoidance, minimisation and mitigation measures were
also discussed at length. The emphasis was mitigation measures proposed specific to
Package IVC. Drawings of other general mitigation measures proposed in the Project were
also shown.
The enhancement spots in Package IVC were shown on a map. The detailed drawings of
some of these enhancement plans, namely those of Mai ki Kutiya, Roza Mazar etc. were
shown and explained to the participants. A few general enhancement drawings like those of
bus-stops, community seating areas, road side plantation, hand pumps, ponds, wells etc
were also shown and discussed. In the end, the associated and created benefits of the
Project were summarised for the participants.
Concerns or Issues Raised by the People
The following are the main points that were raised by the participants in the meeting -
The first and the foremost concern of the people was that related to road safety. People
pointed out that with increasing traffic and speedier movement of vehicles, the most
vulnerable in congested settlement sections are cyclists, pedestrians and school children.
People enquired about the various road safety measures that are being proposed in the
Project and emphasised that adequate signage, speed breakers and under-passes should be
provided. Also, instances of major accidents on the Highway were stated to emphasize that
the problem of road accidents is a serious issue.
All such road safety measures that been proposed in the Project, including some that have
been integrated with Highway design were explained and elaborated with the help of
graphics.
It was stated that speed breakers within the stretch of Highway passing through Sasaram
town should be provided immediately in order to control the increasing trend of collisions
and accidents within the settlement limits.
*   The next most significant issue was that related to land acquisition for the proposed by-
pass. The amount of land to be acquired in particular villages/sections, the expected time
period for completion of legal proceedings, amount of compensation, likely delays, if any
etc. were the common questions. People have also requested the NHAI to provide a
detailed map showing the land acquisition details.
*   All the relevant details related to the by-pass and its construction were provided by the
Project Director and people on the whole expressed their satisfaction towards the Project.
The people were assured that the land acquisition details along with patta (survey) numbers
will be provided for their reference soon.
People also enquired about the time period that has been set towards Project completion
and when exactly the implementation or construction will be initiated. They stated that
people of Sasaram would be satisfied and grateful, if most of the ambitious details that
were mentioned in the presentation become a ground reality.
The participants stated that the existing alignment of the Highway passing through the
town should be periodically maintained right up to the completion of the Project and the
NHAI officials on their part have assured that such periodic maintenance will be taken
undertaken from time to time.
The representatives of the legal owners of the land, from whom the land would be acquired
for the construction of by-pass asked for clarifications regarding the total land that will be
acquired in their villages and the time when the authorities will notify them.
The officials of the NHAI provided the details that the participants were interested in and
explained at length the various related procedures and the time frame, within which they
were expecting all such legal and procedural formalities to be completed.

Fol/ow-up Pub/ic Consultation Programme: Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
The people showed keen interest in the details related to disbursement of compensation
and market value assessment procedure, which were duly provided and explained at length
by the officials of NHAI.
Some of the participants and community representatives emphasised that the road leading
to the tomb of Shershah Suri should be widened and enhanced adequately to emphasize
the importance of this archeologically and historically important structure.
The enhancement plans and drawings of Suraj kund gate, kos minar and signage about the
Sher Shah's tomb that have been proposed in this Package of the Project were shown to
the people. It was stated clearly that enhancement of cultural properties and community
facilities are two important components of the Project and due consideration to all such
properties - whether of local or national importance has been given in the Project.
Provision of proper drainage facility was another concern raised by the people. It was stated
that the drains should be covered in the urban areas to prevent them from clogging due to
waste dumping.
People were told that drainage has been an important element of highway design and
proper drains, including the ones that are covered have been provided for in the Project.
The participants suggested that proper access roads should be provided to the temple and
Roza Mazar, located close to the proposed by-pass alignment.
Moreover, the people suggested that the existing Highway and the proposed by-pass should
be connected through an internal road somewhere in the middle of the Sasaram town.
People were informed that some of these issues were outside the purview of the
responsibilities and functions of NHAI and thus, there is a limited contribution that NHAI
can make in order to resolve them. Nonetheless, the NHAI officials on their part will convey
the same to the local authorities, with whom they interact occasionally to resolve Project
related matters.
-   It was stated by some representatives of the religious communities that the proposed
alignment for the by-pass should not affect the cultural properties such as temples,
graveyards and mazar in the area.
-   The officials of the NHAI made it very clear that the Project has been sensitive enough,
right from its inception as to not impact the regional or locally important manifestations of
cultural belief. In fact, all possible attempts have been made for enhancing the
surroundings, improvement of the access, provision of parking (wherever possible) and
informal seating arrangements (like chabutaras) etc.
*   Provision of signage - both cautionary and informative on the Highway was another
suggestion that has been put forward by the people at Sasaram.
*   Nonetheless, people stated that they fully support the Project and were willing to provide
help and assist the NHAI in putting this ambitious Project into a reality. People said that
they would provide all possible co-operations since the Project itself has been designed by
keeping the public interests in mind. Some of the participants wished success and early
implementation of the Project.
4.2.4    MEETING AT BARHI
Barhi town is the only major settlement in Package VB where the fourth follow-up meeting of the
Community Consultation Programme in GTRIP was organized. As mentioned earlier, the highway
passes through the buffer area of the sanctuary and mismanagement and lack of precautions
both during construction and operation stages can pose a major threat to the flora and fauna in
this sensitive area, which is already under stress due to deforestation for fuel wood
procurement, over-grazing and illegal tree felling.

Fc/iaw-UL Pujb/ic Consultation Programme: Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
The meeting was organized in the premises of Inspection bungalow at Barhi. The meeting was
held on 24t' March 2001. The basic data sheet of the meeting can be referred in Annexure 8.
Presentations made by the Officials and Representatives of NHAI
The presentations made by the officials and representatives of the NHAI covered the following
main aspects -
As mentioned earlier, over-view of the entire Project, various activities that have been
planned for in the Project and the specific details about the package were presented in
detail. The Project Director also explained the relevant features of the Resettlement and
Rehabilitation Policy and the Entitlement Framework that has been evolved for the Project.
The objectives and methodology adopted in the Project for integrating environmental and
social aspects was explained to the participants. People were informed about the issues
raised by them in the past and how these were integrated into Project design. People were
also informed about the places where the reports have been kept for public reference.
The details of various existing and project induced issues with respect to Package VB such
as those related to Gautam Buddha Sanctuary, impact on cultural properties and community
facilities, protection and enhancement of the historical and archeologically important sites in
the Package etc were provided.
Thereafter, the various package specific avoidance; minimisation and mitigation measures
were also discussed. The mitigation measures proposed for resolving some of the important
issues through provision of under-passes in the sanctuary, provision of water holes,
plantation, prevention of air and noise pollution during construction, provision of additional
studies in the Sanctuary area, road safety measures etc. were discussed in detail.
T he detailed drawings of some of these enhancement plans, namely those of the
community pond at 292.3 km, Surajkund Gate and Kos Minar etc. were shown and
explained to the participants. All the enhancement spots in Package VB were shown on a
map. A few general enhancement drawings like those of bus-stops, community seating
areas, road side plantation, hand pumps, ponds, wells etc were also shown and discussed
with the participants.
The benefits of the project - both general and specific to this Package were also pointed
out in order to present a complete scenario to the participants, especially those who are
being negatively affected by this Project.
Concerns or Issues Raised by the People
The most significant concern raised by the people was that related to road safety and provision
of drainage. In fact, the concerns raised by the people in the meeting at Barhi were few
compared to those raised in meetings at Agra or Sasaram. The participants in the meeting raised
the following main points -
The only concern raised by the people was that related to road safety. The increasing traffic
volume and speedier vehicle movement is a matter of concern in settlement sections and
other congested stretches on the Highway. People said that adequate various road safety
measures should be provided.
The safety measures that have been included in the Project and its design - both for
construction as well as the operation stage were discussed and on the whole people
revealed their satisfaction towards the provision of such measures.
Water logging in certain sections, especially during monsoon was also pointed out. In order
to improve the situation, provision of proper drains was suggested.

F/clLv- up Public Consultation Programme: Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
It was specified that the project has already looked into this problem closely and drains
have been provided through the length of the Highway. Covered drains in the settlement
areas have been provided to prevent them from clogging.
The representative of the participants acknowledged that the NHAI has been very much
successful in creating the confidence among local citizens and assured full public
co-operation and support throughout the Project.
The people also recollected the main issues that had been discussed in the workshop/
meeting that had been organised earlier in Barhi about a year and half back. They
mentioned that it is expected that the benefits of the community at large will be kept in
mind and the Project will provide for over-all development of one and all. They further
stated that Community Consultation Programme organised by the NHAI has been very
much useful and that they were pleased to see that some of the issues that they had been
raised in the past meting have been incorporated in the Project design.
People also appreciated the presentation material (slides, maps and drawings) that had
been prepared for the Package.
Nonetheless, the representative of the participants stated that the public has to remain alert
and conscious about the Project developments and at any point if the people face problems
during implementation, they should immediately contact the site office of the NHAI.
-   The Project Director summed up the public views and reaction to the Project as one that
has moved from a 'apprehension' to 'alert consciousness'. The aim of public involvement
and that of awareness generation has thus, been achieved.
4.3      OVERALL COMMUNITY PERCEPTION OF THE PROJECT
The follow-up consultation, which was (organized as a part of the Community Consultation
Programme) conducted in March 2001, provided an added opportunity to gauge the acceptance
of the Project. It appears that the GTRIP project on the whole enjoys a high level of public
acceptance.
As regards acceptance of the Project by the community, they understand the need for better
road and allied facilities. There were also opinions that with the increasing traffic over the years
the road needs widening to accommodate speeding vehicles.
However, with the entire above, there was still a concern for those having kiosks, shops,
residences etc. within the RoW. This concern was observed among both PAPs and fellow
community members. Nonetheless, they specified that they were satisfied with the over-all
intentions of the project and the arrangements made therein and were hopeful that the plans
will fall in place during actual implementation as well. They were assured that people were free
to contact the Project Offices of the NHAI to clarify issues or questions arising during
implementation and can seek more details on specific matters from time to time.

1.  SUMMARY EMP: PACKAGE - IA
INTRODUCTION
The National Highway-2 (NH-2) connecting Delhi with Kolkata is one of the most important high-
density corridors in the country. The existing highway is a two-lane carriageway with traffic
bottlenecks and various highway deficiencies. To cater to the existing high volume of traffic, there is
an urgent need for capacity augmentation of this highway.
The 1400km long NH-2 falls in the Upper Gangetic Plain in northern India and traverses through the
states of Delhi. Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. As part of the Delhi-Kolkata segIment of the
Golden Quadrilateral, the Delhi-Agra section (210km) at the west end, and Barwa Adda-Kolkata
section (278km) at the east end of the NH-2 have already been 4-laned with assistance from the
ADB.
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is improving the Agra-Dhanbad portion of the NH-2
with assistance from the World Bank. To facilitate the project preparation, the corridor stretch has
been divided into five packages. International consultants have been appointed for the planning and
design of each of these five packages, each about 200km long. Each contract package has been
further divided into 16 contract packages. Eight of the 16 contract packages were selected for Third
National Highway Project (TNHP).
Of the remaining eight packages, seven have been proposed under the Grand Trunk Road
Improvement Project (GTRIP). The Allahabad bypass (Contract Package III-B) has not been included
as part of TNHP or GTRIP and will be taken up subsequently for construction by NHAI with funding
from the World Bank.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Package-I starts at km. 199.660 of NH-2 at Agra and ends at km. 393.000. The package has been
divided further into three contract packages for the ease of implementation, namely IA, l and IC.
Package-IA traverses through flat terrain of rich agricultural belt in the Gangetic Plains. The Contract
Package IA extends from km 199.660 of NH2 at Agra (the end of the existing bridge on river
YamLina) to km 250.500 just after crossing the Thana Mathesana road. Two important towns Tundla
(km 222.000) and Firozabad (km 235.000 to 242.000) fall within this package. The other important
villages are Etmadpur (km 217.000), Raja ka Tal (km 233.000) and Thana Mathesana (km 248.000).
IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS
The objective of the project is to widen to 4 lanes (or 6 lanes in the first 21 km section c,f Package I-
A). the existing highway to meet the traffic needs for the next 20-30 years. It entailed detailed
analysis of the present and future traffic, pavement and soil conditons, construction materials, cross-
drainage structures, economic justifications, and environmental/social features. As a guiding
principle, the project avoided land acquisition, displacement of people and properties, and loss of
roadside trees, as much as possible, and several variations in the configuraton of the proposed
development resulted from such consideratons.
The proposed improvements include widening to 4-lane carriageways by addition of a new2-lane 7m
wide carriageway for the entire GTRIP stretch, except in the first 21 km section of Packacle I-A (where
the improvement would consist of reconstruction as a 6-lane carriageway). There would be (raised)
median divider for the entire stretch, generally of a width of 5m, but of lesser width (as low as 1.5m)
in places where space is not available. There would also be 1.5m wide paved shoulders, and 1 m
earthen shoulders on either side of the highway.
The existing cross-drainage structures (major/minor bridges and culverts) on the highway will be
repaired/ rehabilitated, including widening to standard width, if required. Additionally, new cross-
drainage structures (mostly culverts) will be provided in areas of waterlogging, and whenever the
existing ones are inadequate.
Keeping in view the safety requirements, geometric improvements will be made to the horizontal and
vertical profile of the highway, by straightening of sub-standard curves (minor realignments), and by
providing proper transition and banking. To avoid the areas of congestion, and where adequate land
is not available without displacing a large number of residential/commercial structures, bypasses will
be provided. To minimise adverse impacts on various settlements and to minimise land/property
acquisition, short bypasses and realignments have been proposed.
A number of measures were incorporated in the design to segregate the slow and the fast moving
traffic (so as to reduce the possibility of accidents).Roadside drains will be provided for the entire
stretch, including covered drains in the built-up areas. The project incorporates elaborate schemes
for illumination, signage, and safety elements such as crash barriers and guide rails. A few ROBs
and flyovers are also proposed. Adequate roadside facilities like truck-parking bays, rest areas, bus
bays and bus shelters have been proposed. The proposed improvements planned for in Package I A
have been presented in Table 2.

A number of inter-linked studies were carried out as part of the Project Preparation activities. The
main stages or the methodology adopted covers the following:
* Preliminary Environmental and Social Screening;
* Documentation of Baseline Conditions:
* Assessment of Potential Impacts;
* Community Consultation;
* Integration of Environmental Assessments in the Design Process;
* Assessment of Alternatbves;
* Mitigation & Enhancement Measures;
* Environmental Management Plans (EMPs);
* Review of ElAs and the EMPs; and
* Consolidation of EIA and EMPs
SOCIAL & ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM THE PROJECT
1. Macro-Economic Benefits: The project is seen as a major generator of economic momentum,
and will benefit the economically backward states of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand in a significant
way. The project is expected to remove the industrial development bottlenecks, bring the cost of
transportation down, and thereby benefit all sections of the society. The project will further open
up the vast hinterlands of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand to the eastern gateway ports of Kolkata and
Haldia. The investment in rigid pavement is expected to boost the cement industry, and further
trickle down to the other sectors of economy.
The direct benefits accrue due to the reduction in the vehicle operating cost (VC)C) and the
savings in the value of time (VOT) of the road-users. Present value of the said direct benefits is
estimated at US$2170 million.
The present value of the investments in the project is estimated at US$550 million. Given this
investment and the direct benefits, the net benefit of the project is estimated at US$1620 million,
at an economic internal rate of return of about 30%. If the indirect benefits (i.e., the benefits
accruing d ue to growth of industrialisabon, improvement of accessibility, particularly to the social
and health infrastructure, etc.) were also measured, the net benefit of the project would be much
higher.
2. Accident Reduction Benefits: The existing highway stretches under GTRIP are known to have
high rates of accidents. Most of the accidents now involve single vehicles, and the fatality among
the pedestrians and the slow-moving traffic is significantly higher. Due to the project, medians will
segregate vehicles moving in the opposite directions, segregation of slow and fast moving traffic
will occur by means of service roads in the built-up areas. Geometric deficiencies will be
improved. Pedestrian facilities, organised bus-bays, footpaths, guardrails, crash barriers and
proper signage will be provided. Parking lay-byes, and ROBs will be provided. Twenty-nine lives
will be saved every year, along with prevention of about 3,000 injuries. Over all, accident risks will
be reduced by 68 percent over the whole stretch of GTRIP.
3. Local Facilities: Passenger amenities like bus stops, passenger sheds, underpasses, organised
parking lots, lay byes and service lanes will be added. Common property resources and
community assets will be conserved (which otherwise are decaying) and enhanced (detailed
plans, designs and budgetary allocation has been made for about--- such sites).
3



4. Employment Generation: Large employment opportunities (about half a million person-months,
and for about 40,000 persons) will be directly created by the project, of which about 15 percent
will occur in Package 1A.
5. Improved Access to Amenities: This will include speedier access to employment, health and
education centres, increased opportunity for economic activities, and reduction in transportation
costs and enlarged market access for the agriculture and household manufacturingi sectors.
6. Environmental Benefits:
The Benefits Associated to the project will include:
*  Reduction of noise pollution due to increased road capacity and speedier traffic, lessened
congestion, traffic segregation;
* Direct and significant reduction of overall fuel consumption.
Benefits Created (planned, designed and budgeted) by the project will include,
*  Increased overall safety levels and mitigation of existing accident black-spots:
 Reduction of air and noise pollution through better traffic management schemes, by providing
adequate designs for traffic separation, parking, ensuring smooth flow of traffic, etc.;
* Creation of low-noise zones and noise shadows (particularly at education and health facilities
near the project corridor);
*  Reuse of industrial waste materials such as bottom pond ash (generically known ,as fly ash);
*  Better visual environment, by means of cleaning of the project site and the immediate vicinity of
the existing heap of indiscriminate dumping of wastes and dirt;
*  Enhancement' of environmentally, ecologically and culturally important sites and common
property resources (about 100 places);
* Landscaping of the entire project corridor (over and above compensatory afforestation),
*  Improved local and roadside drainage; improving and augmenting waterways forseveral cross-
drains, rivulets and rivers, preservabon of water bodies and water sources;and
* Introduction of low-pollution construction techniques, scheduling, plants and machinery, etc.
The EMPs and the RAPs prepared (for each of the contract packages) take care of all such potential
impacts (which could not be avoided during the design/preparation).
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNITY CONSULTATION
Public participation and community consultation has been taken up as an integral part of social and
environmental assessment process of the Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project. The process
carried out at various stages of the project preparation, public participation has been viewed as a
continuous two way process, involving promotion of public understanding of the processes and
mechanisms through which developmental problems and needs are investigated and solved.
Objectives: Consultation was used as a tool to inform and educate stakeholders aboutthe proposed
acton both before and after the development decisions were made. It assisted in identification of the
problems associated with the project as well as the needs of the population likely to be impacted.
This participatory process helped in reducing the public resistance to change and enabled the
Environmental enhancements include EMP measures taken at places to improve the quality or
ambience where there is no adverse effect of the project, and is distinct from the mitigation
measures.

participation of the local people in the decision making process. The involvement ciF the various
stakeholders ensured that the affected population and other stakeholders are informed, consulted
and are allowed to participate at various stages of project preparation. The process aimed at
promoting public awareness about the proposed project especially amongstthe potentially impacted
communitbes/individuals including the entitlement framework and ResettlementAction FPlan (RAP).
The consultation programme has been conducted at several levels, such as:
* Heads of the households likely to be impacted;
* Members of the households likely to be impacted;
* Clusters of PAPs;
. Villagers:
 Village Panchayats;
* Local voluntary organisabions, and CBOslNGOs;
* Government agencies and departments;
* Other project stakeholders, such as women, tribal and ethnic communities, road user
groups, health professionals and others.

ISSUES RAISED BY PUBLIC AND ADDRESSAL OF THE ISSUES
The focus of the community consultation sessions was in developing solutions to the issues raised.
Resettlement and compensation was a major issue in all the consultation sessions or the public
meetings. Some of the concerns were applicable to the entire project area, whereas at certain
locations there were specific issues raised. The environmental issues/concerns made by local
residents, focus groups and government officials have been summarized under the following heads:
*  Air and Noise Pollution                        *  Fauna and Flora
*  Traffic Congestion                             *  Roadside Drainage

THE CULTURAL SETTING
The NH-2 or the GT Road has a long history. On the project corridor lies important cultural centres
such as Agra. Firozabad, Allahabad, Varanasi. Some of the major settlements along the GTRIP
corridors have grown out of the original highway-side rest areas (saraI) established in the 1 6th century
AD, There are two archaeological protected monuments and sites of significance within 1 km of the
project corridor, which are Budiya ka Taal, and Rambagh in Package I.
The Taj Trapezium Zone
The Taj Trapezium Zone houses for over 40 protected monuments, four of which are listed as World
Heritage Site (WHS) namely the Taj Mahal, the Agra fort and the Fatepur Sikri and a the Bird
Sanctuary within the Bharatpur National Park. The tomb of Akbar (at Sikandra) and Itmad-ud-Daula's
tomb have been proposed for designation as the World Heritage Site. In addition, there are more
than 40 protected monuments within the trapezium. The major centers covered under the Trapezium
are Mathura and Vrindavan towards its northwest corner; Frozabad at its south east corner;
Keoladeo National Park. Bharatpur in the west direction; and Agra as the epicentre of the area.
Firozabad. which is on the project road, lies in the southeast corner of the Taj Trapezium. None of
the aforesaid monuments is within 2km of the highway, and therefore, are not directly irmpacted.
MITIGATION MEASURES
Certain impacts have been actually avoided (or minimised) during project preparation. Examples of
total avoidance include avoiding impacting water bodies and cultural assets by realignment or
bypassing. Examples of minimising impacts include minimising felling of roadside tree plantation,
minimising land acquisition and impacts on people and properties. Such minimisation has been
possible by earmarking a corridor of impact (Col), and restricting all proposed project activity within
such Col. Table 5 details out the Mitigation Measures that have been proposed in Package IA of the
Project Corridor.
Table 5 - Mitigation Measures Proposed
Issue                                     Mitigation Measures
Removal of road side    Forestry clearance obtained; compensatory afforestation @ 2 saplings for each tree felled.
trees                Additional road plantation will be carried out. A total of 37929 trees will be planted with a
total cost of Rs. 28.5 lacs.
Taj Trapezium        The standards of sensitive areas are to be complied with which are as below:
RPM: 50 pg/m3  NO.: 15 ug/m3
SPM: 70 ,g/m3  Pb: 0.5 pg/m3
S02: 15 pgIm3  CO: 1000 Pg/m3
All values except CO are annual averages while for CO its is an 8 hour average
Loss of productive top   15 cm of topsoil will be preserved in all areas of cutting, strpping or borrowing. The
soil                 preserved topsoil will be used for redevelopment of borrow areas, and any existing
wasteland. It is expected that the redevelopment of borrow areas will be done at an
estimated cost of Rs. 50 lacs from which a portion will be assigned preservation of
stripped soil.
Forest land acquisiton   With clearance from Forest Department, compensatory afforestaton will be done through
the Forest Department
Garbage dumping      A wall shall be constructed along the stretch of the road beyond Agra at a cost of Rs. 50
lacs in the reserved forestwhere illegal dumping of the citys garbage is nlow taking place.

groups               to be compensated and/or assisted irrespective of their ownership status. Additional
assistance to vulnerable groups will be given.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT MEASURES PROPOSED
A description of the various management measures during the various stages of the project is
provided in the following sections.
Pre-construction Stage
During the pre-constructon stage, the management measures required will include, the clearance of
the RoW, transplantation of the candidate trees identified, the measures for protecting/replacing
community resources such as hand pumps and other utilities likely to be impacted. Their
enhancement shall also be completed before construction actually starts so that the community can
start using these while the construction activity begins.
Construction Stage
This will be the most crucial and active stage for the Environmental Management Plan. In addition to
the monitoring of the construction activity itself to ensure that the environment is not impacted
beyond permissible limits, the enhancement of cultural properties, mitigabon and enhancement
measures for water bodies will go on simultaneously as the construction progresses. The major
measures are:
*  Proper siting of labour camps, construction equipment and plants E.g. Hotmix plants 500 m from
settlements.
*  Provision for oil and grease traps and sedimentation basins at areas where pollution from
vehicles is likely. E.g. Near vehicle storage areas
8



* Traffic safety plan to be implemented by contractor after approval of Engineer
*  Contractor to conform to all ant-malarial instructions given to him by the Engineer.
*  No borewell or extraction of groundwaterwithout permission of UP Groundwater Board.
* Construction over and close to non-perennial streams shall be undertaken in the dry season.
* Construction expected to disrupt users and impacting community water bodies will be taken up
after serving notice on the local community.
* Any dust generated will be cleared immediately by manual sweeping and removal of debris, or
mechanically if required.
* The road surfaces-shall be hosed or watered using necessary equipment, if required.
Operation Stage
The operaton stage will essentially entail monitoring activity along the corridor. The monitoring for
pollutants specified in the Monitoring Plan will serve the two purposes. In addition to checking the
efficacy of the protection/mitigation/enhancement measures implemented, this will help verify or
refute the predictions made as a part of the impact assessment. Thus, it will corriplete a very
important feedback loop for the NHAI.
The responsibility for implementation and supervision of EMPs are vested with four agencies, namely
Contractors, NHAI, PIU and Engineers. The Contractors herein mean the agency hired for execution
of the construction works for the respective contract packages. NHAI would be the implementation
agency at two levels one at Centre referred as NHAI and the other at Package level named as PIU,
in the EMP.

1.  SUMMARY EMP: PACKAGE - IIB
INTRODUCTION
The National Highway-2 (NH-2) connecting Delhi with Kolkata is one of the most important high-
density corridors in the country. The existing highway is a two-lane carriageway with traffic
bottlenecks and various -highway deficiencies. To cater to the existing high volume of traffic, there is
an urgent need for capacity augmentation of this highway.
The 1400km long NH-2 falls in the Upper Gangetic Plain in northern India and traverses through the
states of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. As part of the Delhi-Kolkata se(gment of the
Golden Quadrilateral, the Delhi-Agra section (210km) at the west end, and Barwa Adda-Kolkata
section (278km) at the east end of the NH-2 have already been 4-laned with assistance from the
ADB.
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is improving the Agra-Dhanbad portion of the NH-2
with assistance from the World Bank. To facilitate the project preparabon, the corridor stretch has
been divided into five packages. International consultants have been appointed for the planning and
design of each of these five packages, each about 200km long. Each contract package has been
further divided into 16 contract packages. Eight of the 16 contract packages were selected for Third
National Highway Project (TNHP).
Of the remaining eight packages, seven have been proposed under the Grand Trunk Road
Improvement Project (GTRIP). The Allahabad bypass (Contract Package III-B) has not been included
as part of TNHP or GTRIP and will be taken up subsequently for construction by NHAI with funding
from the World Bank.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Package 11 starts from km 393.000 at Sikandra and ends at km 115.000 near Khaga. T his package
has been further subdivided into three contract packages namely, IIA, IIB and IIC. Package 11 B is
considered under the GTRIP. It starts at km. 470.000 and goes via Kanpur bypass (krn. 473.200 -
km. 491.992) and ends at km. 38.000.  At the end of Kanpur bypass, the Chainage based on
distance from Delhi ends (km 491.992) and thereafter, the Chainage based on distance from Kanpur
town starts (km 8.462).
Major industries located along this stretch are LML Scooters, LML Ancillary of scooter parts,
Duncans Fertilisers, Indane LPG Gas Plant, Rajendra Steel Pipes and SAIL warehouse. Stretches
with high-density commercial development are located at Bhaunti (km 470.000 - km 471.000), Panki
(km 471.000 - km 472.000), Gujaini (km 5.000), Barra (km 9.000), Naubasta (km 11.000), Kidwai
Nagar (km 12.000) and Rama Devi (km 19.000). Very high traffic volumes (as high as 300,058 PCUs
by 2015 AD) are projected along the corridor. A divided four-lane carriageway has been proposed for
the highway.
IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS
The objective of the project is to widen to 4 lanes (or 6 lanes in the first 21 km section of Package I-
A). the existing highway to meet the traffic needs for the next 20-30 years. It entailed detailed
analysis of the present and future traffic, pavement and soil conditions, construction materials, cross-
drainage structures, economic justifications, and environmental/social features. As a guiding
principle. the project avoided land acquisition, displacement of people and properties, and loss of
roadside trees, as much as possible, and several variations in the configuration of the proposed
development resulted from such considerations.
The proposed improvements include widening to 4-lane carriageways by addition of a new 2-lane 7m
wide carriageway for the entire GTRIP stretch, except in the first 21 km section of Package I-A (where
the improvement would consist of reconstruction as a 6-lane carriageway). There would be (raised)
median divider for the entire stretch, generally of a width of 5m, but of lesser width (as low as 1 .5m)
in places where space is not available. There would also be 1.5m wide paved shoulders, and 1m
earthen shoulders on either side of the highway.
The existing cross-drainage structures (major/minor bridges and culverts) on the highway will be
repaired/ rehabilitated, including widening to standard width, if required. Additionally, new cross-
drainage structures (mostly culverts) will be provided in areas of waterlogging, and whenever the
existing ones are inadequate.
Keeping in view the safety requirements, geometric improvements will be made to the horizontal and
vertical profile of the highway, by straightening of sub-standard curves (minor realignments), and by
providing proper transition and banking. To avoid the areas of congestion, and where adequate land
is not available without displacing a large number of residential/commercial structures, bypasses will
be provided. To minimise adverse impacts on various settlements and to minimise land/property
acquisition, short bypasses and realignments have been proposed.
A number of measures were incorporated in the design to segregate the slow and the fast moving
traffic (so as to reduce the possibility of accidents).Roadside drains will be provided for the entire
stretch, including covered drains in the built-up areas. The project incorporates elaborate schemes
for illumination, signage, and safety elements such as crash barriers and guide rails. A few ROBs
and flyovers are also proposed. Adequate roadside facilities like truck-parking bays, rest areas, bus

SOCIAL & ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM THE PROJECT
1. Macro-Economic Benefits: The project is seen as a major generator of economic momentum,
and will benefit the economically backward states of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand in a significant
way. The project is expected to remove the industrial development bottlenecks, bring the cost of
transportation down, and thereby benefit all sections of the society. The project will further open
up the vast hinterlands of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand to the eastern gateway ports of Kolkata and
Haldia. The investment in rigid pavement is expected to boost the cement industry, and further
trickle down to the other sectors of economy.
The direct benefits accrue due to the reduction in the vehicle operatng cost (VOC) and the
savings in the value of time (VOT) of the road-users. Present value of the said direct benefits is
estimated at US$2170 million.
The present value of the investments in the project is estimated at US$550 million. Given this
investment and the direct benefits, the net benefit of the project is estimated at US$1620 million,
at an economic internal rate of return of about 30%. If the indirect benefits (i.e., the benefts
accruing due to growth of industrialisation, improvement of accessibility, particularly to the social
and health infrastructure, etc.) were also measured, the net benefit of the project would be much
higher.
2. Accident Reduction Benefits: The existing highway stretches under GTRIP are known to have
high rates of accidents. Most of the accidents now involve single vehicles, and the fatality among
the pedestrians and the slow-moving traffic is significantly higher. Due to the project, medians will
segregate vehicles moving in the opposite directions, segregation of slow and fast moving traffic
will occur by means of service roads in the built-up areas. Geometric deficiencies will be
improved. Pedestrian facilities, organised bus-bays, footpaths, guardrails, crash barriers and
proper signage will be provided. Parking lay-byes, and ROBs will be provided. Twenty-nine lives
will be saved every year, along with preventon of about 3,000 injuries. Over all, accident risks
will be reduced by 68 percent over the whole stretch of GTRIP.
3



3. Local Facilities: Passenger amenities like bus stops, passengersheds, underpasses, organised
parking lots, lay byes and service lanes will be added. Common property resources and
community assets will be conserved (which otherwise are decaying) and enhanced (detailed
plans. designs and budgetary allocation has been made for about----- such sites).
4. Employment Generation: Large employment opportunities (about half a million person-months,
and for about 40,000 persons) will be directly created by the project, of which about 15 percent
will occur in Package IIB.
5. Improved Access to Amenities: This will include speedier access to employment, health and
education centres, increased opportunity for economic activities, and reduction in transportation
costs and enlarged market access for the agriculture and household manufacturing sectors.
6. Environmental Benefits:
The Benefits Associated to the project will include:
e  Reduction of noise pollution due to increased road capacity and speedier traffic, lessened
congestion, traffic segregation;
  Direct and significant reduction of overall fuel consumpton.
Benefits Created (planned, designed and budgeted) by the project will include,
*  Increased overall safety levels and mitigation of existing accident black-spots;
* Reduction of air and noise pollution through better traffic management schemes, by providing
adequate designs for traffic separation, parking, ensuring smooth flow of traffic, etc.;
*  Creation of low-noise zones and noise shadows (partcularly at education and health facilities
near the project corridor);
*  Reuse of industrial waste materials such as bottom pond ash (generically known as fly ash);
Better visual environment, by means of cleaning of the project site and the immediate vicinity of
the existing heap of indiscriminate dumping of wastes and dirt;
*  Enhancement' of environmentally, ecologically and culturally important sites and common
property resources;
* Landscaping of the entire project corridor (over and above compensatory afforestation),
*  Improved local and roadside drainage; improving and augmenting waterways for several cross-
drains, rivulets and rivers, preservation of water bodies and water sources; and
*  Introduction of low-polluton constructon techniques, scheduling, plants and machinery, etc.
The EMPs and the RAPs prepared (for each of the contract packages) take care of all such potenbal
impacts (which could not be avoided during the design/preparation).
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNITY CONSULTATION
Public participation and community consultation has been taken up as an integral part of social and
environmental assessment process of the Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project. The process
carried out at various stages of the project preparation, public participation has been viewed as a
continuous two way process, involving promotion of public understanding of the processes and
mechanisms through which developmental problems and needs are investigated and solved.
Environmental enhancements include EMP measures taken at places to improve the quality or ambience
where there is no adverse effect of the project, and is distinct from the mitigaton measures.
4



Objectives: Consultation was used as a tool to inform and educate stakeholders about the proposed
action both before and after the development decisions were made. It assisted in identification of the
problems associated with the project as well as the needs of the population likely to be impacted.
This participatory process helped in reducing the public resistance to change and enabled the
participation of the local people in the decision making process. The involvement cif the various
stakeholders ensured that the affected population and other stakeholders are informed, consulted
and are allowed to participate at various stages of project preparation. The process aimed at
promoting public awareness about the proposed project especially amongst the potentially impacted
communitiesfindividuals including the entitlement framework and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).
The consultation programme has been conducted at several levels, such as:
. Heads of the households likely to be impacted;
* Members of the households likely to be impacted;
* Clusters of PAPs:
* Villagers;
. Village Panchayats;
* Local voluntary organisations, and CBOs/NGOs;
* Government agencies and departments;
- Other project stakeholders, such as women, tribal and ethnic communities, road user groups,
health professionals and others.

ISSUES RAISED BY PUBLIC AND ADDRESSAL OF THE ISSUES
The focus of the community consultation sessions was in developing solutions to the issues raised.
Resettlement and compensation was a major issue in all the consultation sessions or the public
meetings. Some of the concerns were applicable to the entire project area, whereas at certain
locations there were specific issues raised. The environmental issues/concerns made by local
residents, focus groups and government officials have been summarized under the following heads:
*  Air and Noise Pollution                      *  Fauna and Flora
*  Traffic Congestion                           *  Roadside Drainage
*  Road Safety                                  *  Water bodies
*  Cultural Properties                          *  Roadside Amenities
Public Consultation will be organised in March 2001 to appraise the people about the final road
design and how the local issues have been addressed by the project. The following plan for the
continued participabon of the various stakeholders, especially the project affected has been worked
out to ensure time bound and effective achievements of the implementabon of the various EA
measures proposed -

MAJOR ISSUES
The focus in GTRIP has been on the positive and negative impacts associated with the
improvement/rehabilitation of the Project Corridor. The impacts on the various environmental
components have been evaluated for both the construction and operation stages. Table 4 describes
the major issues that have been identified in Package I.

MITIGATION MEASURES
Certain impacts have been actually avoided (or minimised) during project preparation. Examples of
total avoidance include avoiding impacting water bodies and cultural assets by realignment or
bypassing. Examples of minimising impacts include minimising felling of roadside tree plantation,
6



minimising land acquisition and impacts on people and properties. Such minimisation has been
possible by earmarking a corridor of impact (Col), and restricting all proposed project activity within
such Col. Table 5 details out the Mitigaton Measures that have been proposed in Package IA of the
Project Corridor.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT MEASURES PROPOSED
A description of the various management measures during the various stages of the project is
provided in the following sections.
Pre-construction Stage
During the pre-construction stage, the management measures required will include, the clearance of
the RoW, transplantation of the candidate trees identified, the measures for protecting/replacing
community resources such as hand pumps and other utilities likely to be impacted. Their
enhancement shall also be completed before construction actually starts so that the community can
start using these while the construction activity begins.
Construction Stage
This will be the most crucial and active stage for the Environmental Management Plan. In addition to
the monitoring of the construction actvity itself to ensure that the environment is riot impacted
7



beyond permissible limits, the enhancement of cultural properties, mitgation and enhancement
measures for water bodies will go on simultaneously as the construction progresses. The major
measures are:
* Proper siting of labour camps, construction equipment and plants E.g. Hot mix plants 500 m
from settlements.
. Provision for oil and grease traps and sedimentation basins at areas where pollution from
vehicles is likely. E.g. Near vehicle storage areas
* Traffic safety plan to be implemented by contractor after approval of Engineer
* Contractor to conform to all anti-malarial instructions given to him by the Engineer.
* No borewell or extraction of groundwater without permission of UP Groundwater Board.
* Construction over and close to non-perennial streams shall be undertaken in the clry season.
* Construction expected to disrupt users and impacting community water bodies will be taken up
after serving notice on the local community.
 Any dust generated will be cleared immediately by manual sweeping and removal of debris, or
mechanically if required.
* The road surfaces shall be hosed or watered using necessary equipment, if required.
Operation Stage
The operation stage will essentially entail monitoring activity along the corridor. The monitoring for
pollutants specified in the Monitoring Plan will serve the two purposes. In addition to checking the
efficacy of the protection/mitigation/enhancement measures implemented, this will help verify or
refute the predictions made as a part of the impact assessment. Thus, it will complete a very
important feedback loop for the NHAI.
The responsibility for implementaton and supervision of EMPs are vested with four agencies, namely
Contractors, NHAI, PIU and Engineers. The Contractors herein mean the agency hired for execution
of the construction works for the respective contract packages. NHAI would be the implementation
agency at two levels one at Centre referred as NHAI and the other at Package level named as PIU,
in the EMP.

SUMMARY EMP: PACKAGE - IVC
INTRODUCTION
The National Highway-2 (NH-2) connecting Delhi with Kolkata is one of the most important high-
density corridors in the country. The existing highway is a two-lane carriageway with traffic
bottlenecks and various highway deficiencies. To cater to the existing high volume of traffic, there is
an urgent need for capacity augmentation of this highway.
The 1400km long NH-2 falls in the Upper Gangefic Plain in northern India and traverses through the
states of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. As part of the Delhi-Kolkata segment of the
Golden Quadrilateral, the Delhi-Agra section (21 0km) at the west end, and Barwa Adda-Kolkata
section (278km) at the east end of the NH-2 have already been 4-laned with assistance from the
ADS,
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is improving the Agra-Dhanbad portion of the NH-2
with assistance from the World Bank. To facilitate the project preparation, the corridor stretch has
been divided into five packages. International consultants have been appointed for the planning and
design of each of these five packages, each about 200km long. Each contract package has been
further divided into 16 contract packages. Eight of the 16 contract packages were selected for Third
National Highway Project (TNHP).
Of the remaining eight packages, seven have been proposed under the Grand Trunk Road
Improvement Project (GTRIP). The Allahabad bypass (Contract Package III-B) has not been included
as part of TNHP or GTRIP and will be taken up subsequently for construction by NHAI with funding
from the World Bank.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Package IV starts at km 317.000 and ends at km 140.000 at the end of Sone bridge in Dehri-on-
Sone. The Package is sub-divided into two contract Packages IV A and Package IV C. Package IV A



starts at km. 317.000 and ends at km. 65.000 in Mohania at Durgawati. In between, it passes
through Varanasi bypass (km 318.942 - km 21.270) crossing River Ganga at km 15.000. Package IV
C starts at km 110.000 and ends at km 140.000, between kmr.1 11.000 and 130.000 the existing NH-2
passes through the Sasaram town and it will be bypassed on the southern side of the existing
alignment.
IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS
The objective of the project is to widen to 4 lanes, the existing highway to meet the traffic needs for
the next 20-30 years. It entailed detailed analysis of the present and future traffic, pavernent and soil
conditions, construction materials, cross-drainage structures, economic justifications, and
environmental/social features. As a guiding principle, the project avoided land acquisition,
displacement of people and properties, and loss of roadside trees, as much as possible, and several
variations in the configuration of the proposed development resulted from such considerations.
The proposed improvements include widening to 4-lane carriageways by addition of a new 2-lane 7m
wide carriageway for the entire GTRIP stretch. There would be (raised) median divider for the entire
stretch, generally of a width of 5m, but of lesser width (as low as 1.5m) in places where space is not
available. There would also be 1.5m wide paved shoulders, and 1 m earthen shoulders on either side
of the highway.
The existing cross-drainage structures (majorlminor bridges and culverts) on the highway will be
repaired/ rehabilitated, including widening to standard width, if required. Additionally, new cross-
drainage structures (mostly culverts) will be provided in areas of waterlogging, and whenever the
existing ones are inadequate.
Keeping in view the safety requirements, geometric improvements will be made to the horizontal and
vertical profile of the highway, by straightening of sub-standard curves (minor realignments), and by
providing propertransition and banking. To avoid the areas of congestion, and where adequate land
is not available without displacing a large number of residential/commercial structures, bypasses will
be provided. To minimize adverse impacts on various settlements and to minimize land/property
acquisition, short bypasses and realignments have been proposed.
A number of measures were incorporated in the design to segregate the slow and the fast moving
traffic (so as to reduce the possibility of accidents). Roadside drains will be provided for the entire
stretch, including covered drains in the built-up areas. The project incorporates elaborate schemes
for illumination, signage, and safety elements such as crash barriers and guide rails. A few ROBs
and flyovers are also proposed. Adequate roadside facilities like truck-parking bays, rest areas, bus
bays and bus shelters have been proposed. The proposed improvements planned for in Package
IVC have been presented in Table 2.

METHODOLOGY ADOPTED
A number of inter-linked studies were carried out as part of the Project Preparation activities. The
main stages or the methodology adopted covers the following:



Preliminary Environmental and Social Screening;
Documentation of Baseline Conditions:
Assessment of Potential Impacts:
Community Consultation;
Integration of Environmental Assessments in the Design Process;
Assessment of Alternatives;
Mitigation & Enhancement Measures;
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs);
Review of ElAs and the EMPs; and
Consolidation of EIA and EMPs
SOCIAL & ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM THE PROJECT
Macro-Economic Benefits: The project is seen as a major generator of economic mornentum, and
will benefit the economically backward states of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand in a significant way. The
project is expected to remove the industrial development bottlenecks, bring the cost of transportation
down, and thereby benefit all sections of the society. The project will further open up the vast
hinterlands of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand to the eastern gateway ports of Kolkata and Haldia. The
investment in rigid pavement is expected to boost the cement industry, and further trickle down to the
other sectors of economy.
The direct benefits accrue due to the reduction in the vehicle operating cost (VOC) and the savings in
the value of time (VOT) of the road-users. Present value of the said direct benefits is estimated at
US$21 70 million.
The present value of the investments in the project is estimated at US$550 million. Given this
investment and the direct benefits, the net benefit of the project is estimated at US$1620 million, at
an economic internal rate of return of about 30%. If the indirect benefits (i.e., the benefits accruing
due to growth of industrialisation, improvement of accessibility, particularly to the social and health
infrastructure, etc.) were also measured, the net benefit of the project would be much higher.
Accident Reduction Benefits: The existing highway stretches under GTRIP are known to have high
rates of accidents. Most of the accidents now involve single vehicles, and the fatality among the
pedestrians and the slow-moving traffic is significantly higher. Due to the project, medians will
segregate vehicles moving in the opposite directions, segregation of slow and fast moving traffic will
occur by means of service roads in the built-up areas. Geometric deficiencies will be improved.
Pedestrian facilities, organised bus-bays, footpaths, guardrails, crash barriers and proper signage will
be provided. Parking lay-byes, and ROBs will be provided. Twenty-nine lives will be saved every
year. along with prevention of about 3,000 injuries. Over all, accident risks will be reduced by 68
percent over the whole stretch of GTRIP.
Local Facilities: Passenger amenities like bus stops, passenger sheds, underpasses, organised
parking lots, lay byes and service lanes will be added. Common property resources and community
assets will be conserved (which otherwise are decaying) and enhanced (detailed plans, designs and
budgetary allocabon has been made for about --- such sites).



Employment Generation: Large employment opportunities (about half a million person--months, and
for about 40,000 persons) will be directly created by the project, of which about 15 percent will occur
in Package lB.
Improved Access to Amenities: This will include speedier access to employment, health and
education centres, increased opportunity for economic activites, and reduction in transportation
costs and enlarged market access for the agriculture and household manufacturing sectors.
Environmental Benefits:
The Benefits Associated to the project will include:
Reduction of noise pollution due to increased road capacity and speedier traffic, lessened
congestion, traffic segregation;
Direct and significant reduction of overall fuel consumption.
Benefits Created (planned, designed and budgeted) bythe projectwill include,
Increased overall safety levels and mitigation of existing accident black-spots;
Reduction of air and noise pollution through better traffic management schemes, by providing
adequate designs for traffic separation, parking, ensuring smooth flow of traffic, etc.;
Creaton of low-noise zones and noise shadows (particularly at education and health facilities near
the project corridor);
Reuse of industrial waste materials such as bottom pond ash (generically known as fly ash);
Better visual environment, by means of cleaning of the project site and the immediate vicinity of
the existing heap of indiscriminate dumping of wastes and dirt;
Enhancement' of environmentally, ecologically and culturally important sites and common property
resources;
Landscaping of the entire project corridor (over and above compensatory afforestation),
Improved local and roadside drainage; improving and augmenting waterways for several cross-
drains, rivulets and rivers, preservation of water bodies and water sources; and
Introduction of low-pollution construction techniques, scheduling, plants and machinery, etc.
The EMPs and the RAPs prepared (for each of the contract packages) take care of all such potential
impacts (which could not be avoided during the design/preparaton).
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNITY CONSULTATION
Public participation and community consultation has been taken up as an integral part of social and
environmental assessment process of the Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project. The process
carried out at various stages of the project preparation, public participation has been viewed as a
continuous two way process, involving promotion of public understanding of the processes and
mechanisms through which developmental problems and needs are investigated and solved.
Objectives: Consultation was used as a tool to inform and educate stakeholders about the proposed
acton both before and after the development decisions were made. It assisted in identification of the
problems associated with the project as well as the needs of the population likely to be impacted.
Environmental enhancements include EMP measures taken at places to improve the quality or ambience
where there is no adverse effect of the project, and is distinct from the mrtigation measures.



This participatory process helped in reducing the public resistance to change and enabled the
participation of the local people in the decision making process. The involvement ol the various
stakeholders ensured that the affected population and other stakeholders are informed, consulted
and are allowed to participate at various stages of project preparation. The process aimed at
promoting public awareness about the proposed project especially amongst the potentially impacted
commnunitiesfindividuals including the entitlement framework and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).
The consLUltation programme has been conducted at several levels, such as:
Heads of the households likely to be impacted;
Members of the households likely to be impacted;
Clusters of PAPs;
Villagers:
Village Panchayats;
Local voluntary organisations, and CBOs/NGOs;
Government agencies and departments;
Other project stakeholders, such as women, tribal and ethnic communities, road user groups,
health professionals and others.

ISSUES RAISED BY PUBLIC AND ADDRESSAL OF THE ISSUES
The focus of the community consultation sessions was in developing solutions to the issues raised.
Resettlement and compensation was a major issue in all the consultation sessions or the public
meetings. Some of the concerns were applicable to the entire project area, whereas at certain
locations there were specific issues raised. The environmental issues/concerns made by local
residents, focus groups and government officials have been summarized underthe following heads:
*  Air and Noise Pollution                      *  Fauna and Flora
*  Traffic Congestion                           *  Roadside Drainage
*  Road Safety                                  *  Water bodies
*  Cultural Properties                          *  Roadside Amenities
Public Consultation will be organised in March 2001 to appraise the people aboutthe final road
design and how the local issues have been addressed by the project. The following plan for the
continued participation of the varous stakeholders, especially the project affected has been

MAJOR ISSUES
The focus in GTRIP has been on the positive and negative impacts associated with the
improvementlrehabilitation of the Project Corridor. The impacts on the various environmental
components have been evaluated for both the construction and operation stages. Table 4 describes the
major issues that have been identified in Package IVC.

MITIGATION MEASURES
Certain impacts have been actually avoided (or minimized) during project preparabon. Examples oftotal
avoidance include avoiding impactng water bodies and cultural assets by realignment or bypassing.
Examples of minimizing impacts include minimizing felling of roadside tree plantation, minimizing land
acquisition and impacts on people and properties. Such minimization has been possible by earmarking
a corridor of impact (CIO), and restricting all proposed project activity within such CIO. Table 5 details
out the Mitigation Measures that have been proposed in Package IVC of the Project Corridor.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT MEASURES PROPOSED
A description of the various management measures during the various stages of the project is provided
in the following sections.
Pre-construction Stage
During the pre-construction stage, the management measures required will include, the clearance of the
RoW,. transplantation of the candidate trees identified, the measures for protecting/replacing community
resources such as hand pumps and other utilities likely to be impacted. Their enhancement shall also
be completed before construction actually starts so that the community can start using these while the
construction activity begins.
Construction Stage
This will be the most crucial and active stage for the Environmental Management Plan. In addition to the
monitoring of the construction activity itself to ensure that the environment is not impacted beyond
permissible limits, the enhancement of cultural properties, mitigation and enhancement measures for
water bodies will go on simultaneously as the construction progresses. The major rneasures are:
* Proper siting of labour camps, construction equipment and plants E.g. Hot mix plants 500 m from
settlements.
Provision for oil and grease traps and sedimentation basins at areas where pollution from vehicles
is likely. E.g. Near vehicle storage areas
7



*  Traffic safety plan to be implemented by contractor after approval of Engineer
*  Contractor to conform to all anti-malarial instructions given to him by the Engineer.
*  No bore-well or extraction of groundwaterwithout permission of UP Groundwater Board.
*  Construction over and close to non-perennial streams shall be undertaken in the dry season.
*  Construction expected to disrupt users and impacting community water bodies will be taken up
after serving notice on the local community.
*  Any dust generated will be cleared immediately by manual sweeping and removal of debris, or
mechanically if required.
*  The road surfaces shall be hosed or watered using necessary equipment, if required.
Operation Stage
The operation stage will essentially entail monitorng activity along the corridor. The monitoring for
pollutants specified in the Monitoring Plan will serve the two purposes. In addition to checking the
efficacy of the protection/mitigation/enhancement measures implemented, this will help verify or refute
the predictions made as a part of the impact assessment. Thus, it will complete a very important
feedback loop for the NHAI.
The responsibility for implementation and supervision of EMPs are vested with four agencies, namely
Contractors, NHAI, PIU and Engineers. The Contractors herein mean the agency hired for execution of
the construction works for the respective contract packages. NHAI would be the implementation agency
at two levels one at Center referred as NHAI and the other at Package level named as PIU, in the EMP.

SUMMARY EMP: PACKAGE - VB
INTRODUCTION
The National Highway-2 (NH-2) connecting Delhi with Kolkata is one of the most important high-
density corridors in the country. The existing highway is a two-lane carriageway with traffic
bottlenecks and various highway deficiencies. To cater to the exsting high volume of traffic, there
is an urgent need for capacity augmentation of this highway.
The 1400km long NH-2 falls in the Upper Gangetic Plain in northern India and traverses through
the states of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. As part of the Delhi-Kolkata segment
of the Golden Quadrilateral, the Delhi-Agra section (210km) at the west end, and Barwa Adda-
Kolkata section (278km) at the east end of the NH-2 have already been 4-laned with assistance
from the ADB.
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is improving the Agra-Dhanbacl portion of the
NH-2 with assistance from the World Bank. To facilitate the project preparation, the corridor stretch
has been divided into five packages. International consultants have been appointed for the
planning and design of each of these five packages, each about 200km long. Each contract
package has been further divided into 16 contract packages. Eight of the 16 contract packages
were selected for Third National Highway Project (TNHP).
Of the remaining eight packages, seven have been proposed under the Grand Trunk Road
Improvement Project (GTRIP). The Allahabad bypass (Contract Package III-B) has not been
included as part of TNHP or GTRIP and will be taken up subsequently for construction by NHAI
with funding from the World Bank.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Package VB falls within the state of Bihar, starting from km. 240.000 to km 320.000. This 80km
long corr-idor passes through the districts of Gaya and Hazaribagh.  Sparingly inhabited area,
rolling agricultural terrain, hilly protected forest area, deficient geometric alignments, uncontrolled
ribbon development at four locations and severe pavement conditions are some of the
characteristics of this package stretch. Barhi is the major settlement along this corridor.
IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS
The objective of the project is to widen to 4 lanes, the existing highway to meet the traffic needs for
the next 20-30 years. It entailed detailed analysis of the present and future traffic, pavement and
soil conditions, construction materials, cross-drainage structures, economic justifications, and
environmental/social features. As a guiding principle, the project avoided land acquisition,
displacement of people and properties, and loss of roadside trees, as much as possible, and
several variations in the configuration of the proposed development resulted from such
considerations.
The proposed improvements include widening to 4-lane carriageways by addition of a new 2-lane
7rn wide carriageway for the entire GTRIP stretch. There would be (raised) median divider for the
entire stretch, generally of a width of 5m, but of lesser width (as low as 1.5m) in places where
space is not available. There would also be 1.5m wide paved shoulders, and lm  earthen
shoulders on either side of the highway.
The existing cross-drainage structures (major/minor bridges and culverts) on the highway will be
repaired/ rehabilitated, including widening to standard width, if required. Additionally, new cross-
drainage structures (mostly culverts) will be provided in areas of waterlogging, and whenever the
existing ones are inadequate.
Keeping in view the safety requirements, geometric improvements will be made to the horizontal
and vertical profile of the highway, by straightening of sub-standard curves (minor realignments),
and by providing proper transition and banking. To avoid the areas of congestion, and where
adequate land is not available without displacing a large number of residential/commercial
structures. bypasses will be provided. To minimize adverse impacts on various settlements and to
minimize land/property acquisition, short bypasses and realignments have been proposed.
A number of measures were incorporated in the design to segregate the slow and the fast moving
traffic (so as to reduce the possibility of accidents). Roadside drains will be provided for the entire
stretch. including covered drains in the built-up areas. The project incorporates elaborate schemes
for illumination, signage, and safety elements such as crash barriers and guide rails. A few ROBs
and flyovers are also proposed. Adequate roadside facilities like truck-parking bays, rest areas,
bus bays and bus shelters have been proposed.
The traffic volumes along the corridor are projected to be 58,452 PCUs by 2015 AD, A divided
four-lane carriageway with rigid pavement for main carriageway with shoulders and flexible
pavements for service roads have been proposed for Package V B of the project. The proposed
improvements planned as part of the GTRIP are presented in Table 2.
Table 2: Proposed Improvements - Package V B
Widening direction    Length (km) Percentage
North           27.201       33.4%
Concentric or Transition  4.87       6.0%
South            49.35       60.6%
Urban Section       7.772        9.5%
Total    .      81.475      100.0%
For about 60% of the length of the road (49.35km), the road shall been widened towards south, for
another 33% of the length (27.2km), the direction of widening is towards north. Rest of the corridor
length has been proposed to be widened concentrically, especially in semi-urban areas, to reduce
property acquisition. It also includes transrtion stretches while changing from north side widening
to south side widening. At number of places along this package, the existing road alignment
needed horizontal profile correction to bring the geometrics of proposed road alignment to NH
2



standards. In several places this has introduced unavoidable swings where temporary diversion
road would be necessary to keep the traffic through during construction.
METHODOLOGY ADOPTED
A number of inter-linked studies were carried out as part of the Project Preparation activities. The
main stages or the methodology adopted covers the following:
*  Preliminary Environmental and Social Screening;
*  Documentation of Baseline Conditions;
*  Assessment of Potential Impacts;
*  Community Consultation;
*  Integration of Environmental Assessments in the Design Process;
*  Assessment of Alternatives;
*  Mitigation & Enhancement Measures;
*  Environmental Management Plans (EMPs);
*  Review of ElAs and the EMPs; and
*  Consolidation of EIA and EMPs
SOCIAL & ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM THE PROJECT
Macro-Economic Benefits: The project is seen as a major generator of economic momentum,
and will benefit the economically backward states of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand in a significant way.
The project is expected to remove the industrial development bottlenecks, bring the cost of
transportation down, and thereby benefit all sections of the society. The project will further open up
the vast hinterlands of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand to the eastern gateway ports of Kolkata and
Haldia. The investment in rigid pavement is expected to boost the cement industry, and further
trickle down to the other sectors of economy.
The direct benefits accrue due to the reduction in the vehicle operating cost (VOC) and the
savings in the value of time (VOT) of the road-users. Present value of the said direct benefts is
estimated at US$2170 million.
The present value of the investments in the project is estimated at US$550 million. Given this
investment and the direct benefits, the net benefit of the project is estimated at US$1620 million, at
an economic internal rate of return of about 30%. If the indirect benefits (i.e., the benefits accruing
due to growth of industrialisation, improvement of accessibility, particularly to the social and health
infrastructure, etc.) were also measured, the net benefit of the project would be much higher.
Accident Reduction Benefits: The existing highway stretches under GTRIP are known to have
high rates of accidents. Most of the accidents now involve single vehicles, and the fatality among
the pedestrians and the slow-moving traffic is significantly higher. Due to the project, medians will
segregate vehicles moving in the opposite directions, segregation of slow and fast moving traffic
will occur by means of service roads in the built-up areas. Geometric deficiencies will be improved.
Pedestrian facilities, organised bus-bays, footpaths, guardrails, crash barriers and proper signage
will be provided. Parking lay-byes, and ROBs will be provided. Twenty-nine lives will be saved
every year, along with prevention of about 3,000 injuries. Over all, accident risks will be reduced by
68 percent over the whole stretch of GTRIP.
Local Facilities: Passenger amenities like bus stops, passenger sheds, underpasses, organised
parking lots, lay byes and service lanes will be added. Common property resources and
community assets will be conserved (which otherwise are decaying) and enhanced (detailed plans,
designs and budgetary allocation has been made for about ------- such sites).
3



Employment Generation: Large employment opportunities (about half a million person-months,
and fo- about 40,000 persons) will be directly created by the project. of which about 15 percent will
occur in Package IIB.
Improved Access to Amenities: This will include speedier access to employment, health and
education centres, increased opportunity for economic activities, and reduction in transportation
costs and enlarged market access for the agriculture and household manufacturing sectors.
Environmental Benefits
The Benefits Associated to the project will include:
*  Reduction of noise pollution due to increased road capacity and speedier traffic,
lessened congestion, traffic segregation;
e  Direct and significant reduction of overall fuel consumption.
*  Benefits Created (planned, designed and budgeted) by the project will include,
* Increased overall safety levels and mitigation of existing accident black-spots;
*  Reduction of air and noise pollution through better traffic management schemes,
by providing adequate designs for traffic separation, parking, ensuring smooth
flow of traffic, etc.;
*  Creation of low-noise zones and noise shadows (particularly at education and
health facilities near the project corridor);
*  Reuse of industrial waste materials such as bottom pond ash (generically known
as fly ash);
* Better visual environment, by means of cleaning of the project site and the
immediate vicinity of the existing heap of indiscriminate dumping of wastes and
dirt;
* Enhancement' of environmentally, ecologically and culturally important sites and
common property resources;
*  Landscaping  of the entire project corridor (over and above compensatory
afforestation),
  Improved local and roadside drainage; improving and augmenting waterways for
several cross-drains, rivulets and rivers, preservation of water bodies and water
sources; and
*  Introduction of low-pollution construction techniques, scheduling, plants and
machinery, etc.
The EMPs and the RAPs prepared (for each of the contract packages) take care of all such
potential impacts (which could not be avoided during the design/preparation).
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNITY CONSULTATION
Public participation and community consultation has been taken up as an integral part of social
and environmental assessment process of the Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project. The
process carried out at various stages of the project preparation, public participation has been
viewed as a continuous two way process, involving promotion of public understanding of the
processes and mechanisms through which developmental problems and needs are investigated
and solved.
Objectives: Consultation was used as a tool to inform and educate stakeholders about the
proposed action both before and after the development decisions were made. It assisted in
identification of the problems associated with the project as well as the needs of the population
likely to be impacted. This participatory process helped in reducing the public resistance to change
and enabled the participation of the local people in the decision making process. The involvement
of the various stakeholders ensured that the affected population and other stakeholders are
informed, consulted and are allowed to participate at various stages of project preparation. The
Environmental enhancements include EMP measures taken at places to improve the quality or
ambience where there is no adverse effect of the project, and is distinct from the mitigation measures.

process aimed at promoting public awareness about the proposed project especially amongst the
potentially  impacted  communities/individuals  including  the  entitlement  framework  and
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).
The consultation programme has been conducted at several levels, such as:
*  Heads of the households likely to be impacted;
*  Members of the households likely to be impacted;
*  Clusters of PAPs;
.  Villagers;
*  Village Panchayats:
*  Local voluntary organisations, and CBOs/NGOs;
*  Government agencies and departments;
*  Other project stakeholders, such as women, tribal and ethnic cornmunities, road
user groups, health professionals and others.

ISSUES RAISED BY PUBLIC AND ADDRESSAL OF THE ISSUES
The focus of the community consultation sessions was in developing solutions to the issues raised.
Resettlement and compensation was a major issue in all the consultation sessions or the public
meetings. Some of the concerns were applicable to the entire project area, whereas at certain
locations there were specific issues raised. The environmental issues/concerns made by local
residents, focus groups and government officials have been summarized under the following
heads:
*  Air and Noise Pollution                       *  Fauna and Flora
*  Traffic Congestion                            *  Roadside Drainage
*  Road Safety                                   *  Water bodies
*  Cultural Properties                           *  Roadside Amenities
Public Consultation will be organised in March 2001 to appraise the people about the final road
design and how the local issues have been addressed by the project. The following plan for the
continued participation of the various stakeholders, especially the project affected has been
worked out to ensure time bound and effective achievements of the implementation of the various
EA measures proposed -

MAJOR ISSUES
The focus in GTRIP has been on the positive and negative impacts associated with the
improvement/rehabilitation of the Project Corridor. The impacts on the various environmental
components have been evaluated for both the construction and operation stages. Table 4
describes the major issues that have been identified in Package VB.

Issue                                        Description
Removal of road side   A total of 3083 trees need to be removed to accommodate the Ro'l.
trees
The corridor passes through ecologically sensitive area, Gautam Buddha Wildlife
Sanctuary (km. 242.000 - km. 260.000). As land take is absent along the corridor
in the sanctuary area and road shall be widened in the existing RoW, impact on
flora is minimized. There are trees planted along roadside as part of a Social
forestry programme. However, these trees are newly planted and have age not
more than 9 years. Moreover, they are species of economic importance and do not
contribute to the species diversity. Hence, no major impacts are envisaged.
Flora and Fauna    The corridor is in place for the past 400 years and has become a part of the forest
ecology. The impacts likely on the fauna are only due to the increase in time
required for the animals to cross the road and the increase in impact on the
animals in case of collision, with increase in speed of the vehicles plying on the
road. Both the above cases are unlikely, as the animals are alreacly using the
existing cross drainage structures and these have developed over the years as wild
life corridors. Improved access into the sanctuary will increase the threat to wild life
due to illegal activities like poaching.
The predicted concentrations of SPM and NOx exceed the values for sensitive
High Air pollution  areas by 2015 A.D in Gautam Buddha wildlife sanctuary. The only large settlement
levels        along the entire corridor is Barhi. The values for SPM and NOx will exceed the
limits for residential area in the vicinity of the proposed bypass in 2015 A.D.
Noise levels along the Gautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary between km 242. 000
and km. 260.000 are found to be above the standards for sensitive areas. Very
High nolse levels    high noise levels (up to 83 dB(A)) are predicted for km. 252.000 to km. 260.000.
This corresponds to the steep rise in elevation in this section of the corridor.
Small urban areas, Chauparan, Singhrawan, Barakata, Ansarnagar, Karaidpur,
lDrainage and rlooding  Barsot, Gungri and Kunhara khurd are facing drainage problems.

Land acquisition   47.09 ha of productive agricultural land needs to be acquired of the 60.70 ha
required for the project.
Loss of Residential !   0.27 ha of residential land, 0.46 ha of commercial land to be acquired.
Commeroial land
10 families having their residences and 13 families who have both

Displaced families    14 families having their residences, 12 families with commercial properties and 13
families who have both residential+commercial properties will be displaced (Non-
Title holders).
MITIGATION MEASURES
Certain impacts have been actually avoided (or minimized) during project preparation. Examples of
total avoidance include avoiding impacting water bodies and cultural assets by realignment or
bypassing. Examples of minimizing impacts include minimizing felling of roadside tree plantation,
minimizing land acquisition and impacts on people and properties. Such minimization has been
possible by earmarking a corridor of impact (Col), and restricting all proposed project activity within
such Col. Table 5 details out the Mitigation Measures that have been propAAosed in Package IVC
of the Project Corridor.
Table 5 - Mitigation Measures Proposed
Issue                                    Mitigation Measures
Removal of road side   Forestry clearance obtained; compensatory afforestation i 2 saplings for each
trees                  tree felled. Additional road plantation will be carried out. A total of 19275 trees will
be planted with a total cost of Rs. 14.45 lacs.

Loss of prcductive top    15 cm of topsoil will be preserved in all areas of cutting, stripping or borrowing.
soil                    The preserved topsoil will be used for redevelopment of borrow Aareas, and any
existing wasteland. It is expected that the redevelopment of borrow areas will be
done at an estimated cost of Rs. 1.68 crores from which a portion will be assigned
preservation of stripped soil.
Forest land acquisition    With clearance from Forest Department, compensatory afforestation will be done
through the Forest Department
Garoage dumping         A wall shall be constructed along the stretch of the road beyond Agra at a cost of
Rs. 50 lacs in the reserved forest where illegal dumping of the city's garbage is
now taking place.
High noise levels       The sensitive receptors of noise like schools and hospitals have been studied in
detail and mitigation plans are prepared for each of the selected sensitive receptor.
The mitigation includes provision of new boundary walls or rising of the boundary
wall to a height of 5 to 5.5 m depending on the location of the receptor. A total of 4
locations with 590 m long walls.
Drainace and water      Roadside drains; Urban drains at 8 locations; higher road level with formation
logging                 about 1 m above the High Flood Level at an additional costs of Rs. 1.5 lacs
Accident prone areas    *              Provision of service roads with streetlights.
*              Provision of signboards and speed breakers.
.              Safety Audit proposed to be carried out by May 2001
Impact on wild life     .              Provision of underpass at locations specified in the EMP
.              Provision for tree plantation along streams and rivers over which
the NH-2 passes within the Gautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary as directed by
the DFO
.              Construction of water harvesting structures/ check dams
*              Construction of water holes within the sanctuarY
.              Structures to prevent unauthorized access to NH-2 within
sanctuary area
.   Additional Rs. 6.7 crores has been assigned for the sanctuary and for the Taj
Trapezium Zone
Impact on community     Relocation of community facilities: 34 hand pumps and wells, 29 shrines. The total
facilities              cost for these is expected to be nearly Rs. 24 lacs.
Loss to private
properties
Impact on vulnerable    All the affected families falling under the vulnerable category including the BPL are
going to be compensated and/or assisted irrespective of their ownership status
groups                  Additional assistance to vulnerable groups will be given.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT MEASURES PROPOSED
A description of the various management measures during the various stages of the project is
provided in the following sections.
Pre-construction Stage
During the pre-construction stage, the management measures required will include, the clearance
of the RoW, transplantation of the candidate trees identified, the measures for protecting/replacing
community resources such as hand pumps and other utilities likely to be impacted. Their
8



enhancement shall also be completed before construction actually starts so that the community
can start using these while the construction activity begins.
Construction Stage
This will be the most crucial and active stage for the Environmental Management FPlan. In addition
to the monitoring of the construction activity Aself to ensure that the environment is not impacted
beyond permissible limits, the enhancement of cultural properties, miigation and enhancement
rTieasLlues for water bodies will go on simultaneously as the construction progresses. The major
measures are:
* Proper siting of labour camps, construction equipment and plants E.g. Hot mix plants 500 m
from settlements.
.  Provision for oil and grease traps and sedimentation basins at areas where pollution from
vehicles is likely. E.g. Near vehicle storage areas
* Traffic safety plan to be implemented by contractor after approval of Engineer
* Contractor to conform to all anti-malarial instructions given to him by the Engineer.
* No bore-well or extraction of groundwater without permission of UP Groundwater Board.
* Construction over and close to non-perennial streams shall be undertaken in the dry season.
* Construction expected to disrupt users and impacting communiy water bodies will be taken
up after serving notice on the local community.
*  Any dust generated will be cleared immediately by manual sweeping and removal of debris, or
mechanically if required.
* The road surfaces shall be hosed or watered using necessary equipment, if reqUired.
Operation Stage
The operation stage will essentially entail monitoring activity along the corridor. The monitoring for
pollutants specified in the Monitoring Plan will serve the two purposes. In addition to checking the
efficacy of the protection/mitigation/enhancement measures implemented, this will help verify or
refute the predictions made as a part of the impact assessment. Thus, it will complete a very
important feedback loop for the NHAI.
The responsibility for implementation and supervision of EMPs are vested with four agencies,
namely Contractors, NHAI, PIU and Engineers. The Contractors herein mean the agency hired for
execution of the construction works for the respective contract packages. NHAI would be the
implementation agency at two levels one at Center referred as NHAI and the other at Package
level named as PIU, in the EMP.
