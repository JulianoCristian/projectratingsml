Envkonerital Managwrart Plan - Pac*age IVA
Grand Tn,n* Road In,amrnent Projet
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The National Highway-2 (NH-2) connecting Delhi with Kolkata is one of the most important high-
density comidors in the country. The existing highway is a two - lane carriageway with traffic
bottlenecks and various highway deficiencies. To cater to the existing high vohlme of traffic, there is
an urgent need for capacity augmentation of this highway.
The Govemment of India (Gol), acting through the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a part
of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MRTH) is improving the Agra - Dhanbad porbon of
the NH-2 with assistance from the World Bank. To facilitate the project preparation, the corridor
stretch has been divided into five packages. Intematonal consultants have been appointed for the
planning and design of each of these five packages, each about 200km lon g. Each contract package
has been further divided into several contract packages.
The 1400km long NH-2 falls in the Upper Gangetc Plain in northem India and traverses through the
states of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. As part of the Delhi-Kolkata segment of the
Golden Quadrilateral, the Delhi-Agra section (210km) at the west end, and Barwa Adda - Kolkata
section (278km) at the east end of the NH-2 have already been 44aned with assistance from the
ADB. For project preparation, the Agra-Barwa Adda secfion was divided inko 16 contract packages.
Eight of the 16 contract packages were selected for Third National Highway Project (TNHP) (Table 1),
depending on the project preparedness, progress on land acquisition and utility relocation. Of the
remaining eight packages, seven are proposed to be taken up under the Grand Trunk Road
Improvement Project (GTRIP). The Allahabad bypass (Contract Package Itt-B) has not been included
as part of TNHP or GTRIP, wilt be taken up subsequently for constuction by NHAI wthh funding from
the WB.

The traffic volumes along the corridor are projected to be 70,693 PCUs by 2015 AD. A divided four-
lane carriageway with overlay (for Varanasi Bypass) and flexible pavement has been proposed. Two
carriageways of 7.25m each have been provided separated with' a 5.Om wide median. A 2.5m wide
shoulder has been provided with at least 1.5m paved. Median has been narrowed down to 1.5m at
bridge approaches to save earthwork costs. The proposed improvements planned as part of the
GTRIP are presented in Table 2.          -

Environmental Management Plan - Package IV A
Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
1.3 MAJOR FINDINGS OF THE EA
1.3.1  AIR
Highest concentrations of SPM, CO and NO, are predicted for the beginning of Package IV A (km
317.000 -319.000). This urbanised stretch on the initial few kilometres of VRM bypass is the only
stretch where CO levels are likely to exceed the 2000 pg/m3 limit for residential area at 25 m on
either side of the corridor. The values for NOx are likely to exceed the limit of 80 pg/M3 in 2025 A.D.,
whereas in 2015 A.D., the values will exceed the limit only within 25 m from centreline. All the other
urban sections but for Chandauli are being bypassed by the project.
1.3.2 WATER: HYDROLOGY AND DRAINAGE
Since the soil type is sandy loam, the natural drainage of the area in general is good. Drainage
structures in the urbanised areas are either non-existent or completely choked. In urbanised areas
the road was observed to be laid at the ground level and at some places it is below the HFL resulting
in overtopping. The problem is acute in the Naubatpur and Saidraja areas due to domestic and
commercial waste water being let out on the corridor. This stretch of the corridor is being bypassed
and hence further degradation is avoided.
The Drainage system between Kaimur Range and flood planes of UP and Bihar faces severe floods.
Such floods have been experienced thrice in last 15 years. Particularly the stretch between river
Karamanasa and river Durgawati gets flooded in every five or six years during monsoons. On the
existing alignment there are 2 two lane bridges Karamanasa at km 47.000 and Durgawati at km
58.000.
The carriageway has been elevated by 1.0m to 1.5m within the urban areas to provide better
drainage. Cross drainage structures have been examined for their hydraulic adequacy and further
improvements or new structures have been proposed in the engineering design to solve the drainage
problems along the alignment.
1.3.3 LAND
The NH-2 in this package traverses over the highly fertile Indo-Gangetic plain. With provision of three
bypasses at Syed Raja, Naubatpur and Dirkhil, the acquisition of land will be a significant issue since
these tracts of productive soil will be put out of use permanently. 32.55ha of productive agricultural
land needs to be acquired for the bypass and 12.97ha of agricultural land to be taken up for widening
along the existing alignment.
Slope stability is a problem at high embankment areas. Soil erosion against side slopes is a local
problem. It has been adequately addressed through good engineering designs.
Borrow areas for the project has been proposed mostly on non-productive lands. Redevelopment of
these areas after the borrowing needs to be adequately addressed in the project.
1.3.4  NOISE
For Package IV A, the highest noise values are predicted around Jagdishsarai and Chandauli (km
31.000 - 33.000) with highest levels around 84.5 dB(A). A raise of nearly 15 dB(A) is predicted for
this package. The other high levels are expected near settlements of Dirkhili (km 62.000 - 63.000),
Karmanasha (km 48.000). The lowest levels are predicted to occur along the VRM-bypass and from
km 49.000 to km. 52.000. In 2025 A.D., it is predicted that the noise levels at many places within 25

Environmental Management Plan - Package IV A
Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
m from the carriageway will be as high as 84 dB (A). Even as far as 500 m from the centerline. the
noise levels will remaih at around 63 dB (A), 8 dB (A) above the daytime levels for residential areas.
1.3.5 FLORA
Land on either side is agricultural or rural/residential. No endangered flora species has been reported
along the highway. There is no reserve forest or protected forest along the project corridor. The
impact of removal of trees however should be a concern. The roadside plantation in the state of Uttar
Pradesh, declared as protected Forests, will need to be cleared for the project. A total of 15200 trees
within the existing RoW need to be felled for the project. This will cause temporary inconvenience to
the rmad users due to loss of shade trees.
1.3.6 FAUNA
Domesticated animals constitute the major proportion of faunal density in the area. No wild life
reserved forest; national park or Recreation Park is under the influence area of the project package
4A. Some water bodies abutting the highway do serve as a temporary/permanent habitat for the
migratory or even resident avifauna.
1.3.7 HUMAN USE VALUES
The dominant land use along the highway is agricultural. The major crops grown are wheat, maize,
rice and pulses. 52.47ha of land needs to be acquired out of which 45.52 ha will be agricultural land.
It is envisaged that the agricultural land along the highway will get converted to industrial/commercial
use to realise the value of the improved connectivity of the area. A total of 7 schools/colleges and 6
office buildings abut the road. The proposed widening and strengthening will affect roadside
amenities and some locations will be more vulnerable than before. Apart from these, 26 wells and 6
hand pumps are getting impacted and some of these have to be relocated. Increased vehicular speed
along the highway will subject the residents of fringe areas of the road to increased risk from
speeding vehicles.
1.3.8 INDUCEDIRIBBON DEVELOPMENT
Varanasi city's present concentration trend is to the north of NH-2. A bypass (VRM bypass) has
recently come up circumventing two more settlements nearby: Ram nagar and Mughal Sarai.
Analysis of development trends along bypasses in other cities along NH-2 indicates that Varanasi will
also register a decadal growth rate of 2.60% to 3.0% in the area between the prior NH-2 and the
bypass within the design period. The VRM junction towards the east end of the bypass has attracted
settlement concentration. All the settlements to the west of the city will be engulfed as a part of the
urban agglomeration. In general all the settlements along the corridor are predicted to experience a
sudden boom in activity and population with the start of operation of the 4/6 lane NH-2.
1.3.9 CULTURAL PROPERTIES
There are no sites designated as 'Protected Monuments' protected by the Archaeological Survey of
India along Package IV A. However, there are 15 small religious structures along the corridor of local
significance. The detailed drawings of the measures suggested and the associated Bills of Quantities
form a part of this EMP.

1.3.10 QUALITY OF LIFE VALUES
The proiect is expected to bring in substantial improvement in connectivity along the corridor. This will
bring an influx of opportunities, ideas, materials, employment and movement. Thus an improvement
in quality of life of the region is predicted. Presently, the traffic conditions are characterised by mixed
traffic with bullock carts and high-speed truck jostling for space on the highway. These combinations
create hazardous conditions for all the road users. With segregation of local and through traffic. by
the provision of service lanes, flyovers, etc. the project will have a beneficial effect on road safety.
However, real safety concerns have been raised with reference to the children using the highway to
get to the numerous schools and other educational institutions that have direct access opening on to
the NH-2.
1.3.11 RESETTLEMENT
A total of 1089 families will be affected of whom 842 will be displaced. The entitlement framework of
the GTRIP provides for distinct entitlements and assistance for each category of the displaced
families/ persons. For details refer the Consolidated RAP Report and the RAP for Package IV A.

1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT MEASURES PROPOSED
A description of the various management measures during the various stages of the project is
provided in the following sections.
1.5.1 PRE-CONSTRUCTION STAGE
During the pre-construction stage, the management measures required will include, the clearance of
the RoW, transplantation of the candidate trees identified, the measures for protecting/replacing
community resources such as hand pumps and other utilities likely to be impacted. Their
enhancement shall also be completed before construction actually starts so that the community can
start using these while the construction activity begins.
1.5.2 CONSTRUCTION STAGE
This will be the most crucial and active stage for the Environmental Management Plan. In addition to
the monitoring of the construction activity itself to ensure that the environment is not impactod beyond
permissible limits, the enhancement of cultural properties, mitigation and enhancement measures for
water bodies will go on simultaneously as the construction progresses. To facilitate implementation qf
the enhancement and mitigation measures suggested, working drawings of the same are provided in
the Appendices.
In addition, the need for a balanced evaluation and planning for risks associated with construction
activities related to roads such as accidental spillages and consequent damage to the surrounding
environment in terms of loss of flora and fauna, agricultural crop or worse fertile land, continues to

grow  in importance. Other possible locations where a risk assessment' will be useful include the
locations of Hot Mix plants (spillage of fuel, bitumen etc) and labour-camp sites.
1.5.3 OPERATION STAGE
The operation stage will essentially entail monitoring activity along the corridor. The monitoring for
pollutants specified in the Monitoring Plan will serve the two purposes. In addition to checking the
efficacy of the protection/mitigation/enhancement measures implemented, this will help verify or
refute the predictions made as a part of the impact assessment2 . Thus, it will complete a very
important feedback loop for the NHAI.
The measures adopted and/or to be adopted during the different stages of the project have been
detailed in Table 3.
The responsibility for implementation and supervision of EMPs are vested with four agencies, namely
Contractors, NHA!, PIU' and Engineers. The Contractcrs herein mean the agency hired for execution
of the construction works for the respective contract packages. NHAI would be the implementation
agency at two levels one at Centre referred as NHAI and the other at Package level named as PIU, in
the EMP. The term engineer refers to the Supervision Consultant.
While risk management here deals exclusively with the physical environment, the Resettlement Action Plan addresses
equally real risks on the socio-economic aspects. Contingency Planning may be adopted to set aside resources for the
events for which there is no way of predicting severity and probability of occurrence with any great degree of
confidence. Normally fixed proportion of the emergency response resource allocation is kept always on stand-by to
counter such a situation.
The inputs from this and other projects of similar nature will help improve the quality of the environmental management
plans in subsequent projects or modify any future activities along this highway too. Risk Management during the
operation phase of the project almost exclusively deals with the accidents of vehicles carrying fuel or other hazardous
materials. At this stage too, a dispassionate weighing up of the severity and probability is a must to ensure that neither
too many nor too few resources such as personnel, vehicles or communication facilities are available to tackle the
situation whenever it arises.

1.6 REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS
The Monitoring and Evaluation of the management measures envisaged are critical activities in
implementation of the Project. Monitoring involves periodic checking to ascertain whether activities are
going according to the plans. It provides the necessary feedback for project management to keep the
program on schedule. The rationale for a reporting system is based on accountabUlyto ensure that the
measures proposed as part of the Environmental Management Plan get implemented in the project.
The reporting system wil operate linearly with the contractor who is at the lowest rung of the
implementetion system reporting to the Supervision Consultant, who in tum shall report to the PIU. All
reporting by the contractor and Supervision Consultant shall be on a quarterly basis. The PIU shall be
responsible for preparing targets for each of the identified EMAP activities. All subsequent reporting by
the contractor shall be monitored as per these targets set by the PIU before the contractors move on to
the site. The reporting by the Contractor will be a monthly report like report of progress on construction
and will form the basis for monitoring by the PIU, either by its own Manager (Environment) or the
Environmental Specialist hired by the Supervision Consultant.

Environmental Management Plan - Package IV A
Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
The NHAI already has certain organizational and institutional capacity to be able to satisfactorily
complete the implementation of the EMAP and RAP. The capacity was mainly created due to the
requirements of implementing the Third National Highway project (TNHP). TNHP precedes the GTRIP,
and the preparation and implementation of the RAP in GTRIP will benefit from that of the TNHP.
The responsibilities of the NGO, the GRC and the District Level Committees is towards the
irmplementation of RAP, However, for addressal of environmental issues the Manager (environment) at
the PIU will interact with the NGO, the GRC and the District Level Committees. For details about the
individual roles and responsibilities, refer to the section 10.2 of the Consolidated Environmental
Assessment prepared for the project.
1.8 TRAINING
The Environmental Unit at the NHAI headquarters and the PlUs, who would be responsible for the
implementation of the. EMP, need to be trained on the effective implementation of the environmental
issues. To ensure the success of the implementation set up proposed, there is a high requirement of
training and skill upgradation.
1.8.1 TRAINING ALREADY PROPOSED UNDER TNHP
As part of the TNHP, a training programme has been worked out incorporates the project needs as well
as the intermediate-term capacity building needs of the NHAI. The programme consists of a number of
training modules specific to target groups. The training would cover the basic principles and postulates
of environmental assessment, mitigation plans and programmes (particularly the World Bank
Operationa! Guidelines and National Policy Perspectives), implementation techniques, monitoring and
management methods and tools.
Looking into the potential requirements of each of the target groups, several training modules had been
suggested as part of the TNHP.
- Module l: Environmental Overview
* Module Il: Environmental Regulations and Acts
* Module Ill: Pollution
* Module IV: Environmental Impact Assessment
* Module V: Environmental management Plan
* Module VI: Highway Projects and Environmental Issues
M Module VIl: Environmental Issues in the Project
Module VIII: The Environmental Management Plan for Highway Projects
* Module IX: Environmentally Sound Construction Management
* Module X: Planning for Environmentally Sustainable Operation of Highways
* Module Xl: Long Term Environmental Issues in Highway Management
1.8.2 ADDITIONAL TRAINING
The training under GTRIP has been devised taking into account the training already imparted under
TNHP and the budgetary allocations. The training is focused on environmental issues related with road
construction and both theoretical and practical aspects are covered. The Table 4 below gives the
breakup of the proposed training under the GTRIP for various target groups:

1.8.3    Logistical Support Required
The various items that need to be procured for the Environmental Unit are listed below:
* The environment cell at the PIU will require a vehicle to inspect works on site.
* Own equipments for pollution monitoring viz. noise meter, hand-held gas sensors, high volume
samplers, water sampling kit etc.
* The environmental cell at each PIU to be connected to the Documentation Unit at CNHAI by NHAI-
wide LAN (WAN).
* Adequate computing facilities to allow the documentation unit to be self-sufficient including the
latest version of GIS software such as ARC Info, Mapinfo and Idrisi etc
* All officials at the CNHAI to be provided their own PC, a common printer and an access to the
Internet. In addition they should have access to one licensed copy of the latest version of the
software useful for environmental wing. These could include Caline (for air pollution modelling
from traffic pollution), Sound 32 (for traffic noise) and a fugacity-based model (for predicting the
behaviour of volatile/hazardous material that might spill on the road).
* A well-stocked library with books and manuals related to environmental impacts of infrastructure in
general and roads in particular, would be an advantage.

1.9.4 NOISE LEVELS MONITORING
The measurements for monitoring noise levels would be carried out at all designated locations in
accordance to the Ambient Noise Standards formulated by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in
1989 (refer Table 7). Sound pressure levels would be monitored on twenty-four hour basis. Noise
should be recorded at a 'A" weighted frequency using a " slow time response mode" of the measuring
instrument. The location, duration and the noise pollution parameters to be monitored and the
responsible institutional arrangements are detailed in the Environmental Monitoring Plan (Table 8).

1.11 BILL OF QUANTITIES
1.11.1 SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENT SITES
The specific enhancement sites selected from the field survey have been treated with a view to retain
their unique character while allowing the road-user to identify the continuum along the Grand Trunk
Road. The enhancements have been based on certain common elements, which have been used
throughout all the packages of the GTRIP. Based on the treatment envisaged, Eills of Quantities of
various items have been prepared for each site. The Table 9 summarizes the various quantities for
package IV A and can be used in conjunction with the dravwngs for construction on site.

1.11.2 TYPICAL ENHANCEMENT ELEMENTS
The typical mitigation/enhancement designs were prepared using information collected during the field
visit with a view to allow the local communities and the road-users to enjoy the benefit of a better
corridor of movement while ensuring their safety. An additional aim was to try and mitigate the potential
negative impacts of the development of a wider, high-speed corridor on the host communities. All the
designs created are attached with each Environmental Management Plan. Each corridor uses only a
portion of all the designs created. The environmental management plan has referred to the particular
drawing to be used for each package for environmental mitigation/enhancement. Other details of
locations are available in the relevant appendices. The Table 10 below gives the quantities for the
typical designs:

above ground level) to be cut, shall be approved by the Engineer-in-Charge and then marked at site.
Felling trees shall include taking out roots up to 60 cm below ground level or 30 cm below formation
level or 15 cm below sub-grade level, whichever is lower. All excavations below general ground level
arising out of the removal of trees, stumps etc. shall be filled with suitable material in 20 cm layers and
compacted thoroughly so that the surface at these points conform to the surrounding area. The trunks
and branches of trees shall be cleared of limbs and tops and cut into suitable pieces as directed by the
Engineer-in-Charge.
Stacking and Disposal: Wood, branches, twigs of trees and other useful material shall be the property
of the Government. The serviceable materials shall be stacked in the manner as directed by the
Engineer-in-Charge up to a lead of 50 m. All unserviceable material, which in the opinion of Engineer-
in-Charge cannot be used or auctioned shall be removed from the area and disposed off as per the
directions of the Engineer-in-Charge. Care shall be taken to see that unsuitable waste materials are
disposed off in such a manner that there is no likelihood of these getting mixed up with the materials
meant for construction.

wood prescrva'ive allowing at least 150mm above ground level.
Tying
Each tree should be firmly secured to the stake so as to prevent excessive movement. Abrasion must
be avoided by using a buffer, rubber or Hessian, between the tree and stake. The tree should be
secured at a point just below its lowest branch, and also just above ground level; normally two ties
should be used for tree. These should be adjusted or replaced to allow for growth.
Watering
The Landscape Contractor should allow for the adequate watering in of all newly planted trees and
shrubs immediately after planting and he shall during the following growing season, keep the plant
material well watered.
Fertilising
Fertilising shall be carried out by application in rotation of the following fertilisers, every 15 days from
the beginning of the monsoon till the end of winter:
* 1. Sludge or organic well-rotted dry farm yard manure: 0.05 cum or tussle.
* 2. Urea 25gm.
* 3. Ammonium sulphate 25gm.
* 4. Potassium sulphate 25gm.
All shrubs, which are supplied pot grown, shall be well soaked prior to planting.
Watering in and subsequent frequent watering of summer planted container- grown plants is essential.
Shrub Planting In Planter Beds
All areas to be planted with shrubs shall be excavated, trenched to a depth of 750mm, refilling the
excavated earth after breaking clods and mixing with sludge in ratio 8:1 (8 parts of stacked volume of
earth after reduction by 20%: 1 part of stacked volume of sludge after reduction by 8%.)
Tall shrubs may need staking, which shall be provided if approved by the Contracting consulting
engineer, depending upon the conditions of individual plant specimen.

For planting shrubs and ground cover shrubs in planters, good earth shall be mixed with sludge in the
proportion as above and filled in planters.
Positions of planters shall be planted should be marked out in accordance with the architectural Drg.
When shrubs are set out, precautions should be taken to prevent roots drying. Planting holes 40cmdia.
And 40cm deep should be excavated for longer shrubs. Polythene and other non-perishable containers
should be removed and any badly damaged roots carefully pruned. The shrubs should then be set in
holes so that the soil level, after settlement, will be original soil mark on the stem of the shrub. The
holes should be back filled to half of its depth and firmed by treading. The remainder of the soil can
then be returned and again firmed by treading.
Grassing
Preparation
During period prior to planting, the ground shall be maintained free from weeds. Grading and
preparation of the area shall be completed at least three weeks prior to the actual sowing. Regular
watering shall be continued until sowing by dividing the area into portions of approximately 5m squares
by constructing small bunds to retain water. These 'bunds' shall be levelled just prior to sowing of grass
plants; it shall be ensured that the soil has completely settled.
Soil
The soil itself shall be ensured to the satisfaction of Landscape Architect to be a good fibrous loam, rich
in humus.
Sowing the grass roots
Grass roots (cynodon dectylon or a local genus approved by the Landscape Architect) shall be
obtained from a grass patch, seen and approved before hand.
The grass roots stock received at site shall be manually cleared of all weeds and water sprayed over
the same after keeping the stock in place protected from sun and dry winds.
Grass stock received at site may be stored for a maximum of three days. In case grassing for some
areas is scheduled for a later date fresh stock of grass roots shall be ordered and obtained.
Execution
Small roots shall be dibbled about 5cms apart into the prepared grounds. Grass will only be accepted
as reaching practical completion when germnination has proved satisfactory and all weeds have been
removed.
Maintenance
As soon as the grass is approximately a 3cm high it shall be rolled with a light wooden roller - in fine,
dry weather - and when it has grown to 5 to 8cms, above to ground weeds must be removed and
regular cutting with the scythe and rolling must be begun. A top-dressing of an ounce of guano to the
square yard or well decomposed well broken sludge manure shall be applied when the grass is
sufficiently secure in the ground to bear the mowing machine, the blades must be raised an inch above
the normal level for the first two or three cuttings. That is to say, the grass should be cut so that it is
from 4 to 5cms in length, instead of the 3cm necessary for mature grass.
In the absence of rain, in the monsoon, the lawn shall be watered every ten days heavily, soaking the
soil through to a depth of at least 20cms.
Damage failure or dying back of grass due to neglect of watering especially for seeding out of normal
season shall be the responsibility of the contractor. Any shrinkage below the specified levels during the
contract or defect liability period shall be rectified at the contractor's expense. The Contractor is to
exercise care in the use of rotary cultivator and mowing machines to reduce to a minimum the hazards
of flying stones and brickbats. All rotary mowing machines are to be fitted with safety guards.
71



Environmental Management Plan - Package IV A

Rolling
A light roller shall be used periodically, taking care that the area is not too wet and sodden.
Edgin,g
These shall be kept neat and must be cut regularly with the edging shears.
Fertilisinq
The area shall be fed once in a month with liquid manure prepared by dissolving 45gms of ammonium
sulphate in 5 litres of water.
Watering
Water shall be applied at least once in three days during dry weather. Watering whenever done should
be thorough and should wet the soil at least up to a depth of 20cms.
Weeding
Prior to regular mowing the contractor shall carefully remove rank and unsightly weeds.
Maintenance
Cultivating
The Landscape Contractor shall maintain all planted areas within Landscape contract boundaries for
one year until the area is handed over in whole or in phases. Maintenance shall include replacement of
dead plants, watering, weeding, cultivating, control of insects, fungus and other diseases.by means of
spraying with an approved insecticide or fungicide, pruning, and other horticulture operations necessary
for proper growth of the plants and for keeping the landscape sub-contract area neat in appearance.
Pruning and Repairs
Upon completion of planting work of the landscape sub-contract all trees should be pruned and all
injuries repaired where necessary. The amount of pruning shall be limited to the necessary to remove
dead or injured twigs and branches and to compensate for the loss of roots and the result of the
transplanting operations. Pruning shall be done in such a manner as not to change the natural habit or
special shape of trees.
Tree Guards
Where the tree guards are necessary, care should be taken to ensure that they do not impede natural
movement or restrict growth. Two types of tree guards are proposed on the Grand Trunk Road, circular
iron tree guards and barbed wire fencing, the specifications for which one given below:
Circular Iron Tree Guard with Bars.
The tree guard shall be 50 cm. in diameter.
The tree guards shall be formed of (i) 3 Nos. 25x25x3mm angle iron verticals 2.00m long excluding
splayed outward at lower end up to an extent of 10 cms. (ii) 3 Nos. 25x25mm MS flat,rings fixed as per
design (iii) 15 Nos. 1.55 metres long 6mm dia bars. Each ring shall be in two parts in the ratio of 1:2
and their ends shall be turned in radially for a length of 4 cm at which they are bolted together with
8mm dia and 30mm long MS bolts and nuts.
The vertical angle irons shall be welded to rings along the circumference with electric plant 15 Nos.
bars shall be welded to rings at equal spacing along the circumference of ring. The lower end of the
angle iron verticals shall be splayed outwards up to an extent of 10cm. The lower end of the flat of
lower ring shall be at a height of 45cm. and upper end of the flat of top ring shall be at the height of 2.00
metres. The middle ring shall be in the centre of top and lower ring. The bars shall be welded to rings
as shown in the drawing. The entire tree guard shall be given two coats of paint of approved brand and
of required shade over a priming coat of ready mixed primer of approved brand. The design 6f the tree
guard shall be as shown in the drawing.

Nursery Stack
Planting should be carried out as soon as possible after reaching the site. Where planting must be a
necessitv and/or be delayed, care should be taken to protect the plants from pilfering or damage from
people animals. Plants with bare-roots should be heeled- in as soon as received or otherwise protected
from drying out, and others set closely together and protected from the wind. If planting is to be delayed
for more than a week, packaged plants should be unpacked, the bundles opened up and each group of
plants heeled in separately and clearly labelled. If for any reason the surface of the roots becomes dry
the roots should be thoroughly soaked before planting.

Appendix 1   Methodology and Techniques for Tree transplantation
BACKGROUND
"Transplanting consists in lifting plants bodily from their positions, removing them from more desirable
or agreeable places & replanting them in new & better soil."
Season for planting & transplanting shrubs or Trees
The best season for planting or transplanting shrubs & trees vanes in different parts of our country.
Hot weather is generally avoided, as the risk of plants no! establishing is great.
In places where rainfall is moderate, the beginning of rainy season is the best suited time for
transplanting.
Plants which are natives of cold countries & which grow vigorously in the cold season such as Rose, do
better when planted out during close of Rainy season.
In severely cold places like in northem parts of India, the operations are best carried on during the end
of the dormant season about the end of February.
All Robust plants may be planted or transplanted during any part of the year, with proper attention
being given to several details of the operations.
THE TRANSPLANTING SUCCESS
Transplanting involves to some extent at least a disturbance of plant's root system. There is a
loosening of its attachment to the soil & progressive activities are arrested for the time being. Thus
transplanting is a raiiier violent operation, considering the standpoint of the plant. And is required to he
done with great care to be successful. Care is therefore to be taken that the plants recover from the set-
beck as rapidly as possible. Certain conditions are necessary for rapid recovery of plants to active
growth. Some of these are dependent upon the nature & structure of the plants themselves & some on
the prevailing weather & climatic conditions.
Soft-wooded plants transplant better than hardwood plants.
Plants in dormant state transplant better than those in active growth.
Young plants established sooner than old ones. (Refer article Transplanting Shocks: Large tree vs.
Small Trees)
All plants transplant better with a mass of original soil intact around its roots, which should be disturbed
as little as possible.
As the roots, till they establish themselves in fresh soil, will be unfit to absorb the full supply of moisture
needed by the plant, exhalation from the leaves & shoots of the plant is to be kept as low as
possible.
Cool & cloudy weather are chosen for transplanting operations.
Evening are better suited than moming or aftemoon, as plant refresh themselves during the cool hours
of the night.
To overcome the dangers of transplanting the soil is well prepared & kept moist, not allowing it to run
dry: part of the top of the plant is removed usually to minimise loss of water by transpiration.
Some time shade is provided till the plants are established.
Overhead watering by means of spray during the hot hours or occasionally when the leaves wilt,
refreshes the plant to a great extent.
I ~a i'ta



Environmental Management Plan - Package IV A
Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
The stems & branches of transplanted trees are wrapped with straw which is kept moist by spraying
water on it to remove loss of the water by the plant as much as possible.
If the soil is bad below, it is replaced with a mixture of three parts of manure, two parts of black fertile
earth or Loam, and one part of sand for better growth of trees.
If the soil is fairly good, only manure is mixed with it, in case soil is heavy sand and manure is added to
it.
Transplanting of fully-grown trees can only be successfully done with the help of machinery, such as
the tree lifter, and hence it is rarely attempted in private gardens.
Success rate of trees having truck diameter less than 1' would be 90% Success rate of trees having
trunk diameter above 1' to 2' would be 60% Success rate of trees above 2' trunk diameter can only
guaranteed for specific species, in specific transplanting season provided that the surrounding
conditions like soil & weather of the relocated tree are also taken into consideration.
Transporting or shifting of trees on trailer away from the existing location reduces the chances of
success as the trees take more time to set in new conditions, transport may damage root system &
trees are required to be cut down in size to make shifting possible through the road.
A tree regains its original shape with in 4 to 10 years depending on the trunk diameter. Thumb rule is 6"
tree regains it original shape in 6 x 12 months.
Maintenance or Watering of trees is done till one or two monsoons -We advice maintenance till the 1st
monsoon after transplanting in area where monsoon is good or moderate.
METHODOLOGY
Transplanting of young trees and shrubs is done in the following manner:
The plants have to be lifted with as many roots as possible and replaced in fresh soil with the least
possible delay.
For this purpose a trench 45 to 60 cms in width which is wide enough for working conveniently is
opened out in a circle at a suitable distance away from stem, This operation is generally called as
"Side trenching", which may vary from 4' to 10 according to the size of the tree or shrub, the soil is
gradually removed in the trench approaching the centre of the circle as it descends, thus securing
the ball of earth in the shape of an inverted cone. Care is taken not to injure the roots that cross the
trench; these are clean sawed or cut with secateaurs, if small enough at the outer edge of the
trench,
The tap root is also severed. With long crowbars the ball of earth holding the roots is gently lifted and
loosened from its attachment with the rest of the soil.
When the trench is sufficiently deep, the diameter of the ball of earth may be reduced to a convenient
size with a fork, leaving the protruding roots uninjured.
The rootball are continuously kept moist to keep tree active in new root growth & sprouting.
If one is definite of success, the transplanting may be made safer thus: The ball of earth may be got
ready in two stages, The roots may be severed on one-half of the circle in the trench & this portion
is close down with light soil is known as 'root treatment". After another week or fortnight, the roots
sufficiently recovered from the shock of cuts & can be safely lifted & transplanted.
All the roots with jagged cuts or bruises on them are clean cut back to healthy parts as bruises and bad
cuts may bring on decay, which may spread to the plant, killing it.
While it is well known that roots supply all of a plant's water it is less well known that 95 - 99% of a
plant's water is rapidly lost as evaporation from the leaves. Therefore leaf surface of the Tree is
Z70



Environmental Management Plan - Package IV A
Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project
reduced to limit transpiration, it is called "defoliage of tree"; the tree is cut back, if necessary, to
concentrate the sap at the roots for formation of new roots to establish the tree.
"Heading in" or cutting the top is most desirable in many species. If the tree has several strong
branches starting from this leader, each -a smaller branches,.maY be cut back to half a dozen or
more buds, -according to the tree; if there are only few branches, they may be reduced by one-
thirds of their length maintaining its natural shape. The heading in done because first to keep
balance between root system & the canopy (System underground & above ground should be same
to reduce stress on either of it.)
The cut surfaces are all covered with a paste "Waxing" mixture of water soaking & insecticide liquid to
prevent evaporation & to prevent fungus & insect attacks.
The tree is then bodily lifted taking care not to break the ball of and not to bruise the bark of the stem in
the operation. This is called "Transplanting of Trees"
If the ball of earth may happen to be too large to prevent the earth from slipping away, it is tied with
sacking or straw.
Replanting is done to the same original depth if not 3 to 5 cms deeper. It is not safe to place any fresh
manure in contact with the roots.
If by chance the earth breaks away from the roots, these are immediately smeared well with a thin
paste of 2/3 clay and 1/3 fresh cow dung and water and soaking spray of a fungicide is desirable.
The entire plant is then lowered into the hole prepared for it, which is wide enough to take in all roots
when spread out.
Sand or fine soil is worked in between the roots and the hole filled with good soil, which is pressed
down layer by layer.
After the tree is planted, if necessary, it is to be suppofted by being tied to a stout long stake, firmly
fixed to the ground close to the trunk & protected from cattle by a tree guard.
The stem may be advantageously wrapped round with moist straw to limit loss of moisture from the
tree,
The tree is then copiously watered soon after planting, so that the entire ball of earth & the new soil
under it, are well moistened.
After such liberal watering, ii may not be necessary to water again for another three days or so. But the
tree may be refreshed by spraying on it clear water. It might be provided with shade if the sun is
severe.
The ground around the stem is watered freely every week or so, in the absence of rain. Too much
water is not however to be applied, forming puddles at the bottom of hole in which the tree is
planted.
Throughout summer, the transplanted tree should get its regular water supply, the soil being soaked
through at each watering & not merely sprinkled on the surface.
As the surface layer of earth is drying up each time after watering, it may be stirred to depth of 2 to 10
cms, forming mulch. This retards loss of moisture from the soil by evaporation & the tree is enabled
to get the full benefit of the water supplied.
It is advisable to carry out all above operations in consultation with & under supervision of experienced
horticulturists as soil strata, weather conditions, the plant characteristic & root systems may differ from
place to place, Thus requiring modification in the transplanting operations.
