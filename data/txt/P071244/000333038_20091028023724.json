outcome\n            was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: National\n            Highways Authority of India (NHAI) must have at least 50\n            percent of the land acquired and encumbrance free prior to\n            contract award. It should also consider entering into long\n            term arrangements with state governments at program rather\n            than project. Creation of a strong design review capability\n            within NHAI is critical to stalling the multiple delays\n            which are locked in early on as a result of flawed detailed\n            project reports (DPRs). This in-house capability would allow\n            for DPR proof checks, ensure quality designs from\n            consultants as also concessionaires. It could also help\n            develop design standards for national highways and ensure\n            that the national highways exhibit consistency of design.\n            Guidelines for DPRs specifying minimum time for preparation\n            and use of latest technologies in preparation should be\n            issued. Finally, there is a strong need for NHAI to align\n            its staffing requirements (strength and profile) with the\n            increase in the size of its work program and the shift to\n            public-private partnership (PPP) modality. Understaffing at\n            project implementation units (PIUs), Finance, environmental\n            and social development unit (ESDU) is affecting performance.\n            Second, it should focus on developing a cadre of permanent\n            staff, targeting at least 50 percent of staff strength."}, "docdt": "2009-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
