"The World Bank has adopted a\n            programmatic approach to support the Government of\n            India'a National Highway Development Program (NHDP)\n            through a series of loans. The Grand Trunk Road Improvment\n            Project (GTRIP) is the second project in the series,\n            following the Third National Highway Project (TNHP), which\n            was approved and is under implementation. The development\n            objectives of GTRIP are consistent with those of the TNHP:\n            1) to reduce transport constraints on national economic\n            activity; and 2) to improve institutional capabilities to\n            manage road programs, assets, and services on a more\n            commercial basis. There are three project components. The\n            first finances highway upgrading, including civil works for\n            widening and strengthening highway lanes, supervision\n            consultant services, as well as funding land acquisition,\n            utility relocation, resettlement and rehabilitation,and\n            environmental mitigation/management. The second component\n            finances road safety and corridor management works,\n            including consultant services for a safety audit, a program\n            of road improvements specifically targeted at supporting\n            improved methods for reducing accidents and improving safety\n            on the national highway network, and a program of\n            maintenance works to introduce alternative contracting\n            methods and to strengthen maintenance management practices.\n            The third component establishes a public-private partnership\n            in road concession, and the fourth component supports social\n            and environmental as well as road capacity building."}, "docdt": "2001-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
