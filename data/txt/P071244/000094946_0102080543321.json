However,\n            project implementation will adversely impact the\n            environment, causing air pollution (particularly endangering\n            cultural heritage sites, i.e., the Taj Mahal), water\n            pollution, and major crop losses. During the\n            pre-construction and construction stages, measures to\n            minimize adversity shall include clearance of the\n            right-of-way, transplanting pre-identified trees, and\n            replacing/relocating utilities likely to impact the\n            livelihoods of the neighboring population.

To prevent\n            soil erosion, sedimentation, and water pollution, the use of\n            dikes, sediment basins, and slope drains shall be used in\n            accordance with engineering designs. Lubricants and oil\n            spills shall be contained through oil interceptors for\n            refueling cases with fuel storage at appropriate sites, and\n            disposal of petroleum products in accordance with\n            environmental guidelines. Spoils, and solid wastes shall be\n            treated, and disposed of at selected disposal sites.
