About 1500 km of these roads have\n            already been selected and their location fixed. The\n            remaining 300 km will be selected during the next year so as\n            to provide missing links needed to balance the networks in\n            these areas. The project includes some 300 km of roads,\n            contracts for which have already been let on the basis of\n            local bidding only. These roads would not be financed from\n            the proceeds of the bank loan."}, "docdt": "1965-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
