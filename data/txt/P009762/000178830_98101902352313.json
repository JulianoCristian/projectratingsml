Project seeks to achieve early and sustained increases in\n            agricultural production throughout Kerala's eleven\n            districts through the reorganization and strengthening of\n            the extension service of DOA. The project will support this\n            reorganization over a five-year period by: (a) establishing\n            a single line of command between full-time village extension\n            workers (VEW) and extension headquarters; (b) consolidating\n            staff from the special crop schemes into a single unified\n            service; (c) incorporating regular in-service training as an\n            integral part of extension activities; (d) introducing a\n            systematic fixed schedule for regular and frequent visits by\n            VEW to farmer's fields; (e) improving the working\n            linkages between extension operations and agricultural\n            research activities; (f) developing regular monitoring and\n            evaluation procedures; and (g) providing additional staff,\n            operating expenses, equipment, vehicles, training, and rural\n            housing required to implement these reforms."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
