      districts through the reorganization and strengthening of\n            the extension service of DOA. The project will support this\n            reorganization over a five-year period by: (a) establishing\n            a single line of command between full-time village extension\n            workers (VEW) and extension headquarters; (b) consolidating\n            staff from the special crop schemes into a single unified\n            service; (c) incorporating regular in-service training as an\n            integral part of extension activities; (d) introducing a\n            systematic fixed schedule for regular and frequent visits by\n            VEW to farmer's fields; (e) improving the working\n            linkages between extension operations and agricultural\n            research activities; (f) developing regular monitoring and\n            evaluation procedures; and (g) providing additional staff,\n            operating expenses, equipment, vehicles, training, and rural\n            housing required to implement these reforms."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
