There are\n            four components: (1) Institutional strengthening of the\n            environment information system, including support for\n            training and operations, to enable MOREA to carry out its\n            policy, monitoring, and control functions; and training of\n            line departments, regional and district administrations, and\n            nongovernmental organizations; (2) Environmental education\n            to: (a) increase public awareness and participation; (b)\n            integrate environmental education into the educational\n            system; (c) improve the quality of environmental information\n            and access; and (d) identify formal and non-formal systems\n            for information dissemination; (3) Developing the capability\n            of communities to manage natural resources through: (a)\n            NGO-managed activities, including mobilizing communities and\n            running micro-projects to finance small-scale activities;\n            and (b) Department managed activities, including entering\n            into agreements to co-manage publicly-managed resources with\n            communities;  and (4) Environmental actions and studies on\n            climate change and long lead forecasting, water hyacinth\n            control, bilharzia control, national park management; and\n            policy planning support."}, "docdt": "1997-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
