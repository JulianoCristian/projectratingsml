Investment and Sustained\n            Development Promotion Credit aims to achieve an average\n            growth rate of about 5 percent a year, raise investment to\n            18 percent of GDP by 1992, and raise national savings to 12\n            percent of GDP.  To achieve these targets, the program hopes\n            to create an enabling environment for private investment by:\n            (a) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (b) undertaking tax\n            reform so as to improve the incentives for private\n            investment and savings; (c) taking steps to make the\n            regulatory framework in Ghana more consistent with the\n            liberalized economy; and (d) making further progress on\n            state enterprise reforms.  The Government also will maintain\n            the momentum of reforms designed to increase the efficiency\n            with which public resources are used and, thereby, enhance\n            their support of private sector development.  Measures to\n            alleviate poverty are also incorporated into the program."}, "docdt": "1991-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
