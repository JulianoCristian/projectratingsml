the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that Oblast and\n            municipal (local) authorities were left with post-1991\n            responsibilities for social infrastructure, often with\n            limited or nonexistent resources for its maintenance and\n            development. The number of sectors included in the Russian\n            Federation Community Social Infrastructure Project (CSIP)\n            made it more difficult to supervise, problematical in terms\n            of support both by the Bank (involved in several sectors,\n            but owned by none) and the Federal government, and less\n            reliable as a vehicle to effect policy change. The improved\n            levels of architecture, design, and materials brought by the\n            project yielded benefits in terms of lower maintenance\n            costs, better functionality, and a demonstration effect in\n            terms of non-Bank financed work funded by the oblasts. The\n            CSIP achieved significant benefits in the pilot regions, and\n            made substantial efforts to disseminate the lessons from\n            these efforts, but achieved little-except in neighboring\n            oblasts. Initial design of the project institutional reform\n            agenda has to be more detailed in assessing the current\n            framework and be realistic in forecasting the direction of\n            expected changes, taking into account also political economy\n            considerations. CSIP went through several reorganizations of\n            the federal implementing agency (Ministry of Nationalities)\n            and two changes of administrations in Novosibirsk oblast.\n            Luckily, stability of executing agencies (Central and\n            regional Central Project Implementation Units) ensured\n            continuity and eventual satisfactory implementation of the\n            project. CSIP was one of the earlier projects the Russian\n            portfolio and implementation difficulties were\n            underestimated in the project design. This aspect of project\n            implementation in Russia is much better understood now both\n            by the Bank and by the Government counterparts and\n            appropriate actions have been agreed through CPPR process,\n            guidelines for project preparation, and regular practice of\n            project preparation review."}, "docdt": "2004-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
