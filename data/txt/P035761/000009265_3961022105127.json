health care, education, water\n            supply and sanitation; 2) improve the efficiency of managing\n            public resources; 3) promote private sector development; 4)\n            contribute to the government's policy of\n            decentralization by promoting broad participation in project\n            decision-making; and 5) monitor the effectiveness of new\n            practices, and disseminate the results, to promote their use\n            in similar activities elsewhere in the Russian Federation.\n            The project consists of: 1) an education component which\n            includes school rehabilitations, school extensions,\n            construction of new schools, computers, laboratory\n            equipment, furniture and a management information system\n            program; 2) a health component consisting of the\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of selected city and raion\n            hospitals; 3) a water supply and sanitation component\n            including the rehabilitation, refurbishment and renewal of\n            the existing infrastructure in order to improve drinking\n            water disinfection, water distribution, wastewater\n            treatment, and sewerage; 4) a budget and expenditure\n            management component which will consist of consulting\n            services in local revenues, budget formulation, expenditure\n
