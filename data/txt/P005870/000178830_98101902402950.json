This will permit economic development to\n            continue in these Governorates as well as in the regions\n            behind. The project will also help strengthen road\n            maintenance and construction capabilities and help identify\n            a sound long-term economic development strategy for the\n            transport sector. The project will consist of: i) the\n            strengthening of management, installations and equipment of\n            the existing (Abyan) Road Reconstruction and Maintenance\n            Unit; ii) reconstruction of: (a) numerous damaged road\n            sections totalling about 40 km and damaged culverts and\n            irish crossings in Abyan Governorate; and (b) a damaged\n            section (about 1300m) on the Aden-Little Aden road and a\n            damaged section (about 1000m) and flood protection works\n            near the Aden international airport in the Aden Governorate;\n            iii) technical assistance to strengthen the Ministry of\n            Construction's project supervision and monitoring\n            capabilities; and iv) a transport sector study.
