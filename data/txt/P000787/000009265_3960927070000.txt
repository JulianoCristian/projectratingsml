MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$30.0 MILLION
TO THE GABONESE REPUBLIC
FOR A ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.        The foilowing memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Gabonese Republic  for US$30 million  is submitted for approval.   The
proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms vith 15 years' maturity, includ-
ing 5 years of grace and vould assist in financing a Road Maintenance Project.
2.        Background.  Gabon, a country of about one million people and a per
capita GNP of about US$2,750 in 1987, is undertaking a major structural
program. This follows a period of prosperity reflecting the country's favor-
able resource position and increasing public spending, which was interrupted
by the precipitous fall lu Goverument oil revenues from about CFAF 400 billion
in 1985 to about CFAF 70 billion in 1987 as a result of declining oil prîtes.
The stabilization and adjustment program is assisted by a stand-by arrangetuent
with the IMF and a Bank SAL (Loan No. 29330-GAB). While sharply reducing
public expenditures overall, the Government i anxious to safeguard a minimum
level of road maintenance to avoid deteriorating road conditions becoming an
obstacle to essential economic activity and renewed growth.
3.        Because of the size of the country and the large volumes of trans-
port it generates (particularly tlmber, manganese and oil), the transport
system in Gabon is a key sector.  The system comprises about 7,700 km of
roads, 700 km of which are paved, serving some 30,000 vehicles, a new 649 km
railway between Libreville and Franceville, a vell developed domestic aviation
system, two seaports, an inland vaterways system and coastal shipping. While
road transport is private, all other modes are dominated by parastatals, all
of vhich require Government subsidies. Over the last decade, the Goverument
'aas made large investments in transport infrastructure, particularly for the
construction of the Transgabonese railways.  As a result of the country's
difficult economic and financial situation since 1985, vith the exception of
expenditures to oomplete the railway, investments and even expenditures for
maintenance of transport infrastructure have been substantially reduced.  The
condition of the road network is deteriorating rapidly and could becoue a
major bottleneck to the maintenance and expansion of agriculture and forestry
production for the domestic and foreign markets.  Additionally, the continuing
financial losses of transport parastatals constitute a serious drain on the
Government's resources. Progress in resolving both these problems is essen-
tial to the Government's adjustment program.
4.        Sector  Strategy.   The Government's  sector strategy  foeuses on:
(a) ensuring adequate maintenance of the road netwvork during the economic
adjustment period; (b) reducing the financial drain on Governument resources by
the parapublic enterprises by lmplementing cost reducing reform programs; and
(c) restoring a balanced investment program in the transport sector in line
with a coordinated development of all modes through the implementation of a
balanced three-year rolling investment and expenditure program for the sector.
Items (b) and (c) are being addressed under the ongoing SAL, while item (a),
included as a Government commitment under SAL, would be addressed through the
proposed project ihich would also inelude technical assistance for the annual
preparation of %.).



- 2 -
5.        Objectives.  The main objectives of the road maintenance project,
which contains the priority items of the Government's 1989-92 roads program,
are to help Gabon: (a) preserve past investments în the road network; (b) op-
timize the use of the limited resources available for road maintenance;
(c) maintain vehicle operating costs at a reasonable level; (d) assure and
improve access to productive agricultural and forestry areas; and (e) initiate
changes in policies regarding the management (including Gabonization of road
maintenance), organization and methods of execution of road maintenance in
preparation of an increased level of maintenance and rehabilitation vorks
folloving the project period. The combined effect of SAL and the road mainte-
nance project would promote more efficient use of resources in the transport
sector.
6.        Description.   The proposed  three-year  project  includes:   (a) an
urgent program of road maintenance by contract for the most important sections
of the road network, including some 460 km of paved roads, some 1,300 km of
gravel roads, and about 29 bridges; (b) a program of routine and a limited
amount of periodic road maintenance by force account for gravel and earth
roads, including rehabilitation of existing maintenance equipment and purchase
of complementary equipment and spare parts; (c) training program aimed at
Gabonization of maintenance, planning and management; (d) institutional
strengthening in the road sub-sector; and (e) preparatory and follow-up
studies.   The project vill be revieved and revised annually in light of
available funding and an assessment of needs and priorities. The Government's
three-year road program also includes the rehabilitation of three heavily
degraded earth roads; the construction of three regional workshops and certain
other periodic maintenance vorks. These vorks have not been included in the
project but vould be carried out if additional funding becomes available on
acceptable terms.
7.        Rationale for IBRD Involvement.  The proposed project would complete
actions in the road sector undertaken under the structural adjustment program
agreed betveen the Government and the Bank. It vould provide the means for
Government to maintain a priority road network while simultaneously addressing
a number of policy changes and implementing reform programs in the transport
sector. The Bank's association vith the road maintenance project under this
approach would ensure that a balanced investments program across the sector
vould be implemented during the structural adjustment period. It would also
ensure that adequate resources are made available for road maintenance essen-
tial for the agriculture and forestry development objectives the Goverrment
and the Bank have agreed are critical for economic recovery.
8.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations agreements vere reached that
the Government vill:  (a) agree vith the Bank on annual road maintenance
programs, by the 30th of November of each year, including the actions needed
for its implementation; (b) consult vith the Bank, by the 30th of November of
each year, on the annual transport sector expenditure program; and (c) com-
plete a study by January 1, 1990 and thereafter implement, in accordance vith
an agreed program, an appropriate level of road user taxes for heavy vehicles.
9.        Status of Project Preparation and Co-financing.   Draft terms of
reference for project preparation vere prepared during the October 1987 SAL
appraisal mission, and the resulting preparatory studies vere reviewed in
April 1988.  The project vas appraised in July 1988 and reduced in scope



during the October 1988 expenditure review mission. AfDB has confirmed its
readiness to participate in the project. FAC vill also provide part of the
technical assistance needed for the road maintenance program through reassign-
ment of staff already in place.
10.       Justification and Risks.  Lack of regularly maintained roads vould
increasingly become a deterrent to economic activity and vould threaten the
prospects for agricultural development which is essential for recovery and
growth. Road rehabilitation and maintenance traditionally have high economic
returns leading to substantial savings of foreign exchange which have been
confirmed by the preparatory studies. The main project riske are managerial
and fînancial. To deal vith the managerial risk, adequate technical assis-
tance has been provided through reassignment of technical assistance already
in place complemented by qualified consultants financed under the project, as
vell as some modifications to the organizational set-up to manage road mainte-
nance. The financial risk of lack of timely and sufficient contribution by
the Govern'ment to the project would be reduced through annual reviews wvth the
Bank of expenditure programs for road maintenance and for the road sector
under the proposed project and for the entire public sector under the struc-
tural adjustment program.
il.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
vith the Articles of Agreement of the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
