The\n            main objectives of the project were to: (a) preserve the\n            Government's investment in the road network and extend\n            its useful life; (b) optimize the Government's limited\n            resources available for road maintenance; (c) maintain\n            vehicle operating costs at a reasonable and stable level;\n            (d) improve access to productive agricultural and forestry\n            areas; (e) develop a national capacity to plan, manage and\n            supervise road maintenance and rehabilitation, gradually\n            taking over in-line positions held by foreign experts; and\n            (f) initiate changes in policies regarding road maintenance\n            ganization and methods of execution. The Bank's\n            performance was not satisfactory. The main lesson learnt is\n            that a force account has proved to be an ineffective and\n            inappropriate method of road maintenance, as has already\n            been demonstrated in similar countries. For future\n            operations, all mechanized works should be executed by\n            private contractors, and the existing fleet of public works\n            equipment should be sold to private firms."}, "docdt": "1996-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
