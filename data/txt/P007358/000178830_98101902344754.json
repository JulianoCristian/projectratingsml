preparation of evaluation reports and\n            bidding documents on areas to be offered for exploration,\n            evaluation of proposals by oil companies, contract\n            negotiations, monitoring of oil companies' exploration\n            activities, oil accounting and auditing, revision of the\n            current petroleum legislation, and preparation of\n            specialized studies as required; (2) training for staff of\n            the General Directorate of Mines and Hydrocarbons (DGMH);\n            (3) computer processing of data; (4) equipment and materials\n
