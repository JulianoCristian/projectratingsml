                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is expected to disburse less than half of the loan on goods and works that will contribute to the overall objectives. It will however not reach its development objectives.

                         The project was envisioned to undertake projects to improve tourism and basicservices in the Lake Titicaca Region including docks, rural water supply, solid waste management
                         systems, urban water supply, drainage and wastewater treatment, tourist centers and signage for tourist areas. The implementation was delayed initially due to institutional
                         deficiencies of the executing agency at the beginning of the project. A restructuring was undertaken to transfer the responsibility to FPS with a focus on the execution of the works.
                         Under the new structure delays were encountered in contracting the pre-investment studies for the large urban water projects which did not allow these project which represent the

                         identifying land acquisition and compensation arrangements, finalizing designs, identifying interested contractors and reaching community consensus. As of January 2014 an
                         additional set of projects were considered in order to replace those that have had encountered these impediments in the design and bidding. These include drainage works,
                         equipment for solid waste management systems, ecological sanitation facilities and rural water supply projects.

                         To date the project has completed investments in signage in tourist areas; and rural water supply projects in two areas (Laja and Puerto Perez). 4 landfills (Copacabana, Tiwanacu,
                         Achacachi and Tiquina) are under construction. In addition, rural water supply projects (in Achacachi and Santiago de Huata); ecological sanitation latrines (in Achacachi, Viacha,
                         Santiago de Huata, and Huatajata) have recently been contracted. Additionally, equipment for solid waste management (Achacachi, Tiwanacu, Copacabana and Tiquina) and one
                         urban drainage project (in Viacha) are in the stage of contract award. No other equipment or works are expected to be procured. For all works that would extend after that project
                         closing date, local financing will be provided to cover that portion of the works.

                         It is expected that a total of between 45 and 50% of the loan will be disbursed before the end of the closing date. In total, the project has disbursed 27% of the loan including the
                         works executed and the previously executed pre-investment studies, small tourism activities and management costs. This represents and increase from 19% reported in the last ISR.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is planning for closure in February 2, 2015 as planned.
                         A date of October 31, 2014 has been set as a deadline for all bidding processes to be completed, and counterpart funding confirmed.
                         After that time, it is planned that the remaining portion of the loan will be canceled and these resources will be used for other investments in Bolivia.
