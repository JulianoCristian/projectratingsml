                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project completed restructuring in June 2012 which formally established FPS as the sole implementing agency for the project and with this simplification, it was expected the
                         Project’s implementation progress and overall performance would improve. The restructured project is envisioned to be implemented in two phases with the first phase involving all
                         those projects that at the time of processing the restructuring had substantially completed pre-investment studies and a second phase which includes those projects that were at the
                         early stages of preparation in June 2012.

                         The first phase projects include 51 projects (docks, water supply, solid waste management systems) amounting to USD5.3 million of the loan (USD6.0 million with counterpart

                         USD16 million from the loan (USD21 million with counterpart funding).

                         To date, 16 projects in phase 1 are completed (USD1.2 million in loan resources), 27 are under contracting (USD2.8 million in loan resources), 6 are under bidding (US$0.7 million in

                         loan resources) and the remaining 2 (USD0.8 million in loan resources) are under preparation.

                         For Phase 2 the pre-investment studies for the water supply, drainage and wastewater treatment were partially completed before the restructuring and with the transfer of contractual
                         management as part of the restructuring, needed to be rebid or restarted. Of these studies, 1 is in execution and the remaining 3 are under bidding. The design of the tourism
                         centers have been completed and the launch of the bidding process is awaiting confirmation of the land ownership.

                         In total, the project has disbursed 17% of the loan (US$3.4M) including the works executed thus far in Phase 1 and the previously executed pre-investment studies, small tourism
                         activities and management costs.
