                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project recently completed restructuring (June 2012) which formally established FPS as the sole implementing agency for the project and with this simplification, it is expected the
                         Project’s implementation progress and overall performance would improve. The restructured project is envisioned to be implemented in two phases with the first phase involving all
                         those projects that at the time of processing the restructuring had substantially completed pre-investment studies and a second phase which includes those that are at the early
                         stages of preparation.

                         The first phase projects include 51 projects (docks, water supply, solid waste management systems) amounting to USD5.3 million of the loan (USD6.0 million with counterpart

                         USD16 million from the loan (USD22 million with counterpart funding).

                         To date, 20 projects in phase 1 have been contracted (USD1.2 million in loan resources), 27 are under bidding process (USD2.8 million in loan resources) and the remaining 4

                         (USD1.3 million in loan resources) are in evaluation and expected to be bidded out before December. For Phase 2 the pre-investment studies were partially completed before the
                         restructuring and with the transfer of contractual management as part of the restructuring, needed to be rebidded or restarted. Of these studies, all are the stage of bidding. The pre-
                         investment studies and associated works are on schedule to be completed before the new project closing date of February 2, 2015.

                         In total, the project has disbursed 14.6% of the loan (US$2.87M) including the works executed thus far in Phase 1 and the previously executed pre-investment studies, small tourism
                         activities and management costs. It is expected that disbursement of all of phase 1 works to be completed before in third quarter 2013, increasing disbursement to approximately
                         USD 7 million (35% of the loan), at which time the first of the larger projects under Phase 2 are expected to begin execution.
