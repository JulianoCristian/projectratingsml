The restructuring is\n            intended to rectify deficiencies in the Project's\n            implementation arrangements, and to bring the Project back\n            to satisfactory implementation. The Project scope is to be\n            reduced to activities already completed; activities already\n            initiated by Vice Ministry of Tourism (VMT), but not\n            completed, which have been transferred to FPS (Fondo\n            Nacional de Inversion Productiva y Social); and other works\n            originally assigned to FPS for implementation which will be\n            completed by the extended Project closing date of February\n            2, 2015. Outstanding payments and audits for Project\n            activities carried out under VMT responsibility will be\n            completed by June 30, 2012.
