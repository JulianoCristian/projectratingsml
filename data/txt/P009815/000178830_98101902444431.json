including a lined canal system\n            to the 8 ha subchak level and field channels leading to\n            individual fields; (ii) introduce efficient, reliable, and\n            equitable water management systems in each medium irrigation\n            project; (iii) establish an appropriate institutional\n            framework for extending improved water management activities\n            in the state; (iv) strengthen the project organization for\n            quality control and the design of minor networks; (v)\n            provide mechanical skill training; (vi) provide training for\n            farmers; and (vii) provide vehicles, plant, and\n            communications equipment for the construction, maintenance\n            and operation of the MIPs. The project will create about\n            241,000 ha of additional irrigated area and provide a more\n            reliable water supply for 133,000 ha of existing irrigation."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
