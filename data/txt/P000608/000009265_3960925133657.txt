HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1303-DJI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Highway Maintenance
Project in Djibouti, for which Credit 1303-DJI in the amount of SDR 5.7 million
was approved on November 30, 1982. The credit was closed on June 30, 1987, six
months behind schedule. It was not fully disbursed, because SDR 38,207.47 was
cancelled on January 25, 1988, when the last disbursement was made.
The Infrastructure Operations Division, South-Central and Indian Ocean
Department, of the Africa Regional Office prepared the Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III. IDA requested the Government to prepare a PCR several
times, but it did not receive any reply. On May 11, 1990, IDA sent Part I and
III of this PCR to the Government for comments which were given in a letter dated
July 17, 1990. The content of the letter is given in Part II.
Preparation of this PCR was started during IDA's last supervision
mission of the project in October 1986. The PCR is based, inter alia, on the
Staff Appraisal Report, Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence
between IDA and the Government, and IDA's internal memoranda.

HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1303-DJI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objlectives
The Highway Maintenance Project, IDA's first involvement in Djibouti's
transport sector, aimed at assisting the Government in strengthening its road
organization to carry out effective, economic and efficient road improvement and
maintenance operations, thereby providing easier and more reliable access to the
hinterland and reducing transport costs (Part I - para 1.11).
Implementation Experience
The achievements for periodic maintenance of paved roads largely
exceeded the original objective, e.g. 66 km. vs. 25 km. (Part I - para. 1.16).
Spot improvements of about 800 km of priority earth roads and tracks by labor
intensive techniques proved to be more difficult than expected. The Department
of Public Works (PWD) improved about 85 km of priority roads to gr. vel standards
using mechanized units i.lstead (Part I - paras 1.17-1.20).
Procurement of the equipment financed by IDA was delayed because of
the time required for international competitive bidding, Government's lack of
familiarity with IDA's policies and procedures, and IDA's slowness to review
bidding documents (Part I - para 1.21).
Results
The project fulfilled the objectives of carrying out road improvement
and periodic maintenance of paved roads. However, neither the maintenance of
gravel and earth roads, nor the strengthening of the road organization were
carried out as expected (Part I - paras 1.32-1.34).
The quality of all work executed under the project was good. Project
measurable targets were all attained except for those set for the routine
maintenance of earth roads and tracks (Part I - para 1.32).
Measurable targets for training were not set at appraisal. Also, no
information on the number of PWD's local employees trained under the project
and results obtained is available, with the exception of the chief mechanics
(Part I - paras 1.33).
The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and PWD were reorganized under the
project. Structurally, the new organization was sound, even if it required to
be further improved. The strengthening of the road organization to carry out
effective, economic and efficient road improvement and maintenance operations
was not fully realized (Part I - para 1.34).



- iv -
Sustainability
It is expected that throughout its economic life the project will
maintain at least the same level of net benefits as estimated in this PCR on very
conservative assumptions (Part III - Annex 2).  However, benefits would drop
considerably if (i) the Government should not make available sufficient funds
to maintain the investments made under the project adequately, and (ii) no
technical assistance should be made available to PWD (Part I - paras 1.39 and
1.40).
Findings and Lessons Learned
The main lesson learned concerns the progress that can actually be made
in strengthening organizations  and in training  local  staff.   The project
confirmed what had already been learned from many other similar projects.
Institution building and training require continuously sustained effort over a
long period of time before tangible and durable results can be obtained (paras
1.33 and 1.34).

Macro Policy Objectives
1.02      Djibouti, which became independent in 1977 and a member of the Bank
and its affiliates in October 1980, is a small country of about 22,000 km2.
Most of its population of about 400,000 inhabitants lives in Djibouti City,
capital as well as port and railway terminal, where most of the economic
activities are concentrated. The hinterland, characterized by high mountains
and plateaux, is generally arid and hot and inhabited by poor pastoral
population.
1.03      Djibouti's natural resources are very limited.  In particular,
agriculture is almost non-existent and livestock scanty because of the extreme
shortage of arable and pasture land and water; the productive sectors,
therefore, have plaid only a minor role. For these reasons and because of
Djibouti's location, economy has, therefore, been very much oriented to
financial, commercial and shipping services for the region.
1.04      To support its role as a regional center, Djibouti's development
policy was mainly concentrated on the modernization of its infrastructure.
Because of population pressures in the city and an impending shortage of
potable water there, as well as strategic reasons, the Government began
encouraging development in the hinterland. Ac the beginning of the '80s, the
Government redefined the country's economic goals. Though Djibouti's economy
would remain oriented to services, priority was given to reducing poverty in
urban and pastoral areas, to decrease food and energy dependency and to
promote agriculture and industrialization.



Sector Development Objectives
1.05      In 1982, the transport system comprised about 2,800 km of roads and
tracks 1, 110 km of railway , the Djibouti port and an international airport
and several airstrips. In particular, the road network consisted of 300 km of
paved roads and streets and some 2500 km of earth roads and tracks.
1.06      The paved network included the Djibouti-Ethiopian border road (217
km) and 83 km of streets, most of them in Djibouti City. The Djibouti-
Ethiopian border road was in fair condition, but the first section (30 km),
built in 1953, needed to be rehabilitated, and the middle section, the Grand
Bara (25 km) needed resurfacing. Most of the tracks were in poor condition
and passable only by 4-wheel drive vehicles.
1.07      On June 2, 1983, the Government established, by decree, a National
Road Network of about 1,100 km, including 300 km of paved roads and streets
and about 800 km of priority earth roads and tracks, which would have first
call on the limited funds available for road improvement and maintenance, and
for which responsibility would be of MPW.
1.08      Before Djibouti's independence in 1977 and soon after, the
Government's main objective for the transport sector had been to support
Djibouti's role as a regional transhipment point. Most of the investments,
therefore, were made in the port of Djibouti, as well as in the railway and
road from Djibouti City to the Ethiopian border.
1.09      The development of the rest of the road network, consisting of
tracks, had been neglected, and the outlying areas, where the poor pastoral
population lived, had virtually been cut off from Djibouti City, economic and
political capital. The Government, then, changed its policy and began
investing in the development of the road network to supply those areas and
unify the country.
1.10      Because the interior of Djibouti was rather sparsely populated, so
that, in general, building new roads would have low economic rate of return,
maintenance and improvement of existing earth roads was essential to maintain
liaison between the capital and other settlements.
1 The figures given in the Project Completion Report are those of the
Appraisal Report. They do not match, however, those given in the consultants'
study (Etude diagnostique de l'entretien routier). According to this study
the length of the road network was 2,906 km, of which 1,106 km were national
roads, following the Government's decree of April 1982, and 1,800 km were
district tracks. The national road network comprised 249 km of paved roads
including the Djibouti City-Ethiopian border (219 kIn), 32 km of gravel road
and 825 km of tracks. The 68 km of streets, of which 50 km in Djibouti, were
not part of the national network.



E. Proiect Implementation
Delays before Effectiveness
1.14      The project was scheduled to be presented to the Board on
September 21, 1982 but the Government sent IDA its agreement to the negotiated
documents only at the end of October and did not comply with one condition 3
for Board presentation. To expedite the project, IDA had to change that
condition into a condition of effectiveness. The project was presented to the
Board on November 30, 1982, and the Credit Agreement signed on January 6,
1983.
1.15      The effectiveness date had to be postponed three times because of
the Government's lack of familiarity with IDA's requirements for
effectiveness. The Credit became finally effective on October 26, 1983,
almost one year after the Board presentation. Project implementation began,
therefore, about one year and a half later than scheduled at appraisal.
Maintenance of the Paved Network
1.16      Originally, the project provided for periodic maintenance of the
paved network consisting of resurfacing 25 km of the Grand Bara section of
RN 1 (Djibouti City-Ethiopian border road, 219 km). Neither the Appraisal
report nor the Consultants's study (Etude diagnostique de l'entretien routier)
specified whether the resurfacing would consist of a single or double surface
treatment. Under the project, PWD actually carried out the following periodic
maintenance work:
(a)  25 km of single surface treatment on RN 1 (Djibrp--i City-
Ethiopian border, 219 km),
(b)  8 km of double surface treatment on RN 3 (Balbala-Khor Ambado,
23 km)
(c)  10 km of double surface treatment on RN 5 (Grand Bara-HolHol,
64 km),
(d)  7 km of double surface treatment in Djibouti City (new streets)
(e)  16 km of single surface treatment in Djibouti City (existing
streets).
3 By the decree of June 16, 1982, the Government had given MPW responsibility
for improving and maintaining the National Road Network, including the streets
of Djibouti City. A condition of Board presentation first, and then a
condition of effectiveness, was that the Government promulgated a second
decree officially establishing the organization of MPW and defining its
functions, including routine maintenance of the streets drainage and sidewalks
of Djibouti City. This also involved the transfer of about 500 laborers ard
related operating funds from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of
MPW.

C. ProJect Obiectives and DescriRtio
Prolect Obiectives
1.11      In accordance with the Government's policy, the Highway Maintenance
Project, IDA's first involvement in Djibouti's transport sector, aimed at
assisting the Government in strengthening its road organization to carry out
effective, economic and efficient road improvement and maintenance operations,
thereby providing easier and more reliable access to the hinterland and
reducing transport costs.
Project Components
1.12      These were the Project components:
(a)  a three-year road improvement and maintenance program,
including resurfacing of about 25 km of paved roads, routine
maintenance on 300 km of paved roads and streets, and spot
improvements and maintenance with hand tools on about 800 km of
priority earth roads and tracks,
(b)  procurement of equipment, spare parts, tools, materials and
supplies for the works under (a),
(c)  construction of a workshop in Djibouti City and of a service
station in Dikhil, and expansion of the service station in
Tadjourah,
(d)  procurement of equipment and tools for workshops, and
(e)  consulting services comprising (i) technical assistance to
strengthen the road or anization, train personnel and do
preinvestment studies   to identify the improvement needs and
priorities of the road network, and (ii) fellowships for the
training of road maintenance personnel.
D. Proiect Design and Organization
1.13      The project design and scope resulted from the findings of IDA's
identification mission and a preinvestment study carried out by consultants.
The desi,n was very simple, not innovative and represented a realistic
approac to the road-development needs of the country. Only one Government
agency, with the assistance of consultants, was responsible for the project.
2 These studies included detailed engineering for the improvement to gravel
standards of about 250 km of tracks and preinvestment studies for the
rehabilitation of the first section (30 km) of the paved road from Djibouti
City to the Ethiopian border (RN 1).



Namely, about 66 km of surface treatment, 41 km (164%) more than
planned. Also, PWD carried out the routine maintenance of about 300 km of
paved roads and streets as provided for under the project,
Improvement and Maintenance of the Unpaved Network
1.17      The project provided for spot improvements and maintenance with hand
tools of about 800 km of priority earth roads and tracks. This work was to be
carried out mainly by labor intensive techniques, but this proved to be even
more difficult than expected 4. In 1984, PWD set up a firs-z gang and put it
to work on RN 3, but it advanced so slowly mainly because of the rocky soil
that PWD decided to replace it with a mechanized unit which had been set up
with existing equipment.
1.18      In September 1984,  PWD set up a second mechanized unit with
equipment procured under Japan's parallel financing and, one year later, in
September 1985, it set up a third mechanized unit with the first batch of
equipment procured under IDA's financing. Actually, therefore, PWD did not
carry out any spot improvement by labor intensive techniques but it improved
the following priority roads to gravel standards using mechanized units:
km
(a)  RN  3, Dorale-Khor Ambada                7
(b)  RN  5, Ali Sabich-Ali Adde               7
(c)  RN  6, Dikhil-As Eyla                   37
(d)  RN 14, Tadjourah-Obock                  34 5
Total                                  85
1.19      Neither IDA's files nor the consultants' final report give any
information about whether the 800 km of the earth priority road and tracks
received any routine maintenance at all. The Ministry of Interior (MI) was to
transfer about 500 laborers and the related operating funds to MPW, but it
never did it. As most of MI's laborers were old, unskilled and not prone to
work in the field under severe conditions, and their transfer was politically
difficult, MPW once proposed to set up a road fund, fed by taxes on fuel, to
finance road improvement and maintenance. But the proposal never came
through.
1.20      MI is the only agency which might have done some routine maintenance
4 Excerpt from the Project Brief: "In view of the heavy unemployment in
Djibouti, it would appear desirable to maximize the use of labor-intensive
techniques. However, while every attempt will be made to use labor-intensive
methods, this may prove difficult, because (i) many parts of the country are
sparsely populated so that workers would have to be brought considerable
distances from the town or from refugee camps, (ii) it may not be easy to find
people prepared to do labor-intensive road maintenance work in the extreme
conditions of the Djibouti hinterland (where temperature above 50 degrees
centigrades are common) and (c) there may be problems of financial
justification due to the relatively high minimum wage in Djibouti."

on those roads using the labor force and the funds which it should have
transferred to MPW. Hodever, this is verv unlikely, and if MI did carry out
some routine maintenance, the results must have been very poor 6,
Procurement of road equipment, etc (see 1.12 (b))
1.21      The equipment financed by Japan was procured expeditiously;  by
September 1984, it had been all delivered and most of it was operational.
Procurement of the equipment financed by IDA was delayed because of the time
required for international competitive bidding, _overnment's lack of
familiarity with IDA's policies and procedures, and IDA's slowness to review
bidding documents. By September 1985, the first batch had been delivered and
was operational. The second and third batches were delivered at the beginning
of 1987, the last year of project execution.
ConsLruction of Workshops
1.22      The project provided for the construction of workshops in Djibouti
City and service stations in Tadjourah and Dikhil. All the work, carried out
by contract, was completed. However, the construction of the Djibouti
workshop progressed very slowly, and the Government had to replace the
contractor. As a result, the new Djibouti workshop could not be used under
the project, because the work was finished at the beginning of 1987, i.e. when
the improvement and maintenance work was completed. Eventually, the Djibouti
workshop became operational and supported PWD maintenance operations.
Training
1.23      The project provided for (i) on-the-job training of counterparts,
including engineers, workshop mechanics, road technicians, store keepers and
accountants, and (ii) overseas fellowships for eight instructors who would
train equipment operators and road technicians. Training of counterparts and
assignment of fellowships, however, proved to be difficult for lack of
suitable candidates.
1.24      Three mechanics only availed themselves of the fellowships by
attending training session in France. The Government, then, with IDA
agreement, requested the consultants to hire an additional expert, a mechanic,
to train mechanics on-the-job for ten months. This program was carried out
from January to September 1986, during which 16 chief mechanics were trained.
1.25      Before and after the training, the expert tested the trainees'
6  Excerpt from SAR:
- "However, as the municipalities and MI lack the funds, expertise and
equipment to carry out these tasks, PWD is regularly called upon to
provide these services on an emergency basis (paragraph 1.17, page 5)."
and
- "Teams of MI's laborers nominally in charge of routine maintenance Df
earth roads and tracks, produce no tangible results (paragraph 2.03,
page 9).".



techLnical knowledge. The outcome indicated that, on the average, the
trainees' knowledge had improved but that there was still a long way to go in
order to obtain an acceptable level of technical knowledge, i.e. training
should continue.
1.26      The expert came up against several difficulties during the training.
One was the late completion of the Djibouti workshop and another,inherent to
on-the-job training, was the too short time available to explain the methods
to find out the causes of the breakdowns, because of the urgency to repair the
equipment.
Proiect Risks
1.27      SAR (para 3.08) pointed out that the main risks of the project were
the usual risks associated with road maintenance projects. Project
implementation might be slowed down by delays in procurement of equipment,
materials and supplies, recruitment of technical assistance, construction of
workshops and provision of local funds, as well as by productivity lower than
the modest levels assumed. These risks were compounded by the fact that the
project was IDA's first operation in the road subsector in Djibouti.
1.28      Actually, project implementation was delayed because of difficulties
in the (i) preparation and approval of bidding documents for procurement of
equipment, spare parts, materials and supplies and (ii) construction of
workshops (paras 1.21 and 1.22). However, project implementation was delayed
mainly before the actual implementation of the project started, because of
delayed credit effectiveness (para 1.15). Productivity was not one of t,'e
factors that delayed project implementation.
1.29      Also, SAR pointed out that, because the project was IDA's first
operation in the road subsector in Djibouti, more frequent supervision would
also be required in the initial project stages. Looking at the number and
dates of the actual supervision missions, it does not seem that IDA met this
requirement adequately.
1.30      The Government and consultants were actually faced with another
difficulty not mentioned among the risks in SAR, but identified since project
preparation, namely the difficulty for PWD in keeping and recruiting trained
and experienced staff at all levels 7. This affected the training program
adversely (para 1.23).

1.31      The estimated total cost at appraisal was US$8.0 million, excluding
taxes, and the estimated foreign cost was US$6.4 million entirely financed by
IDA. The actual total cost, net of taxes, turned out to be much higher, i.e.
7 The Project Brief pointed out that "this difficulty is aggravated by the
proximity of Saudi Arabia, which needs, and therefore imports, qualified
staff. The project will have to make a major training effort, even if many of
the people trained may not stay in their jobs, because they may seek more
remunerative employment, or more pleasant working conditions elsewhere.".

US$13.9 million of which the foreign cost was US$10.7 million. An increase of
US$5.8 million (72%) due to procurement of more equipment, financed by Japan,
as well as more materials and supplies, financed by the Government, than
estimated at appraisal 8. Breakdown of the project financing in US$ million
was as follows:
SAR                              Actual

F. Project Results
1.32      The quality of all work executed under the project was good.  The
productivity of the mechanized units for both resurfacing of paved roads and
improvement to gravel standards of tracks, was higher than expected. Project
measurable targets were all attained except for those set for the routine
maintenance of earth roads and tracks which was not carried out under the
project (para 1.19). Actually, the targets for resurfacing and routine
maintenance of paved roads and for improvement to gravel standards of earth
roads and tracks, were exceeded.
1.33      Measurable targets for training were not set.  Also, no information
on the number of PWD's local employees trained tnder the project and results
obtained is available, with the exception of the chief mechanics (paras 1.23-
1.25). T.e only replacement of expatriates with Djouboutians, mentioned in
either IDA's files or the consultants' final report, is that of PWD's director
in July 1986. The consultants estimated in their report that PWD's
expatriate staff would decrease from 13 9 in 1986 to 12 in 1987, to 6 in 1988
and to 5 in 1989.
1.34      MPW and PWD were reorganized in 1984.  PWD split up into two
departments, Department of Public Works and Department of Town Planning and
Housing. Structurally, the new organization was sound even if it required to
be further improved. However, there was still lack of qualified staff at all
levels but clerical, and a need for a lot more of training. PWD still needed
many expatriates (para 1.33) to run adequately and properly. Because at the
end of the project, MPW, and in particular PWD, still depended heavily on
technical assistance, the strengthening of the road organization to carry out
effective, economic and efficient road improvement and maintenance operations
8 Fluctuations of the rates of exchange between the US dollar and the Special
Drawing Rights and between the US dollar and the Djibouti franc were so small
that they did not have any appreciable impact on the actual project cost. At
appraisal, SDR 1=US$1.123 and US$1=DF 175. The average rates of exchange for
the project period were: SDR 1=US$1.095 and US$1=DF 177.63.
9 According to the appraisal report, there were 26 expatriates in PWD in
1982, provided by Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC). According to the
consultants' final report, there were 13 at the end of 1986.

cannot be considered as realized.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
1.35      At appraisal, because no historical data on traffic volumes
existed 10, and the economic activity outside Djibouti City was limited, a
conservative traffic growth of 2.5% p.a. for paved roads and 1% p.a. for earth
roads and tracks were assumed. Vehicles operating costs (VOC) and savings
were derived using the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM).
Not all data used at appraisal to evaluate ERR, however, are on file, namely
VOC for paved roads. ERR of the resurfacing of 25 km of paved road was
evaluated at 58% on the basis of an economic life of 5 years, and that of the
routine maintenance of both paved and unpaved roads was evaluated at more than
100%, on the basis of an economic life of 3 years.
1.36      The Government did not prepare a completion report for the project,
in spite of IDA's numerous requests. IDA's last supervision mission visited
Djibouti in October 1986, and because there has been no follow-on project, no
other transport mission has visited Djibouti so far. The consultants' final
report does not deal with economic re-evaluation of the project. PWD carried
out two traffic counts in 1983 and 1984, i.e. before the start of project
implementation, but they were taken only on RN 1, and too close to Djibouti
City for the results to be of any use. Consequently, no data, except for
actual costs, were available to re-evaluate ERR.
1.37      In spite of this lack of data, ERR was re-evaluated all the same,
but on very conservative assumptions (Part III - Annex I) as follows: (a) The
economic re-evaluation of the resurfacing (single surface treatment) of 25 km
of RN1 (para 1.16 above) was done using the same traffic, 60 vpd, as at
appraisal, but assuming a 0% growth p.a. and no savings in reconstruction cost
after 5 years, as assumed at appraisal 11. Also, since no VOC for paved roads
were on file, it was assumed that VOC of a representative vehicle for a good
paved road was about 13% only lower than that given for good gravel roads in
the 1981 study: "Etude diagnostique de l'entretien routier". On these
assumptions, ERR was about 16% (Part III - Annex 2, para 1), whereas at
appraisal, it had been evaluated at 58%. (b) An economic evaluation of the
resurfacing (double surface treatment) of 18 km of RN3 and RN5 (para 1.16
above), not originally included in the project, was carried out on the same
conservative assumptions. ERR was about 10% (Part III - Annex 2, para 2).
ERR turned out to be lower than that of RN1 because of the higher cost (double
surface treatment instead of single surface treatment). (c) The economic
evaluation of the resurfacing of 23 km of streets in Djibouti City, not
originally included in the project, showed an ERR of about 25% (Part III -
Annex 2, para 3). (d) An economic re-evaluation of the routine maintenance of
about 300 km of paved roads and streets (para 1.16 above) was also carried out
10 The only traffic data available were those from a one-week count made on
selected roads and tracks by consultants in 1981.
11 Savings in reconstruction cost after only five years were not considered
also because the 25-km-long road section actually required only a single
surface treatment, hence it must have been in better condition than assumed at
appraisal.



- 10 -
on the same conservative assumptions. ERR was about 57% (Part III - Annex 4,
para 3) versus an estimate of 100% at appraisal. Routine maintenance of 800
km of tracks was not carried out under the project. It was replaced by the
improvement to gravel standards of 85 km of tracks (para 1.18 above). (e) The
economic evaluation of this %mprovement to gravel standards of 85 km of
priority tracks was done usiag a traffic of only 10 vpd, i.e 50% of the
highest traffic estimated at appraisal for this type of roads, and assuming a
growth p.a. of 0%. VOC were assumed to be the same as those given in the 1981
study: "Etude Diagnostique de 1' Entretien Routier". On these assumptions,
ERR was about 14% (Part III - Annex 2, para 5).
1.38      The overall project rate of return was estimated at 22% as compared
to more than 100% estimated at appraisal, largely because of the very
conservative assumption on traffic growths which were utilized for the PCR, in
the absence of adequate data.
G. Proiect Sustainability
1.39      The work executed under the project was of good quality, the
Government provided more funds than expected (44% of project total cost as
against 20% estimated at appraisal) showing its determination to improve and
maintain the road network, and PWD with technical assistance performed
relatively well under the project. It is expected, therefore, that throughout
its economic life the project will maintain at least the same level of net
benefits estimated, on very conservative assumptions, in this PCR as shown in
Part III - Annex 2.
1.40      However, benefits might drop considerably if (i) the Government
should not make available sufficient funds to maintain the investments made
under the project adequately, and (ii) no technical assistance should be made
available to PWD. As IDA has not decided to finance a follow-on project in
the transport sector as yet, it is not in a position to address these issues
in detail.
H. IDA Performance
1.41      The project was small and simple without any complicated transport
issues and not innovative for IDA. It was delayed mainly because of the
difficulties that the Government encountered in meeting conditions for credit
effectiveness, but then it was executed smoothly without major issues. IDA
might have been more speedy in reviewing bidding documents and could have
supervised the project more frequently, since the project was IDA's first
involvement in the highway subsector, but probably it could not because of
staff constraints.



- 11 -
I. Borrower Performance
1.42      The Government did not perform well during the preparation of the
project, namely in meeting conditions of credit effectiveness. The project,
however, was IDA's second operation in Djibouti 12, and the Government's lack
of familiarity with IDA's requirements was the main reason for this poor
performance, that delayed project implementation by about one year and a half.
During project execution, the Government performed satisfactorily.  The
Borrower's main weaknesses were its unfamiliarity with IDA's procedures and
requirements (which IDA should have addressed through increased supervision)
as well as its inability to supply qualified staff to the project. Both were
well known by IDA during project preparation and can hardly be imputed to bad
performance.
J. Proiect Relationships
1.43      The Borrower-IDA relationship was generally good.  At a given time,
however, there were conflicting opinions about the responsibility for the
delays in finalizing bidding documents. PWD accused IDS of not reviewing
bidding documents in a speedy manner, and IDA thought that the Government did
not prepare bidding documents as it should, i.e. according to IDA's
requirements.
K. Consulting Services
1.44      The consultants performed well.  Their reports, in particular the
final one, however, could have been a little more accurate and clear.
L. Prolect Documentation and Data
1.45      The legal documents and the appraisal report were prepared, as
usual, with care and are clear. However, as the Government was not familiar
with IDA's procedures and requirements (paras 1.21 and 1.43), occasionally, it
had problems in interpreting and applying some of the credit agreement
conditionalities. Also, not all data used for ERR evaluation are available in
the appraisal report or any other document in the files.
12 IDA's first operation in Djibouti was a US$3 million credit for a
technical assistance project approved by the Board on April 20, 1982.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
2.01 Parts I and III were sent to the Borrower on May 11, 1990 with the
request to provide Part II. The following response to that request was
received from the Director of Public Works in his letter dated July 17,
1990.
2.02 "In response to your letter dated May 11, 1990, please find hereunder
the comments from the Borrower:
(i) Concerning Part III of the PCR, I confirm that the information
it contains is accurate.
(ii)   Concerning Part I, the Government has the following comments:
(a) The program of improvement of gravel roads by mechanized
brigades is being continued. Since the beginning of the Highway
Maintenance Project, which had identified a priority network (of
tracks) of 250 km, 186 km of tracks have been improved and it is
intended to complete the program by 1994.
(b) The strengthening of the road organization has been achieved
as projected at the level of the subdirectorates of Dikhil and
Tadjourah with the commissioning of routine maintenance crews
(for pavement, shoulders, drainage and structures), as well as
the setting up of specialized gangs (for heavy equipment and
engines) in the equipment yards.
(c) In addition to this, the training organization developed
(under the project) has been maintained and is still operating,
especially for operation and maintenance of heavy equipment and
vehicles (one full time trainer since 1987). We are currently
envisaging the setting up of a training cycle for road
maintenance site foremen in 1991. Moreover, since 1988,
training sessions for head foremen and topographers have been
offered in the Vocational Training Center for Building and
Public Works with technical and financial assistance from the
French Cooperation.
(d) MPW's suggestion (to the Government) to create a road fund
to collect a fuel tax earmarked for the upgrading and
maintenance of National Roads has not been adopted.
(e) The setting up of a Road Planning Unit by 1993 is a major
objective of DPW in order to analyze the road network and
promote a road maintenance policy (with appropriate data
processing tools).
(f) A number of technical assistants (10) provided by France are
still present within DPW. The replacement of these by Nationals
with equivalent skills is envisaged at about 50% by 1994.



- 13 -
(g) DPW does its best to maintain the road assets in good
condition, those built before, during, and after the project.
Routine maintenance is financed under the National Budget.
Financing from various bilateral sources is expected for the
periodic maintenance of RN1 as follows: Saudi Fund-30 km
completed; African Development Fund-100 km, envisaged in 1991;
and French Cooperation-40 km envisaged in 1992.
(iii)    Evaluation of Bank's performance:  as this was the first project
in the infrastructure sector, it is difficult (for us) to have
an opinion on it. However, the project has been completed with
the main objectives attained, which can be Interpreted as a good
performance and capacity to adjust adequately as project
implementation goes on. The flexibility shown in the Djiboutian
context has been well appreciated.
(iv)    Evaluation of Borrower's performance:  the Borrower's
performance has been very positive especially after project
completion. The continuation of training, the willingness to
improve the road maintenance organization and management, the
provision of substantial funding for routine and periodic
maintenance of national paved or upgraded unpaved roads, all
show a national concern (for road maintenance) following the
implementation of the project.
(v)    Evaluation of Bank-Borrower relationship during project
implementation: relationship must have been satisfactory if one
considers that the project has been completed without
unreasonable delay. The multiple small problems (arisen during
project implementation), resulting mainly from the need to
comply with Bank guidelines, might have had less impact had the
supervision mission been more frequent."

13 The date shown herein is that of the Project Brief.  However, the project
was actually identified in October 1980 by an IDA's mission which also began
the project preparation (see Terms of Reference of October 6, 1980 and Back-
-  Offic  -eport of November 12, 1980).
14 In at..-rdance with the Project Brief, the date given herein is when
consultants started the road maintenance study (see para 15 of the Project
Brief). However, actual preparation began in October 1980 (see note 13).
15 Board presentation delayed because the Government sent IDA its agreement on
the negotiated documents only on October 26, 1982 and did not meet the conditions
of Board presentation. In order to present the project to the Board, IDA had
to change the conditions to Board presentation in conditions to effectiveness.
16 The Credit Account was closed on Jan 25, 1988, when the last disbursement
was made (see paras 3.03 A and B).

21 Actually, there was no short list. The Government proposed, and IDA agreed,
hiring the same consultants who had carried out the Maintenance Study.
22 The Government aporoved of the contract for technical assistance on November
1, 1984 and notified the consultants of the approval on January 12, 1984, when
the consultants' services should have started. However, they actually started
on October 9, 1983 when, following the Government's and IDA's approval, the
mission leader arrived in Djibouti
