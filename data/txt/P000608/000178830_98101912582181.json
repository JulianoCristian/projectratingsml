Highway\n            Maintenance Project for Djibouti are to assist the\n            Government in strengthening its road administration to carry\n            out road improvement and maintenance effectively and\n            economically, thereby: (i) providing easier and more\n            reliable communications between Djibouti city and the\n            interior; and (ii) reducing transport costs. It will also\n            provide training to local staff and lay the foundation for\n            planning and preparing future road projects. The major\n            components include: (a) a three-year road improvement and\n            maintenance program including resurfacing of about 25 km of\n            paved roads, routine maintenance on the 300 km of paved\n            roads and streets, and spot improvements and maintenance\n            with hand tools on about 800 km of priority earth roads and\n            tracks; (b) improvement of equipment maintenance facilities,\n            including construction of workshops in Djibouti city and\n            service stations in Tadjourah and Dikhil; (c) technical\n            assistance comprising consulting services to strengthen the\n            road administration, to train personnel and to prepare\n            pre-investment studies to identify the improvement needs and\n            priorities of the road network, and fellowships for the\n            training of road maintenance personnel."}, "docdt": "1982-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
