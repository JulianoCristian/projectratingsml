are to assist the Government in strengthening its\n            road administration to carry out road improvement and\n            maintenance effectively and economically, thereby (i)\n            providing easier and more reliable communications between\n            Djibouti City and the interior; and (ii) reducing transport\n            costs. It would also provide training to local staff and lay\n            the foundation for planning and preparing future road\n            projects. The major components include: (i) a three-year\n            road improvement and maintenance program including\n            resurfacing of about 25 km of paved roads, routine\n            maintenance on the 300 km of paved roads and streets, and\n            spot improvements and maintenance with hand tools on about\n            800 km of priority earth roads and tracks; (ii) improvement\n            of equipment maintenance facilities, including construction\n            of workshops in Djibouti City and service stations in\n            Tadjourah and Dikhil; (iii) technical assistance comprising\n            consulting services to strengthen the road administration,\n            to train personnel and to prepare pre-investment studies to\n            identify the improvement needs and priorities of the road\n            network, and fellowships for the training of road\n            maintenance personnel."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
