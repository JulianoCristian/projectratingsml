ENERGY,TF052261-SECONDMENT OF PETER JOHANSEN", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7221", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Renewable Energy Project\n            for Turkey were as follows: outcomes were highly\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: long-term financing to renewable energy\n            development can be financially viable. However, financing\n            renewable energy is a complex line of business and capacity\n            building support should be provided to financial\n            institutions in strengthening project evaluation and\n            engineering skills and environmental and social safeguard\n            functions. For renewable energy projects, technical\n            assistance to financial institutions should be considered\n            being incorporated into initial project designs. Success of\n            the project can be linked to the long-term programmatic\n            approach that Turkey has adopted and the Bank has supported\n            to create the enabling environment, build capacity and\n            catalyze investments. The Turkish experience suggests that\n            the development of renewable energy often faces an array of\n            barriers, including institutional, capacity and financing\n            challenges. To promote the utilization of renewable\n            resources requires a thorough understanding of the sector\n            background, long-term efforts, and a strategic mix of policy\n            and investment interventions to overcome these barriers. A\n            predicable policy and regulatory environment is a critical\n            precondition for private sector investment in renewable\n            energy development. Having a supportive policy environment,\n            including predictable feed-in tariffs and transparent rules\n            for electricity trading are critical for attracting private\n            sector investment. Other favorable policies include\n            facilitation of developer access to land and adoption of\n            transparent and streamlined procures for obtaining licenses\n            and water-use rights in the case of hydropower development.\n            For renewable energy projects, it is important to develop a\n            coherent strategy that integrates the establishment of an\n            enabling policy and regulatory environment within the\n            overall framework of the project design. High levels of\n            sponsor collateral requirement constrained small renewable\n            developers with low collateral value from accessing finance.\n            It is important to develop more friendly policies for small,\n            first-time renewable developers in the future, such as\n            guarantee fund, to overcome the challenge."}, "docdt": "2010-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
