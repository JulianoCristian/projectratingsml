1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The recurrent political instabilities between 2003 and 2005 seriously affected the
functioning of the public administration in Mauritania. In August 2005, in the aftermath of a
military coup, the Military Council for Justice and Democracy led by Colonel Ely Ould
Mohammed Vall (Conseil Militaire pour la Justice et la Démocratie – CMJD) was established.
CMJD ratified a new constitution, conducted presidential and legislative elections, and handed
power to the new government within 19 months.

2.      The World Bank did not suspend its assistance during this period, and remained
engaged in dialogue with the transitional government. The coup appeared to have been backed
by the population and was immediately followed by the transitional arrangements and preparation
of the National Reform Program (NRP) in November 2005. Maintaining the Bank’s leadership on
policy dialogue and as coordinating partner for financial and technical partners around the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was critical. In addition, the Bank and International
Monetary Fund (IMF) were jointly addressing both the aggravated macroeconomic situation that
resulted from extra-budgetary spending in early 2004 and management of the oil revenues on
which the country was largely depending.

3.       The project was conceived in such a complex and fragile environment but prepared
in line with the strategic documents. The project specifically supported two out of four pillars
of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2003-2005 approved by the board on May 6, 2002: (i)
institutional development and governance; and (ii) developing human resources and ensuring
universal access to basic infrastructure and services for the poor. The new CAS for 2006-2009
was being prepared during the same period, and it stressed the importance of governance and
capacity development of the public service.

4.      The Government’s priorities for which the Bank had comparative advantage to
offer support were identified in the original PAD as the following:

   (i) Strengthening Public Financial Management (PFM), especially management of oil
         revenues, in the context of projected growth;
   (ii) Promoting the stagnant decentralization process;
   (iii) Exploring the emerging concerns over sustainable environmental management in the
         context of high dependence on the exploitation of natural resources;
   (iv) Improving Human Resource Management (HRM) to strengthen overall public service
         delivery.

5.       The Policy and Human Resources Development grant (PHRD-US$549,825) was
signed in April 2004, paving the way for the project. The PHRD financed: (i) a broad
institutional assessment and an action plan for modernization of public administration; (ii) an
action plan for improving public resource and expenditure management; (iii) an action plan for
private sector development; and (iv) identification and preparation of an action plan for the
development of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).

6.      In addition, a Project Preparation Facility (PPF-US$765,000) was provided to
support the detailed design of two components and corresponding implementation
arrangements. The PPF financed: (i) a preparatory study for the environment component, (ii) a
preparatory study for the decentralization component and (iii) the recruitment of staff for the
Project Coordination Unit (PCU). Activities to be implemented during the first year were


                                               1
identified and Terms of Reference (TOR) were prepared prior to board approval. The transitional
government and IDA agreed on retroactive financing for payments that had been made by the
borrower for preparations undertaken before project effectiveness.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.    The development objective of the project was to contribute to the improvement of
performance, efficiency, and transparency of public resources management in Mauritania.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification.

8.     The original results indicators of the Bank’s three year project were as follows: (i)
the budget preparation at all levels of national administration is improved; (ii) fiscal and
accounting reports are produced in a timely manner according to international standards; (iii)
responsibility for issuing orders of payment is delegated to sector Ministries through RACHAD
in conformity with established norms and regulations; (iv) the institutional framework for
environment and natural resources management is improved; (v) the HRM system is improved
and de-concentrated in sector Ministries.

9.       The original PDO did not change in the course of implementation, but several
changes in the PDO indicators were made at restructuring in March 2012 (See Table 1).
Major changes were made in order to: (i) reallocate resources and non-committed funds to new
priorities and activities such as support to procurement reform; and (ii) revise indicators to better
articulate the connection between inputs, outputs and outcomes in the project, taking into account
new activities. It should be noted that the original indicators were designed to measure outputs
rather than outcomes and did not include some critical areas such as improvement of budget
execution and increase in tax revenue.

10.      The October 2013 level 2 restructuring brought additional minor changes in the
results framework. The measurement of PDO 1 and intermediate indicators 4 were slightly
changed to better reflect project impact and adjust to the project circumstances at that time (see
Table 1 and Data Sheet). The intermediate indicator 13, concerning planned functional reviews of
the Ministries of Civil Service and Finance was dropped, following the cancellation of the
activity.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.    As a multi-sectoral project focusing on many dimensions of institutional
development and capacity building, the project included a broad range of beneficiaries. It
included five ministries: the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED); the
Ministry of Finance (Component A); the Ministry of Interior, Postal Services, and
Telecommunications (Component B); the Ministry of Rural Development and Environment
(Component C); and the Ministry of Civil Service and Employment (Component D). The project
was initially coordinated at the Prime Minister’s Office (see further detail in the section on
implementation arrangements).

12.     During the course of implementation, changes in the architecture of the government
meant that there were significant changes in the architecture of beneficiaries. For example,
the Ministry of Interior, Postal Services and Telecommunications - beneficiary of Component B –
was dismantled in 2007 and divided into three ministries: Ministry of Interior and Territorial
Administration, Ministry of Decentralization, and Ministry of Postal Services and
Telecommunications. Two ministries were reintegrated again into one Ministry of Interior and
Decentralization in August 2008, while Postal Services and Telecommunications remained
separate.

13.    In addition, a number of new agencies and Directorates were added as a result of
project restructuring. These include the National Statistics Office (ONS), Public Procurement
Regulatory Authority (ARMP), Procurement Control Commissions, Directorate General of Land
Management, and the Directorate General of Customs in the Ministry of Finance.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.     This Specific Investment Loan (SIL - US$13 million) was approved by the board on
July 6, 2006 for three-year implementation with 5 components. It became effective on
January 7, 2007. The project was designed to reflect the identified key priorities in the National
Reform Program of the Transitional Government, and also included a component to support
project implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

15.     Component A: Improvement of public finance management (US$5,135,000). This
component aimed at increasing transparency and efficiency of PFM by creating management
tools and an information system, and improving human resource management (HRM) capacity. It
included: (i) strengthening resource mobilization (US$1,650,000); (ii) improving budget
presentation and planning (US$450,000); (iii) improving budget execution and accounting
(US$1,710,000); (iv) strengthening the efficiency of expenditure (US$575,000); and (v)
strengthening PFM at the de-concentrated level in two regional capitals - Nouadhibou and Rosso
(US$750,000).

16.    Component B: Support to local development (US$1,565,000). This component
supported reforms that aimed to further decentralize and de-concentrate authority. It included
support to: (i) the Directorate of Territorial Administration (US$550,000); (ii) the General
Directorate of Local Governments (US$175,000); (iii) information, education, and
communication (IEC) activities (US$40,000); and (iv) pilot operations in Dakhlet Nouadhibou
and Trarza (Rosso) for local development management (US$800,000).

17.     Component C: Mainstreaming environment into development management
(US$985,000). This component aimed at facilitating the integration of environmental concerns
into development planning, through harmonization of various sector strategies and existing texts
with a view of clearly establishing the central and transversal character of environmental
concerns in the political domain. It included: (i) support to a working group aimed at preparing
and creating a Ministry of Environment or other dedicated structure as described in the NEAP
(US$175,000); (ii) a capacity building program (US$290,000); and (iii) pilot projects
(US$520,000).

18.    Component D: Improvement of human resources management in public
administrations (US$2,285,000). This component aimed at strengthening structures in charge of
management of civil servants and maximizing utilization of the State’s human resources. It
included: (i) support to strengthen human resources management in public administrations
(US$460,000); and (ii) modernization of management and information tools used by public
administrations (US$1,825,000).

19.    Component E: Support to project implementation, monitoring and evaluation
(US$970,000). This component aimed to provide the Prime Minister’s Office, the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) and the Project Steering Committee with the resources needed to
adequately support project implementation by the five partner Ministries, as well as handle
monitoring and evaluation activities and manage communication on progress made against the
reform agenda. It included: (i) operating costs for the PCU within the Prime Minister’s office
(US$500,000); (ii) financing of technical and financial audits, training for unit staff and IEC for


                                                4
the reform programs supported by the Project (US$325,000); and (iii) monitoring and evaluation
(US$145,000).

       1.6 Revised Components

20.      The project underwent five instances of restructuring. The closing date was extended
three times in December 2009 and December 2011, and in March 2012 and a comprehensive
restructuring took place, including a further extension of closing date. A minor restructuring in
the Results Framework took place in October 2013, and a cancellation of unused funds in 2014.
The result of the comprehensive restructuring that took place in March 2012 was that the project
re-focused on updated government priorities and was able to reallocate resources, add new
activities and review and revisit project outcome indicators. The components were revised as
follows:

21.      Component A was revised to include a number of new activities to support increased
transparency and efficiency in Public Financial Management. They include: technical
assistance for public procurement reform; technical assistance to the new PFM reform
coordination unit of the Ministry of Finance to support the PFM reform master plan approved in
2011 (Schéma Directeur de la Réforme des Finances Publiques); and support to the population
and habitat census led by the National Statistics Office. A small series of activities that were not
yet fully designed were cancelled to allow for these resources to be reallocated.

22.   Activities related to decentralization, originally planned for Component B, were
removed 1 and the related funds were reallocated within the project.

23.     Component C was revised with a combination of cancellation of activities and
introduction of new activities. An activity providing for development around the sand dunes in
Nouakchott was cancelled due to complications regarding safeguards. Instead, savings from
cancellation of this activity were reallocated to support strategic work for climate change and
green growth, and for rehabilitation of the Ministry of Environment.

24.     Component D was revised to include support for development of a strategic agenda
for HRM reform, including functional reviews of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry
of Civil Service. However, in early 2013, the project steering committee decided to replace this
functional review with support for operationalization of the HRM reform strategy approved in
2012, as this was a critical agenda item for the government. The indicator related to this activity
was subsequently modified during the fourth restructuring of October 2013.

25.      Component E was revised to provide additional capacity within the PCU. This aimed
to allow the PCU to better support beneficiary institutions with design and implementation of
activities, and to enhance compliance with Bank rules. In addition, the revision placed
procurement for the whole project under a single procurement commission in charge of social
sectors, marking a change from previous plans to disperse authority for procurement across seven
different procurement commissions. This change came in response to challenges that had arisen
under the previous procurement arrangements.

26.    Finally, during the last 15 months of implementation, a number of activities across
the project were proactively reviewed and adjusted, in order to meet all development


1
    These activities were to be covered by a new project under preparation at the time.




                                                                    5
     objectives. The team took into account both available capacity and present circumstance, and
     reallocated resources with a view of focusing on critical changes and to ensure the success of on-
     going activities.

     1.7 Other significant changes

     27.      The closing date was extended three times. Bank activity was suspended during the
     period of August 2008 – September 2009 due to significant political instability in 2008-2009. A
     first extension to this project was granted on December 9, 2009 to extend the closing date of the
     project from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2011. A further three-month extension of the
     closing date from December 31, 2011 to March 30, 2012 was granted to prepare a thorough
     restructuring, and the third and final extension to March 29, 2014 was approved on March 29,
     2012.

     28.     At the third restructuring in March 2012, in addition to extending the closing date, a
     reallocation of funds was made to reflect the proposed changes in the project activities (see
     Table 2). In particular, uncommitted funds from Component B (Local Development) were
     reallocated to Component A (Public Financial Management), and remaining contingencies were
     reallocated to Component A and Component E to focus on PFM reforms and to strengthen project
     implementation capacity.

     29.     At the fourth restructuring, on October 7, 2013, minor changes in the results
     framework were made to better capture the impact of the project objective. This is discussed
     in more detail under section 1.2, ‘Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key
     Indicators’.

     30.     At the fifth restructuring in February 2014, the project cancelled SDR645,000
     (US$993,000 equivalent) because of savings due to fluctuation of SDR against USD and
     cancelation of two activities. Significant fluctuation of SDR to USD during the seven years of
     the project resulted in USD 687,232 in savings. Further, two activities that had been included in
     the project action plan in April, 2013 (support for the PFM reform coordination unit, and support
     for implementation of the Civil Service reform strategy) were expected to remain unimplemented
     during the remaining life of the project. The remaining US$305,768 was therefore cancelled and
     these activities were to be undertaken instead by the Government of Mauritania with its own
     financial resources. The table below shows the reallocation of funds throughout the project life.

31.     Finally, project anchoring officially changed 3 times in the course of implementation.
While the project was originally designed and expected to be anchored in the Prime Minister’s
Office, the Prime Minister’s decree on this matter in 2007 (n° 0357/PM) instead established the
project within the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development. A later decree in 2009 (n°
3525) moved project anchoring to the Ministry of Public Administration and ICT, and a third
change came in 2010 when a decree (n° 1378) re-assigned anchoring for the project to the
Ministry of Public Administration..

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

32.     The fragile context in Mauritania in 2005 made preparing a public sector project
challenging. When the Bank team began designing the project, it was in the immediate aftermath
of a military coup, and the main interlocutor at the time was the transitional government.
Because PRECASP aimed to address politically sensitive issues, like public resource
management and civil service reform, this made engagement with the transitional government
during this time all the more sensitive.

33.     According to the PAD, the project was designed in response to demand from the
government with a participatory approach. Project preparation involved representatives of the
concerned Ministries in planning conversations with the Bank and in the drafting of project action
plans for areas associated with the reforms, financed by IDA and other donors. This high level of
engagement allowed the Bank to provide operational tools and financing for short-term actions
selected from the general government program of reforms. According to the PAD, each of the
selected ministries had already prepared a specific reform program, and these were taken together
to form a strategic framework for the project.

34.     The project took into consideration recommendations from a number of strategic
documents. The project was directly based on the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2003-2005
(specifically supporting the governance pillar as well as the HR and service delivery pillar) and
supported the development priorities of the PRSP, particularly the promotion of good
governance, increased access to public services, and improvement of tools to monitor impact of
public finance expenditures.

35.     However, regarding quality at entry, there are a number of complicating factors at
the design stage which affected project implementation and performance:

   •   Lack of coherence among components of the project: While the project was designed
       with a strong orientation to the needs and priorities of the government, the project’s
       components did not themselves form a coherent program of work. In particular, the
       decision to include activities around environmental policy (Component C) in a project
       that mainly focused on PFM issues and HR management was questionable. This created
       some confusion among stakeholders, according to interviews conducted during the ICR
       mission.

   •   Lack of clarity on how the Bank would partner with other donors: At the time of
       project preparation, the Bank was one of several donors supporting Mauritania on public
       sector reform issues. Donor coordination would have been crucial to create synergies
       among donors so as to develop a common strategy and to build upon comparative
       advantages of each donor. While the PAD highlighted the importance of coordinating
       with the donor community, it is not clear in the document what coordination


                                                7
         arrangements would entail throughout implementation 2. According to the June 2007 ISR,
         one of the “main weakness of the project was that the current design is not adapted to
         building a program with other donors”. Also the MTR (p. 22) highlights the “lack of
         formal dialogue mechanisms with other capacity building projects in the country”.

    •    Lack of clarity on mitigation measures for this high risk-rated project: According to
         the PAD, the main project risks are the “change of priorities after election of the post-
         transition Government”, the “lack of mobilization within the Government on the proposed
         reform program”, and that “technical and financial partners are not aligned with
         Government's reform programs or the Project”. The overall risk is rated as substantial.
         Even though the team was aware that some of the activities and priorities might change
         under the new government elected in March 2007, the mitigation measures do not address
         how the project would adapt to possible changes in government priorities. Measures such
         as increasing the number of supervision missions or enhancing support for monitoring of
         project activities would have been a more robust set of mitigation measures than those
         listed, which included ‘good quality design’ and ‘strong project preparation’. During the
         ICR mission several stakeholders acknowledged that the project, despite the difficulty of
         the context, had not been flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances.

    •    Short time frame of project implementation: While the project design was complex,
         the project was originally expected to be completed within 3 years. A posteriori, such a
         short timeframe is considered too ambitious for a complex project that involved
         institutional changes in 5 ministries and aimed to introduce innovations in a fragile
         context.

2.2 Implementation

36.     The project has had a long and complicated implementation history. The project was
originally intended to be a 3-year long SIL and it ended up lasting 7 years, including a 1-year
suspension during the period of August 2008 to September 2009 when all Bank projects were
suspended due to political instability. The implementation path for the project was long, and it
encountered a number of significant obstacles and challenges. The project underwent 5
restructurings and was extended 3 times.

37.     To give a clearer overview of the implementation history of the project, 3 different phases
of the project can be identified, as outlined below. In addition, Table 3 offers a chronology of the
project milestones through these phases, also noting changes in the country context during the life
of the project.

    •    1st phase (July 2006 - August 2009): The first phase was characterized by political
         instability. Two entirely new governments were formed within two years, and a military
         coup then occurred on August 6, 2008. Following the coup the Bank halted activities for a
         period that lasted until September 2009. This phase experienced very slow disbursement
         (30% in 3 years) and weak achievement of PDO indicators.

  According to the PAD, the project constituted a key element of the assistance program developed in partnership with
the donor community (PAD, 1). The PAD lists ‘partnership arrangements’ in the detailed description of the project,
but this section is simply a list of donors who are involved in working around the issues mentioned in the PAD. There
are no notes on how coordination should take place.

      •     2nd phase (September 2009 – March 2012): This phase saw more focus on
            implementation despite continued and frequent changes in the government, with four
            Ministers of Finance, five Directors General of Budget and three Directors General of
            Taxes taking and leaving office in 31 months. Implementation of the project led to some
            concrete results, and this phase also saw the finalization of the MTR, the resulting Action
            Plan 2011-13 and a round of significant project restructuring in March 2012. As
            highlighted in the ISRs, restructuring allowed the structure of the project to respond to
            changed conditions and to align activities with changing priorities and opportunities. This
            phase also saw several rearrangements in the institutional architecture of the project
            following changes in the government.

      •     3rd phase (Mid 2012 – March 2014: The last phase was an intensive period of
            disbursement and achievement of PDO indicators, especially when compared to the first
            two phases. This phase was characterized by very close supervision by the Bank team.
            This included seven supervision missions between February 2013 and March 2014,
            monthly VC meetings with PCU and focal points, and bi-weekly contact to report on key
            activities. The disbursement rate increased from 55% to 90% in only 12 months, and the
            project achieved almost all of its development objective targets by the closing date.

                            13 achieved


38.    Other factors that affected project implementation and performance were the
following:

   •    Unpredictable country context: Not only were project activities suspended for 1 year
        following the military coup in August 2008, but several changes in the administration
        (outlined in Table 3) also created confusion and limited buy-in and ownership among the
        Ministry responsible for the project.

   •    Distortion in project institutional arrangements: Structural problems within the
        institutional arrangements affected implementation and performance of the project. For
        instance, while the Ministry of Finance was the largest beneficiary in terms of financial
        volume, the Ministry of Public Service was leading the project committee and was
        responsible for signing all the project contracts. Anchoring the project in a ministry that
        was not playing the leading role in the project’s reforms distorted perceptions of
        leadership surrounding the project and complicated project implementation, causing
        delays. Another problem was the lack of technical expertise of some focal points, which



                                                    10
        affected the quality of the work of government departments. In addition, several changes
        in anchoring the project coordination unit in the course of implementation slowed down
        implementation.

    •   High turnover of management both within the PCU and on the Bank team: During
        the life of the project, the PCU had 3 different Project Coordinators and the Bank TTL
        changed 5 times. Turnover of TTLs meant that adjustment time was required for the new
        TTL to understand the context and to build trust relationships with the stakeholders. In
        addition, the specialists selected to take over the TTLship came from varying
        backgrounds 4 and given the multi-sectorality of the project, some TTLs needed time to
        establish understanding outside their specific area of expertise.

    •   A long and complex procurement process: As noted in several ISRs, the complexity of
        the national procurement system, which has been under reform since 2012, was a factor
        slowing down project implementation. The project was constantly affected by lack of
        capacity in the procurement commissions, unclear process due to lack of critical
        documents such as operational manuals and standard bidding documents, and unclear
        demarcation of responsibilities among the concerned entities. The project’s procurement
        process encountered frequent complaints cases from bidders. For instance, the periods of
        processing and signing for 3 large IT contracts, a total amount of 1.3 million USD, were
        delayed for an average of 12 months each.

    •   Adaptive and change management issues: PRECASP introduced a number of
        significant innovations to the public administration, and there were several cases of
        resistance to change that resulted in blockages during implementation. Development of
        the interface between the Central Bank and the Treasury for an automated payment, and
        adoption of a new system for Customs information are two examples where anecdotal
        evidence suggests that resistance to change was a significant factor for implementation
        delays.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39.    The M&E section in the original PAD does not appear to be well articulated for the
following reasons:

      i. The Results Framework does not clearly articulate the connections between activities,
         intermediate outputs and outcomes;
     ii. Initial indicators were not SMART 5 indicators. For example, PDO 1 is “the budget
         preparation at all levels is improved”. This has a vague yes/no answer, and does not
         capture what the project will be able to achieve and how;
    iii. There are no indicators provided for Component E;
    iv. The arrangements for M&E are not clear in the PAD. It is not clear who will be
         responsible for M&E activities during implementation.

40.   Flaws in M&E planning affected project implementation and performance.
Weakness in the Results Framework (RF) at design and lack of clear articulation of some areas of
the PAD made it difficult to clearly attribute results to PRECASP activities. In addition, because

  The first TTL was an engineer from the Water and Urban department, the second was a lawyer from the legal
department, the third was an economist, and the fourth and fifth both had public sector backgrounds.

                                                    11
appropriate M&E support appeared to be missing, clear linkages between activities, outputs and
outcomes were difficult to establish. The steering committee, which was designed to oversee an
M&E process, did not appear to function as planned, and thus there was no one group or
individual tasked throughout the life of the project to proactively seek out results and impacts of
the activities.

41.     Despite these challenges, the PCU was able to successfully gather and communicate
M&E data on all project components during the life of the project. In particular, the M&E
expert working within the PCU collected and used M&E data throughout the project life with a
great degree of regularity. Despite flaws in the design of the RF and the lack of a M&E plan that
was only developed in 2008, the PCU proactively monitored project activities and informed the
Bank when the activities were delayed and/or encountered difficulties. The PCU produced the
quarterly financial report and M&E reports and submitted them on time to the World Bank. The
Bank hired an expert M&E consultant in 2013 to enable closer monitoring of project activities to
take stock of all results produced during the project life.

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management

42.     During project implementation, funds were generally used in a cost effective manner
and in conformity with the relevant rules. The ICR mission found that all financial status
reports were prepared in a thorough and precise way, backed up with transaction evidence, and
submitted on time. The overall performance in the area of financial management was deemed
satisfactory following the final FM supervision in March 2014. The accounting system operated
satisfactorily. The auditors issued an unqualified opinion on the project’s 2012 financial
statements and it reported that internal control procedures were in place.

Procurement

43.     The procurement system created several problems during project implementation.
The national procurement process was slow and complex, which caused long delays in processing
and signing the final contract for several contracts, including contracts for the establishment of
public financial management systems, for procurement of IT equipment and software, and two
technical assistance programs.

44.    However, despite the bottlenecks encountered as a result of the system, the project
did successfully contribute to the reform of that same system. Public procurement reform has
made concrete progress with PRECASP support, and public procurement is now being executed
more transparently and in compliance with international standards. PRECASP supported a
number of activities including: the drafting of a standard bidding document for procurement of
goods, works and consultants; drafting of manuals of procedure of all agencies of the
procurement system such as Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (ARMP) and National
Commission for Control of Procurement (CNCMP); providing relevant training for more than
300 persons including the private sectors and banking services involved in public procurement;
and drafting the ceiling for the single source contracting.

Disbursement

45.    The amount approved under the original IDA Grant was US$ 13 million equivalent.
The final disbursement rate was 94.8%.



                                                12
46.     The project experienced revisions in the allocations among project components,
discussed in detail above. The project cancelled SDR645,000 (US$993,000 equivalent) in
February 2014 because of the savings, fluctuation of SDR against USD and non-accomplishment
of two activities.

47.     There are three phases with regard to PRECASP disbursement. In the first two
phases disbursement was relatively low, around 30% in the first phase (July 2006 - August 2009)
and around 59% in the second phase (September 2009-December 2012). However, the
disbursement rate rose consistently in the last phase of the project, reaching 95% at project
closure in March 2014.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

48.     A follow-up to PRECASP, the Mauritania Governance Enhancement Project
(P146804), is being prepared at the time of this ICR. The project will support a next
generation of reforms, many of which are building on achievements from previous Bank support
including PRECASP. These reforms all are in line with the government’s public sector efficiency
agenda and are principally center of government reforms with a focus on greater technical
capacity and better systems for public resource management.

49.     While PRECASP has built basic capacities and stronger systems within the public
administration, the new project will take further steps toward optimizing efficiency and
performance of public institutions to enable them to better tackle inclusive growth. The
project is planned to include three main areas:

     i. Component 1: The objective of this component is to improve the legal framework,
        systems and management capacity for budget forecasting, planning, execution and
        control;
    ii. Component 2: The objective of the component is to optimize government revenue
        collection and other benefits coming from the expanding mining sector, and to ensure
        good environmental and social standards through effective monitoring.
   iii. Component 3: The objective of this component is to strengthen the Government’s
        capacity to produce, treat, and use data for better policy decisions and to provide support
        to the statistics institute.

50.     The team preparing the new project recognizes that this project should aim to build
on the achievements and lessons learned from PRECASP and seek to advance on the
government reform agenda. The new project will consolidate the PFM system in an integrated
manner, further strengthen management capacity of staff to ensure coherent and streamlined
public resources management in sectors, and enhance control and monitoring of public resources.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory (S)

51.     PRECASP objectives remain highly relevant for the country and strongly aligned
with government priorities throughout the project life. As stated in the first ISR and
mentioned above, the project directly supported and was aligned to one of the pillars of the CAS
(2003-2005) as well as two pillars of the PRSP, particularly the promotion of good governance,
increased access to public services and improvement of tools to monitor impact of public finance
expenditures. Moreover, the objectives of the project remain highly relevant in the current context
of the country as the project supports the second pillar of the current Country Partnership Strategy
(FY2014-2016), with a focus on improving economic governance and public sector performance
for enhanced service delivery. The objectives of the project are also in line with the World Bank
Group’s overall strategic goals of poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth, as well as
those of the 2011 World Bank Africa Strategy.

52.    Despite flaws in design that affected the Quality at Entry, PRECASP has
successfully created momentum for improved performance, efficiency and transparency of
public resource management. PRECASP has contributed to growth in ownership and increased
commitment of high-level officials for further PFM reform, including consensus on the
importance of moving to the IFMIS and widespread acceptance of the need for strategic HR
management including performance based management systems. Maintaining this momentum
will be a central focus of the Governance Enhancement project that is under preparation as
PRECASP’s successor project. This project will provide a seamless opportunity to further
support this momentum.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory (S)

53.     PRECASP successfully contributed to the achievement of the original PDO to
improve performance, efficiency and transparency of public resources management in
Mauritania. In particular, the project contributed to: (i) improvements in PFM that included
improved budget credibility, significant increase in revenue collection, improved transparency in
the public procurement system, and adoption of a Strategy for the Reform of System of Public
Finance Management, as highlighted in the latest Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA); and (ii) improvements in civil service HR management including
elimination of irregularities from the HR records through the census and reconciliation of
different datasets in 2008-2009, which contributed to reduction of the high wage bill in 2010-
2011, and establishment of the sound and transparent HRM system by integrating HR records,
wage and pension systems (see detail in the section below).

54.      The project achieved almost all of its objectives despite delays. The government ICR
states that the project ended with a positive track record overall, and the project achieved 5.5 out
of 6 PDOs with one partially achieved. 11.5 out of 13 intermediate indicators were fully achieved,
with one partially achieved and one unsuccessful. Component A achieved all but one indicator,
which remained partially achieved. Component B achieved all its indicators, as did Component

Component A

Rating: Satisfactory S

55.     The objective of this component was to support the implementation of reforms
aimed at increasing transparency and efficiency of PFM through the creation of
management tools and human resources capacity. Budget execution was significantly
improved through the establishment of transparent and effective financial management systems
including the budget expense system (RACHAD) and an automatic payment system established


                                                          15
between the Treasury and the Central Bank. Important achievements have been made in the area
of revenue collection, particularly a significant increase in tax revenue that resulted from
improved tax collection and the establishment of a Customs information system (SYDONIA++).
The new land management information system (Tehil) is expected to contribute further to
revenue collection in the future. A main challenge that remains is to develop a close linkage
between budget planning (MTEF), budget preparation, and execution and monitoring. To this
end, budget classification codes need to be updated and a budget preparation training module
should be further developed for relevant officials.

56.      Project component A strongly contributed to shaping and supporting the
government PFM reform program. Starting in 2006, the government of Mauritania has
initiated major reforms in the system of public finance management with the support of
PRECASP. The reform process has been reinforced by the adoption and implementation since
2012 of the "Strategy for the Reform of System of Public Finance Management" (Schéma
Directeur des Réformes), whose main axes reflect the PEFA indicators.

57.     According to the PEFA 2014 draft report, Mauritania has made substantial progress
on PFM reforms supported by PRECASP (Annex 3 shows the comparison of PEFA scores
from 2008 and 2014 6). The country has made significant improvements in the areas of revenue
collection, budget execution and procurement process, organization of accounting, production
and dissemination of budget information, and the computerization and modernization of the
expenditure chain through the establishment of the RACHAD and Beit el mel systems. This
progress is partially, if not fully, attributable to the PRECASP, and many of the advances
supported by PRECASP represent the concretization of reform efforts initiated in 2006.

58.   Specifically, the project has contributed to progress made in the following areas of
the PEFA framework:

A. PFM-out-turns
    • “Credibility of the Budget”: Information systems supported by PRECASP, such as
      RACHAD have improved government capacity to make credible budget forecasts. For
      instance, the difference between initial forecasts and expenditure has been substantially
      reduced, from 19.2% in 2011 to 0.8% in 2013, and distortion between the sectoral
      allocation foreseen in the initial forecasts and the effective allocation has also been
      reduced from 31.5% in 2011 to 10.7% in 2013. Stock and monitoring of expenditure
      payment arrears have seen improvement in 2014 thanks to the improvement of systems
      supported by PRECASP to: (i) eliminate the possibility to place orders on expenditure
      arrears without commitment; and (ii) to strengthen the availability of data for monitoring
      the stock of expenditure payment arrears through RACHAD and Beit el Mel.

B. Key crosscutting issues
    • “Comprehensiveness and Transparency”: The establishment of the new organization of
       public procurement, supported by PRECASP, has substantially improved the
       dissemination of information on government procurement.

C. Budget Cycle
    • “Policy-Based Budgeting”: The government has made good progress in the preparation of

    The PEFA 2014 is still in draft status and may be subject to changes.




                                                         16
       macroeconomic and budgetary framework and the preparation of sectoral MTBF
       supported by PRECASP in line with the national strategy for growth and poverty
       reduction.

   •   “Predictability and Control in Budget Execution”: The new procurement system
       supported by PRECASP is generally consistent with international standards, especially
       with regard to the reporting requirements, control and regulation and its implementation
       is advanced. The computerization of circuits (RACHAD) helped organize and streamline
       controls expenditure of the general government budget.

   •   “Accounting, Recording and Reporting”: The quality of records kept regarding budgetary
       and financial operations of the State is satisfactory. The connection established by
       PRECASP between the information systems of the Central Bank and the Treasury has
       contributed to enhanced quality of information. Moreover, recording on expenses and on
       budget execution has been highly improved through RACHAD and Beit el Mal, which
       have made it possible to have reliable information in a shorter timeframe than before.

59.     PDO 1 on “improvement of budget preparation” was partially achieved under this
component. PRECASP supported the development of a Medium Term Budget Framework
(MTBF) for the periods 2007-2008 and 2012-2014, and during this time the government also
prepared seven sectoral MTBFs. A third MTBF (2013-2015) was prepared by the government
without PRECASP support. While MTBFs were prepared and regularly updated, it does not
appear to be strongly aligned with the budget or reflected in budget laws. Further, budget
formulation and preparation processes are not yet automated. The government is currently aiming
at strengthening budget classification toward program budget, also with Bank support. A robust
database application is needed (instead of Excel-based tools) to support basic annual budget
preparation before moving to more ambitious budget reforms. This platform is expected to be
designed as a part of the integrated web-based GFMIS platform to avoid incompatibilities.

60.     PDO 2 on “improvement of budget execution” was achieved. The project supported
the establishment of the payment process system (RACHAD) in all departments (26), enabling
improved performance and control of public expenditure. The project established an
interconnection between RACHAD and Treasury and between Treasury and the Central Bank,
which resulted in shortening the payment duration by half and establishing monitoring
capabilities for both transaction status (payee) and remaining balance (payer). With PRECASP
support, payment/budget execution has shifted to an automated system.

61.     PDO 3 on “improvement of tax collection” was achieved beyond its target. As a
result of the fiscal census in Nouakchott in 2012 that was financed by PRECASP with the aim of
identifying all commercial and noncommercial properties and activities, a large number of
unregistered taxpayers and potential sources for sales tax were found. Following the rectification
in the tax registry of these sources and improved tax collection resulting from the census, tax
revenue in 2013 increased 147% compared to 2011. The development of a new tax administration
system, which includes the e-tax system to be implemented in the near future, will further ease
the administrative burden and allow the government to focus their scarce capacities on remaining
areas of weakness.

62.    The table below illustrates the list of PFM systems in Mauritania, many of which
were either developed or upgraded by the project.

63.     PDO 5 on “improvement of public procurement in compliance with the
procurement plan” was achieved. Public procurement is now more transparent, and is in
compliance with the institutional procurement plans supported by the project 7 . The Public
Procurement Regulatory Agency, the seven sectoral procurement commissions, and the control
commission were all established with PRECASP support, and are now operational. The standard
bidding documents and a new operational manual were prepared and officially approved, and
training for more than 300 people from both private sector and public entities were completed.
Public Procurement Plans of 9 ministries (Health, Education, MAED, Rural Development,
Mining, Employment/Professional Training, Justice, Finance, and Water) were regularly prepared,
updated, published and implemented. However, one remaining challenge with the sectoral
procurement plans is to ensure that plans cover all public contracts. Also, the ARMP is benefiting
from the GIZ support (about $130k) to develop the functional and technical requirements of e-
Procurement portal, which is expected to be operational in several years, as a part of the future
GFMIS platform.

64.    PDO 6, a “decrease in the single source contracting in public procurement”, was
achieved beyond its target. According to national procurement statistics from 2013 reported by
the Regulatory Agency for Public Procurement, single source contracting as percentage of total
lowered from 6% to 2.11%, demonstrating a clear improvement in the period following public
procurement reforms supported by PRECASP.

65.         In addition, this component achieved the following noteworthy results:

      (i)      Population and Habitat Census (RGPH)
               Thanks to additional support provided by PRECASP through project restructuring in
               2012, the Population and Habitat Census was successfully completed in spring 2013.

           Authorities made provisional results available in spring 2013 and published the final
           results in July 2014, reporting a population of 3,537,368. This represents the first time
           that demographic and socio-economic statistics have been updated in five years, and
           is thus critical for the development of the country.
   (ii)    Improved Coordination around PFM reform agendas
           The Ministry of Finance prepared a holistic PFM reform master plan for the priority
           actions, including identification of financing gaps, and approved it in 2011. A first
           round table was organized on December 10, 2013, marking the beginning of
           significant improvements in coordination between the government and development
           partners around the PFM agenda. In addition, a coordination unit for monitoring and
           evaluation was established in April 2014 with PRECASP support.
   (iii)   Step forward to E-government
           The restructuring in March 2012 made room in the project for support to the
           development of an integrated information system. This included the establishment of
           an electronic archive system to save critical documents such as minutes of ministerial
           meetings, legal documents, and policy statements. This new priority paved a way for
           establishing an electronic system in the government to manage and rationalize the use
           of public records.

COMPONENT B

Rating: Satisfactory (S)

66.      The objective of this component was to support the implementation of reforms
aimed at increasing decentralization and de-concentration. The project achieved all of the
intermediate indicators under this component. In particular, it contributed to strengthening basic
skills and knowledge of 160 officials working at the Ministry of Interior and Decentralization on
a number of subjects, including decentralization of municipalities, the establishment of basic data
on local finances, and the development of local development plans. According to interviews
conducted during the ICR mission, training provided by PRECASP was essential to strengthening
the basic skills of officials in the areas of fiscal decentralization and administrative management.
This component also resulted in collection of basic data on local finances and drafting of a local
development plan as part of the reform of territorial administration. Overall, the component
successfully achieved its goals by developing local capacity through training and by providing
support to local development plans. The new Bank project, Local Government Development
Program (P127543), was approved in June 2013 and takes over these efforts.

COMPONENT C

Rating: Satisfactory (S)

67.    The objective of this component was to integrate environmental policy into the state
development program. The component achieved all of its indicators, and environmental issues
have been fully integrated into government policy through the creation of a Ministry and the
development of a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) for the first time in the history of
Mauritania.

68.     The project successfully supported the integration of environmental issues into
government policy, created a dedicated structure for environmental management and
developed capacity to implement environmental policy in the country. The project supported
the adoption of the country’s first NEAP (2007-2011), the creation of a new Ministry, and the
rehabilitation of a building to serve as the Ministry headquarters. The project also financed the


                                                19
revision of the NEAP for a second phase (2012-2016). In addition, the project contributed to the
preparation of a green growth study and a concept note for a clean energy program. More
importantly, the project built capacity of staff at the Ministry of Environment. This capacity
building included a comprehensive training program focused on NEAP implementation and
training on how to conduct environmental assessments to accompany public investment projects.
The implementation of this component encountered several delays due to a lack of clarity on the
activities originally outlined in the PAD, which resulted in frequent changes during the course of
the project. While the integration of environmental issues into policy priorities has been
successfully achieved, a remaining challenge is to ensure strong execution of the NEAP.

COMPONENT D

Rating: Satisfactory (S)

69.     The objective of this component was to improve human resources management in
the public administration. Under this component, the project supported the HR reform process
including support for the census, cleaning HR records, and supporting reconciliation between the
payroll/pension data and HR records. The component also contributed to strengthening capacity
of staff for HRM in the Ministry of Public Service, and developed the first Integrated Human
Resource Management system in the country. New legislation on special status of specific
services, such as Customs and Justice, and their related salary scales was drafted with support of
this component, though this legislation has yet to be adopted 8.

70.     PDO 4 on “improvement of public human resources management” (HRM) was
achieved. The project provided support for a series of activities, in a coherent manner, for
establishing a sound HRM system in Mauritania such as the census of public servants, cleanup
and reconciliation of various datasets for payroll, pension and HR records, and capacity building
for HR management staff in the Ministry of Public Service. As a last step, the integrated HRM IT
system was established in March 2014, allowing for HR records as well as payroll and pension
data on all permanent public servants staff to be effectively captured.

71.      This component produced the critical achievement of cleaning HR records and
strengthening basic capacity to manage the public human resources. Despite some delays in
the course of implementation, HR records were fine-tuned and irregularities such as ghost
workers, double dippers and the diseased (approximately 8,000 irregular cases) were identified
and are in the process of being regularized through 2010. As a result of a series of “clean-up”
processes, the high wage bill was reduced from 10.2% of GDP in 2009 to 8.8% in 2010 and
further to 8.0% in 2011 9. In particular, the establishment of the integrated HRM system is an
important achievement of this project, with operationalization of the system projected for the end
of 2014. The system will allow more streamlined management of civil servants’ careers from
recruitment through retirement, including performance management and supporting a move
towards a performance-based administration. It will also serve as a strategic tool in ongoing
efforts to restructure the public administration, and allow for forecasting of the public sector size
and wage bill. As stated by some stakeholders during the ICR mission, this is an important
contribution to effectiveness in the public sector. The challenge will be to maintain integrity of

officials, which is not included in the HRM system.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

72.     While the project did not include a cost-benefit analysis at the concept stage, it
resulted in high-return, in particular in terms of increase in tax revenue and reduction of
the wage bill. While it is difficult to quantify the direct and indirect financial, economic, and
social benefits arising from capacity-building and institutional reform interventions, positive
correlation between supported inputs and outcomes can be observed. For instance, a significant
increase in tax revenue (an increase of 85.46 Billion Ouguiya or 28.2 million USD in two years)
was seen as a result of the fiscal census, which had been supported by the project at a cost of
US$185,784. By eliminating 8,000 irregular human resources cases through the census in 2008
and through reconciliation of different datasets in 2009, the high wage bill was significantly
reduced from 10.2% of GDP in 2009 by 8.8% in 2010, and further 8.0% in 2011, with an
investment cost of less than US$500,000.

73.      Despite the fact that both the implementation period and supervision budget
doubled, due in large part to the adverse effect10 of fragile country context that impacted
project implementation efficiency, the project’s achievements more than make up for this
expanded time and cost. The original project period was extended from 3 to 7 years. This is
due in part to underestimated project length at entry for such a complex project design, and in
part to significant political instability from 2007 to 2009 that resulted in suspension of all Bank
activities in Mauritania during the period of August 2008 – September 2009. As a result,
originally planned to be US$ 970,000, or 7.4% of total budget, at closure in March 2014 the
implementation budget totaled US$1,810,070, or 12.8% of the total project budget. This is in line
with a similar public sector project, the Burundi Multi-sector Capacity Building project
(P978627), which ran for eight years and spent 13% of its total budget on supervision. Similarly,
supervision costs more than doubled. Supervision costs were projected at approval to be
$300,000 for the project life of 3 years (with closure in December 2009), and at closure in 2014
the project had spent $732,124. Given the length of overall extension and the identified need for
strong oversight in the final phase given lagging performance and slow disbursement, this figure
seems to be reasonable, particularly when taking into account the outstanding achievements of
the project at closure (See Table 5).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory (S)

74.     Despite suspension of Bank operations for over a year, and implementation delays,
the project achieved all critical objectives. The project achieved 5.5 out of 6 PDO indicators
and 11.5 out of 13 intermediate indicators. Some indicators, such as improvement in tax
collection and reducing the rate of single source contracting, even surpassed the targets that were
set. Despite the challenging context and substantial delays, the project can be considered
satisfactory in terms of achievements of objectives.

75.     Discussions with counterparts and beneficiaries during the ICR mission highlighted
a strong connection between the PRECASP-supported achievements and perceived
improvements in the efficient use of public resources. One example of success is the
establishment and use of the HRM system, which will manage HR matters from recruitment
through retirement for the entirety of the Civil Service. While it is difficult if not impossible to
establish a reasonable counterfactual for a technical assistance project like PRECASP, feedback
from the ICR mission suggests that the project was instrumental in allowing the government to
advance on some significant areas of HRM and PFM.

76.     The Draft PEFA evaluation for 2014 reports that Mauritania has made considerable
progress since 2008 and much of this progress is attributable to PRECASP. As mentioned in
the section on Component A, the implementation of PFM reforms and establishment of public
financial information systems were supported notably by PRECASP. The main challenge going
forward will be the consolidation of these achievements with a view of establishing long-term
sustainability of the reforms.

77.    The objectives of the project are still relevant for the country and the strong
ownership of and momentum for reform in the Government of Mauritania remain today.
Despite the long project life, the objectives of the project remain relevant for the current context
in Mauritania and the follow-up to PRECASP should build on its achievements. The fact that
government requested a follow-up project before PRECASP support came to a close is testimony
of growing ownership among high-level officials of the reform agenda supported by PRECASP.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not Applicable

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

78.     Given the nature and focus of the project, its overall success, and the positive
feedback from stakeholders about its impact and effectiveness, the project clearly
contributed to institutional strengthening. Stakeholders reported that activities supported by
Component A of the project served to revise existing resource management systems, which will
be developed further by the follow-up project in an integrated manner, and to improve the skills
of officials. Also, Component B supported trainings to develop basic but crucial skills for
personnel working to advance the decentralization process.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

79.      Vague design of project activities appears to have led to the project being used as a
flexible financing facility for many unrelated priority areas. At the 2012 restructuring,
activities were revised in order to respond to changing and shifting reform priorities. Although
this did help the project focus on higher-value activities, it meant that government stakeholders
began to see PRECASP as a pool of convenient funding rather than a thematically structured,
dedicated project fund. The post-2012 phase saw many requests for funding that, while
addressing important priorities within the government, fell outside of the project’s original PDOs.

80.    The rehabilitation of a building for the Ministry of Environment in the project
created unintended adverse effects. Such a large-scale activity raised procurement concerns and


                                                22
required intensive project oversight to ensure effective time management. This aspect of the
project was further complicated by modifications to the building plan that were requested by the
Ministry of the Environment. The management burden for this activity was very heavy for the
PCU, and this overshadowed PCU engagement in other areas of project implementation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

81.       The main risks to the Development Outcome are:

       i. Country context: political and institutional fragility slowed down implementation of the
          project and continue to be a major risk in the country.

      ii. Government commitment: government commitment, which is a key for advancing public
          sector reforms, was not steady during the implementation of PRECASP and risks to
          remain weak.

   iii. High turnover in the administration: changes in the administration occurred frequently
        during the life of the project and resulted in weak communication about implementation.
        This risk remains high.

      iv. Change management: Weak inter-ministerial communication, resistance to change and
          lack of ownership are considered to be continuing potential risks in the context of the
          country.

82.     The successor of PRECASP should prioritize development of appropriate mitigation
measures. The team designing PRECASP’s successor operation is aware of the risks in the
country and the challenges PRECASP encountered during implementation. For instance, the
successor project will include capacity building for change management and measures to ensure
strong engagement with government stakeholders from the outset.

83.     Nevertheless, continued risks to the Development Outcome are considered
substantial due to the persisting fragile context and unpredictable government commitment.
Mitigating this risk, will require significant engagement from the Bank side to ensure adequate
supervision and to maintain structured flexibility during the implementation of the PRECASP’s
successor.

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

84.     The project suffered from a number of design flaws that affected project
implementation and performance. The Results Framework and M&E section in the PAD were
lacking important details and there was not clear connection between activities, outputs and
outcomes. This made it difficult to clearly attribute all the results observed to the activities of the
project. Also, the case to include a component on environment in the project was not explained,
and this disconnect led to confusion during implementation. While implementation delays were
not only due to design flaws, it was one of the causes for slowing down implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately satisfactory (MS)

85.     The quality of supervision varied over the course of the project. The first two phases
of implementation were characterized by light supervision and adaptation to changes in the
government (2006-2012). The third phase (2012-2014), which focused heavily on
implementation and disbursement, took on a more proactive and hands-on approach, including 7
missions between February 2013 and March 2014. Project performance improved significantly
during the third phase of implementation, suggesting that strong supervision contributes to higher
performance.

86.     The Bank approach during 2006-2012 was more reactive than proactive. According
to the 3rd ISR, “the project is still […] hesitating about what to do and how to do it, regarding
certain components”. Even though many changes in the government made it difficult for the Bank
to strongly engage with them, and despite the recommendations in several ISRs between 2009
and 2011 for the restructuring of the project, restructuring did not occur until March 2012.

87.     The ISR ratings given during the first two phases of the project were too optimistic
for the actual performance during this period. Project performance in terms of disbursement
and achievement of outcomes was low until 2011, but the ISR ratings in the first two phases were
satisfactory and moderately satisfactory. 11 ISR narratives were not fully backed up by project
progress data or strong measurement of results in the context of the project results framework12.
Interestingly, during these first two phases of implementation, reviews conducted by the Bank
showed a more optimistic outlook than that presented in reports produced by the PCU. If lower
and more realistic ratings were given at the time, this would have revealed a more accurate
picture of implementation performance and could have alerted both the Bank team and the
government beneficiaries of the need to invest more heavily in problem solving and to more
closely track implementation progress.



11
   Ratings of unsatisfactory and moderately unsatisfactory were given during the period of suspension of activity
following the military coup.

   For instance, in the second ISR there is no data on current indicators and in ninth ISR there is no baseline data or
targets in the Results Monitoring Framework section.

88.     The third phase of the project (mid 2012-2014) was characterized by a more
dynamic and hands-on approach. In light of lagging performance, the Bank team began to take
measures to speed up implementation. These included initiating intensive supervision, close
follow-up with the project committee, and re-launching activities that were at the time inactive.
The Bank team was strengthened to include an IT expert for PFM IT related activities, a
construction expert to assist with the rehabilitation of the Ministry of Environment, and a M&E
specialist for the whole project. Over the course of a year and half, the disbursement rate went
from 55% at the end of phase 2 to 95% at project closure. During the ICR mission, one
stakeholder noted that this intense Bank engagement was essential to the successful achievements
in Phase 3, citing the Bank’s proactive follow up on PFM IT contracts.

89.     Engaged supervision and high disbursement rate are strongly correlated. Table 7
below illustrates the interrelation between disbursement rate and number of supervision missions.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

90.     Despite some design flaws and the continuing challenge of operating in a fragile
environment, the Bank team performed strongly in the 3rd phase of the project, which
allowed the project to achieve its objectives. Quality of supervision was weak during phases 1
and 2, but was re-prioritized in phase 3 which resulted in a resurgence of both PCU and
beneficiary activity. Overall the Bank struck a balance between responding to changing priorities
in the government and ensuring strong support to disbursement and attention to project results.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

91.       The two main bodies in the planned institutional architecture, the Inter-Ministerial


                                                 25
Committee (IMC) and Project Steering Committee (PST), did not appear to play a strong
role in driving results. Despite the strong strategic role foreseen for the IMC, it met only twice
in 7 years as opposed to the quarterly meetings planned in the project agreement. The PST also
met only twice in 2012 and 2013 instead of on a quarterly basis and did not appear to play the
oversight role for which it was originally designed. For instance, in April 2013, the PST made a
decision to transfer funds from Component A to Component D without any concrete planning for
new activities.

92.      Government commitment to the project was unsteady until 2011, mainly because of
frequent changes in the administration that resulted from unstable political conditions
(Table 3). While it is difficult to assess the overall government commitment during the life of the
project, there are some indications that the government was not “in the driver’s seat”. Between
2006-2011, there were a number of factors that impacted project implementation and
performance, including transition to a new government in 2007, a military coup in 2008, and
frequent cabinet reshuffles through 2011. These factors directly affected the institutional
architecture through which the project was meant to be implemented. In addition, these changes
made it even harder for many stakeholders to remain engaged in the sensitive reform agenda such
as strategic fiscal planning, establishment of the innovative PFM systems and civil service reform.

93.      The government, however, showed increased ownership and commitment to the
project in 2012, which accelerated implementation in late 2012. When the Bank supervision
mission visited the country in February 2013, the Government responded by stepping up their
activities within the reform agenda, particularly in the areas of PFM and HRM reform. The
government’s commitment in the last phase of the project was an essential factor in the results
that were achieved during this period. During the ICR mission many government stakeholders
expressed appreciation for the results of PRECASP as well as the momentum created around
some reforms at the later stage of the project. There is for example a strong indication that the
government is committed, for the first time, to creating an integrated financial information system
with the aim of optimizing public resources. The Bank team will seek to follow-up on this
renewed engagement during the successor project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

94.     Division of responsibility for the project between two ministries and the resulting
distortion within institutional arrangements affected implementation and performance of
the project. The Ministry of Public Service was the leading institution for the project committee
and was responsible for signing all the project contracts, while the Ministry of Finance was the
largest beneficiary in terms of financial volume. By anchoring the project in a ministry that was
not playing the leading role in driving the reforms that the project directly supported resulted in
creating distorted perceptions of leadership surrounding the project and complicated project
implementation, causing delays.

95.     According to ISRs, mission reports and the government ICR, it is clear that the PCU
played an important and overall effective role in ensuring proper monitoring of the project
and providing strong reporting oversight. The 8th ISR (2011) describes the PCU as an
efficient team that is conversant with Bank practices. The PCU satisfactorily met its
disbursement, procurement and fiduciary obligations. Despite some staff changes, the PIU
remained well effective throughout the lifetime of the Project.

96.    However, interaction between the PCU and the designated Focal Points within the


                                                26
government seemed, at times, to be inactive. The role of the Focal Points was to ensure clear
liaison between the PCU and the administration in order to allow for the easy aggregation of
demands from the many beneficiaries in the administration and to inform structured and relevant
action plans. However, many stakeholders witnessed the lack of technical expertise of some focal
points, which affected the quality of the work of government departments, and weak interaction
between PCU and focal points in the administration. Information sharing within the ministries
was not fluid, and confusion existed within the ministries about the details of project activities.
From the PCU perspective, coordinating 5 ministries simultaneously while operating with a small
number of staff was a major challenge that affected its performance.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

97.     Government commitment and motivation fluctuated during project life, mainly due
to the unstable country context, but the project saw a resurgence of government
engagement in early 2013. The guidance provided by the PST and the IMT were not in line with
expectations during design, and changes in the government meant that ministry engagement was
constantly shifting. Interest in achieving results and commitment to the reform agenda
significantly increased, however, during the third phase of implementation.

98.    The PCU played a strong role in ensuring proper monitoring of project activities,
but coordination with government Focal Points was a weak point. PCU reporting and
monitoring tasks were diligently performed during the life of the project, despite sometimes weak
communication with beneficiary ministries, which did negatively affect implementation.


6. Lessons Learned

94.      Analysis of public sector reform efforts in a politically fragile context like
Mauritania raises important lessons about how to best design and implement effective
projects and how to effectively engage with the government in such a context. Many similar
first generation public sector capacity building and TA projects appear to have common problems
such as flaws in Quality at Entry and encountered difficulties at the implementation stage, from
which both government and the Bank are to learn. Some key lessons drawn from the history of
PRECASP could be useful for developing public sector reform projects in fragile environments in
the future.

95.     Fragile contexts call for careful scrutiny of project design, taking into account
political economy factors and low existing capacity. The design of PRECASP, which included
5 components and 5 ministries, appears to have been too complex to implement in a country with
low capacity and a fragile context. The complexity of the initial design created enormous
challenges and obstacles in terms of project implementation and management, as well as with
regards to coordination amongst beneficiaries. Although the PAD did recognize that the political
situation in the country might deteriorate, a posteriori the project procedures do not seem to have
been flexible enough to respond to new circumstances. When designing a multi-sectoral public
sector project in a fragile context, the Bank should take into consideration several important
lessons, including: (i) developing simpler and focused project structures with fewer beneficiary
and fewer components all related to public sector, to achieve tangible results; (ii) understanding
the political economy of the country, which will enable the team designing the project to develop
more appropriate implementation arrangements; (iii) creating incentives for government buy-in;


                                                27
(iv) developing flexible implementation arrangements depending on political economy
considerations; and (vi) considering the appropriate timeframe to implement the project.

96.     A strong focus on M&E should be established from the concept stage and extend
throughout the life of the project. PRECASP did not have a robust M&E framework with clear
M&E arrangements, and this affected both performance and performance monitoring. In absence
of a clear baseline, targets, and verifiable indicators, it became difficult to measure progress,
identify and remove bottlenecks, and take corrective measures. Therefore, the results framework
should be prepared with greater caution focusing on realistic outcomes and indicators, ensuring
links between activities, outputs and outcomes. Therefore, it is advisable for the Bank to involve
M&E support not only at the design stage but also throughout implementation. It is also
recommended to explore the possibility of simplifying the internal restructuring procedure to
modify the results framework when needed so that teams can be flexibly adaptive to the
circumstances of implementation.

97.      Clear and simple implementation arrangements are essential to smooth
implementation during the life of a project and to the eventual achievement of project
objectives. PRECASP encountered a number of problems during the implementation due to
distortion of implementation architecture. When designing institutional arrangements, it is
advisable to: (i) clarify the roles of each institution involved in the project; (ii) clearly define the
role of the PCU and the project steering committee, and ensure the competitive, transparent and
meritocratic selection process for project management staff; (iii) anchor the project in a Ministry
that will play a leading role in the concerned reforms; and (iv) ensure during implementation that
communication channels among the stakeholders are active. It is also noted that analytical work
such as a political economy (PE) study can serve to better inform the Bank team of the many
factors such as the complex political, economic and social environment, enable deeper analysis of
institutional risks, and help identify key players in the government. It also helps to better design
implementation arrangement and avoid any associated risks.

98.      In light of a strong correlation between achievement of results and close supervision
and monitoring, it is recommended that robust supervision arrangements be included in
projects from the design stage. The history of PRECASP shows that conducting project
supervision once or twice a year may not be enough in a fragile context. Results achievement and
disbursement rates remained low in the first two phases of the PRECASP, when supervision
missions were not frequent but subsequent strong engagement by the PCU and close supervision
by the Bank contributed to accelerating disbursement rates and stronger achievement of project
objectives in the third phase of the project. Furthermore, the field presence of two public sector
specialists in the country and in the region (Senegal) since 2012 helped to strengthen policy
dialogues with the counterparts and allowed more frequent hands-on support through intensified
supervision. For FY 2013, additional corporate budget was provided to the task team in response
to their request, allowing the team to increase the frequency of supervision and expand the team
to include expertise identified as necessary. This resulted in a significant boost to project
performance. In a fragile context, it is advisable to: (i) provide flexible support tools, including
human resources and budget, to the task team in order to strengthen efforts for supervision when
necessary; (ii) flexibly form a supervision team comprised of technical specialists as well as a
M&E specialist in response to the needs that arise in the course of implementation, allowing the
team to adapt to implementation circumstances. Furthermore, this experience shows that it would
be worth considering institutionalizing the design of supervision arrangements in future projects,
in order to avoid dependence on the discretion of the TTL over allocation of budget for
supervision.




                                                  28
99.     Government needs to be engaged and to assume a high level of responsibility and
ownership during project design and implementation. Government commitment picked up
mostly during the last phase of PRECASP implementation, and significant increase in results
achievement followed. There is a clear synergy effect between increase in supervision and
monitoring efforts by the Bank and engagement of the government in the project. As the Bank
faces new budget constraints, it becomes extremely important to identify other ways to ensure
government commitment and motivation, such as better using IT solutions including video- and
audio-conferencing, or hiring a resident specialist as a Short Term Consultant and delegating to
this individual, to some extent, a mandate to strengthen the team’s liaison with counterparts. In
addition, project design can seek to embed incentive mechanisms within the project activities to
maintain the buy-in of high-level officials.

100. Changes in the project management team can have significant and negative
consequences for project implementation. The several changes of staff, in particular TTLs (five
overall), over the life of the project created delays in the implementation of the project. This was
identified by past TTLs during ICR interviews as a significant cause of delay. As this remains a
common problem, it is encouraged to minimize such changes and seek to ensure a smoother
transition of TTLs and staff working on a project if the change is unavoidable.

101. The Bank should seek to facilitate coordination among donors engaged in public
sector reform. While there had been a thematic coordination group on PFM that had
participation of all concerned financial and technical partners, this group remained inactive for a
long period during the life of the project. The group was recently revitalized only when a PFM
reform master plan was approved and a coordination unit was created within the Ministry of
Finance in April 2013. As one of the leading donors on public sector, the Bank should use its
leverage to bring donors together to discuss PFM issues, to develop a strategy, and to support its
implementation, with an aim to maximize the effect of financial and technical support throughout
the life of a project.

102. Addressing change management is a key success factor for public sector reform
projects. Adaptive challenges must be seen alongside technical challenges when outlining
obstacles to the implementation of a reform program. As the ICR mission confirmed, the
innovation and changes introduced by PRECASP frequently encountered resistance to change.
The project also experienced problems related to lack of coordination and communication among
government stakeholders, such as the case of interconnection between the Central Bank and the
Treasury. While a project may offer technical solutions to specific problems by using good
practice examples, a change management strategy and problem-solving approach based on the
principles of empowerment, integration and collaboration among various stakeholders must not
be left aside. The PRECASP experience draws an important lesson that strong ownership and the
proactive treatment of adaptive challenges are keys to success for a public sector reform project.

103. Knowledge management is essential for improving project monitoring and ensuring
appropriate coordination between project stakeholders. PRECASP implementation history is
long, and the project supported many activities and achieved critical objectives. However,
information on all the activities and outputs produced by the project was not archived in a unique
platform, complicating the ease of consultation. In 2013 the Bank TTL hired a M&E expert to
undertake a stocktaking exercise to gather data on results and activities, which raised an
important question on how the Bank and the PCU should better monitor the project and
continually catalogue all the information produced by the project to enable constant monitoring
and use of this information. A knowledge management platform that can organize, analyze and
share all the information produced by the project could be designed as part of the implementation



                                                29
component from the outset. This would enable more systematic data collection and stronger focus
on stakeholder use of implementation data.

104. As a way of laying groundwork to be able to gather data and produce evidence-
based results assessments, it may be worth investing in ex-ante cost-benefit analysis at the
preparation stage of public sector capacity building TA projects. While PRECASP did not
carry out a cost benefit analysis, it is clear in evaluation that the country benefited from high-
return from the project in terms of the significant increase in tax revenue and the reduction in the
high wage bill with only relatively inexpensive inputs. With an increased demand for cost-
benefit assessments in order to more clearly articulate the strategic rationale for public sector
projects and PFM reform, with given the lack of precedent within the Governance Global Practice
of carrying out such ex-ante assessments during project preparation, it may be beneficial to
develop a methodology for cost-benefit analyses for public sector capacity building TA projects.

105. There are a number of lessons to learn from PRECASP on how to develop and
strengthen PFM systems in fragile countries. When developing PFM systems in a fragile
context, the most important lessons from PRECASP are the following: (i) to support or develop a
government strategy for PFM reform; (ii) to design the project by articulating how project
activities will contribute to strengthening PEFA components and to establish the Result
Framework with a clear link between activities and the PEFA components and indicators to
which they contribute; (iii) to invest in training and change management activities, when
introducing the new technology environment such as IFMIS so as to increase ownership of the
government and facilitate sustained use after the project’s closure.

106. Developing a concrete step-by-step strategy on IFMIS system is crucial in fragile
states. While PRECASP improved some of FMIS systems in the country and its achievements
are well recognized, the project did not invest enough resources in the necessary FMIS
prerequisites, such as budget classification and the necessary integration between FMIS systems.
It is advisable for the Bank to develop a sound strategy when developing IFMIS systems that
includes: (i) identifying the PFM reform needs of the government and the country context
conditions; (ii) developing customized solutions with the possibility to use of Rapid Results
Approaches when possible; and (iii) strengthening capacity for project implementation. The Bank
should also better clarify the link between PFM and service delivery improvements, as well as
publishing open budget data, when developing the strategy to design and implement IFMIS
systems.

Annex 2: Outputs by Component

Component 1: Improvement of Public Financial Management

This component included five sub-components: (i) strengthening of resource mobilization; (ii)
improvement of budget presentation and planning; (iii) improvement of budget execution and
accounting; (iv) strengthening of the efficiency of expenditure; and (v) strengthening of PFM at
the de-concentrated level in two regional capitals, Nouadhibou and Rosso.

Sub-component 1: Strengthening resource mobilization

There are three main achievements including: (i) enhanced tax management and control capacity
and system; (ii) strengthened customs system and management capacity; (iii) establishment of
land management system; and (iv) organization of the consultative group in Paris in December,
2007 to mobilize external resources.

   i.   Comprehensive support to Directorate General of Tax (DGI) to maximize tax
        collection efforts: This sub-component provided comprehensive support to DGI, which
        addressed strengthening administrative, tax collection and control capacity, properly
        registering taxpayers and developing the new tax administration system. The Tax
        Administration System (JIBAYA) as well as the Tax ID Numbers (NIF) were developed
        and put in place for the first time in the country. The Tax Code was updated and
        harmonized. A fiscal census was conducted in Nouakchott in 2011, with the aim to
        identify unregistered taxpayers, tax evasions, and leakage of tax collection. Following the
        census, 8,300 taxpayers in the formal sectors were properly registered with NIF. A fiscal
        procedures manual, an internal control manual, and an operational manual for DGI staff
        were prepared with support of this sub-component, and trainings on these manuals were
        held. Specialised training on the tax system in emerging sectors (mining, oil and
        telecommunications) was provided to 17 staff. The headquarter building of the DGI was
        rehabilitated and received IT and office equipment. Regional tax offices at Nouadhibou
        and Rosso were constructed and equipped with IT systems and office equipment.

   ii. Strengthened customs system and its management capacity: The IT department in the
       Directorate General of Customs (DGD) received training on Sydonia++/ORACLE system.
       The DGD also received IT and office equipment.

   iii. Establishment of Land Title Management System: A Land Title Management System
        (TEHLIL) was established, and 26,000 land titles were registered for the first time in the
        country. The team for this activity used the Rapid Results Approach, and developed a
        rapid workflow with deadlines set for each stage of the design and establishment of this
        system. The team used RRA to monitor implementation thoroughly, including
        development of the system, verification of land titles, elimination of the duplicated titles,
        and registration of the verified titles. As a result, despite its complex nature, this activity
        was successfully implemented within one year.

Sub-component 2: Improvement of budget presentation and planning

There are two main outputs: (i) preparation of global MTBF and sectoral MTBF; (ii)
establishment of the PFM reform coordination unit and strengthening of its reform monitoring
capacity.

   i.   Introduction of MTBF to budget planning and improvement of its predictability:
        Global Medium Term Budget Framework (MTBF) for 2008-2010 and seven sectoral


                                                 32
        MTBFs (education, health, transport, water management, urban development, petroleum
        and justice) were prepared for the first time in Mauritania with support from the project.
        The global MTBF for 2010-2013 was subsequently prepared with limited support from
        the project and the current version for 2013-2016, only with government own human and
        financial resources.

    ii. Establishment of the MTBF committee: The Committee, composed of staff who work
        both with MAED and the Ministry of Finance, is in charge of both MTBF and budget
        preparation to ensure that policy priorities are reflected in budget preparation. This
        approach contributed to enhancing the link between the two organizations, and improved
        predictability of the macro-framework. Still some disconnections appear between the
        policy framework and budget preparation process. These mainly result from (i) lack of
        established and clear procedure, (ii) lack of monitoring mechanism and capacity, (iii) lack
        of closer collaboration between the MAED and the Ministry of Finance, and (iv)
        potentially excessive political interference in budget preparation process.

    iii. Establishment of the PFM reform coordination unit and strengthening of its reform
         monitoring capacity: A PFM reform master plan was approved in 2011 and a
         coordination unit was subsequently established in April 2012. The project supported a
         start-up process that included staffing and equipment, and provided support to strengthen
         M&E capacity and communication about the reforms. The first roundtable on the review
         of PFM reform was organized in January 2014. The activity is still underway and has
         been taken over by the government using it’s own resources.

Sub-component 3: Improvement of budget execution and accounting

There are mainly five outputs: (i) revision of General Regulation of Public Accounting (RGCP);
(ii) development of payment module in the automated expenditure system (RACHAD) and its
interface with the Treasury information system (SITP); (iii) deployment of RACHAD in all
ministries; (iv) interface between Central Bank systems and Treasury for sending payment
instructions; (v) interoperability of the public financial systems; (vi) training across the Ministry
of Finance.
This sub-component supported all activities initially planned in the PAD, which addressed putting
in place the necessary IT systems (see Box 1), revision of the critical legal text governing PFM
reform aspect, strengthening human resources capacity.

Training for 68 MF and MAED staff was held, covering specific themes such as tax system in
emerging sectors, accounting, and prevention of fraud and embezzlement. In addition, a number
of staff received general administrative management training, including redaction of
administrative reports, French and Arabic language, and computer skills.

Challenges for improvement of the current systems and flows are listed as follows:

•   Existing PFM information systems are fragmented and not effectively used. There are
    multiple data sources, redundancies, lack of interfaces, low reliability and low quality of
    information.

•   Despite some investment into interoperability by the project, core budget preparation,
    execution (including commitment control, procurement, and cash management), accounting
    and reporting functions are not yet fully automated and integrated.




                                                 33
•    Performance of budget execution can be substantially improved with the introduction of fully
     automated treasury single account (TSA), electronic payments, and digital signature, together
     with necessary changes in legal/regulatory framework and institutional arrangements.

•    Transactional and historical PF data sets are not readily available (online) to relevant units for
     decision support, budget forecasting / planning, and internal/external audit.

           BOX 1: Core IT Budget Execution and Accounting Systems in Mauritania
1.        RACHAD: Payment Module in the Automated Expenditure System
RACHAD software has been in use since 2006 by the Budget Directorate (DGB) to manage the
allocation of budget resources and commitments, and the preparation of payment orders.
RACHAD is a commercial package developed by ST2I, Tunisia (http://www.st2i.com.tn), using
the Oracle RDBMS. Initial deployment of the RACHAD has been funded by PRECASP (about
$146k). This web-based system can be used by 250 concurrent users to manage current and
capital budget expenditures. The interface between RACHAD and the Central Bank (BSM) was
developed under another contract in 2011 ($99k). Although the new interface has improved the
speed of processing payments (check and cash), the total duration of payment processing remains
at around 3-5 days. This is expected to be improved during the implementation of the new project
with the introduction of electronic payment systems and TSA operations. The system is also
linked to Beite El Male for processing of payment orders.
2.        Beite El Male: Treasury Accounting System
Beite El Male software has been developed by a local consultant/firm in 2002, to automate
central government accounting and reporting functions. The Treasury Directorate (DGTCP) is
currently using this system to record all budget transactions by combining revenue/expenditure
data received from tax/customs and other entities. The software was developed using a
commercial platform (WinDev) and is based on MS SQL database. The team was informed that a
dispute that arose between the MoF and the software developer regarding the ownership of the
source code has been resolved, and the development of interfaces with other systems is in
progress (SITP, JIBAYA, SYDONIA, NOVA, TEHLIL, etc.).
3.        SITP: Treasury Information System
A system for Treasury information management, the SITP, was developed by a local firm in 2005
to support the monitoring of public expenditures with dynamic (daily) updates on the Treasury
web site. It also supports electronic filing for transaction documents (about 450,000) in the
Treasury archive (as PDF files). Interfaces with other PFM systems are expected to be developed
in Q4 2014. Other PFM entities will have read-only access to SITP records once these interfaces
are completed. SITP is a web-based locally developed software (LDSW) platform based on open
source solutions (Java, MySQL). Reports on budget revenues (including extractive industries)
and expenditures are being published on the Treasury web site regularly (www.tresor.mr).
Sub-component 4: Strengthening of the efficiency of expenditure

There are four major outputs: (i) Strengthening of control by the General Inspectorate of State
(IGE) and the Court of Accounts, (ii) Monitoring and Evaluation in MAED, (iii) Population and
Habitat Census, (iv) Public Procurement Reform:

     i.   Strengthening of control: The project mainly supported training on audit and
          financial control for staff and senior officials at the IGE and the Court of Accounts.
          Staff attended trainings in France (at ENA, the National Public Administration School,
          Mali Senegal and Tunisia, as well as a workshop for risk-based auditing in partnership
          with the World Bank in 2011.


                                                  34
   ii. Public Procurement Reform: As a result of the reform, public procurement is now
       being executed more transparently and in compliance with the adopted institutional
       procurement plans supported by the Project (PDO indicator 5). The regulatory agency, the
       seven sectoral procurement commissions and the control commission were established
       and are now operational with support from the project that included staffing, IT
       equipment and office equipment. The standard bidding documents, as well as a new
       operational manual, were prepared. The project supported the following three trainings
       from which 350 people were benefited: (i) strengthening of basic knowledge on the
       procurement code for the concerned authorities, (ii) dissemination of relevant legal
       documents to Small Medium Enterprises and private banks, and (iii) public procurement
       procedure, implementation, control and regulation training for concerned authorities.

   iii. Despite these areas of progress, the established institutions appear to be not fully
        functioning due to weak capacity. The procurement process itself remains complex and
        slow. Upon completion of a comprehensive evaluation of the current reform process, to
        be undertaken in the form of a Public Expenditure Review (PER), it is recommended to
        include continued support for the reform process and strengthening further capacity in the
        next project.

Sub-component 5: Strengthening of PFM at the de-concentrated level in two regional
capitals, Nouadhibou and Rosso

There are two major outputs: (i) capacity building of de-concentrated staff of MF in Nouadhobou
and Ross, (ii) rehabilitation and extension of the Tax and Treasury offices in Noudhibou and
Rosso and office and IT equipment were provided.

Others:

With additional support, the following outputs were produced:
   (i)    Population and Housing Census (RGPH)
          Thanks to additional support provided by PRECASP through project restructuring in
          2012, the Population and Habitat Census successfully completed in spring 2013.
          Authorities made provisional results available in spring 2013 and published the final
          results in July 2014 reporting a population of 3,537,368. The National Statistics
          Office (ONS) made strong efforts in gender consideration, providing job
          opportunities to 90 IT female operators. The census was critical for the development
          of the country as important data such as demographic and socio-economic statistics
          have been updated for the first time since five years.
   (ii)   Coordination around PFM reform agendas was improved in 2013
          The Ministry of Finance has identified all missing actions and financial gaps for the PFM
          reform master plan (Schema directeur de la reforme de la gestion des finances publiques)
          approved in 2011. A first round table was organized on December 10, 2013.
   (iii)  Completion of one part of the E-government project
          The E-government project was successfully completed. This activity aimed at introducing
          an electronic archive and records system in the government for critical documents such as
          minutes of ministerial meetings, legal documents, policy statements, etc. It also paved a
          way for establishing the platform for the electronic system in each ministry.


Component B: Local Development




                                                35
There are mainly two outputs in this component: (i) strengthening of the Ministry of the Interior
and Decentralization, and (ii) local development management in Nouadhibou and Rosso.

   i.     Strengthening of the Ministry of the Interior and Decentralization: This component
          provided technical assistance to strengthen basic knowledge on the decentralization
          process, provided training to increase the administrative skills of staff, provided office
          and IT equipment to ensure an adequate working environment at the Directorate of
          Territorial Administration (DAT) and the General Directorate of Local Governments
          (DGCL). In addition to administrative staff who received basic training related to general
          administrative management (redaction of reports, French and Arabic language, computer
          skills), 160 staff received technical trainings as indicated in Table 8. The database on
          municipal finance and the monitoring system on fiscal and budget management were
          developed and operational.

In 2013, regional workshops on the reorganization of territorial administration in each region
were held, with strong involvement of the local Governor (Wali). These workshops provided
comprehensive recommendations for follow up.

   i.     Local development management in Nouadhibou and Risso: The component financed the
          development of a Local Development Plan for Rosso and hinterland in coordination with
          the regional PRSP. Two Wilayas of Nouadhibou and Rosso benefited from
          comprehensive support to increase their organizational efficiency and staff management.
          This support included: (i) the institutional review of Wilayas, (ii) implementation of the
          adopted institutional reform plan, (iii) basic staff training. Two governors’ offices were
          renovated and provided with IT and office equipment.

Component C: Mainstreaming Environment in Development Policy

There are mainly four outputs in this component: (i) the creation of the Ministry of Environment
and rehabilitation of the Ministry’s building, and (ii) the adoption of a National Environmental
Action Plan, in two phases (2007-2011 and 2012-2016), (iii) capacity building for environmental
evaluation for 103 staff at the Ministry of Environment (see Table 9 below), and (iv) drafting of a
green growth study and establishment of a clean-energy program.

Component D: Improvement of HRM in public administration

This component included two sub-components: (i) support to HRM capacity creation in public
administration, (ii) modernization of administration tools.

Sub-component 1: HRM capacity creation in public administration

   •    Update the legal frameworks related to the civil service: This sub-component financed
        to draft 12 legislations related to civil service special status and its salary scale that were
        approved by the Superior Council of Public Service but not yet adopted.

   •    Capacity Building of staff at the Ministry of Public Service: Training was provided to
        46 staff across the ministry to strengthen knowledge on HRM and labor law, and skills to
        encourage social dialogue. Training particularly aimed at training trainers to ensure
        sustainability.

Sub-component 2: Modernization of administration tools

   •    Civil Service census and HR data reconciliation: This sub-component financed the
        civil service census in 2008, following which the reconciliation of dataset between
        payroll data, HR data and the result of census was completed in 2011. Approximately
        8,000 staff were identified as irregular cases in both databases (ghost workers, double
        dippers, those who should retire) and subsequently rectified in the HR system. A final
        count of 31,541 was recognized as the consolidated number in the final report by the
        technical commission for HR data reconciliation in April 2011. This was the major
        achievement of this component to better manage the wage bill and enable staff career
        management.

   •    Integrated HRM system: The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Civil Service has
        been operating three different systems (SIGPE for Human Resource Management;
        RATEB for Payroll; EL MAACH for Pensions) and managing about 22,000 pension
        (9,500 civil and 12,500 non-civil) and 37,000 payroll payments. A NOVA Portal, an
        integrated HRM system, was fully developed and is expected to be fully operational in
        Jan 2015 to replace existing platforms. NOVA will be one of the first applications hosted
        in the government Main Data Center (MDC) and supported by the DG ICT.

Building on the established new system and strengthened skills, the project has taken further steps
to implement the new HRM reform strategy approved in 2012, which aims to strengthen control
in the HRM by establishing the General Inspectorate for the Public Administration and to


                                                  37
introduce performance-based evaluation. The project financed the beginning of this process and
the government is continuing these efforts.

  The PEFA report underlines that for several of these indicators, a comparison between 2008 and 2014 is not
possible due to a change in the evaluation methodology. The PEFA 2014 is still in draft status and the ratings
are subject to changes.

Annex 4: Economic and Financial Analysis


As highlighted in the section on efficiency, the project at concept stage did not carry out a formal
cost-benefit analysis, as the project did not plan to finance investments with benefits quantifiable
in economic terms. However, it should be noted there was a high-return, in particular in terms of
increase in tax revenue and reduction of the wage bill. For instance, a significant increase in tax
revenue (an increase of 85.46 Billion Ouguiya or 28.2 million USD in 2 years) was seen as a
result of the fiscal census, which had been supported by the project at a cost of US$185,784. By
eliminating 8,000 irregular human resources cases through the census in 2008 and through
reconciliation of different datasets in 2009, the high wage bill was significantly reduced from
10.2% of GDP in 2009 by 8.8% in 2010, and further 8.0% in 2011, with an investment cost of
less than US$500,000.

In general, as the project improved the budget cycle, in particular, budget execution and public
procurement, it is expected that there will be financial and economic returns and benefits, through
an improved and more efficient public resources management for medium and long term.

Annex 8: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
The Bank team’s preliminary findings and lessons learned were shared at the end of the ICR
mission with the project stakeholders and the government in order to receive feedback. The
stakeholders expressed appreciation for the work of the Bank team and discussed preliminary
findings of the report, in particular: the important results of the project, the implementation
arrangements, the project anchorage, and the role of the project coordinator. The stakeholders
reaffirmed their interest and commitment in pursuing the collaboration with the World Bank in
subsequent projects.

The government of Mauritania prepared a final evaluation in March 2014. This served to inform
the finalization of the Bank’s ICR. The summary of the Government evaluation’s main lessons
learned and recommendations is provided below (in English) followed by the full text (in
French).

Main lessons learned and recommendations – Government of Mauritania ICR

1.       Overall, the performance of PRECASP was not helped by a context marked by two
periods of political transition, multiple reorganizations of the architecture of the government, the
suspension of disbursements for a year and several changes in the institutional anchoring,
national coordination and project team leaders of the World Bank (TTL). Furthermore, the fact
that the actions were not sufficiently specified in the PAD and it was up to the beneficiaries to
refine administrations has affected the pace of implementation of the project. This whole situation
was aggravated by lack of ownership in the operation, the overall lack of human resources and
institutional arrangements and coordination in operations.

2.      Notwithstanding the overall situation, the project had a positive impact on national policy
on good governance and capacity building. This is clearly visible through the main results of the
project. These satisfactory results are still fragile, and it is of utmost importance to sustain them.
However, it is important to note that that sustainability depends in large part on the country social
and political-institutional framework.

3.      The results of the project will be sustainable as long as there is an institutional
environment conducive to good governance in the country. In the context of the potential change
of status of Mauritania to a middle-income country, this dynamic needs to be supported by the
World Bank through a great and innovative public sector project. To avoid dispersion and
challenges in terms of coordination and implementation of activities, it would be appropriate to
focus this project on a limited number of strategic themes for which the institution has a
comparative advantage pronounced.

4.      This innovative project should capitalize the rich experience after many years of hard
work by the team of PRECASP and it could be an opportunity to address change management
issues and to focus more on knowledge management. These elements are at the heart of the
problems of the consolidation of national strategic planning and capacity building in the public
sector in the country.

Government of Mauritania’s ICR summary

INTRODUCTION GENERALE

1.      Le Gouvernement mauritanien a obtenu un financement de l’IDA pour la mise en œuvre
du Projet de Renforcement des Capacités du Secteur Public (PRECASP) afin d’aider le pays à
atteindre les ambitieux objectifs de développement qu’il s’est fixés, notamment dans le cadre du


                                                 45
quatrième axe du Cadre Stratégique de Lutte contre la Pauvreté (CSLP) ayant trait aux capacités
institutionnelles et à la bonne gouvernance.

2.      Plus précisément, le PRECASP a pour objet d’aider à mettre en œuvre des réformes
essentielles pour améliorer la performance, l’efficacité et la transparence de la gestion des
ressources publiques. Le présent rapport s’inscrit dans le cadre de la préparation de cette revue
pressentie pour mars 2014 et de la rédaction du rapport d’achèvement.

3.      Dans le prolongement de ces développements, le bilan de l’exécution financière du projet
est établi. Les questions liées à l’analyse des performances du projet, à l’action des parties
prenantes (Banque Mondiale, Gouvernement, Assistance technique) et aux perspectives pour la
pérennisation des acquis sont successivement abordées ensuite.

DESCRIPTION ET DEMARRAGE DU PROJET

A)      Contexte politique

4.     Le projet a été mis en place dans un contexte politique marqué le coup d’Etat du 03 août
2005 qui a porté au pouvoir un Comité Militaire pour la Justice et la Démocratie (CMJD). Ce
comité a annoncé que le Gouvernement allait se retirer dans un délai de 19 mois, après
l’approbation d’une nouvelle constitution et des élections présidentielles et parlementaires.

5.     Il a en outre, mis en place trois comités interministériels chargés de définir des feuilles de
routes dans trois domaines essentiels à savoir la transition politique, la justice et la bonne
gouvernance. Les rapports de ces trois comités ont été adoptés lors des journées nationales de
concertation organisées à Nouakchott en octobre de la même année.

6.       Relativement à la gouvernance économique, les actions destinées à affermir la réflexion
stratégique sur les politiques de développement, à améliorer la transparence des marchés publics
et à renforcer la coordination de l’aide extérieure occupent une place centrale. Elles s’articulent
avec d’autres mesures visant à développer les capacités de programmation et de suivi-évaluation,
à accroître la mobilisation des ressources publiques, à rénover la programmation, l’exécution et
le suivi des dépenses publiques, à affermir les structures de contrôle, à promouvoir la lutte contre
la corruption et toutes les autres formes de la délinquance économique et financière et à assainir
la situation du secteur des entreprises publiques.

7.      Pour ce qui est de la gouvernance environnementale, les actions proposées s’articulent
autour de la prise en compte de la variable environnementale dans les politiques et stratégies de
développement, de la mise en place des outils nécessaires à l’élaboration et à la mise en œuvre
d’une politique nationale de conservation des ressources forestières/zones humides, d’une part, et
de la gestion intégrée et efficace des déchets urbains et de la zone côtière et marine, d’autre part.

B) Situation économique et sociale

8.      Au cours des années 2001 – 2005, la croissance économique annuelle moyenne était de
l’ordre de 5% et les prévisions au titre de l’année 2006 étaient de 18.3% eu égard au démarrage
de l’exploitation pétrolière. Il était attendu que cette dernière devait permettre de tripler, à moyen
terme, le revenu par habitant dans un pays où, en 2004, environ une personne sur deux (46,7% de
la population) vivait dans la pauvreté. . C’est dans ce contexte que le pays a adhéré à l’Initiative
pour la Transparence des Industries Extractives (ITIE).




                                                 46
9.      Dans une économie d’une extrême sensibilité aux chocs exogènes sur le volume et le prix
de ses deux grands produits traditionnels d’exportation (le fer et le poisson), l’inflation qui était
de 12.3% en 2005 devait, selon les prévisions, régresser sensiblement pour s’établir 6% en 2006.

C) Situation et problèmes majeurs

10.     Dans le contexte politique, économique et social susmentionné, le pays faisait face, en
matière de gouvernance, à 4 défis majeurs :

    •   La gestion des finances publiques : le pays était confronté à des problèmes budgétaires
        importants dont la manifestation la plus visible fut la révélation de l’existence, avant 2004,
        d’importantes dépenses extrabudgétaires financées essentiellement par des crédits de la
        Banque Centrale (BCM). Ces problèmes budgétaires ne sont que l’un des résultats du
        système de gestion des finances publiques caractérisé depuis des décennies par la
        faiblesse des systèmes de comptabilité publique, des régies de recettes, de la
        programmation et de l’exécution du budget ;

    •   Le développement local confronté à la faiblesse de l’impact des réformes engagées depuis
        1986 eu égard, entre autres, aux moyens limités, à l’absence d’une véritable politique de
        déconcentration administrative et à la faiblesse des structures administratives en charge
        des collectivités locales et de l’administration territoriale ;

    •   La gestion rationnelle de l’environnement dans un pays à vocation désertique confronté à
        l’émergence de sérieux problèmes environnementaux dans les zones urbaines en
        expansion rapide et à des risques de pollution marine liés à l’exploitation offshore du
        pétrole ;

    •   La gestion des ressources humaines de l’Etat organisée sur un modèle ancien, centralisé et
        inadapté avec pour corollaire l’opacité et le laxisme et la perte de moyens substantiels à
        tous les niveaux.

D) Cadre institutionnel

11.    Le Projet est mis en œuvre par cinq ministères en charge des Finances, des Affaires
Economiques et Développement, de l’Intérieur, de l’Environnement et de la Fonction publique.
Dans sa conception initiale, la coordination de la mise en œuvre est exercée par les services du
Premier Ministre, en charge de l’exécution du programme de réforme au sein du Gouvernement.

Organisation et réalisation du projet (ministère de tutelle, autres ministères impliqués dans
l’exécution du projet).

12.    Depuis le démarrage des activités, l’ancrage institutionnel du projet et son cadre global
d’exécution ont connu un certain nombre de mutations qui n’ont pas été sans conséquences sur
les modalités pratiques de son travail et sur les résultats escomptés. Dans le cadre de ces
mutations, on peut retenir quatre étapes essentielles :

•   Première étape : L’architecture du projet, prévue par l’arrêté du Premier ministre n° R
    0357/PM du 13 avril 2006 et reprise dans le PAD, se compose de trois instances : le comité
    interministériel chargé de la coordination des réformes du secteur public, le comité de
    pilotage et l’unité de coordination.




                                                 47
•     Deuxième étape : Le dispositif institutionnel précité a été révisé par l’arrêté du Premier
      Ministre n° R 1987/PM du 31 août 2007 pour tenir compte de l’architecture du premier
      gouvernement post transition caractérisée par la fusion du ministère des affaires économiques
      et du développement et de celui des finances en un ministère de l’économie et des finances
      (MEF), la création d’un ministère de la fonction publique et de la modernisation de
      l’administration (MFPMA) auquel est désormais rattaché le PRECASP et d’un nouveau
      ministère de la décentralisation et de l’aménagement du territoire (MDAT).

•     Troisième étape : Par arrêté du Premier Ministre N° 3525 en date du 27 septembre 2009
      abrogeant l’arrêté N°1987 en date du 31 Août 2007, le dispositif institutionnel du projet a été
      modifié pour tenir compte d’une nouvelle réorganisation du gouvernement. Ainsi, la
      présidence du Comité Interministériel du PRECASP est désormais assurée par le Ministre
      Délégué auprès du Premier Ministre Chargé de la Modernisation de l’Administration et des
      Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication (MDPMMAPTIC). Il comprend
      désormais le Ministre de l’Intérieur et de la Décentralisation (MID), le MAED, le MF, le
      Ministre de la Fonction Publique (MFP) et le Ministre Délégué auprès du Premier Ministre
      Chargé de l’Environnement et du Développement Durable (MDPMEDD). La présidence du
      comité de pilotage et sa composition sont modifiées en conséquence.

•     Quatrième étape : Le dispositif institutionnel en vigueur actuellement est celui mis en place
      par l’arrêté 1378/PM abrogeant l’arrêté N° 3525 en date du 27 septembre 2009. Conçu pour
      tenir compte d’une nouvelle architecture gouvernementale, il est marqué par le rattachement
      du projet au Ministère de Fonction Publique, du Travail et de la Modernisation de
      l’Administration (MFPTMA). Le fonctionnement des organes d’orientation et de pilotage du
      projet est relativement satisfaisant (respect de la fréquence des réunions, établissement de
      procès – verbaux, taux de présence aux réunions de l’ordre de 100 %, pertinence de l’ordre de
      jour des réunions). Par ailleurs, les missions de supervision de l’IDA sont régulièrement
      organisées. En moyenne ces missions se faisaient tous les six mois. Après de 2011, elles
      étaient organisées trimestriellement.

13.      En somme, les modifications continues de l’architecture du gouvernement, notamment
des départements ministériels impliqués dans le projet (finances, affaires économiques et
développement, intérieur/décentralisation et environnement), couplés à celles de son ancrage
institutionnel ont imposé régulièrement, à toutes les structures intervenantes, des périodes plus ou
moins longues d’adaptation avec les conséquences qui en découlent en termes de retards dans la
définition et la mise en œuvre des activités programmées.

18.     Globalement le PRECASP sort avec un bilan positif en termes de préparation des
activités et d’avancement dans le processus de passation de marchés mais avec des retards
relativement importants pouvant aller jusqu’à une année et même plus sur la quasi-totalité des
dossiers. C’est ainsi que les activités ayant trait au recensement fiscal, au système
d’interopérabilité des finances publiques, au système de la gestion du fichier foncier, aux contrats
pour les différentes formations pour une enveloppe de plus de 700.000 USD et à la fourniture des
équipements et mobiliers de bureaux ont été achevées. Par ailleurs, les marchés des travaux
planifiés pour un million de dollars ont été exécutés et réceptionnés mis à part la réhabilitation du
MDEDD qui est en cours de finalisation.

LES PERFORMANCES DU PROJET

19.     Le degré d’atteinte des objectifs est apprécié à l’issue des résultats d’enquêtes auprès des
points focaux et ce conformément aux indicateurs élaborés dans le PAD. Un changement dans le
nombre et la qualité des indicateurs a été opéré suite à la demande de prolongation du PRECASP
en mars 2012.

20.     Ainsi, le nombre d’indicateurs d’impact globaux a été porté à six (au lieu de cinq
précédemment). Il s’agit de : (i) Le processus d’élaboration du budget au sein de l’administration
est amélioré ; (ii) l'exécution du budget est améliorée grâce à un processus de paiement plus
efficace au Trésor ; (iii) la perception des impôts est améliorée ; (iv) un pourcentage plus élevé de
fonctionnaires est effectivement contrôlé par le Ministère en charge de la Fonction publique ; (v)
Une plus grande proportion de marchés publics exécutés en conformité avec les plans de



                                                 49
passation des marchés institutionnels adoptés et (vi) Une baisse du pourcentage de contrats à
fournisseur unique

21.   Par ailleurs, le nombre des indicateurs intermédiaires s’est accru passant de 11 à 13. Par
composante, ces indicateurs sont les suivants :

   •   Composante A : (i) La DGI est équipée d’un système informatisé de gestion des
       ressources ; (ii) Nombre de ministères sectoriels utilisant effectivement le système
       RACHAD pour la gestion déconcentrée de leur budget ; (iii) Nombre de ministères pour
       lesquels les budgets ont été établis sur la base d’un CDMT (national et sectoriel) ; (iv) Le
       pays a effectivement évolué vers une généralisation de la comptabilité à partie double et
       (v) Le système de suivi - évaluation des performances des financements externes est en
       place.

   •   Composante B : Les opérations pilotes de Nouadhibou et Rosso sont en cours.

   •   Composante C : (i) Le PANE est approuvé par le Gouvernement ; (ii) La structure
       transversale recommandée par le PANE est effectivement en place et (iii) Nombre de
       ministères sectoriels disposant d’une structure en liaison avec la structure transversale.

   •   Composante D : (i) La nouvelle réglementation sur la gestion des ressources humaines est
       approuvée et en vigueur et (ii) Le nouveau système de gestion informatisée des ressources
       humaines de l’Etat est en place.

22.     Il ressort du dernier RSF (décembre 2013), et comme l’indique le tableau 4 suivant, que
pour les indicateurs précédemment cités, le pourcentage de ceux qui ont été atteints varie de 25%
pour la modernisation de l’administration à 100% pour le développement local et
l’environnement en passant par 70% pour l’importante composante des finances publiques. Le
pourcentage des indicateurs intermédiaires atteints           pour les finances publiques et la
modernisation de l’administration devrait être de 100% avant la fin du mois de mars (finalisation
en cours). La revue des indicateurs des résultats du projet (janvier 2014) a conclu que 4
indicateurs globaux sur 6, et 11 indicateurs intermédiaires sur 13 ont été atteints après 7 ans
d’exécution du projet. Les autres indicateurs sont liés à des activités en voie de finalisation.

23.     L’indicateur global sur l’amélioration de l’exécution du budget à travers la mise en place
de l’interfaçage entre le Trésor et la Banque Centrale a été atteint en janvier 2014, alors que les
deux autres indicateurs synthétiques restent à suivre, à savoir le pourcentage de fonctionnaires
contrôlés par le nouveau système intégral de la gestion de ressources humaines et la réduction du
taux de marchés gré à gré.

24.      De l’ensemble des développements précédents, il résulte que, malgré un environnement
institutionnel changeant et l’arrêt des décaissements pendant une année avec toutes les
conséquences qui en découlent, l’exécution du projet a atteint un niveau satisfaisant en termes de
taux de réalisation physique des activités et d’exécution financière. Cette situation d’ensemble
découle, entre autres, de la pertinence de la conception du projet, de la souplesse dans la
formulation du contenu et des objectifs des composantes (en tenant compte du niveau des
ressources, des capacités et du niveau d'engagement des différents acteurs), de la solidité du cadre
de suivi des résultats, du dynamisme de toutes les parties prenantes, notamment la cellule de
coordination, et de l’appui constant de la tutelle et des services techniques de la Banque
Mondiale.




                                                50
 ANALYSE DE L’ACTION DE LA BANQUE MONDIALE, DU GOUVERNEMENT ET
                   DE L’ASSISTANCE TECHNIQUE

25.     La Banque Mondiale a continuellement accordé une importance de premier plan à
l’exécution du projet qui occupe une place centrale dans sa politique d’appui au développement
économique et social du pays. Au – delà de sa mise en place au moment approprié (transition
politique, démarrage de l’exploitation pétrolière), cela s’est traduit concrètement à travers les
décisions de prolongement prises en 2009 et 2012 afin de permettre la poursuite des activités
dans de bonnes conditions et l’atteinte des objectifs escomptés.

26.     A cela s’ajoutent les décisions relatives à : (i) la désignation d’un Task Team Leader
(TTL) au niveau de la sous – région afin d’assurer pratiquement une plus grande proximité avec
les structures intervenantes et (ii) l’organisation concrète des missions de supervision. Depuis
2012, ces dernières sont désormais effectuées tous les trois mois (contre 6 mois auparavant) par
une équipe pluridisciplinaire en vue d’examiner simultanément, et en un court laps de temps, tous
les aspects afférents au fonctionnement du projet et de prendre les décisions nécessaires à cet
effet.

27.     A titre d’illustration, la dernière mission de supervision qui s’est déroulée du 19 au 23
janvier 2014 s’est particulièrement focalisée sur la revue de certains dossiers dans les phases
critiques de leur exécution (mise en place de systèmes informatiques pour la gestion des finances
publiques, appui à la réforme de la passation des marchés et réhabilitation des locaux du MEDD)
et a permis de les faire avancer sensiblement. Une dernière mission de supervision est
programmée du 16 au 20 mars 2014.

28.    Nonobstant l’ensemble des éléments précités, il importe de souligner que les changements
fréquents de TTL du projet (5 sur 7 ans) ont eu des incidences négatives sur son fonctionnement
eu égard aux délais d’adaptation et d’appropriation des dossiers qu’ils impliquent.

29.     L’une des décisions majeures du gouvernement ayant favorisé l’exécution du projet a été
la mise en place d’un comité interministériel chargé de la Coordination des Réformes du Secteur
Public en tant qu’instance d'orientation, d'impulsion et de suivi-évaluation des reformes du
secteur public dans lesquelles s'inscrit le PRECASP. Elle a permis, entre autres, à ce dernier une
plus grande insertion dans les processus de formulation, de mise en œuvre, de suivi et
d'évaluation des politiques publiques. A cela s’ajoute la création d’un comité de pilotage assurant,
sous l’autorité du comité interministériel, la supervision et le suivi de la mise en œuvre des
actions retenues.

30.    Par ailleurs, la réforme des marchés publics engagée par les pouvoirs publics après le
démarrage des activités du projet, et nonobstant les retards enregistrés consécutivement à la mise
en place des nouvelles structures de passation des marchés, a eu un impact positif sur son
exécution eu égard aux surplus de fluidité et de transparence générés. A ce niveau, il importe de
souligner que le projet avait longtemps souffert de la lourdeur et de l’inefficience des structures
de passation de marchés. Il s’agissait, en dehors de l’UCP, de 5 commissions départementales des
marchés d’inégale efficacité (malgré les efforts entrepris en termes de renforcement des
capacités) et de la Commission centrale des marches.

31.    En outre, l’exécution du projet a été favorisée par la mobilisation régulière par l’Etat des
fonds de contrepartie. Aucune difficulté particulière n’a été rencontrée en la matière.

32.     Au – delà de l’ensemble des éléments positifs précités, les modifications répétées de
l’environnement institutionnel et les changements de la coordination et des points focaux ont eu



                                                51
une incidence négative sur l’exécution du projet car elles ont imposé régulièrement, à toutes les
structures intervenantes, des périodes plus ou moins longues d’adaptation avec les conséquences
qui en découlent en termes de retards dans la mise en œuvre des activités programmées.

33.    Durant toute la durée de vie du projet, la qualité des relations entre la Banque Mondiale et
le Gouvernement a été appréciable. La Banque a toujours été au rendez- vous pour l’apport de
son assistance technique au niveau de la passation des marchés, du suivi-évaluation et de la
coordination et concertation avec les PTFs.

34.     Le dialogue entre la Banque Mondiale et le Gouvernement, notamment au cours des
rencontres semestrielles pour la revue du portefeuille, a permis de dépasser certaines contraintes
et de faciliter l’exécution et la prise de décisions au moment opportun.

Leçons essentielles

35.     Il ressort de l’examen minutieux de l’action du Gouvernement et de la Banque Mondiale
au cours de l’exécution du projet l’importance d’un certain nombre questions essentielles tant au
niveau de la conception que de l’exécution : (i) la définition précise des objectifs, leur caractère
mesurable et la solidité du cadre de suivi des activités (ii) la formulation des objectifs et des
composantes en prenant en compte le niveau des ressources, des capacités et du niveau
d'engagement des différents acteurs ; (iii) la souplesse en termes de programmation et
budgétisation ; (vi) le niveau d’appropriation par les structures en vue de garantir l’exécution et
la durabilité des actions ; (v) le respect du calendrier d’exécution afin d’assurer la mobilisation
permanente des parties prenantes et la crédibilité du projet ; (vi) le renforcement des capacités de
la cellule et ses partenaires d'exécution notamment en ce qui concerne les procédures de
décaissements et de passations de marchés ; (vii) la stabilité de l’ancrage institutionnel du projet
et des équipes internes et externes en charge de son exécution/supervision ; (viii) l’organisation
de missions de supervision rapprochées et pluridisciplinaires et (ix) un mécanisme de
concertation permanant (Etat, Banque mondiale, autres PTFs) dans le domaine d’intervention du
projet afin d’assurer un suivi et une synergie entre les différentes interventions

    PERSPECTIVES POUR LE FUTUR POUR LA PERENNISATION DES ACQUIS

36.     Globalement, l’exécution du PRECASP n’a pas été favorisée par un contexte marqué par
deux périodes de transition politique, de multiples réorganisations de l’architecture du
gouvernement, l’arrêt des décaissements pendant une année et plusieurs changements au niveau
de l’ancrage institutionnel, de la coordination nationale et du chef d’équipe projet de la Banque
mondiale (TTL).

37.     En outre, le fait que les actions à entreprendre n’étaient pas suffisamment précisées dans
le PAD et qu’il revenait aux administrations bénéficiaires de les affiner a eu des répercussions sur
le rythme de mise en œuvre du projet et a fait que la programmation effective des activités, à
l’occasion des missions de supervision ou d’échanges avec le bailleur de fonds, s’est écartée de
celle consignée dans le PAD. Cette situation d’ensemble a été amplifiée par les insuffisances
dans le montage et l’appropriation des opérations, la faiblesse globale des ressources humaines et
des dispositifs institutionnels et de la coordination au niveau des opérations engagées.

38.     Nonobstant ce situation d’ensemble, et comme l’ont montré les développements
précédents, le projet eu une incidence positive sur la politique nationale en matière de bonne
gouvernance et de renforcement des capacités. Cela est nettement perceptible à travers les
résultats suivants :




                                                52
    •   L’amélioration de l’exécution budgétaire à travers une liaison effective BCM - Trésor et
        l’établissement d’un module de paiement au niveau de ce dernier ;
    •   L’affermissement de la gestion du budget de l’Etat dans le prolongement des appuis
        apportés à la comptabilité publique et au système RACHAD ;
    •   Le renforcement des capacités de programmation budgétaire à la suite de l’établissement
        des CDMT 2008, 2012 et 2014 (en cours) ;
    •   La progression des recettes publiques consécutivement au recensement fiscal, au Système
        informatique de la Direction Générale des Impôts, à la formation et au renforcement de
        SYDONIA et du système de gestion foncière. Dans ce cadre, il faut souligner que dans le
        prolongement du recensement fiscal en 2012 qui a permis de saisir le nombre précis de
        contribuables, une augmentation des recettes fiscales de l’ordre de 135% a été
        enregistrée ;
    •   L’amélioration de la mobilisation des ressources financières et de l’aide extérieure
        consécutivement aux appuis apportés aux groupe consultatif et à la table ronde des
        partenaires au développement tenus respectivement à Bruxelles en 2008 et 2010 ;
    •   Le perfectionnement des conditions de travail grâce à la réhabilitation et la construction
        des locaux et la fourniture du matériel et mobilier de bureau ;
    •   L’amélioration de la gestion des ressources humaines de l’Etat suite au recensement des
        agents de l’Etat, à l’actualisation/modernisation de la législation et la mise en place d’un
        système de gestion intégré des ressources humaines ;
    •   Le renforcement des capacités des fonctionnaires et agents de l’Etat à travers
        l’organisation de sessions de formation et de perfectionnement ;
    •   La prise en compte de manière transversale de la problématique de l’environnement dans
        les politiques publiques ;
    •   La promotion du knowledge management (Mise en place d’une base de données sur le
        renforcement des capacités du secteur public).

39.     Ces résultats satisfaisants sont encore fragiles, et il est de la plus haute importance de les
pérenniser et de les développer. Or, le projet n’avait pas intégré le concept de pérennisation des
acquis dès le stade de la conception et, de ce fait, il n’a jamais été question de s’y appesantir au
cours des 7 dernières années.

40.     En laissant de coté cet aspect qui devrait prendre toute son importance dans la conception
et la mise en œuvre de projets futurs, il importe de ne pas perdre de vue que la pérennisation
dépend, en grande partie, du cadre social et politico-institutionnel qui la conditionne et la
normalise.

41.      De ce fait, la dynamique du projet devrait se maintenir grâce à l’environnement
institutionnel et politique national favorable à la bonne gouvernance dans toutes ses dimensions.

42.     Dans un contexte de réflexion sur le passage de la Mauritanie vers le statut de pays à
revenu intermédiaire et de multiples défis liés aux dysfonctionnements du processus global de
gouvernance, cette dynamique mérite, cependant, d’être soutenue par la Banque Mondiale à
travers un grand projet novateur surtout au moment où on assiste à l’émergence de nouvelles
opportunités de partenariats techniques et financiers en faveur, singulièrement, du renforcement
des capacités du secteur public.

43.     Afin d’éviter la dispersion et les difficultés en termes de coordination et d’exécution des
activités, il serait approprié de se focaliser dans ce projet sur un nombre réduit de thématiques
stratégiques pour lesquelles l’institution dispose d’un avantage comparatif prononcé.

44.      Le projet novateur susmentionné qui devrait capitaliser la riche expérience acquise   au
bout plusieurs années de travail intensif par l’équipe du PRECASP pourrait être l’occasion     de
s’atteler aux pratiques de conduite du changement et à la mise en place d’un dispositif        de
pérennisation des acquis des projets qui n’existe pas à l’heure actuelle. Ces éléments sont    au
cœur des problématiques de l’affermissement de la planification stratégique nationale et       du
renforcement des capacités du secteur public.
