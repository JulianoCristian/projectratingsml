                         This US$ 13-million Mauritania Public Sector Capacity Building Project (P082888) was approved by the Board on July 6, 2006 and became effective on January 16, 2007. Due to the
                         political situation, the Bank's activities were suspended for 15 months between August 2008 and October 2009. The Project has undergone several restructuring to date. The original
                         closing date of the project, December 31, 2009, was thereafter extended for two years to December 31, 2011, then to March 2012, and further extended for a third and final time to
                         March 29, 2014.

                         As part of the restructuring, the project development objective remained unchanged, but resources were further focused on the components Public Finance & Public Procurement,
                         Human Resources Management (HRM), Monitoring & Evaluation and implementation capacity.

                         The disbursement rate as of September 9, 2013 stands at 69.29% (against 85% of contracting rate). While certain inactive activities have been picked up and made positive progress
                         following three supervision missions in February, April and June 2013, the rate remains low considering the number of activities still to be completed before the closing date.

                         2 PDO indicators out of 6 and 8 intermediate indicators out of 14 achieved the targets after 7 years of implementation. Since a few indicators are not measurable or directly financed
                         by PRECASP, the team suggest to slightly readjust the measurements and/or indicators in the result framework through mini-restructuring, to precisely measure the impacts and
                         outcomes of the project.

                         Over the last 6 months, the team has focused particularly on assessment of all IT contracts related to establishment of different public financial management systems; (i) 3 big IT
                         contracts in total amount of 1.3 million USD are delayed on average at 12 months, and (ii) interconnection between Central Bank and Treasury has been completed but not
                         operational yet. The team has requested the government to review the implementation calendars and implement it accordingly.

                         Despite of efforts made by PIU to accelerate implementation of inactive activities over the last 9 months and to improve project management, given slowness in disbursement, weak
                         achievements and several contract management problems as aforementioned, the team concludes the project be downgraded from MS to MU.

                         The challenges of the project and implementation delays are due to (i) the broad variety of beneficiaries (5 ministries) which makes the coordination and project management difficult,
                         (ii) a long and complex national procurement process (duplications of roles in several commissions and frequent complaint cases), (iii) a limited level of monitoring by the project
                         committee (it was organized only twice in 2012, and one time so far in 2013 as opposed to the quarterly basis organization).

                         However, the team also noted tangible achievements of the project over the last 9 months including:

                         (1) Improvement of tax revenue
                         Following the fiscal census in 2012 that identified additional 2,500 taxpayers and improvement in the tax record management, tax revenue has increased by 136% in 2012 (184Mds in
                         2011 by 250Mds in 2012). First quarter of 2013 recorded further increase by 21% compared to the same period in 2012. The development of tax management system/application is in
                         a final stage but with 12 months of delays. The team urged PCU to review the implementation calendar and sign the amendment of contract.
                         (2) Population and Housing Census (RGPH)
                         Major data collection operations have been completed (sedentary and nomad populations). The provisional number that was presented at the council of ministers is 3.387.868
                         inhabitants. It was agreed with the Minister of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED) and the Statistics Office (ONS) to provide additional financing for data analysis, with

                         available budget under Component A.
                         (3) E-government project successfully completed
                         The mission assessed that E-government project was successfully completed. This activity aimed at introducing the electronic archive and records system in the government for the
                         critical documents such as minutes of ministerial meetings, legal documents, policy statements etc. It also paved a way to establish the platform for the electronic system in each
                         ministry.

                         Major remaining activities are: (i) support to the procurement reform based on the recent diagnostic work; (ii) support to tax administration; (iii) support to implementation of the PFM
                         master plan; (iv) support to the Green Growth Study; (v) interfacing the HR database and payroll system; and (vi) rehabilitation of a building of the Ministry of Environment.

                         To complete the remaining activities within the tight schedule, the pilot committee needs to be organized more frequently to assess the state of play of implementation, to discuss and

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The disbursement rate as of September 9, 2013 stands at 69.29% (against 85% of contracting rate). While certain inactive activities have been picked up and made positive progress
                         following three supervision missions in February, April and June 2013, the rate remains low considering the number of activities still to be completed before the closing date.

                         2 PDO indicators out of 6 and 8 intermediate indicators out of 14 achieved the targets after 7 years of implementation. Since a few indicators are not measurable or directly financed
                         by PRECASP, the team suggest to slightly readjust the measurements and/or indicators in the result framework through mini-restructuring, to precisely measure the impacts and
                         outcomes of the project.

                         Over the last 6 months, the team has focused particularly on assessment of all IT contracts related to establishment of different public financial management systems; (i) 3 big IT
                         contracts in total amount of 1.3 million USD are delayed on average at 12 months, and (ii) interconnection between Central Bank and Treasury has been completed but not
                         operational yet. The team has requested the government to review the implementation calendars and implement it accordingly.

                         Despite of efforts made by PIU to accelerate implementation of inactive activities over the last 9 months and to improve project management, given slowness in disbursement, weak
                         achievements and several contract management problems as aforementioned, the team concludes the project be downgraded from MS to MU.
