                         This project was approved by the Board on July 6, 2006 and became effective on January 16, 2007. Project implementation hascoincided with political and institutional instabilities
                         marked by the formation of a number of entirely new governments and otherfrequent changes in ministerial assignments as well as several instances of merging and de-merging of
                         ministerial departments. Dueto the political and institutional context, the Bank's activities were suspended in the country for 15 months between August 2008and October 2009. The
                         original closing date of the project, December 31, 2009, was thereafter extended for two years to December31, 2011, and for another interim period of 3 months to March 30, 2012.

                         Implementation of the project has significantly improvedbut could not fully recover the initial delay. As a result of a restructuring of March 2012, the project was therefore extended
                         fora third and final time to the new project closing date of March 29, 2014. The project development objective remained unchanged, butresources were further focused on the
                         components Public Finance & Public Procurement; Human Resources Management (HRM); andMonitoring & Evaluation and implementation capacity. Specific activities resulting
                         from the restructuring include: the functionalreview of selected ministries; support to the population census; implementation of the public procurement reform; and support
                         toenvironment strategy and identification of financial resources related to climate change.

                         The project has five components, namely:(i) Public Finance (45% after restructuring); (ii) Local Development (7%); (iii) Environment (8%); (iv) Human Resources
                         ManagementFunction (21%); (v) Support to project implementation, monitoring and evaluation (14%). Remaining 5% correspond to projectpreparation and contingencies.

                         The disbursement rate of the project as of today reaches 50% and commitment represents above 60% oftotal project. Main project achievements include: computerization of the
                         public financial management system and network linkagebetween budget, treasury, Central Bank and commercial banks; enhanced delegation for payment orders and financial
                         control; thecompletion of a civil servants census; the harmonization HR and Payroll databases.

                         New activities introduced as part of therestructuring include: (i) a functional review for the Ministry of Civil Service; (ii) support to the population census; and (iii)capacity building
                         activities for the Ministry of Environment for a sector strategy and related sector programs.
