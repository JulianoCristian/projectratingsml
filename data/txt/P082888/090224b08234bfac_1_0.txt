                         This US$ 13-million Mauritania Public Sector Capacity Building Project (P082888) was approved by the Board on July 6, 2006 and became effective on January 16, 2007. Due to the
                         political instability caused by a coup d'etat in 2008, the Bank's activities were suspended for 15 months between August 2008 and October 2009. The Project has undergone 5
                         restructuring to date, as follows. The original closing date of the project, December 31, 2009, was extended for two years to December 31, 2011 for the first time because of this
                         suspension of all operations, then to March 2012 for the second time, and further extended for a third and final time to March 29, 2014. The forth restructuring, which involved minor

                         changes in the Result Framework to better measure the outcomes, was approved in October 2013. On February 27, 2014, the project canceled undisbursed SDR645,000 (US
                         $993,300 equivalent) or 7% of total funds through the fifth and last restructuring, for the following 2 reasons:

                         (1) Thanks to the savings from the project, 2 new activities were included in the project action plan in April, 2013: (i) support for the PFM reform coordination unit, and (ii) support for
                         implementation of the Civil Service reform strategy. However, given the limited time for its implementation, they are expected to disburse only 25% and 30% respectively by the
                         closing date. The remaining of funds was therefore canceled and will be covered by the Government of Mauritania with their own financial resource.
                         (2) US$ 687,232 of savings was further identified.

                         After 7 years of implementation, the (i) achievement of outcomes, (ii) efficiency and (iii) sustainability of the project are summarized below.

                         (i) Achievement of Outcomes
                         The project Development Objective is to contribute to the improvement of performance, efficiency and transparency of public resource management in Mauritania. The project
                         achieved its targets for 5 out of 6 PDO indicators and 12 out of 13 intermediate indicators.

                         PDO 1 : Improvement of budget preparation – Achieved (Component A)
                         •        Budget preparation process has been significantly improved by aligning it with a new global MTEF as well as 7 sectoral MTEFs financed by the Project that have helped to
                         focus on programmatic expenditures related to poverty reduction. Challenges for future will be timely updating of those frameworks and implementing them during budget preparation
                         in a more rigorous manner, including by making the MTEF more realistic through better use of budget data. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development recently established
                         several working groups to continue their efforts for its updates.

                         PDO 2 : Improvement of budget execution – Achieved (Component A)
                         •        Establishment of transparent and effective financial management systems is a key achievement of this project. It includes the expenditure chain (RACHAD), the automated
                         system for customs data (ASYCUDA++), the tax administration system, the debt management system, the land registry system, and the integrated human resources management
                         system including the payroll and pension. Moreover, the automatic payment of payment orders by connecting the Treasury and the Central Bank is an extraordinary achievement, as
                         the payment/budget execution has completely shifted from manual operation to the automated one. It resulted in reducing the payment duration by half and the payment transaction
                         status and balance can be timely monitored on line on both sides. Reconciliation is now being done on a daily basis. Inter-operational system that interconnects all these PFM
                         systems has been mostly completed (except the treasury, the tax administration system and the customs). While the basic systems have been established, the Bank further needs
                         capacity building support for change management to adapt to the new management environment, and to operate them more efficiently.

                         PDO 3 : Improvement of tax collection – Achieved (Component A)
                         •        As a result of the fiscal census in Nouakchott in 2012, financed by PRECASP, with an aim to identify all commercial and non-commercial properties and activities, a large

                         number of unregistered taxpayers and unpaid sales tax were found. Following a rectification in the tax registry and improved tax collection, tax revenue in 2013 has increased by
                         160% in comparison with 2011. The development of a new tax administration system, which includes the e-tax system to be implemented in the near future, is mostly completed
                         (provisional acceptance is expected by March 25), which will further ease the administrative burden on the tax administration and allow them to focus their scarce capacities on
                         remaining areas of weakness. A significant amount of work remains for strengthening capacity for tax administration and improving communication with the taxpayers.

                         PDO 4 : Improvement of public human resources management (HRM) –Achieved (Component D)
                         •         The project has been providing support for all aspects of establishing a sound HRM system in Mauritania such as the census of public servants, clean-up and reconciliation
                         of different datasets for payroll, pension and HR records, capacity building training for key HR management staff in the Ministry of Public Service, and an establishment of the
                         integrated HRM IT system in the Ministry of Finance and Public Service. Throughout the processes, HR records have been fine-tuned (updated and verified?) and most of the
                         irregularities such as ghost workers and double dippers have been eliminated. The establishment of the integrated HRM system is the last achievement of this project. The new
                         system captures all civil servants correctly (final acceptance is expected to be received before March 20). In addition, it will allow better managing civil servants’ career from

                         towards a performance-based administration.

                         PDO 5 : Improvement of public procurement in compliance with the procurement plan– Achieved (Component A)
Public Disclosure Copy




                         •         As a result of the reform, public procurement is being executed more transparently in compliance with the adopted institutional procurement plans supported by the Project.
                         The regulatory agency, the 7 sectoral procurement commissions as well as the control commission were established and are now operational. The standard bidding documents as
                         well as the new operational manual were prepared and training for both private sector and public entities were completed. Yet, the established institutions are complex, and not fully
                         functioning due to weak capacity. The procurement process itself remains complex and slow. Since procurement reform is an on-going and continuous process, the team encourages
                         the Bank to continue supporting it.

                         PDO 6 : Decrease in the single source contracting in public procurement - Not achieved (Component A)
                         •          In 2012, the share of single source contracting in total increased to 8.3% from 6% in 2011. This is mainly due to emergency spending related to severe drought. The
                         statistics have not been made publicly available since 2011.


                         Other noteworthy achievements that contributed further to achieve the Development Objective are the following:

                         (1)       Completion of the Population and Habitat Census through support to the National Statistics Office (Component A)
                         Thanks to additional support by PRECASP, the census operation that was delayed for 2 years was successfully completed in spring 2013 and authorities subsequently made the
                         tentative result of 3.387.868 habitants available in June 2013. The National Statistics Office (ONS) made strong efforts to achieve gender equality, providing job opportunities to 90 IT
                         operators, who are all female and very competent. The census was critical for the development of the country as important data such as demographic and socio-economic statistics
                         have been updated for the first time since 5 years.

                         (2) Establishment of land management system (Component A)
                         The land management system (cadaster) to electronically manage land titles was established for the first time in the country. All titles available in the country were scanned and
                         registered in the electronic system. Double and/or false titles were eliminated and regularized through the registration process. The next step would be how to use it as a strategic tool
                         to address related issues including property taxes and guarantees for the Bank.

                         (3)      Improvement of PFM coordination (Component A)
                         Following an approval of the PFM reform master plan in 2011, the Ministry of Finance has established the coordination unit with support from the PRECASP and identified all missing
                         actions and financial gaps in the plan. A first round table was organized on December 10, 2013. This was a critical step to improve the coordination among financial and technical
                         partners involved in the PFM reform.

                         (4)       A big step forward to the E-government (Component A)
                         PRECASP supported to create an electronic archive and records system in the government for critical documents such as minutes of ministerial meetings, legal documents (Laws,

                         Presidential and Ministerial Decrees), policy statements, etc. It improved significantly the efficiency of the public administration and also paved the way for establishing the platform
                         for the electronic system in each ministry.

                         (5)     Mainstreaming Environment in the Economic Development Policy (Component C)
                         Environment policy has been successfully integrated in the development program with the creation of a new ministry and the adoption of the National Environmental Action Plan
                         (NEAP) for the first time in the country. The green growth study and the clean energy program have been subsequently prepared. They paved the way for more sustainable economic
                         development of the country.

                         The outcomes achieved by the project are important as PRECASP has been the first project in the country to initiate important reform activities. As summerized above, it introduced
                         for the first time in the country several innovations in the public administration by putting in place effective public resources management systems. The use of those systems are
                         strongly contributing to a more effective and efficient management of the public sector in Mauritania. Moreover, it should be noted that for some indicators the project has even

                         surpassed the targets like in the case of PDO 1, 2 and 3, respectively, on budget preparation, execution and tax c ollection.

                         The Project Development Objective has therefore been satisfactorily achieved.

                         (ii) Efficiency
                         The implementation of this project was long and not without problems and challenges, as the project underwent 5 restructuring to date with the strong willingness it would achieve its
                         objectives and to adapt to changing circumstances. It should be also stressed that Mauritania remains a fragile country. As experienced 15 months of the project interruption due to
                         the political instability caused by a coup d'etat in 2008, the project has been implemented under uncertain and difficult political circumstances. Nonetheless, the government has
                         made tremendous efforts to carry out important and major reforms and achieved them, despite these delays in the project management.

                         The challenges of the project and implementation delays were mainly due to (i) a complex project design including 4 sectors, (ii) the broad variety of beneficiaries (5 ministries and
                         several institutions/agencies) which makes the coordination and project management difficult, (iii) a long and complex national procurement process (duplications of roles in several
                         commissions and frequent complaint cases), (iv) a limited level of monitoring by the project committee (it was organized only twice in 2012 and 2013 respectively as opposed to the
                         quarterly basis organization), and (v) a not well conceived implementation arrangement. The pilot committee was headed by the Ministry of Public Service, whose the minister was
                         responsible for signing all contracts of the project, while the major beneficiaries and activities of this project were situated in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic
                         Affairs and Development. This unfavorable implementation arrangement did not ensure efficient project management and appropriate monitoring.

                         Moreover, the project encountered several problems during implementation because of resistance to change from several stakeholders as many activities supported by the project
                         represented important innovations in the country.

                         It should be also noted frequent change of TTLs (5 TTLs for 7 years including 15 months of interruption) was not helpful to ensure appropriate supervision and monitoring of the
                         project.

                         To improve the disbursement and to complete all planned activities within the tight schedule, special efforts from the Government and the Bank's team were made in the last year of
                         the project. These efforts included: (i) assignment of additional staff from the government to thoroughly follow and manage on-going but stuck activities; (ii) additional technical
                         support from the Bank's team by all means (supervision mission, monthly VC and daily phone conversation) to discuss and review/modify activities if needed, and to evaluate results
                         and impacts; (iii) the strengthening of the supervision mission/team with additional members including a new public sector specialist, a senior procurement specialist, a PFM IT
                         expert, a M&E specialist, and a construction expert for rehabilitation of the Ministry of Environment.

                         As a consequence of these efforts, the last supervision in January and March 2014 noted significant progress. The disbursement rate was improved from 55% to 90% in 12 months.
                         The final disbursement rate will be close to 100% after the cancellation of SDR 645,000. (The rate will be finalized during the grace period.)

                         (iii) Sustainability
                         The development of transparent and efficient public resource management systems supported by PRECASP is a positive sign in terms of sustainability. The two last supervision
                         missions in January and March 2014 appreciated that the government realizes the benefits of using those systems and will likely use them in the future.

                         Another important contribution to make project achievements sustainable is the stocktaking exercise that the Bank has supported to better highlight and capture all the achievements
                         but also to reflect upon the problems and delays the project has encountered to learn from them.

                         The Bank team is in the process of developing the successor of PRECASP that might follow up on some activities already supported by the project to ensure further sustainability.
                         The successor of the PRECASP and the government will likely put particular attention to sustainability 1) by accompanying the public reform process by paying attention to change
                         management so that stakeholders will take full advantage of the new systems developed and 2) by developing a learning system to capture the information and knowledge produced
                         by the project.
