                         This US$ 13-million Mauritania Public Sector Capacity Building Project (P082888) was approved by the Board on July 6, 2006 and became effective on January 16, 2007. Due to the
                         political instability, the Bank's activities were suspended for 15 months between August 2008 and October 2009. The Project has undergone 4 restructuring to date, as follows. The
                         original closing date of the project, December 31, 2009, was extended for two years to December 31, 2011 for the first time, then to March 2012 for the second time, and further
                         extended for a third and final time to March 29, 2014. The forth restructuring that involved minor changes in the Result Framework was approved in October 2013.

                         The Bank team noted significant progress since last two supervisions in October 2013 and January 2014. As a result, the disbursement rate has increased to 80% (97% of
                         contracting rate). The project disbursed 30% in 2013 only.

                         During the last supervision mission in January 2014, the team concluded that the project achieved its targets for 4 out of 6 PDO indicators and 10 out of 13 intermediate indicators.
                         The last restructuring which involved minor changes in one PDO measurement and 2 intermediate indicators was completed on October 30, 2013. This has contributed to measuring
                         project results more precisely in line with the activities supported by the project and helped to better achieve project development objective.

                         The team focused particularly on the assessment of IT contracts related to the establishment of different public financial management systems : (i) tax administration system, (ii)
                         interconnection between Central Bank and Treasury, (iii) integrated Human Resources management system (interface between payroll and HR system), (v) cadastre registration
                         system and (v) inter-operational and information sharing system in the Ministry of Finance. Interconnection between Central Bank and Treasury has been successfully operational
                         since January 2, 2014. Inter-operational and information system was mostly completed except for the tax administration and the Treasury parts. 3 other contracts are expected to be
                         completed by March 29.
                         While still observing some risks of incompletion of all the tasks by the closing date of March 29, 2014, the team noted positive progress and provided additional technical assistance
                         to the HR coordination unit for change management and update of legal requirements.

                         The team also noted good progress in the following activities over the last 3 months:

                         (1) Population and Housing Census (RGPH)
                         The mission noted good progress in data treatment and analysis in the Population and Habitat census. The National Statistics Office (ONS) made strong efforts on gender, providing
                         job opportunities to 90 IT specialists, who are all female and very competent. Upon a request from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED) and ONS, additional
                         funds of 150,000USD was provided to complete the census.

                         (2) Coordination around PFM reform agendas improved
                         The Ministry of Finance has identified all missing actions and financial gaps on the basis of the 'Schema directeur de la reforme de la gestion des finances publiques' approved in
                         2011. A first round table was organized on December 10, 2013.

                         (3) E-government project successfully completed
                         The mission assessed that the E-government project was successfully completed. This activity aimed at introducing an electronic archive and records system in the government for
                         critical documents such as minutes of ministerial meetings, legal documents, policy statements, etc. It also paved a way for establishing the platform for the electronic system in each
                         ministry.
