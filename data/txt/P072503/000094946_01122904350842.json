Furthermore, the project\n            will support the implementation of sector-wide technical\n            services programs, in an effort for the private sector to\n            take responsibility over the agricultural services, and\n            other technical support functions carried out by SONAPRA,\n            whose ginning plants, and operations' privatization,\n            includes assistance, and advisory services for the reform\n            process, and for addressing the social aspects, and\n            financial needs of the government's conversion program."}, "docdt": "2001-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
