Project for Benin were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: using investment lending in tandem\n            with budget support to implement difficult reforms may be\n            more effective than each instrument alone. The project under\n            review experienced that reforms are extremely difficult to\n            implement within a sector as strategic and as politically\n            sensitive as cotton. Even if it is clearly stated initially,\n            Government commitment can hardly be taken for granted on a\n            long period of time, unless irreversible steps are taken at\n            the beginning of the reform process, which was not the case\n            in the Benin reform process. The privatization of National\n            Company for agricultural production was finally completed\n            under joint support of specific investment lending and\n            budget support. Budget support can signal and facilitate\n            commitment to reforms. Strong sector teams from the\n            investment side are, however, needed to lead an effective\n            policy dialogue. Institutional development and structural\n            reforms should be outward looking and keep an eye on\n            evolving global developments. The project under review and\n            the underlying cotton sector reform were affected by\n            decisions of key stakeholders driven by internal struggles\n            and the political economy of the national cotton sector.\n            Evidence based analysis highlighting the performance of\n            alternative approaches followed in the region could have\n            improved decision making. The Bank is well suited to provide\n            such kind of input as shown by the recently completed\n            comparative analysis of Organization and Performance of\n            African Cotton Sectors (World Bank 2008). The project was\n            further affected by developments on international commodity\n            and financial markets. Designs need to be forward looking,\n            anticipate such external effects and be flexible enough to adapt."}, "docdt": "2008-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
