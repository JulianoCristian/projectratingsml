The project will further strengthen the\n            required human capacity within the civil service. The\n            project consists of three components: 1) petroleum sector\n            component, will continue the critical technical assistance,\n            and capacity building in this nascent sector. It will help\n            build an institutional, and legal framework to formulate\n            policies, supervise, and regulate the petroleum sector. This\n            will entail strengthening of the National Petroleum Agency\n            in the development of institutional structures, human\n            resources, and necessary equipment, while providing training\n            programs. The legal framework will be strengthened, to\n            include sector related environmental issues, and the\n            country's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) will be\n            established as will information management systems. Studies\n            and seminars will be undertaken to help the Government\n            develop an economic model of the EEZ, focused on the\n            opportunities for sector development and job creation; 2)\n            public finance component - seeks to improve financial\n            management, so as to strengthen petroleum revenue\n            management, harmonize budget nomenclatures and identify\n            expenditures for poverty reduction. Public procurement, and\n            relevant legislation shall be updated, to include the\n            establishment of information systems, which would improve\n            budget oversight and public finance management, through the\n            provision of  training, and the development of accounting\n            planning. On the revenue side, accounting practices, and\n            taxation will be improved, through training and capacity\n            building; and, 3) support for the implementation of the\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), includes training\n            and capacity building, namely through seminars, workshops,\n            and study tours."}, "docdt": "2004-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
