                         A. STRATEGICCONTEXT AND RATIONALE

 1.       COUNTRY AND SECTOR ISSUES

 1.       S2o Tome and Principe i s a least developed country o f about 140,000 inhabitants. It is a
heavily indebtedpoor country (HIPC) with 53.8 percent o f its population living below the
poverty line and with low human capacity. It i s highlyvulnerable to external shocks and its
dominant public sector i s characterized by weak institutional capacity, an inadequate legal and
regulatory framework, and limitedfinancial resources, making the functioning o f the economy
and the management o fpublic resources difficult.

2.        Since 1991, S2o Tom6 and Principe has enjoyed a democratic political system.
Nonetheless, political life has beenmarked by instability and administrative deadlock,
punctuatedby differences betweenthe Office o f the Presidentand the National Assembly,
successive Governments, internal party discords, governance issues, and two brief andbloodless
coups in 1995 and in2003. Since 2001, the country has had four Governments and two
ministerial re-shuffles as a result o f internal discords. The arrival o f the petroleum era could
heightenthis political instability and affect economic management further.

3.       S2o Tom6 and Principe i s at the cusp o f a major economic change. Highlyprospective
blocks for offshore oil production inthe Joint Development Zone (JDZ), established inrecent
agreement with Nigeria, were offered for biddingin late 2003. The most promising block (block
1) i s most likely to be licensed inthe second halfo f 2004. As o fAugust 2004, with one block
assigned, the share to the country from the petroleum contract signature bonus i s expected to
reachUS$45 million, or approximately 90 percent o f the country's yearly GDP. Ifno other
block i s negotiated and contracted out, the country would enter a period o f 5 to 10 years with
little to no further revenues from petroleum related signature bonuses. The two Governments
(S2o Tome and Principe and Nigeria) have, nevertheless, decided to postpone licensing o fthe
other blocks in an effort to ensure participation o f more qualified firms. Ifexploration succeeds,
the oil productioni s expected to start in2008-10.

4.       Inthe face ofthese challenges, the Government is committed to continue the
implementation o f its PRSP adopted by the Government inDecember 2002 and promulgatedby
the Presidento f the Republic inJanuary 2003. A major pillar o f the PRSP i s to continue reform
o f the public institutions, to build institutional capacity, and to promote better economic
management, good governance, and increased transparency. With the onset o f the petroleum era,
the Government recognizes the urgency o f continuing and accelerating these reforms and has
started to lay the base for the new institutional, legal and regulatory framework for the petroleum
sector.

2.       RATIONALE FORBANKINVOLVEMENT

5.       Giventhe country and sectoral issues outlined above, the Government has requested
support for a new project to continue the strengtheningo f economic management and the
implementation o f reforms and to build institutional and human capacity.

6.       The proposed credit fits within the overall CAS goals o f sustained growth, poverty
alleviation and improved access to quality social services. The CAS acknowledges the weak

institutional and implementation capacity for economic and public resource management and the
governance issues. Insupporting the Government development goals, the CAS notes the
possibilities for future lendinginthe context o f the PRSP and its action plan (for the period
2000-2005), and inbuildingthe capacity for petroleumpolicy and management.

7.      The Bank provided support to S5o Tom6 and Principe through a Public Resources
Management Credit (PRMC) that closed inJune 2004 and a PRMC-TA that will close in
December 2004. The PRMC helpedthe Government inconsolidating macroeconomic stability,
enhancing competitiveness o f the economy whereas the PRMC-TA allowed to elaborate some o f
country's sectoral strategies, develop its PRSP document, implement its reform program and
buildsome institutional capacity incritical areas such as financial and budgetarymanagement,
judiciary, petroleum and statistics.

8.      The Government's ability to coordinate donor intervention i s weak, coupled with weak
absorptive and management capacity. Bank involvement couldprovide policy andprogrammatic
leadership inthis area, helping to coordinate the assistance from other partners yielding greater
benefit from the various interventionsby the development partners.

3.      HIGHER    LEVEL OBJECTIVESTO WHICH THE PROJECTCONTRIBUTES

9.      The project contribution will be to improve the impact o fbetter budget and economic
management on economic growth, development andpoverty reduction through modernizing and
buildingup capacity ineconomic (financial and budgetary) management and supervision; and
through strengthening basic institutional and legal infrastructure inthe finance and the natural
resources and environment ministries.

4.      PROJECT COMPONENTS

14.     The project will consist o f three components: (i)petroleum sector component; (ii)
                                                            a                                    a
public finance component; and (iii)   support for the PRSP implementation.

4.1.    Component I:Petroleum sector

15.     The current PRMC-TA, closing inDecember 2004, has supportedsome o fthe nascent
petroleum sector activities inthe past eighteenmonthsin a number o f ways: (i)international
experts were hiredto assist the Government inre-negotiating four contracts; (ii)    international
experts also assisted the Government inthe process o f launching a bidding round for bids from
petroleum companies for thejoint development zone (JDZ) with Nigeria inApril 2003 and for
analyzing the bids subsequently received during October 2003-April 2004; (iii)      a kernel of the
National Petroleum Agency (NPA) i s already active, andhas receivedtechnical assistance and
funding and engaged an international expertto help the SZo TomCans fully develop the NPAin
its sectoral supervisory and analytical capacities; and (iv) the Government has passed a decree
law officially creating the NPA inJanuary 2004. The decree law was promulgated by the
Presidento fthe Republic inJune 2004. Technical assistance was provided to the Government
which is finalizing a petroleumrevenue managementlaw. The law was submitted to the
National Assembly inJuly 2004 and a favorable general first vote was cast inmid-August 2004.
A secondvote is to follow inSeptember 2004. The Government andthe Presidencyhave also
publicized their desire for transparency, by announcing that they are interestedinsigning up to


                                              I
                                                  - 3 -

the "Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative" (EITI). A joint declarationwith regards to the
JDA was issuedby the Presidents o f ,520 Tome and Principe and Nigeria inlate June 2004. The
Bank i s supporting this transparency effort.

16.     The new project will continue critical technical assistance and capacity buildinginthis
nascent sector. It will help to buildan institutional and legal framework to formulate policies,
and to supervise and to regulate the petroleum sector. This will entail: (i)  strengtheningo fthe
National Petroleum Agency inmaterial and human capacity terms (develop agency structure,
hireappropriate staff, equip agency, adopt atraining program andthe like); (ii)     strengtheningo f
the legal framework, including sector related environmental issues; (iii) the Government
                                                                           helping
to prepare and to promote the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) o fthe country; (iv) settingup a
functional information systemthat i s transparent; and (v) undertaking studies and seminars that
would help the Government to develop an economic model o f the EEZ to study the opportunities
for local content inthe sector development and for job creation.

17.     Capacity buildingand relatedtraining will represent a significant share o f the funding
receivedthrough this TA Credit and will mainly consist o f the following activities: (i)  on-the-job
training activities that will be a standard request inall consultant contracts to involve NPA
professionals inrelevant tasks; (ii)  short-term courses, preferably inSTP by invited experts; (iii)
long term courses for NPAprofessionals that will obtain masters and other postgraduate
diplomas intechnical, economic, legal and environmental subjects; and (iv) industry
secondments, to be arranged with the companies operating inboth JDZ and EEZ blocks.

4.2.    Component11: Publicfinance

18.     The project will assist the Government to improve public finance management
(expenditure and revenue sides) inlight o f the future petroleum era. Many o f the actions
proposedfor this component are recommendations from the analytical and technical assistance
work undertaken since 2002 inthe framework o f the PRMC/PRMC-TA and the 2001-2003
HPC-AAP analyses. The specific actions to improve budgetary process (harmonization o f
budget nomenclature; identification o f expenditures for poverty reduction, development and
adoption o f a new accounting framework) were identified inthe HIPC-AAP December 2003
report. Relevant output/outcome indicators from HPC-AAP have been adopted to assess
developments inthe context o f this component. Also, the Government and the World Bank team
identifiedother actions to improve governance and transparence o fpublic andprivate financial
dealings. The Government wishes to receive assistance to develop a macro-economic model to
help improve formulation o f economic policies. Onthe expenditure side, the actions to be taken
are summarizedunder the following headings: (i)      strengthen petroleum revenue management
supervision across national institutions (Government, Central Bank, National Assembly, Court o f
the Accounts); (ii) harmonize budget nomenclatures and identify expenditures for poverty
reduction; (iii)update the public procurement, and treasury and public patrimony laws and
procedures; (iv) install a simple Information System among specific Government entities inthe
country as deemed necessary to facilitate the PEM; (v) improve budget oversight and public
finance management training; and (vi) develop and implement an accounting framework and
accountingplan. Onthe revenue side, the Govemment wishes to: (i)         improve accounting and tax
reporting practices o f enterprises; and (ii)increase MoPF capacity to collect tax revenue.

 19.       Capacity buildingand relatedtraining will mainly include the following activities:
(i) short-term courses/workshops and on-the-job training to develop, use and update a macro-
economic model; and (ii)    short-term courses/workshops and seminars to strengthen petroleum
revenuemanagement supervisionacross nationalinstitutions, improve budget oversight and
public finance management; (iii)    on thejob-training and/or workshopdseminars to leam and
adopt the harmonized budgetnomenclatures and produce appropriate accounting tables; (iv)
seminars andor on-the-job training to leam the new laws inprocurement, treasury and public
patrimony and to implementthem; (iv) on-the-job training and/or workshops/seminars to learn
how to use the Information System among specific Government entities; and (v) training
(courses, workshops and on-the-job training) to implementthe accounting framework and
accountingplan.

4.3.       Component111: PRSP

20.       The new credit will help facilitate the implementationo fthe PRSP goals. The credit will
support this effort by helping: (i) directorate to become functional - capable to fully supervise
                                    the
and follow-up on the implementation o f the PRSP goals, with regular provision o f indicators; (ii)
the updating o fthe PRSPdocument with analysis, forecasts and a strategy for the petroleum
economy (revenues and expenditures); and (iii)      the adoption o f the updated PRSP.

21,       Capacity buildingand related training will mainly include the following activities (i)
seminars and workshops, study tours for the core PRSP team, (ii)       training courses/workshops
and on-the-job training for the INE(National Statistical Institute) professionalsworking on
survey development, implementation, post-survey data analysis and reporting, and updating o f
data.

5.        LESSONS   LEARNEDAND REFLECTEDIN THE PROJECT DESIGN

22.       A number of lessons were learnedfrom the PRMC andPRMC-TA. The lessons learned
from the PRMC suggest that: (i)    national ownership o f the reforms and related capacity building
process will increase the probability o f the sustainability o f the assistance; (ii) project
                                                                                   the
objectives should not be too ambitious and should be within the capacity o f a properly trained
implementingagency andthe Government; and (iii) i s needto keep the project simple in
                                                        there
design, implementation (components and indicators), and follow-up (supervision).

23.       The PRMC-TA was developed as a study fundrelatedto the PRMC. The Government
usedthe funds within the framework o fthe identified sectors but without a specific capacity
buildingprogram. The lessons learnedfrom the PRMC-TA are two-fold: (i) success o fthe
                                                                                  the
training o f technical assistance will dependon its ability to address capacity buildingneeds ina
coherent yet flexible framework that is supported by an underlyingpolicy agenda; and (ii)      the
modality o fproviding training affects its outcome and sustainability for the institutions targeted:
(a) it i s more productive and less costly to bringinternational TA to the country to train a group
o f civil servants than sending out one or two civil servants for training. Ifseveral people are
trained then departure or absence o f one civil servant does not leadto loss o f the expertise and
the capacity acquired to undertake the specific activity; and (b) there are trainings that are highly
specialized and for which a few civil servants needto travel abroad. Inthis case the trained
individuals should report back to their units/ ministries inpreparing a written report to be



                                                   - 5 -

distributedto all relevant colleagues (or through a seminar) or accept to train other colleagues in
the skillthey have acquired.

24.     The GCB-TA focus has beenplacedon two sectors (petroleum andpublic finance) and
on specific institutional capacity building. Experience with the PRMC-TA pointed to the need
for a more analytical design and focus, coupledwith a strengthened Implementation Unit and
improved implementation arrangements. The proposedcredit has also focused on identifying
T A and capacity buildingneeds within a reform or institution buildingprogram to increase its
viability beyond the life o f the credit. The TA and capacity buildingdesignhave attempted to
program many activities incountry, with allowance for external training. The development o f
the credit content was drivenby a close cooperation betweenthe relevantministries andthe WB
team to ensure that the actions included would be country owned.

6.      ALTERNATIVESCONSIDEREDAND REASONSFORREJECTION

25.     Several alternatives were considered interms of lendinginstrument and sector focus:

        (i). TheAdaptableProgramLoan(APL)wasrejectedsincethesocio-economic
        situation inthe country may change radically once the petroleum revenues start flowing.
        Furthermore, the criteria for usingan APL - that it be usedto support the phased program
        o f a sector restructuring or a systemic reform o f the power, water, health, education or the
        natural resources management sector - did not exist.
        (ii).The      leaming and innovation loan was rejected as it i s to support small pilot-type
        investment and capacity buildingprojects and did not fit the immediate and multi-sectoral
        institutional needs o f the country.
        (iii).TheInstitutionalDevelopmentFund(IDF)isconsideredafundoflastresortand
        i s not meant to finance activities that can be funded on a timely basis, through ongoing
        projects, economic and sector work, or a Project PreparationFacility. Nor i s the IDF
        meant to finance activities that can be financed by other donors or other Bank
        instruments,such as learning andinnovation loans. The maximum amount o f
        US$500,000 was not sufficient and the IDFtopical focus did not match the needs
        addressed inthe GCB-TA credit.


                                      C. IMPLEMENTATION

1.      PARTNERSHIPARRANGEMENTS: NOTAPPLICABLE

2.      INSTITUTIONALAND IMPLEMENTATIONARRANGEMENTS

26.     The current Implementation Unit (PIU) for PRMC-TA, closing inDecember 2004, has
beendesignated as the ImplementationUnit for the new project. The unit will bereinforced so
that it will be composed o f (i) coordinator o f the project; (ii)financial management
                                 the                                 a
specialist (the current accountant to be trained to become the FMS); (iii)   a procurement specialist
(part-time); (iv) an "implementation champion" - a SZo Tomkan who will have economic and
policy training and experience and familiarity with the policy and political environment o f the
country - who will follow-up the policy and implementation aspects o f the project; (v) a



                                                  - 6 -                                                   7.L

secretary; and (vi) a driver. The new ImplementationUnitwill be housed inthe Ministryo f
Planningand Finance, under the tutelage o fthe Minister o fPlanning andFinance, and will have
i t s own independentbudget and employees. A sectoral coordinator will be located at the
National Petroleum Agency, under the tutelage o fthe Ministry o fNatural Resources. The role o f
the coordinator inthe Petroleum Agency i s to participate inthe definition o f needs for the
petroleum sector (TORS,technical specifications, etc), identifypotential consultants for a short
list, participate inthe evaluation process to select the consultants/firms and the evaluation o f the
final products received from the consultantsifirms. The actual procurement processes will
remain with the PIU.

Procurement

27.      The current PIUo fthe closing PRMC-TA credit i s composed o f a Coordinator (with
Procurement functions), an accountant, a secretary and a driver. As recommendedduringthe
Procurement Capacity Assessment o f February 2004, a procurement specialist has beenhired on
part-time basis (working jointly with the Social Sector Support Project (PASS). This option will
betested duringthe first few months o fthe project, andwill berevisedifnecessary. The
procurement specialist has beentrained and i s ready to launch the first procurement activities
underthe new project. The coordinator andothers dealing with World Bankprocurement issues
(including staff at the National Petroleum Agency participating incontracting activities) received
a one week training on procurement processes in late June 2004. Furthertraining will follow as
appropriate.

Financial Management

28.      A FinanceUnit,headedbythe financial management specialist, will be established
within the PIU. The FinanceUnitwill have responsibility for the financial management and
accounting o f the credit. Specifically, it will be responsible for (i)
                                                                      preparing the activity plans,
monthly Special Accounts, reconciliation statements, and quarterly Statements o f Expenditures
(SOEs), withdrawal schedules, quarterly financial monitoring reports, and annual financial
statements; and (ii)  ensuringthat the project financial management arrangements are acceptable
to'the Government and to IDA.

29.      The GCB -TA project financial management benefits from the fact that this project i s the
follow-up o f an ongoing project that is beingimplementedby the same PIU. However, the GCB
-TAproject financial management is affected by the following negative facts:

      0     The current PIUaccountingsystemis based on Excel Spreadsheetsinsteado fbeing
           based on a financial management package format or inFMRformat;

      0     The current PIUdoes not have a Financial Procedures Manual;

      0    Financial management in S5o Tom6 and Principe is weak. There are pieces o f the
           puzzle missing, such as a comprehensive and up-to-date set o f Procedures Manuals for
            Government budgetingand accounting that includes Project financial management
           procedures; uniform applicationthroughout the Government o f systems for financial
           management andbudgetary execution; and information systems sophisticated enough
            to produce timely and accurate information for reporting and control purposes.



                                                  - 7 -

    0      Weak intemal and extemal audit system, and a weak judiciary system, with very little
           accountability inthe system.

30.      The project will undergo annual audits by internationallyreputable companies. These
audits will be provided to the WB by June 30 o f the year following the audited year. The cost o f
the audit will be financed by the credit. The TOR for the audit will have to be agreed uponby the
WB.

3.       MONITORINGEVALUATIONOFOUTCOMES/RESULTS
                        AND

31.      The keyperformance indicators stated above will be monitored on a regular basis.
Specific outputhesults for components have been finalized with the Government (Annex I).         The
`implementation champion' active within the PIU will be responsible for the monitoring,
evaluation and reporting o f these indicators. The PRSP Unit and the National Statistical Institute
will be supported to produce and monitor some o f the baseline indicators identified inthe PRSP
document, especially as they relate to poverty reduction. Data on health and education indicators
could be obtained through cooperationwith the Social Sector Support Project (PASS).

4.       SUSTAINABILITY

32.      The major components o f the credit are geared to help put inplace a system that would
allow the Government to ensure sustainability o f outputs and outcomes once the oil revenues
flow.

33.     New and updatedlegislation affecting the petroleum sector, public finance, procurement
and the judiciary will become part of the legal framework o f the country. The increased
institutional and human capacity inthe petroleum sector and the Ministry o f Finance would
allow the Government to build on the achievements o fthe project by usingpart o fthe petroleum
funds that will become available to the country inthe mediumto longrun. The project will also
build some skills inproject, procurement and financial management which can beusefulbeyond
the life o fthe project. Ultimately, the sustainability o f the project will be determined by the
degree o f ownership o f the institutional and human capacity buildingmeasures and the political
will o fthe policymakers once the revenues from petroleumproduction start to flow to the
country at the end o f the decade.

5.       CRITICAL RISKSAND POSSIBLE CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS

34.     Political instability has led inthe past to frequent political infighting, Government
changes, delayed decision making and implementation of reforms. This instability may be
heightenedwith the onset o fthe petroleum era. More specifically, the risk exists that authorities
could deviate from stable macro-economic and expenditure management principles once
petroleumrevenues arrive. Many petroleum-rich countries have increased public expenditures
substantially to address perceived development needs. Many, ifnot all, wasted the monies and
failed to achieve their purported development goals. Inthe case o f Sgo Tome and Principe, there
are three mitigation factors to consider: (i) the short run(2 year horizon), the risk o f this
                                              in
deviation i s mitigated by the desire o f the Government to achieve HIPC debt relief, and therefore
the necessity to continue with a PRGFprogram; (ii) policy makers are knowledgeable about
                                                        the



                                                  - 8 -

the experiences o fother petroleumproducers, especially those of S5o Tom6 and Principe's
neighborqand (iii)     the countrywill only receive a one-offpetroleum contract signatures bonus
for now. While this bonus may be substantial compared to the GDP, the Government i s also
aware that it i s a one-time payment. The productionbased petroleum revenue is not expected to
reach the country before 2008-2010.

35.      The proposed project supports the Government in strengtheninginstitutions and civil
service capacity as well as the legal and regulatory framework, and therefore contributes to the
creation o f a more rules-based economic environment and a more professional civil service, one
that i s not as easily affected by political instability. Furthermore, the Government i s committed
to reforms and agreed to a three year PRGFinearly July 2003. Inthe aftermath o f the mid-July
2003 coup, the Government has reiterated its commitment and received the IMF team inmid-
November. Another IMFmission visited the country inJune 2004 and expressed satisfaction
with the overall macroeconomicperformance for the first halfo f2003. The IMFi s slated to
returnto the country inOctober 2004 to continue policydiscussions andpotentially come to an
understanding on a PRGF.

36.      The Government is developinga petroleum sector revenue management law that has been
distributedfor national discussion inJuly 2004. It has beenrecently approvedby the National
Assemblybutwill still be analyzed inmore details. Althoughthe initial petroleum development
activities will not take place before 2008 and then indeep-water offshore blocks, the proposed
project will address environmental aspects to ensure that the Government i s sensitive to possible
environmental concerns related to petroleum operations. Recommendationswill be included in
the policy dialogue with the Government, and monitored duringthe implementation o f the
project.

37.      Financial Management: So far, a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)
has not yet been conducted. Therefore, the risk o f waste, diversion andmisuse o f funds cannot
be assessed. However, the overall project risk from a financial management perspective i s
considered highsince few Bank-financedprojects have beenimplemented inthe country and the
public sector i s characterized by weak institutional capacity and limited financial resources.

38.      The table of the next page identifies the key risks that project management may face in
achieving its objectives andprovides a basis for determininghow management should address
these risks.

39.   Procurement: The WB mission ratedthe risk o f the Unitto handle procurement as high.
The mainreasons to reach such conclusion are summarizedbelow:

   0  Staff handling procurement for the PRMC-TA had not received appropriate training.
      Duringthe life o fthe existingPRMC-TA, the Banknevercarried out procurement
      reviews, nor participated insupervisionmissions to provide advice.

   0  Absence o f an Operational Manual and a Procurement Plan.

   0  Lack o f familiarity with the national legislation on procurement.

   0  Lack o f transparency inthe evaluationprocess.

   0  Misunderstandingo fthe Guidelineswhen selecting the methods for the procurement o f
      goods or the selection o f consultants, leading to improper practices.

40.   A Summary of Findingsand an Action Planto mitigate these weaknesses are included in
Annex 8.

41.     The weaknesses identified infinancial and procurement management are mitigated
through action plans inAnnex 7 and Annex 8 respectively and conditions for effectiveness.

6.      LOAN~REDIT      CONDITIONSAND COVENANTS

        The conditions for effectiveness are: as follows: (a) Adoption o f a Financial,
Administrative and Procurement Manual o fprocedures, satisfactory to IDA; (b) Relevantly
qualified auditor for the project appointed on approved terms o f reference; (c) Special Account in
dollars and Project Account inDobras for counterpart funds and current account opened; (d) the
Government deposits US$50,000.00 o f its total contribution for the first fiscal year inthe
appropriate account; and (e) the National Petroleum Agency staffed and functional ina manner
satisfactory to IDA.

1.      ECONOMIC     AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES: NOT APPLICABLE

2.      TECHNICAL:NOTAPPLICABLE

3.      FIDUCIARY

42.     The overall conclusion o f the financial management assessment is that the current
financial management arrangements inthe PIUdo not satisfy the World Bank's minimum
financial management requirements. Inorder to establish an acceptable controlled environment
and to mitigate financial management risks, the following measures are to be taken.

43.     Bycredit effectiveness, the project will not beready for report-based disbursements.
Thus, at the initial stage, transactions-based disbursement procedures, as described inthe World
Bank DisbursementHandbook, will be followed i.e. direct payments, reimbursements, and
special commitments. However, when project implementationbegins, and the borrower requests
conversion to report-based disbursements, a reviewwill be undertakenby the Bank team to
determine ifthe project i s eligible.

44.     The mainrecommendations o fthe World Bank missionwhich preparedthe Procurement
Capacity Assessment were:

(i) Urgency to recruit a Procurement Specialist for the Unit who could be trained, together with
the Coordinator and other staff dealing with procurement actions (Le. National Petroleum
Agency). The Bank highlyrecommends the recruitment o f an international consultant to assist
the staff inlaunching the first procurement activities duringthe preparation and the first months
o fthe project's implementation. The Bank team and the Government will revisit this issue
duringthe first supervisionmission for the credit.
(ii)Procurement Plan. Under the revisedProcurement Guidelines dated M a y 2004, the
Procurement Plan was prepared during the project preparation, finalized during negotiations, and
referenced inthe LoanAgreement. It covers activities for at least the initial 18 months o f the
project. The use o f the methods definedby the planwill be mandatory and subject to declaration
o f misprocurement.

5        ENVIRONMENT

45.      As the project deals with technical assistance, it hasbeenrated as a C category project.
The petroleum exploration activities will not take placebefore 2008. The oil activities will be
concentrated indeep offshore blocks. Nonetheless, the project includes technical assistance on
environmental issues to ensure that the Government i s sensitive to environmental concems
related to petroleum operations. Recommendations will be included inthe policy dialogue with
the Government andmonitoredduringthe implementationperiod. One small works component
involving extension o f an existing buildinghas beenincluded to accommodate the staff o f the
Petroleum Agency so that they benefit from an adequate working environment.

       Annex 2: Major RelatedProjectsFinancedby the Bank and/or other Agencies

1.      The current PRMC-TA - which will close end o f 2004 - has supported the Government in
laying the base for the new institutional, legal and regulatory framework for the petroleum
sector. The PRMC-TA has supported the establishment o f a Petroleum Unit. The Credit has
also supported the Government in: (1) hiringo f foreign technical expertise innegotiating
petroleum contracts; (2) obtaining expert analysis and advice on international offers for the
petroleumblocks inthe Joint Development Zone (JDZ) (between S2o Tom6 and Principe and
Nigeria); (3) initiating the buildingo f a petroleum institution capable o f analyzing the sector-
related issues and supervisingthe activities o f foreign companies inthe sector; and the like.
PRMC-TA funds also have helpedthe Government to elaborate some o f its sectoral strategies,
develop its PRSP document, implementpart o f its reform program and build some institutional
capacity incritical areas such as financial andbudgetarymanagement, judiciary, and statistics.
The Credit Implementation and Development Objective ratings from the last PSR are bothbeing
satisfactory. The Government has requested the proposed Governance Capacity Buildingproject
to continue the strengtheningo f economic management and the implementation o f reforms and
to build institutional and human capacity.

2.      The EUprovided support for a 2000-2002 civil service reform. France and Portugalhave
provided expatriate technical assistance inCustoms Administration, Budget Administration and
Public Finance. While Customs has benefitedfrom this technical assistance, the result inpublic
finance management has been more mixed.

3.      Inthe petroleumsector, the UNDPhas provided some financing incoordinationwith the
PRMC-TA to support the Government efforts to develop the petroleum revenue management
law. The World Bank and UNDP have supported two two-day seminars (inDecember 2003 and
March2004) to educate Sao Tomean policy makers and the civil society on petroleum issues,
and to ensure transparency o fpetroleum discussions and decision makings.

ComponentI:Petroleumsector

8.      The current PRMC-TA, closing inDecember 2004, has supported some o f the nascent
petroleum sector activities ina number o fways: (i)international experts were hiredto assist the
Government inre-negotiating four contracts; (ii)     intemational experts also assisted the
Government inthe process o f launching a biddinground for bids from petroleum companies for
thejoint development zone (JDZ) with NigeriainApril 2003 and for analyzing the bids
subsequently received duringOctober 2003-April 2004; (iii)kernel o f the National Petroleum
                                                                 a
Agency (NPA) i s already active, and has receivedtechnical assistance and funding and engaged
an international expert to help the S2o Tomkans fully develop the NPA intheir sectoral
supervisory and analytical capacities; and (iv) the Government has passed a decree law officially
creating the NPA inJanuary 2004. The decree law was promulgated by the President o f the
Republic inJune 2004. Technical assistancewas provided to the Government which i s finalizing
a petroleum revenuemanagement law. The law was submittedto the National Assembly inJuly
2004 and a favorable general first vote was cast inmid-August2004. A second vote i s to follow
inSeptember 2004. The Government and the Presidency have also publicizedtheir desire for
transparency, by announcingthat they are interested insigning up to the "Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative" (EITI). Ajoint declarationwith regards to the JDA was issued by the
Presidentso f SBo Tom6 and Principe and Nigeria inlate June 2004. The Bank is supporting this
transparency effort.

9.      The new project will continue critical technical assistance and capacity buildinginthis
nascent sector. It will help to build an institutional and legal framework to formulate policies, to
supervise and to regulate the petroleum sector. This will entail: (i)  strengthening o f the National
Petroleum Agency inmaterial and human capacity terms (develop agency structure, hire
appropriate staff, equip agency, adopt a training program and the like); (ii)  strengthening o f the
legal framework, including sector related environmental issues; (iii) the Government to
                                                                        helping
prepare and to promote the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) o f the country (iv) setting up a
functional information system that i s transparent; and (v) undertaking studies and seminars that
would help the Government to develop an economic model o f the EEZ, to study the
opportunities for local content inthe sector development and for job creation.

10.     Capacitybuilding and related training will represent a significant share o f the funding
receivedthrough this TA Credit and mainly consist o f the following activities: (i)   on-the-job
training activities that will be a standard request inall consultant contracts to involve NPA
professionals inrelevant tasks; (ii)  short-term courses, preferably in STP by invited experts; (iii)
long-term courses for NPAprofessionals that will obtain masters and other postgraduate
diplomas intechnical, economic, legal and environmental subjects; and (iv) industry
secondments, to be arranged with the companies operating inboth JDZ and EEZblocks.

Component11: Publicfinance

11,     The project will assist the Government to improvepublic finance management
(expenditure and revenue sides) inlight o fthe future petroleum era. Many o f the actions
proposed for this component are recommendations from the analytical and technical assistance
work undertaken since 2002 inthe framework o f the PRMC/PRMC-TA and the 2001-2003
HIPC-AAP analyses. The specific actions to improve budgetary process (harmonization o f
budgetnomenclature; identification o f expenditures for poverty reduction, development and
adoption o f a new accounting framework) were identifiedinthe HIPC-AAP December 2003
report. Relevant output/outcome indicators from HIPC-AAP have beenadopted to assess
developments inthe context o f this component. Also, the Government and the World Bank team
identifiedother actions to improve governance andtransparence of public andprivate financial
dealings. The Government wishes to have assistanceto develop a macro-economic model to
help improve formulation o feconomic policies. Onthe expenditure side, the actions to betaken
are summarized under the following headings: (i)     strengthenpetroleum revenue management
supervision across national institutions (Government, Central Bank, National Assembly, Court o f
the Accounts); (ii) harmonizebudget nomenclatures and identify expenditures for poverty
reduction; (iii)update the public procurement, and treasury and public patrimony laws and
procedures; (iv) install a simple Information Systemamong specific Government entities inthe
country as deemed necessary to facilitate the PEM; (v) improve budget oversight and public
finance management training; and (vi) develop and implement an accounting framework and an
accounting plan. On the revenue side, the Govemment wishes to: (i)      improve accounting and
tax reporting practices o f enterprises; and (ii)
                                                increase MoPF capacity to collect tax revenue.

12.     Capacity buildingand related training will mainly include the following activities: (i)
short-term courses/workshops and on-the-job training to develop, use and update a macro-
economic model; (ii)   short-term courses/workshops and seminars to strengthen petroleum
revenuemanagement supervision across national institutions, improve budget oversight and
public finance management. The training courses and workshopsheminar details, content and
intensitywould vary dependingon whether it was geared toward MoPF and Central Bank (more
technical), National Assembly (more supervisory) or Court o f the Accounts (more audit
oriented); (iii)
               onjob-training and/or workshops/seminars to learn and adopt the harmonized
budgetnomenclatures andproduce appropriate accountingtables; (iv) seminars and/or on-the-job
training to leam the new laws inprocurement, treasury and public patrimony and to implement

1.       The unit implementing the current PRMC-TA will bereinforcedto implementthe new
project. The evaluation o f the current PIU indicates that its financial or procurement
management processes do not meet Bank requirements (see Annex 7).

2.       The current ImplementationUnit for PRMC-TA, closing inDecember 2004, has been
designated as the ImplementationUnit for the new project. The unitwill be reinforced so that it
will be composed of: (i) coordinator o fthe project; (ii)Financial Management Specialist
                           the                                 a

                                                 a
"implementation champion."- a S5o Tomean who will have economic and policy training and
experience and familiarity with the policy and political environment o f the country who will
follow-up the policy and implementationaspects o f the project; (v) a secretary; and (vi) a driver.
The new ImplementationUnit will behoused inthe Ministryo fPlanning and Finance, underthe
tutelage o f the Minister o fPlanning and Finance, and will have its own independent budget and
employees. A coordinator will be located inthe National Petroleum Agency, under the tutelage
o f the Ministryo f NaturalResources, to initiate, pursue and implementthe activities inthe
petroleum sector. The role o f the coordinator inthe Petroleum Agency inprocurement activities
i s that he/she can participate on defining needs (TORS, technical specifications), identify
potential consultants for a short list, participate on the evaluation process to select the
consultants/firms and the evaluation o fthe final product received from the consultants/firms.
The actual procurement processes will remainwith the PIU.

Procurement:

3.       The current PIUo fthe PRMC-TA credit is composed o f a Coordinator (with
Procurement functions), an Accountant, a Secretary and a Driver. As recommendedduringthe
Procurement Capacity Assessment o fFebruary 2004, a Procurement Specialist (part-time) will
be hiredon a part-time basis (working jointly with the PASS project). This option will be tested
after the first six months o f the project implementation and, will berenewedifsatisfactory. The
Procurement Specialist was trained and i s ready to launchthe first procurement activities under
the new project. The coordinator and other staff dealing with procurement issues (including the
staff at the National Petroleum Agency participating incontracting activities) were also trained
inprocurement inlate June 2004. Furthertraining will follow as appropriate.

Financia1Management:

4.       The GCB-TA project financial management benefits from the fact that this project i s the
follow-up o f an ongoing project that i s beingimplementedby the same PIU. However, the
GCB-TA project financial management i s affected by the following negative facts:

     0     The current PIUaccounting systemis based on Excel Spreadsheets instead o fbeing
           based on a financial management package format or inFMR format;
     0     The current PIUdoes not have Financial Procedures Manual;



                                                -41 -

   0     Financial management in S3o Tom6 and Principe i s weak. There are missingelements
         such as; (i)a comprehensive and up-to-date set o f Procedures Manuals for Government
         budgeting and accounting that includes Project financial management procedures; (ii)
         uniform application throughout the Government o f systems for financial management
         andbudgetary execution; and (iii)    information systems sophisticated enough to produce
         timely and accurate information for reporting and controlpurposes.
   0     Weak internal and external audit system, and a weak judiciary, with very little
         accountability inthe system.

5.     The weaknesses identifiedare addressedinthe financial management actionplan(see
Annex 7).

6.     A FinanceUnit,headedbythe FinancialManagement Specialist, will be established
within the PIU. The Finance Unitwill have responsibility for the financial management and
accounting o f the Credit. Specifically, it will be responsible for; (i)
                                                                      preparing an activity plan, a

withdrawal Schedule, a quarterly financial monitoring reports, and annual financial statements;
and (ii)ensure that the project financial management arrangement are acceptable to Government
and IDA. The project will undergo annual audits by external, internationally reputable
companies. These audits will beprovided to the WE3 by June 30 ofthe year following the
audited year. The cost o f the audit will be financed by the Credit. The terms o f references
(TORS)for the audit will have to be agreed to by the WE3.

information ina timely manner for decision-makingpurposes (to enable project management to
monitor the efficient implementationo f the project). This information should have the
characteristics o fbeing understandable, relevant, reliable and comparable and would enable
management to plan, implement,monitor and appraise the entity's overall progress towards
achieving its objectives. This should be achieved through the preparation o f quarterly Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) which integrates project accounting, procurement, contract
management, disbursement and audit with physical progress.

Reporting(FinancialMonitoringReports)

6.     The PIU accounting systemwill bebased on a computerized, double-entry, cash-based
system. The chart o f accounts and internal controls will be documented inthe Financial
Procedures Manual.

The following quarterly FMRswill beproducedby the PIU:
                FinancialReports:
                       Sources andUses o f Fundsby FundingSource
           .        o  Uses o f Fundsby Project ActivityKomponent
                Physical Progress (Output Monitoring) Report
                Procurement Report

7.     The formats will be defined and agreed with the Bank, and the project mustbe capable o f
       producingFMRs by effectiveness.

8.     The project may later become eligible to use the report-based disbursement method,
provided that duringproject implementation, it (a) sustains satisfactory financial management
rating duringproject supervision; (b) submitsFMRs consistent with the agreed form and content
as explainedbelow; and (c) submitsProject Audit Reports by the due dates. The PIU i s then
requiredto submit to the Bank the following information inorder to support report-based
disbursement:
           ....Financial MonitoringReport (FMR);
                Special Account (SA) Activity Statement;
                SA Bank Statements;
                Summary Statement o f SA Expenditures for Contracts subject to Prior Review;
                Summary Statement o f SA Expendituresnot subject to Prior Review.

ProjectFinancialStatements

9.     Inaddition to themonthly reconciliations and quarterly monitoring reports, the Project
will produce annual Project Financial Statements for analytical and audit purposes. These
Financial Statements will be composed of:

       A Statement of Sources andUses ofFunds(showing IDA and Counterpart Funds);
       A Statement reconciling the balances on all Bank Accounts to the bank balances on the
       Statement of Sources and Uses o f Funds;
       SOE Withdrawal Schedule, listing individual withdrawal applications relating to
       disbursementsby SOE method, byreference number,date and amount;
       A Cash Forecast for the next two quarters;
       Notes on significant accounting policies and accounting standards adopted by
       management when preparing the accounts; and on any supplementary information or
       explanations that may be deemed appropriate by management to enhance the presentation
       o f a ''true and fair view."

Monitoring

10.    Project monitoring will take the following forms:

    0  Management oversight by the PIU; and

    0  Annual extemal audit o f the Project finances.


DisbursementArrangements

11.    Project funding will consist o f IDA Credit and Government's counterpart funds. The
following accounts will be maintained by Project:

    0  One Special Account totaling US$500,000 maintained inU S Dollars ina commercial
       bank acceptable to the Bank, into which initial deposit and replenishment from IDA
       funds will be located.

    0  A Current Account inDobras ina commercial bank to which drawdowns from the
       Special Account will be credited inrespect o f incurred eligible expenditures. The current
       account will only be usedto make payments inDobras, since the SA will be opened in
       USD. Inthis manner, theproject resources are not impactedbylocal currency
       fluctuations against U S dollar. Eachmonth depending on the frequency o f their financial
       operations, the project will forecast the estimated payments to be made and withdraw the
       total amount from the SA (inU S dollar) to the current account (inDobras) at a specified
       rate. Followingthe immediate payments inrespect o f those eligible expenditures, the
       balance on this account should be zero.

    0  Project Current Accounts inDobras ina commercial bank to which Government's
       counterpart funds will be deposited.

        individuals, regardless o f the amount o f the contract would be subject to prior review by
        the Bank.

Staffing

12.     The FinancialManagement staff o fthe PIUfor the PRMC-TA credit comprises a
professional with a University degree and experience inhandling financial management issues o f
Bank-financedprojects, but no formal training inAccounting.

3. Risk assessment

Country risks

13.     So far, a Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA) has not yet been
conducted. Therefore the risk o f waste, diversion and misuseo f funds cannot be assessed.
However, the overall project risk from a financial management perspective i s considered high
since Bank-financedprojects are very scarce inthe country andpublic sector i s characterized by
weak institutional capacity and limited financial resources.

Project risks

14.     The table below identifies the mainrisks faced bythe project and existing or potential
mitigations measures.

      management requirements. Inorder to establish an acceptable control environment and to
      mitigate financial management risks, various measures should be taken by the due dates as
      indicated inthe table below. The Project financial risk i s assessed as being moderate provided
      that the financial management arrangements are properly implemented and the financial
      management action plan i s adequately carried out.

General

1.      The Bank has neverconducted a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) in
SZo Tom6 and Principe. Two studies on the procurement of goods and services, were carried out
by national consultants in 1999 andby an international consultant in2001. Information extracted
from these studies i s summarized below:

    0   STP does not have a Public Procurement Code. Procurement procedures are regulated by
    the GovernmentalDecree (Portaria) 555/71 of 12 October, 1972 for Works, and Decree No.
    341 of August 29, 1972 for Goods and Services, enacted before the country's independence
    from Portugal in 1975.

    0   The rules o ftransparency are not assured under Decree No. 341/72.


    0   Allpurchases/acquisitions needto be approved bythe Cour des Comptes,which assesses
   the transparency o fthe process andthe existence of funds (from the nationalbudget). This
   tribunal, whose Organic Law No. 3/99 was publishedinAugust 1999, has been operational
    only since 2003.    .

    0  The Directorate General for the Treasury andPublic Assets (DGTP), responsible for
   procurement for the public administration, follows procedures of international partners like
   the World Bank, the African Development Bank or the EuropeanUnion. For smaller
   acquisitions, the ministries also follow these procedures.


   0   According to DGTP and the Chamber o f Commerce, corruption does not seem to be a
   major problem inSTP, specially because a control system (Cour des Comptes) has been
   established. Anti-corruption clauses inthe SZo Tom6 and Principe legal system, are currently
   being revised.

2.     Inthe context ofthe insufficiencies ofthe current Procurement systeminSZo Tom6 and
Principe, that may not be able to cope with the substantial influx o fpetroleum resources to the
country inthe near future, the WB mission recommendsa procurement assessment review. Such
reviewwould indicate actions leadingto a procurementreform inthe country.

Use of BankGuidelinesand StandardBiddingDocuments

3.     Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out inaccordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" datedMay
2004, andthe provisions stipulated inthe Legal Agreement. The general description o f various
items underdifferent expenditure category are describedbelow. For each contract to be financed


                                             - 49 -

bythe Loadcredit, the different procurement methodsor consultant selection methods,the need
for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed
between the Borrower and the Bank project team inthe Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan
will be updated at least annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project implementationneeds
and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

4.       Procurementof Works: Some minor constructionandrehabilitationworks for the
National Petroleum Agency will be financed under the PPF and under the project. Works
estimated to cost less thanUS$15,000 equivalent per contract, maybe procured under lump-sum,
fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis o f quotations obtained from three (3) qualified
domestic contractors inresponse to a written invitation.

5.       Procurementof Goods: Goods procuredunder this project would include vehicles,
office equipment, and Information and Communications Technologies (ITC) for the National
Petroleum Agency, the Ministry o f Planning and Finance and the Project CoordinationUnit.To
the extent possible, goods should be grouped into contract packages. Packages estimated to cost
the equivalent o fUS$150,000 or more should be procured under International Competitive
Bidding(ICB) or LimitedInternational Bidding(LIB)procedures. Procurementof goods
estimated to cost more than US$50,000, but less than US$150,000 will beprocured using
National Competitive Bidding(NCB) procedures. Goods estimated to cost less than US$50,000
will beprocuredby shopping on the basis o f comparisono f quotations from at least three eligible
and qualified suppliers. Requests for such quotations will include a clear description and quantity
of the goods, as well as the expected date andpoint o f delivery.

6.      The procurementwill be doneusingBank's Standard BiddingDocument (SBD) for all
ICB and LIB and National SBD agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank. Standard Bid
Evaluation Forms shall also be used.

7.      Selectionof Consultants: Consulting services and Trainingwill consist oftechnical
assistance, studies, audits to be carried out by national and international consultants. Consulting
firms for the assignments estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$50,000 or more will be selected
through the Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS). Consultants' services estimated to cost
less than the equivalent o f US$50,000 may be contracted by usingthe Consultants' Qualification
Selection (CQS). Auditors will be selected usingthe Least-Cost Selection procedures (LCS). In
case o f assignments requiringindividual consultants, the selection will follow the procedures
stipulatedinSection V o fthe Guidelinesfor the Selection and Employment of Consultants.

8.      Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent
per contract maybe composed entirelyo fnational consultants inaccordance with the provisions
of paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines. The Bank's standard requests for proposals, the
forms of contracts (lump-sum, time-based, and/or simplifiedcontracts for short-term assignments
and individual consultants) as well as the sample forms o f evaluation report for the selection o f
consultants will be used. All consultants contracts with an estimated value ofUS$lOO,OOO
equivalent or more for firms and US$50,000 equivalent or more for individual consultants would
be subject to prior review bythe Bank. And all Single Source consultants contracts for both
firms and individuals, regardless of the amount o f the contract would be subject to prior review
by the Bank.


                                              - 50 -

9.       OperationalCosts: which would be financed bythe project would beprocuredusing
the implementingagency's administrativeprocedures which were reviewed and found acceptable
to the Bank. "Operational costs means incremental expendituresincurred on account o f office
                                    "
supplies, vehicle operation and maintenance and communication, reasonable bank charges
relating to the operation o f the special account, rental expenses, office maintenance costs,
utilities, travel costs for project staff and salaries o f support contractual staff for the project.

10.      The Government will start the preparation o fnew national standard biddingdocuments
for the procurement o f goods, works and consultants' services. The models o fnational SBD will
be incorporated inthe Manual o fProcedures. The nationalbiddingdocuments canbeusedfor
National Competitive Bidding(NCB) once the Bank has verified and am-eedinwriting that the
procedures are acceptable. These procedures should ensure that: (i) will be advertised in
                                                                           bids
national newspapers with wide circulation; (ii) bid document clearly explains the bid
                                                    the
evaluation and award criteria; (iii) are given adequate response time (minimumfour
                                      bidders
weeks) to prepare and submit bids; (iv) bids will be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder and
not arbitrarily; (v) eligible bidders, including foreign bidders, will not beprecluded from
participating; and (vi) no domestic preference margins are applicable to domestic manufacturers
or suppliers.

Advertising

11.      A draft General Procurement Notice (GPN) shallbepreparedbythe Borrower before
negotiations. The GPN shall contain information about the Borrower, amount and purpose o f the
credit, scope o fprocurement, including I C B (ifapplicable) and a list o f large consulting
assignments. The Bank will arrange for its publication inDevelopment Business (UNDB online)
and inthe Development Gateway Market (dgMarket).

12.      Invitations to bid shall be advertised as Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) in at least
one newspaper o f national circulation inthe Borrower's country (or inthe official gazette, or in
an electronic portal with free access). Such invitations shall also be publishedin UNDB online
and indgMarket. Notification shall be given insufficient time to enable prospective biddersto
obtain the biddingdocuments andprepare and submit their responses.

Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

13.     The ImplementationUnit for the current PRMC-TAhas been designated as the PIUfor
the newproject. It is attached to the Ministry o fPlanning and Finance and it has an independent
budget.

14.     A procurement capacity assessment o fthis unitwas carried out duringand after thepre-
appraisal mission completed inApril 2004. The main findings o f the assessment were:

     0   Staff handling procurement have not received appropriate training.
     0  Absence o f an Operational Manual and a Procurement Plan.
     0  Lack o f familiarity with the national legislation on Procurement.

    0   Misunderstanding o f the Guidelineswhen selecting the methods for the procurement o f
        goods or the selection o f consultants, leadingto incorrect practices.

15.     The corrective measures which havebeenrecommended are:

        Recruit a Procurement Specialist. The WB mission, inagreement with the Social Sector
        Support Project(PASS) mission beingappraised at the time o f the capacity assessment,
        proposed to jointly use the services o ftheir recently hiredProcurement Specialist, who
        would then work three days for the PASS and two days for GCBP or vice versa. This
        option would be tested during the first six months o f the project (done inJune 2004).
        Train as soon as possible the Procurement Specialist for the PIU (done inApril/May
        2004). It i s also desirable that the Project Coordinator and the staff at the Petroleum
        Agency who participates inpetroleum contracting, receive training (done inJune 2004).

        Prepare a Manual o f Procedures and hold a clinic on its use with stakeholders o fthe
        project.

        Recruit an international expert familiar with Bank's procurement, who would act as a
        facilitator duringthe preparation and first months o f implementation o f the project, to
        assist the Unit inthe preparationo f the first contracts, the use o f the standard
        procurement documentation, as recommended inthe manual o f procedures, while at the
        same time, transferring knowledge to the staff. This same expert could later be hiredto
        conduct periodic visits to assess the progress o f the Unit andprovide recommendations.

        Ensurethat a transparent systemof evaluation for the award o fthe contracts is set up, that
        evaluation committees (permanent and ad hoc) are put inplace, andthat proper
        procedures for the preparation o f evaluationreports are consistently applied. Such a
        systemmustbe clearly explained inthe Manual o fProcedures.
        Use o f Bank's Standard Procurement Documents (bidding documents, request for
        proposals, guide for evaluation, standard model for shopping, etc.)

        Set up a centralized, user-friendly filing system as suggested during the pre-appraisal
        mission.
16.     The overall project risk for procurement i s high.

ProcurementPlan

17.     The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation
which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan, covering an initial period o f
18 months o fproject implementation, has been agreed between the Borrower andthe Project
Team on July 8,2004 and is available at the offices o fthe World Bank. The ProcurementPlan
will be updated inagreement with the Project Team annually or as requiredto reflect the actual
project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

18.     The use o f the methods definedinthe plan will be mandatory and subject to declaration
o f misprocurement.
