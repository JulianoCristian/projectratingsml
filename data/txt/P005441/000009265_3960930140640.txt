MEMO4RANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR AN AGRICULTURE SECTOR INVESTMENT LOAN
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Morocco for US$50 million is submitted for approval. The loan would be for
20 years including a five year grace period with interest at the standard
variable rate and wvuld finance part of the Government of Morocco's Agricuiture
Sector Investment Program.
2.          Background.  In response to mounting economic disequilibria in the
early 1980s, Morocco embarked upon a medium-term program of stabilization and
adjustment designed to reduce external and fiscal deficits and to reform the
underlying structure of key economic and social sectors.   As part of this
program, public investments were cut to control the fiscal deficit and the
Government embarked on a series of policy reforms at both sectoral and macro-
economic levels. The Bank has supported Government's reform program through,
inter alia, two agricultural sector adjustment loans (ASAL I, FY86 & ASAL II,
FY88) and a structural adjustment loan in FY89.
3.          The overall reform program has enjoyed considerable success and the
economy grew at a rate of about 4 percent p.a. in the second half of the 1980s.
Even more impressive was Morocco's growth rate in the agricultural sector which
accounts for some 16 percent of GDP and 30 percent of exports. Over the same
period, agricuizure grew at over 6 percent p.a. and has contributed almost a
third of real GDP growth.  In 1989, for the first time, agriculture exports
surpassed those of phosphates to become the leading source of foreign exchange
earnings. The impact of agriculture on the balance of payments was even greater
than indicated by the 4 percent p.a. export growth; the increase in domestic
agricultural output permitted a total reduction of 15 percent of agricultural
imports during the se  nd half of the eighties.  Tthere has also been a rapid
(over 15 percent p.a.) increase in private investments in agriculture. This
remarkable performance was helped by favorable weather but owes much to
successful implementation of policy reforms taken over the past several years.
4.          The sector, however, still has considerable untapped growth potential
and will, therefore, continue to play an important role i- Morocco's adjustment
and  growth  strategy.    The  Bank  and  the  Government  concur  that policy
interventions should now focus on the consolidation of macro-economic stability
and on the resumption of sustained investment growth. To support this, Bank
strategy is to move gradually from an emphasis on adjustment lending to
investment lendins.  The proposed Agriculture Sector Investment Loan (ASIL) is
consistent with this strategy in a sector where an adjustment program is already
successfully on track. The third and final tranche of the second Agricultural
Sector Adjustment Loan is expected to be released in the fall of 1991. The Gulf
crisis affected the macro-economic and fiscal stability through increased oil
prices (compensated by increased support from Kuwait, Saudi-Arabia and the other
Gulf States), loss of revenue from tourism, and other factors. These effects
are expected to be of short duration.

5.          The  two  agricultural  adjustment  operations  supporting  the
Government's Medium-Term Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program (MTASAP) aimed
to (a) liberalize the agricultural and food pricing, marketing and trade regimes,
while encouraging increases in productivity; (b) reorient the public expenditure
program towards quick-maturing investments; (c) streamline essential governmental
support services and transfer commercially viable ones to the private sector;
(d) improve the management of natural resources; and (e) strengthen institutional
capacity for sector policy formulation, analysis and performance monitoring.
Progress in implementing the MTASAP has been excellent so that Morocco now
generally has a highly favorable policy environment in the agricultural sector
to which farmers have responded well as demonstrated by the rapid growth rate
in agriculture since 1985. In a few selected areas, however, the reform process
is not yet complete and further Bank support will be needed to reach the final
MTASAP objectives.
6.          The Government has become  increasingly  aware  of the need  to
complement its sector policy reforms with reforms related to the investment
process. Considerable progress on investment issues has already been made under
the MTASAP: private investments in agriculture have increased rapidly, due in
part to recent policy reforms, and public investments are now being concentrated
in quick-maturing and high-return projects. The Government can now turn its
attention to improving investment efficiency, better targeting of public
investments in infrastructure and agricultural services, and continuing to ensure
a policy environment that stimulates private investments.
7.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Over the past several years, and
particularly during the recent Agricultural Expenditure Review (AER), the Bank
has worked closely with the Government to review and shape the public investment
program in the agricultural sector. The proposed ASIL would support the Ministry
of Agriculture's (MARA's) entire 1991-92 investment program of roughly
US$640 million. The ASIL would allow tbc Bank to continue to bring to bear its
experience, in Morocco and worldwide, in investment reviews and investment loans,
helping Morocco implement and monitor a sector investment program. Thus, the
Bank would continue to play a role in decisions about future agricultural
investment allocations, assisting in the orientation of expenditures towards sub-
sectors or activities of priority, and ersuring that investments meet specific
criteria such as positive economic rates of return, positive environmental
impacts and positive equity effects. The ASIL would also permit the Government
to avail itself of Bank expertise in undertaking institutional refcrms such as
improving the efficiency of budget execution. In addition, it would provide an
occasion for the Bank to encourage reforms on sensitive issues in key subsectors
not presently covered by Bank operations (land use policy, agricultural education
and livestock) and give additional leverage in irrigation, forestry and research
& extension supported through other Bank operations.
8.          Project Objectives.  Given the sound policy framework that exists in
the agricultural sector in Morocco following its successful period of aajustment,
the main need at this time is to improve the overall efficiency of Morocco's
investment program and to couple this with policy reforms in selected areas.
Consequently, the primary objective of the proposed loan is to support a well-
conceived investment program in Morocco's agricultural sector. The loan would
finance MARA's 1991-92 agricultural investment program, a program which is



-3
considered satisfactory by the Bank. In the past, investment allocations have
been low and subject to frequent budget cuts. Those funds that were included
in the budget were frequently not available on a timely basis, lowering actual
investment levels still further. Investments most at risk for cuts are those
not financed by donors, yet some of these investments constitute core activities
that are critical for rational development of the sector and for assisting the
poorer segments of the farming community.   The ASIL would help ensure the
financing of such activities.  It would also promote essential policy reform
measures to improve the investment process by focusing on efforts to ensure the
timely flow of funds, and improved monitoring and evaluation which is critical
for better project selection. Finally, the proposed ASIL would continue the
Bank's ongoing support for policy reforms in the irrigation and livestock
sectors; these two sectors contribute to the bulk of agricultural GDP; the
irrigation sector, moreover, consumes over half of MARA's budget expenditures.
9.          Proiect Description.   As already noted, the proposed ASIL would
provide support for MARA's overall investment program in the agricultural sector;
the whole of MARA's investment program would be based on selection criteria that
have been agreed witb the Bank.   The principal activities that the Bank would
finance include: small- and large-scale irrigation; crop diversification and area
development including roads; destoning and land consolidation; equipment for
plant protection; forest management plans and plantation establishment; and
technical equipment, vaccines and rangeland improvement for livestock. The ASIL
would also support a technology development program promoting (a) better soil
cultivation, seed-bed preparation and crop management through use of more
appropriate tractor-drawn farm implements; (b) more efficient small-scale
irrigation; (c) improved crop storage; (d) improved livestock production through
better stock and feeding; (e) fruit tree planting as part of crop diversification
measures; and (f) land improvement.
10.         The package of policy measures supported by the ASIL includes:
a)     improvements in the investment process in three general areas:
(i) budget execution (faster delegation of funds, better
monitoring of expenditures); (ii) institution building
(improving MARA's staffing and structure); and (iii) project
selection (use of objective criteria for all new MARA
investments);
b)     livestock sector reforms; and
c)     improved recovery of irrigation water charges.
11.         Program Costs and Financing.  The total cost of the program to be
supported by the proposed ASIL is some US$640 million. This amount includes on-
going projects supported by the Bank and other donors and which are already
inscribed in Morocco's 1991-92 agricultural investment program. The two-year
investment program also includes O&M and other recurrent costs items linked to
specific investments. Deducting Bank and other donor projects and recurrent
costs from the total cost of the program leaves a balance of US$135 million.
The proposed loan would be for an amount of US$50 million and would be equivalent
to the foreign exchange cost of this unfunded balance. Thus, the loan would



-4-
f nanee 8 percent of the cost of the Government's tctal two-year investment
program in agriculture. Retroactive financing of up to US$5 million would be
provided in order to allow a timely program start-up and would cover payments
for eligible expenditures made after July 1, 1990.
12.         The loan would be disbursed against a number of specific items in the
Government's investment budget, selected because: (a) they constitute priority
activities; (b) they do not benefit from anly external donor financing and thus
are at most risk from budget cuts; and (c) they are easy to disburse against.
The loan would not provide supplementary financing to substitute for Government
funds in foreign financed projects or programs, but would be disbursed against
items without any donor assistance. The project would disburse funds for civii
works; forest operations; equipment, tools, materials, farm inputs, breeder
animals and veterinary drugs; consultant services, studies and training; and for
the technology development program.   A breakdown of program costs and the
financing plan for MARA's budget are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Morocco are given in Schedules C and D respectively. Tho
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9240-NOR and dated July 29, 1991, is distributed
separately.
13.         Environmental Imoact.   The proposed ASIL has been classified a
Category B project. The environmental effects have been reviewed and found to
be generally positive and not in need of special monitoring except in some
limited cases. Such monitoring would be applied to investments in irrigation,
where for small-scale works, a system for environmental screening has already
been introduced, and where for large-scale structures an environmental assessment
is currently being carried out. Monitoring would also be applied in the area
of reforestation with regard to the use of exotic species. Other reforestation
investments would have positive environmental effects.    Land development
activities (such as land-levelling, destoning and road construction) would also
be screened following criteria similar to those for irrigation. MARA has already
established a committee chaired by the Secretary General to review all major
investment projects for environmental effects.
14.         Agreed Actions.   At negotiations,  agreement was obtained from
Government that it will take the following actions: (a) use criteria agreed with
the Bank in the selection of all new projects which require, inter alia, that
the ERR exceeds 12 percent or be justified on other grounds and, subsequently,
submit to the Bank, not later than September 30, 1991, MARA's draft agricultural
investment budget for 1992 for review and comment; (b) carry out the investment
and sectoral reform programs in accordance with an implementation plan
satisfactory to the Bank; the plan would include such measures as delegating
funds to agencies that make investments by certain target dates and reviewing
progress annually with the Bank; producing monthly monitoring data on budget
expenditures by certain target dates; executing an organizational study of MARA;
developing and implementing a strategy to further strengthen the livestock sector
and continue privatizing its services; improving accounting of irrigation water
charges and preparing a plan by January 31, 1992 to improve their recovery;
undertaking an impact study of the technology development program by December
31, 1992 and implementing the recommendations made by the study and agreed with
the Bank; and (c) maintaining a project coordinating committee and a budget



-5-
execution monitoring committee.
15.        fisenefita.  The project would help increase incomes in rural areas
through its support of investment in infrastructure and agricultural services.
This would, in turn, attract increased private sector investment in agriculture.
Projects with an ERR of less than 12 percent would not be included unless
Justified on other grounds.
16.         UI!Ss. The two major risks facing the project are Government failure
to provide adequate and timely budget funding and the institutional risk arising
from an entrenched bureaucracy resisting changes and inert to stimulus to improve
its performance. The timeliness risk is addressed directly by the ASIL through
measures to accelerate the delegation of funds. The risk of adequacy of funding
is reduced but not eliminated by the improved budget situation and because MARA's
budget would be part of the protected priority investments. To minimize the
institutional risk, the organizational reform program has been designed with
transparent and monitorable targets which would be closely supervised during
project implementation.
17.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
