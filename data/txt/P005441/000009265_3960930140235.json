       agricultural sector. The program being supported is a\n            1991-92 time-slice of the Government's total investment\n            program in agriculture. These include: small and large-scale\n            irrigation; crop diversification and area development\n            including roads; destoning, and land consolidation;\n            equipment for plant protection; forest management plans and\n            plantation establishment; and technical equipment, vaccines,\n            and rangeland improvement for livestock. It will also\n            finance technology development program promoting: (a) better\n            soil cultivation, seedbed preparation and crop management\n            through use of appropriate tractor-drawn farm implements,\n            (b) more efficient small-scale irrigation, (c) improved crop\n            storage, (d) improved livestock production through better\n            stock and feeding, (e) fruit tree planting as part of crop\n            diversification measures, and (f) land improvement."}, "docdt": "1991-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
