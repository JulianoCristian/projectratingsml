Chapter One
SOCIAL IMPACTS OF AMRP: NEED FOR
DETAILED RAP AND ITS COVERAGE
1.1    Background
The Ahmedabad Mehasana Road Project (AMRP) comprises of improving and
construction of SH 41 between Ahmedabad and Mehsana, in the state of Gujarat. The
project road runs a total length of 51.6 kms. The proposed alignment starts from Km.
19 near Adalaj and ends at 70.6 near the southern Municipal limit of Mehasana. This
section of the highway is a major link between Ahmedabad City and the oil and
industrial town of Mehasana. Adalaj, Sertha, Kalol, Chhatral, and Nandesan are the
prominent towns and villages along the main road.
The AMRP envisages widening and upgrading the existing 51.6-km of SH 41 to a
two-lane dual carriageway, with service roads on either side of the main road. Also a
11.5 km long spur road will be constructed, which will commence from Chhatral on
the main road and run northwest to the town of Kadi. The road at Km. 22 passes
through agricultural land and Sertha Village. Here the alignment is very poor with a
reverse curve within the village. The AMRP proposes to construct a 2.08 km long 60
meter wide duel carriage way By-pass road to the west of Sertha village to take the
traffic out of the village. Hence, the implementation of the bypass at Sertha Village
would entail acquisition of land.
The AMRP is being implemented on a Build, Operate, Own and Transfer (BOOT)
format by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) by the name and style of Ahmedabad
Mehasana Toll Road Limited (AMTRL), a joint company, formed by The
Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) and the Government of
Gujarat (GOG). The BOOT is a contractual arrangement whereby a project entity is
authorized to finance, construct, own, operate and maintain an infrastructure or a
facility for a specific fixed franchise period. The project entity is allowed to recover
the total investment and operation and maintenance costs plus a reasonable rate of
return through the collection of tolls/fees/rentals/user charges from the users of the
facility
1.2   Summary of Social Impacts Assessment Conducted during the Feasibility Study
During the planing stage a detailed Social Assessment' (SA) of the project was
undertaken along with the technical and environmental investigations. The objective
of SA was to minimise the adverse social impacts in terms of number of Project
Affected Persons (PAPs) as well as the intensity of the impacts; and to suggest
'Undertaken by Scott Wilson and Kirkpatrick India Pvt. Ltd. (August 1997)
3



44
mitigation measures by way of measures for restoring the socio-economic status of
the PAPs. As a first step, the SA examined alternate alignments to bypass the existing
congested road sections that would cause significant negative impacts. As a result a
2.08km bypass with a Right of Way (ROW) of 60m was proposed at Sertha village.
The salient features of the SA are summarised below:
*  The project required acquisition of 11.27ha of land from 76 plots at village
Sertha of which 9.54ha were privately owned agricultural lands belonging to 47
landowner Project Affected Families (PAFs). The land acquisition also included
1.73ha of Sertha grampanchayat and ONGC land
*  36 and 25 commercial squatters were identified within the ROW  on the
Ahmedabad-Mehasana main project road and Chhatral-Kadi spur road,
respectively. Since these squatters had setup their commercial activities in
response to consumer demand from the highway and the adjoining industries, it
was felt that relocation of these structures would lead to loss of livelihood. The
SA recommended shifting of the squatters to the edge of ROW such that their
income would not be affected. It was also proposed that the squatters would be
provided an assistance of Rs. 2000/- each towards the costs involved in shifting
and improving their appliances
* The total cost of mitigating the adverse social impacts due the project was
estimated at Rs. 19.47 million, which included a provision of Rs. 15.9 million for
replacement value of lands, Rs. 2.12 million towards cost of resettlement and
rehabilitation and Rs. 1.45 million for hiring of NGO and Monitoring and
Evaluation Agency
1.3   Objective of the Present Study
The preparation of implementable RAP under the present study was undertaken with
the onus of filling the gaps in the SA and update its findings. Specifically, the study
aimed at identification of all PAPs (100 per cent coverage) having interest in
properties and land to be acquired for the project and collection of recent socio-
economic and other relevant data to facilitate development of RAP in consonance
with the SA recommendations. The overall assignment had the following sub-
components:
*  To obtain and record the final status of LA in the project area.
*  To confirm that all such notified plots of land optimally meet the project
requirements
*  To confirm  through field surveys, discussions with villagers and their
representatives that all rightful owners and persons having interest in the said
land have been correctly identified and compensated; and highlight and details of
any disputed cases
*  Determine the replacement value for the land acquired in project villages based
on the location, type and use of land and reach consensus with the PAPs on
economic assistance in lieu of loss of land
4



55
*  Based on data pertaining to post LA land holding, extent of loss, economic status
grouping PAPs into relevant categories and developing the entitlement package
for all PAPs to ensure restoration of their economic status within a stipulated
period and
*  To prepare the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) for the
project, which will provide details of implementation strategy, time frame,
budget, institutional framework for implementation and monitoring and
evaluation, of the RAP
1.4   Present Status of RAP Implementation
At the time of submitting this report construction activity has begun along a
considerable length of the project road. However, at this stage no commercial
squatters have been displaced. The government has completed the land acquisition
and lands have been transferred to AMTRL. AMTRL is in the process of disbursing
the rehabilitation and relocation assistance and is undertaking construction of
community structures as detailed out in this document

LAND ACQUISITION - STATUS, EXTENT AND IMPACTS
2.1    LAND REQUIREMENT FOR THE PROJECT
The existing ROW of 60m is sufficient for construction and upgradation of the
project road, except at Sertha village where a bypass is proposed as an alternative.
The bypass, which passes through2 72 revenue plots, would require a land area of
12.1067 ha comprising predominantly private agricultural lands. Of the 72 plots, 65
are private lands owned by 79 families and the rest of the plots belong to Sertha
Grampanchayat, ONGC and Gandhinagar Collectorate. Table 2.1 gives the area of
lands acquired for the bypass under various categories of ownership
L________     Table 2.1: Land Requirement Details

2.2   STATUS OF LAND ACQUISITION PROCEEDINGS AT SERTHA
The Roads & Buildings divisional Executive Engineer initiated the LA proceedings
by submitting the land plan schedules indicating the details of the land required to
Gandhinagar District LAO. The LAO initiated the proceedings with the publication
of notification u/s-4 (1) under the LA Act on July 28, 1997. The LA proceedings
were further processed u/s 6 and 9 between September 1997 and February 2000 and
the final award was declared during March 2000. Table 2.2, gives details of the
private lands acquired from the titleholders named in the award list. However, land in
rural areas is often passed on from one generation to the other without updating the
land records. As a result, though the land is physically divided between inheritors the
titleholder in the award list maybe the ancestor or the eldest inheritor. Therefore,
necessary care has been taken to also identify the inheritor and Project Affected
Person/Family who actually possess and enjoy the land rights. The details in this
respect are given in Table 2.2 column 4 and 5 respectively. The final award list is
attached as Appendix 1
2 The lands acquired for the project marginally differ from those estimated at the time of SA and
summarized in the previous chapter

2.3    COMPENSATION RATES:
The compensation rates awarded by the Government of Gujarat for land acquired in
the village Sertha is based on the registered price of land in respective areas over the
past three years. Accordingly, the revenue department has declared compensation at
the rate of Rs. 1,00,000 per hectare for agricultural lands which including the
solatium at 30 per cent and the interest at 12 per cent per annum for 29 months on the
land value since the date of notification under section 4(1) amounts to Rs.1,59,000
per hectare

2.4 IMPACTS OF LAND ACQUISITION
2.4.1   Loss of Private Agricultural Land
Total private agricultural land being acquired due to this project is 8.8553 ha
comprising of 65 plots, affecting 79 families3. As a first step of the exercise, the
socio- economic data of the PAFs was analysed to identify PAFs who are primarily
dependent on agriculture. The observations are presented in Table 2.5. Out of 79
families, 2 families do not reside at Sertha or in nearby villages. This indicates that
their livelihood is not affected by land acquisition. The impact of LA for the project
on the PAFs has been evaluated using two criteria. The first criterion is based on a
comparison of pre and post land holdings, with respect to Minimum Economic
Landholding (MEL4). The PAFs were classified based on their pre and post
landholding sizes. The aim being to identify no. of families which move to a lower
classification as a result of LA. The distribution of PAFs under the different
categories is given in Tables 2.3
Table 2.3: Impact on Size of Landholding Due to Land Acquisition*
Size of                   Number of PAFs
Landholding             Pre LA              Post LA
>2MEL                 20                 18
MEL - 2MEL                 20                  22
<MEL                 39                  39
*  LA for the project does not result in increased number of PAFs having post LA
land holding less than the Minimum Economic Landholding (MEL), considered
to be the most vulnerable group. However, a large number of PAFs having pre
LA landholding less than MEL have also lost land, and these families will require
economic rehabilitation for restoration of their income
* There is no significant increase (pre LA-20 and post LA-22) in number of
families having post LA holding between MEL and 2 times the MEL.
The second criterion is based on the percentage of loss in size of landholding of each
PAF due to LA. The details are presented in Table 2.4
3One of the plots of land being acquired belongs to Sertha school
4MEL: Minimum Economic landholding is the size of plot that enables the cultivator to maintain an economical status just above
poverty line. The MEL in the project site is estimated as IHa of irrigated land or 2Hla. of unirrigated land (average expenses and
income from agricultural activities is presented in Appendix 2).

>50%                            6             7.7
* From the above tables it is evident that majority of the PAFs (57 of 79) lose less
than 15% of their land holding. Specific technical interventions can make good
for the loss by increasing agricultural productivity. Real loss of agricultural
income is therefore limited to approximately 25% of the families affected by the
project
2.4.2  Loss of Agricultural Income:
There could be an economic impact on a family due to the land acquisition, as the
lands are agricultural lands and agriculture is a traditional source of income or
livelihood in this village. Paddy is gROWn as kharif crop and wheat/ mustard as a
rabi crop. Agricultural income has been estimated as Rs. 40,000/ha/year for PAFs
owning irrigation sources, tractor and gROWing three crops per year and Rs.30,
000/ha/year for PAFs not owning irrigation sources, tractor and gROWing two crops
per year. The details for the estimates have been presented in Appendix-2. The extent
of impact would depend on the size of the pre LA land holding as well as the land
area acquired for the project. The socio-economic details presented in Table 2.5
reveal that with respect to loss in agricultural income
*  One PAF suffers an agricultural income loss of more than Rs.25,000 (PAF no.
10), however LA does not render this PAF vulnerable as his post LA income is
estimated to be above twice poverty line (2PL)
*  Three PAFs will suffer loss of agricultural income in the range of Rs. 15000 - Rs.
25,000 (PAF no.s 45, 47 and 77). Of these PAF nos. 45 and 47 are not rendered
vulnerable and retain income levels above 2PL after LA.
2.4.3  Loss of Private Structures and Utilities
The land acquisition for the bypass will affect three irrigation wells and one
farmhouse with a small temple. The irrigation wells are defunct and are not used by
the farmers. The farmhouse made of brick work in mud is currently used for storing
farm implements and as a cattle shed, which has been acquired, and GoG has paid Rs.
58,080. A small temple is also located within the farmhouse which will be
reconstructed by AMTRL. However, the livelihood of the farmhouse owner, Shanaji
17

Shankarji, listed under block no. 1733 will not be affected due to LA, as the land
acquired is a marginal area of 0.2705ha out of 2.4595ha.
2.4.4 Loss of Community Structures and Utilities
A community cattle drinking water trough and a marginal part of the village water
tank (open) will be affected due to LA. The proposed bypass will also sever the two
of the village cart tracks
2.5 IMPACT OF ROW CLEARANCE
2.5.1 Commercial Squatters
The current 60m ROW of the road is sufficient for construction of the project.
However, 36 and 23 commercial squatters have been identified (during SA)5 within
the ROW of the main road and the spur road, respectively. The list of these structures
is presented as Appendix 3
These are temporary wooden structures comprising of tea-stalls, vegetable vending,
cigarette shops, automobile repair shops and set up in response to the consumer
demand from highway traffic and the adjoining industries. The space occupied by
these squatters on an average is about 50sqft and in no instance exceeds 100sqft. The
owners of these structures will lose the source of their income if these structures are
removed without appropriate rehabilitation
It was observed that since the time of undertaking the SA in 1997, in a few sections
of the road, commercial development had taken place. This has led to an increase in
number of commercial squatters within these stretches. Whereas, most of the road
length did not attract such commercial activities and no new commercial squatters
were observed. Since considerable time has passed from the date of documentation of
commercial squatters in the SA, it has been decided to update the list of commercial
squatters, just prior to physical relocation necessary for road construction and
consider them as PAFs
2.5.2 Residential Structures
The clearing of ROW will affect 13 residential structures encroaching into the ROW
and 4 residential squatters located within the ROW. The list of these structures are
presented in Appendix 4. The ROW clearance will render squatters homeless,
necessitating relocation. However, the residences encroaching the ROW will not be
significantly affected as only a small portion of the structures encroaching the ROW
will be demolished.
5These numbers are as on August 1997, as recorded in the final detailed feasibility oreport by the
consultants - Scot Wilson.

2.5.3  Community Utilities and Structures
The community structures and utilities that need to be relocated as part of ROW
clearance includes shifting of 16 temples, five roadside drinking water posts, three
toilet blocks and 15 bus stops.

Chapter Three
ENTITLEMENT FRAMEWORK AND THE RAP
3.1   Introduction
AMTRL's E&S policy for R&R is based on the Environmental and Social Report of
IL&FS, and follows the three principles
(i)          Prevent adverse social situation
(ii)         Mitigate possible adverse social impacts; and
(iii)        Enhance the quality of life in and around the project
The Social Assessment (SA), which was undertaken with an aim to minimise the
impact of the project on the PAFs, examined alternate alignments to bypass
congested road sections. Therefore, the first principle was taken into consideration
during the SA itself. The present study carried out with an aim to develop an
implementable RAP takes into account the second and third principle of the ESR, by
detailing out the rehabilitation assistance measures entitled to each PAF and the
institutional arrangements and mechanisms that will ensure timely and effective
implementation of the R&R related activities
3.2.1  Entitlement Framework - Basic Considerations
As a result of land acquisition, the affected population is subjected to a range of
socio-economic impacts. Most significantly affected families are those, who lose all
or a considerable portion of their assets to the project. Rehabilitation by way of
physical replacement of the assets may be the only effective means of compensating
such families. The families that lose only partial assets may be able to continue their
present occupation albeit with diminished income. The mitigation measures for such
families will involve an assessment of their losses and provision for timely and
adequate compensation to overcome the losses
The form of assistance should also depend upon the extent of loss; and economic and
social vulnerability of the PAFs. The PAFs, who retain a substantial part of their
assets after the LA and who have a demonstrable capacity to invest money
productively, can be compensated by one time payment of cash. In the rest of the
cases, the mitigation measures need to strike a balance between immediate and long-
term needs of the PAFs. This can be achieved by providing a cash compensation for
partially replacing the lost assets, a maintenance allowance to provide relief for
immediate loss of income and a compensation by way of income generating scheme
(IGS) and training to rebuild the lost earning capacity of the PAF. The actual
mechanism and amount of resettlement and rehabilitation assistance for the PAFs is
determined by way of developing a family level entitlement package that accounts for
the losses suffered by the family as well as its ability to make effective use of the
assistance
24



2525
The entitlement framework also needs to be sensitive to the special needs and
limitations of squatter families. If not adequately provided for these families could be
worst affected by the project as they are solely dependent on the economic
opportunities near the area of their settlement and project induced displacement
leaves them with very limited opportunities for restoring their income.
3.2.2  Definitions
Project Affected Person
Project Affected Person (PAP) under the current project assignment refers to every
person affected by the project implementation through acquisition of land and/or
other properties.
In the context of this assignment for the Sertha By-pass Road component of the
Project, the following may be the possible categories of PAPs/ PAFs:
(i)           Who lose agricultural land
(ii)          whose livelihood/trade/occupation is affected
(iii)         who lose access to common property / resources
(iv)          others found / reported as affected by the project
The Cut -Off Date
For identification of PAPs and determining their entitlement for lands and assets
falling on newly acquired lands for the project, the date of 4(1) notification, i.e. July
28, 1997 will be deemed as the cut-off date.
For identification of squatter PAPs owning commercial or other structures within the
previously existing ROW of 60m, a fresh survey will be under taken just prior to the
beginning of construction, while implementing the RAP and the date of such survey
will be deemed as the cut-off date. Following this survey regular monitoring of
project ROW will be undertaken by the SPV, inorder to control further inflow of
squatters within the ROW
3.3    Methodology to Determine Entitlement for a Loss Category
The objective of the RAP is to ensure that the socio-economic status of PAFs is
maintained or improved. The desired improvement in income levels is especially
relevant in case of below poverty line6 (BPL) PAFs. However, it is also important
that the level of assistance is equitable and does not cause resentment among the
PAFs due to perceived discrimination.
6 For this report the poverty line has been pegged at Rs 30,000/- for a fanily size of 5.
25



2626
The entitlement of the PAFs, therefore, is determined by identifying the applicable
category of losses, estimating their quantum and assessing the potential socio-
economic impact due to the loss. The level and mechanism of assistance by way of
compensation (monetary and in kind) is then decided to ensure that the income
restoration/enhancement objectives of RAP are achieved. The following section
presents the reasoning and the entitlement framework developed for different
categories of losses suffered by the PAFs due to acquisition of property and assets
by the project
3.4.   Entitlement for Loss of Agricultural Lands
The 'land for land' option for PAFs having valid title or customary or usufruct right
for their acquired land is considered as the most appropriate way to compensate the
agricultural PAFs. However, unavailability of surplus agricultural land in the
project village makes this option difficult to implement. Also the small plots
acquired from individuals PAFs cannot be replaced due to lack of contiguous lands
to supplement the land lost and purchase of such small plots at different places
would not be economically viable. In such case compensating for the loss of land at
replacement value is considered appropriate and is acceptable to the PAFs
3.4.1 Determination of Replacement Value for Lands
It is generally observed that the registered values for the lands are lower than
their replacement values. As a result, the compensation rates determined by the
government based on the registration value are also lower than the replacement
value. The PAFs, therefore, do not get adequate compensation to replace their
lost assets.
Since the lands have already been acquired by the government and compensation
paid, for adequate replacement of their assets the project provides the difference
between the replacement value and the government compensation, as
Rehabilitation Assistance (RA) to PAFs. The payment of RA to PAFs will
however be subject to handing over the lands to the Project Company, free from
any title litigation and court cases against the award by LAO.
With the objective of determining replacement value, an informal survey was
conducted to collect information on land prices in the bypass area. Sertha Talati,
Sarpanch, sellers and buyer in the vicinity were contacted for this purpose.
During the survey it was observed that there was only a single transaction in the
past two years in Sertha village. However, the prices in the nearby villages
provided the Project Authority a general idea of prevailing land prices and
variations thereof. *
The PAFs were consulted through series of Public Information and Consultations
to reach a consensus on replacement value of land. After extensive discussions
26



2727
with the PAFs, a final value of Rs. 8,50,000/- per hectare 7was arrived at as
replacement cost of the land. The photographs of the PICs held in Sertha are
included as Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2. As an outcome of the deliberations, the
people agreed to withdraw the court cases as a pre-condition to receiving the
Rehabilitation Assistance (RA) from the Project Company
3.4.2  Vulnerable Groups
The PAFs below poverty line (pre as well as post LA), women headed families
and families with physically or mentally handicapped members have been
considered as vulnerable group of PAFs. These PAFs need to be provided with a
special guidance to use the RA effectively to establish a suitable Income
Generation Activity (IGA) that brings the family above poverty line. The
experience of implementing the IGAs shows that for success of such schemes
motivated participation of PAFs is necessary.
In order to generate wholehearted support from the PAFs, an incentive
mechanism by way of a financial reward on achieving the target income
generation has been built in IGA implementation. The reward will be capital cost
of IGA, up to a ceiling of a pre-determined amount on successfully achieving the
target income level of selected IGA. Also the vulnerable PAFs shall be provided
with maintenance allowance per month during the first year of IGA operation.
3.4.3  Entitlement Package
Considering the above guiding principles and the severity of impacts due to land
acquisition, the entitlement package has been determined taking in to account the
percentage loss of landholdings and post-LA income levels. While determining
the entitlement package the following two categories have been considered
1.    The loss of landholdings up to 15% is considered as minor loss, where
agricultural interventions can make good for the loss by increasing agricultural
productivity.  In such cases, Rehabilitation Assistance (RA) in cash plus
guidance for improved agricultural produce will be provided. In case of the
PAFs who are below PL under this category will be provided with Income
Generating Activities (IGA) to generate one fourth the PL income.
2.    In cases where loss of landholdings is above 15 % the agricultural
interventions cannot offset the income from loss of productive land. The PAFs
7 Rs. 1,59,000/- per hectare has already been paid by the government as part of the LA procedure.
Therefore, the Rehabilitation Assistance per hectare works out to Rs. 6,91,000/-
27



2828
under this category are further classified as: (i) PAFs with income above 2PL (ii)
PAFs having income between 1 and 2PL and (iii) the PAFs whose income levels
are below poverty line. While the PAFs under category (i) will be provided with
RA in cash, the PAFs in category (ii) and (iii) will be provided with IGAs
generating one fourth and half the PL incomes respectively
The IGAs for the eligible PAFs will be provided using part or full amount of RA.
The implementation of IGA will also have a provision for an incentive to PAFs
to run the IGAs diligently. Accordingly, an amount, not exceeding the cost of
IGA or Rs2O,000/-for PAFs being provided with IGA generating one half the PL,
and not exceeding Rs. 10,000/- for PAFs being provided with IGA generating one
fourth the PL will be reimbursed to the PAFs on achieving targetted performance
of IGAs. The incentive will be paid in two installments over three years if the
family runs the IGA successfully, earning the projected income levels. In case of
below PL PAFs, an additional maintenance allowance per month per family will
be paid for an year, by which time the income flow from IGA is expected to
stabilise

3.5     Entitlement for Loss of Structures
Private: The land acquisition for the bypass will affect two irrigation wells and one
farmhouse with a small temple. The irrigation wells are defunct and are not used by
the farmers. A small temple is also located within the farmhouse. The cost of the farm
house has been paid by the Revenue department. The owner of the structure has
opted for replacement of the temple
8 From agricultural experts, it is understood that up to 15% of loss of agricultural land, specific technical
interventions can make good for the loss by way of increasing productivity from agriculture
29

Community: A community cattle drinking water trough and a marginal part of the
village water tank, will be affected due to LA The extent and impact of the loss will
be evaluated with the help of an engineer and alternative solutions will be made good
by the Project Company.
3.6    Entitlement to Squatters Within the Row
Commercial Squatters: 59 commercial squatters were identified to be within the
ROW of the main road and the spur road, respectively at the time of SA. Since then
an increase of such squatters in a few road stretches which have attracted significant
commercial development has been observed. Informal observations indicate that such
increase will not be more than double the numbers observed during the DFIBR study.
These commercial ventures have been set up in response to the consumer demand
from highway traffic and the adjoining industries. Removal of these structures would
lead to economic loss to the families dependent on these commercial activities.
An informal interaction in this regard with the squatters revealed that that the
squatters prefer self-relocation option in the nearby place with necessary shifting
allowance from the company. Considering this observation, it is proposed to provide
a self-relocation measure, where, market value of the land occupied by the squatter;
in addition, shifting allowance will be paid. The maximum assistance for self-
relocation is estimated9 at Rs.5000/-  In case if the structures are beyond the
formation width of the project road, the structure will be allowed to continue
However, in some cases where the lands outside the ROW are occupied by industries
or commercial sector, it may not be possible self-relocation by the commercial
squatters in the visinity of their original location. In such case, it is possible that the
income from the business is impacted over a transitional period. In such cases it may
be necessary to provide a rehabilitation assistance to the squatters on the case to case
basis. The exact measures for such assistance will be determined during the RAP
implementation. The expenditure towards this head is expected to be marginal and
will be met from R&R contingency
Residential Structures: The clearing of ROW will affect 13 residential structures
encroaching ontothe ROW and 4 residential squatters located within the ROW at
Kalol. The residences encroaching the ROW will not be significantly affected as
only a small portion of the structures encroaching the ROW will be demolished. The
residences have considerable area behind the structures for expansion. Also the
owners have agreed for demolition of the encroached part of the structure, on
payment of the actual value of the demolished structure. In case of residential
squatters, the affected families opted for self-relocation on payment of compensation
for the structures currently occupied by them. The compensation for these squatter
PAFs will be paid once they identify structures for self-relocation. The names of the
9 The maximum area of the squatter is about lOi2, cost of land is assumed to be three times the market
value at Sertha village, i.e. Rs. 250/- per Sq.mtr. and an additional allowance up to Rs. 2500/- is considered
for shifting and improving their tools of the trade
30

residential PAFs and the compensation value of the respective structures is presented
in Appendix 4
Community Utilities and Structures: The community structures and utilities that
need to be relocated as part of ROW clearance includes shifting of 16 temples, 5
roadside drinking water posts, and 15 bus stops. The following measures are planned:
*  Temples: 3 of the 16 temples are personal temples while the rest are community
owned. Discussions held with the focus groups revealed that the people would
prefer to shift the temple as per the village customs with assistance from the
company. Therefore, it is proposed that the Project Company will provide
construction material and cash assistance for relocation
*  Bus Stands: All these bus stands have been taken into consideration in the
designing of the project road configuration and bus bays have been provided with
*  Drinking Water Stand Posts, Hand Pumps and Toilet Blocks: 5 drinking
water posts and three toilet blocks need to be relocated as part clearance of
formation width for construction of road. The public utilities will be shifted
outside the RoW of the project road
3.7    Rehabilitation Action Plan
Based on the above discussions the following are the RAP components for this
project.
1. Rehabilitation Assistance for loss of agricultural lands and income
2. Identification of vulnerable families and provisions for
* Income generation schemes
3. Rehabilitation assistance for loss of assets
*  Private
* Community
4. Rehabilitation for loss caused due to ROW clearance
* Commercial Squatters
* Community structures
The above have been detailed out in the following section
3.7.1  Rehabilitation Assistance for Loss of Agricultural Lands and Income:
The landowning PAFs are to be compensated at the replacement value of their lands.
This objective of RAP is achieved by adding a rehabilitation assistance to the
compensation paid by the government. A provision has been made to assure that
PAFs all together receive an amount of Rs. 8,50,000 per ha of land acquired which is
considered as appropriate compensation by the PAFs for their loss of agricultural
lands. The detailed family-wise entitlement towards this head is presented in Table
3.2. A budgetary provision of Rs. 61,19,289/- has been made to meet this expenditure

The socio-economic survey's findings have been further analyzed to determine the
vulnerable families. The following are the salient observations and recommendations
in this context
*  55 PAFs who lose less than 15% of their land holding and are above poverty line.
These PAFs will be provided with RA in cash and specific guidance for improved
agricultural practices.
*  4 PAFs losing less than 15% of their land holding, and having post LA income
below PL have been considered as vulnerable, and will be provided with IGA
using part or full amount of RA to generate PL4 income. These PAFs will be
provided with maintenance allowance for a year @ Rs. 350/family per month
*  8 PAFs losing more than 15 % of their land holding, and having post LA income,
between 1-2 PL will be provided with IGA using part or full amount of RA to
generate PL/4 income.
*   1 PAF losing more than 15% of their landholding, and having post LA income
below PL will be provided with IGA using part or full amount of RA to generate
PL/2 income. The PAF will be provided with maintenance allowance for a year
@ Rs. 700/ family per month
A detailed vulnerability analysis has been carried out based on the entitlement
package, and the extent to which individual families are affected by the project has
been determined. The R&R measures are presented in Table 3.3

3.8 Rehabilitation Assistance for Loss of Assets:
Private: The land acquisition for the bypass will affect three irrigation wells and one
farmhouse made of brickwork in mud. The irrigation wells are defunct and are not used by
the farmers and the same are valued by GoG and compensated.. The farmhouse has been
acquired, and GoG has paid Rs. 58,080, which has been excepted by the PAF. A small
temple is also located within the farmhouse. The private temple will be relocate by AMTR.
Community: A community cattle drinking water trough and a marginal part of the village
water pond will be affected due to LA The extent and impact of the loss will be evaluated
with the help of an engineer and alternative solutions will be made good from the project.
The proposed bypass will severe two of the village cart tracks. The following measures are
planned to minimise these impacts:
35



3636
*  Construction of a cattle trough
* Provision of an underpass at the southern end of the village and cattle crossing on the
northern part for uninterrupted movements on village cart tracks
*  Deepening of the Village water tank by desilting and thereby increasing the water
holding capacity
Commercial Squatters: The commercial squatters will be paid up to Rs. 5000 for relocation.
A provision of Rs. 5,90,000 has been made for 118 squatters. Those squatters who are unable
to effectively exercise the self-relocation option due to locational constraints will be assisted
by way of rehabilitation assistance from project contingency (R&R budget). The detailed
measures will be determined by the implementing social consultant/NGO
Residential Structures: In case of residential encroachment the encroached part is valuated
and compensation for this works out to Rs. 12,98,172/-. The residential squatters, who have
opted for self-relocation, the compensation amount works out to Rs.1,46,780/-
Community Utilities and Structures: The community structures and utilities that need to be
relocated as part of ROW clearance includes shifting of 16 temples, 5 roadside drinking
water posts, and 15 bus stops. The following measures are planned:
D  Temples: 3 of the 16 temples are personal temples while the rest are community owned.
Discussions held with the focus groups revealed that the people would prefer to shift the
temple as per the village customs with assistance from the company. Therefore, it is
proposed that the Project Company will provide construction material and cash assistance
for relocation
*  Bus Stands: All these bus stands have been taken into consideration in the designing of
the project road configuration and bus bays have been provided with
*  Drinkin2 Water Stand Posts, Hand Pumps and Public Toilet Blocks: The public
utilities will be shifted outside the RoW of the project road
3.9   Institutional Framework
For the purpose of implementing the RAP an independent full time social consultant will be
appointed. The specific tasks of the social consultant being:
*  Creating awareness and facilitating community development for implementing economic
and social rehabilitation Package
*  Assist PAFs in getting their RA for their land
*  Ensure proper utilisation of RA as available under the R&R package for vulnerable
families requiring IGA
*  Help PAPs in redressal of their grievances relating to LA and economic rehabilitation
*  Assist PAPs in IGA selection, effective working and uplifting their standard of living
The cost of engaging a social consultant has been budgeted at Rs. 8,00,000 .
36



3737
An external monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) consultant, appointed by AMTRL will review
the implementation of RAP. The M&E consultant will review the RAP implementation for a
period of 90 person days spread over 2 years. Rs. 6,00,000 has been budgeted towards cost of
appointing an external M&E consultant
3.10 Time Frame
In the present context the RAP will be implemented over a period of 6 months.
Months 1-3: Rapport building with PAFs and withdrawal of cases. Relocation of structures
is also expected to begin in the first month
Months 4-6: Continuation of relocation of structures. Disbursement and of replacement
amounts to the respective PAFs. Implementation of IGAs

3.11   Monitoring of Implementation Progress
ESMG will monitor and evaluate the progress of RAP at the end of each quarter and will submit a
report on the same, to the Project Company and Bank for review and comment. A quarterly
progress report format has been developed to monitor both physical and financial indicators
of RAP implementation progress. Refer Appendix-5. The format will present a clear
picture of progress made with respect to the targets indicated as per the action plan.
However, the targets as per the action plan listed in the attached format may change at the
time of actual implementation. Any such deviation will be highlighted with reasons for
the same at the time of submission of progress reports
