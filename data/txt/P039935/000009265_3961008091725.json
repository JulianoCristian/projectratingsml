Private\n            Infrastructure Finance Project are to: 1) develop prototype\n            contractual arrangements for private investment in the\n            Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited's\n            (IL&FS) areas of involvement, thereby facilitating entry\n            of the private sector on a much larger scale in areas\n            heretore dominated by the public sector; 2) build up\n            India's capacity to attract private investment in\n            infrastructure, pilot-test institutional and contractual\n            arrangements in a variety of subprojects under various\n            administrative and political conditions, and help establish\n            a track record as a prerequisite for large scale private\n            investment in the sector; 3) meet the pressing needs of\n            commercial infrastructure project entities for long-term\n            rupee financing; 4) foster efficiency in the delivery and\n            use of selected infrastructure services; 5) encourage the\n            establishment of more efficient practices in the\n            construction and operation of infrastructure project; and 6)\n            assist in alleviating the severe financial and institutional\n            constraints to the expansion of infrastructure in India. The\n            project consists of three interrelated components: 1) an\n            investment component in the form of a line of credit to\n            IL&FS; 2) a subproject preparation component, which will\n            cover specialized consultancy services; and 3) a training\n            and technical assistance component, which will include: (a)\n            IL&FS's staff development for its staff; and (b)\n            specific studies that IL&FS is undertaking to facilitate\n            the evaluation and implementation of commercial\n            infrastructure projects."}, "docdt": "1996-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
