in\n            India. It is developing a pipeline of commercially viable\n            projects which includes urban by-passes, mass transit\n            systems, water and sanitation infrastructure and integrated\n            area development. IL&FS recognizes the need to clearly\n            demonstrate its commitment to environmental and social\n            issues in each of its projects. This report, the\n            environmental and social report (ESR), presents IL&FS\n            environmental and social policy and operational procedures.\n            It is a core document of the Institution for its\n            infrastructure activities. Its purpose and aim is to provide\n            IL&FS an overall framework to guide it in the\n            identification, assessment and management of environmental\n            and social concerns at the project and organizational\n            levels. The report comprises three parts: 1) part I states\n            IL&FS commitment to responding to environmental and\n            social issues; 2) part II (Procedures) provides the process\n            by which IL&FS will ensure that each of its\n            infrastructure projects is in compliance with its policy;\n            and 3) part III (Organizational Requirements) outlines\n            IL&FS organizational structure to administer the ESR. It\n            outlines the organizational support and staff development\n            plan proposed to be implemented and the interfaces that it\n            will put in place, especially in relation to Multilateral\n            Agencies such as the World Bank."}, "docdt": "1998-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
