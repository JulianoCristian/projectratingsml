1.0   EXECUTIVE SUMNIARY
1.1  Backgrouind
The Ahmnedabad-Mahesana road which links Ahmedabad with Mahesana, a major oil
town, north of Ahmedabad, has been prioritised as a strategic link by the Roads and
Buildings Department, Government of Gujarat (GoG), which needs to be improved in the
near fiuture. The Roads and Buildings Department, Government of Gujarat (GoG) is
rcsponsiblc lor construclion, operation and maintenance of roads in Gujarat. R & B
department of GoG is keen to widen/strengthen the existing Ahmedabad - Mahesana
Section of State Highway 41, including Kadi - Kalol link, on a commercial basis. GoG
has entered into an Agreement with Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited
(IL&FS) to develop, implement and operate this roads . The proposed alignment starts
from Km. 19 near Adalaj and ends at Km. 70.25 near Mahesana. This section of the
highway is a major link between Ahmedabad City on one end and the oil and industrial
town of Mahesana on the other end. The stretch is highly congested causing significant
delays to traffic using the road.
A pre-feasibility study commissioned by GoG Snd IL&FS has established the preliminary
viability of the proposed project, including strengthening of the existing road and
widening it to a 4-lane road. Further, IL&FS has commnissioned Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick
India Pvt. Ltd. (SWK) in association with Rail India Transport and Economic Services
(RITES), on behalf of GoG to undertake a detailed techno-economic feasibility study and
environment and social assessment of the project road.
1.2   Project Details
The Ahmedabad-Mahesana Road (SH-41) is a major link between Ahmedabad City and
Mahesana.  Whilst the road passes through agriculture areas, there are numerous
industrial units existing along the road. The project road runs a total length of 51.25
Krns. A 11.5 Km long Spur from Kalol to Kadi takes off from this road at Chhatral
village. The project includes the strengthening and widening of the existing carriageway
to 4 lanes and widening as a single carriageway of the Kadi-Kalol link road to 2 lanes. At
Km 10 on existing Ahmedabad - Mahesana Road, the road to Gandhinagar forms a T
junction. National Highway 8C crosses the alignment at Km 18 followed by a railway
bridge at Km 19. Northwards, the road at Km 22 passes through agriculture land and
Sertha viUlage. Here the existing alignment is poor with a reverse curve within the village.
A new by-pass about 2.5 Kms long is proposed to the west of the village. At Km 28, a
by-pass to Kalol Town commences and a four lane, dual carriageway, starts immediately
after this. At Km 31, a road leading to Vijapur on the National Highway No. 8 at
Himatnagar forms a Y-junction. The Chhatral-Kalol industrial belt starts from Kmn 36 at
Chhatral Village which forns a Y-junction with the Ahmedabad-Mahesana Road.
Beyond Chhatral the vehicular traffic reduces and the industries and other activities on
either side of the road is relatively spread out. The road passes through Nandesan town at
Km 49 where there is another link to Kadi town. At Km 69, there is a railway crossing.

Feasibility Study for tihe Ahlnedabad-Mahesana andc              Executive Summary
Kadi-Kalol spur ROad
Immediately afterwards, a staggered junction occurs with the road to the west going to
Bechrajee and that to the east to Himmatnagar. A four lane road commences at Km
70.25. Apart from the above major intersections these are about 40 minor intersections
(village road crossing). A 60 meter ROW exists for most of the route while in case of
Chhatral-Kadi road spur the ROW is 24 meters.
On thie Cliliatral-Kadi road spur the ROW is 24 meters. The alignment is winding in parts
witli a ROW of approximately 24m. Thiere are a number of industrial units throughout the
road leIigthi. Tlhere are also a number of junctions with narrow roads leading ofr to Rajpur
and Anakhol at Km 3 and to Karannagar at Km 5. At Kadi there is a staggered cross-
roads. To the north is the road to Nandasan and to the south, to Sanand. The road surface
throughout the 11.5 Km stretch is of asphalt concrete, generally in fair condition.
1.2.1  Main Carriageway
Presently two possible alternative routes appear to exist one on the east and the other on
the west of the project road. Table No. 3-1/1 gives a comparision of both the alternative
alignments. The starting point of this survey is considered from Adalaj as this area is very
telose to the Km 19. Adalaj is a land mark emerging as a focal point for different
directions of movements as it is directly linked with Gandhinagar, Sarkhej and
Ahmedabad.

1.2.2  Service Roads*
In order to ensure safe and efficient movement of traffic on the project road, it is
extremely important to provide service road facilities to segregate local and through
traffic. The decision to provide service road facilities depends to a great extent on the
landuse characteristics, location of industrial/commerciallresidential activities along the
project road which would be responsible for the generation of traffic.
1.2.3  Project Options
Six construction options have been considered for the project.
*  Option IA   A four lane road made up of a 7m wide strengthened existing road plus
an additional new two lane 7m carriageway together with a total of 28
Kims of service roads located both sides of the main carriageways at
selected locations.
*  Option IB   As 1A but with a total of II Kms of service roads located both sides at
Kalol Township.
*  Option IC   As I A but divided into two construction phases. (a) Phase I being of 18
months duration between 1-4-98 to the 30-9-99 covering the section
from Km 19 to Km 35 and (b) Phase 2 of 24 months to be constructed
between 1-1-2002 and 31-12-2003 covering the section from Km 35 to
Km 71.
In the case of these three options toll collection will take place from all motorised vehicles
at four Toil Plazas situated at Km 20 and Km 68 and at the beginning of the Chhatral and
Nandesan Spur roads.
*  Option 2   A four lane road made up of the strengthened existing road plus a new
carriageway together with service roads extending both sides for the
complete length of the project road.
All commercial vehicles (trucks, buses and LCVs) must pass through
the main Tolls at Km 20 and Km 68 in this system. Non commercial
traffic, however may enter the service roads around the main Plazas at
Km 20 and Km 68 and travel from one end of the project road to the
other without payment. Should they enter either main carriageway,

however, through a minor toll (6 of which are proposed) they will be
charged.
Option 3A  In this layout the dual carriageway has service roads on both sides but
which commence after the main tolls at Km 20 and 68 and thus all
traffic whether commercial or non commercial must pay a toll.
Option 3B   This is similar to Option 3A except that service roads are replaced with
a 3m wide paved shoulder. All traffic pays at the main Tolls at Km 20
and Km 68.
1.2.4 Sertha Bypass
A dual carriageway bypass (Figure 3-3/5) some 2.5 kms long is proposed to the west of
the Sertha Town to take all through traffic out of the town.

Kadi-Kalol spur Road
Location of tile ambient air quality monitoring stations were selected on basis of the wind
pattern recorded at 1MD, Ahmnedabad over past years to represent upwind and downwind air
quality status with respect to the road. Locations were selected to represent highest impact
area due to road traffic or to represent background concentrations and for model calibration.
Ambient Air Quality Monitoring (AAQM) stations were set up at four locations for sarnpling
SPM and NOx at eight hourly interval.

The maximum concentration of SPM was observed in Sertha being 1405 pg/cum and
minimum at Water Park being 16 pg/cum. This variation is due to the variation in the
traffic pattem. It should be noted that the average SPM concentration is also high at
proposed by-pass at Sertha being 575 .g/cum, and may be due to the combustion of fuel
in the village for various activities.

1.4  Impact on Environmental Resources
1.4.1 Impact on Air Quality
*     Construictioni Phase Inipacts
Consumption of diesel in construction activities will be the principal cause of incremental
air pollution during the construction phase. Diesel powered trucks required for haulage of
aggregates, eartli and otlher construction material and running of construction machineries
at the construction yards are the major sources of air pollution.
Operational Pliasc
During the operation phase of the project the primary air quality impacts due to the
project will be due to the flow of the traffic on the project road. The extent of these
impacts, at any given time, will depend upon (i) the rate of vehicular emission within a
given stretch of the road and (ii) the prevailing meteorological conditions. The impacts
will have strong temporal dependence as both of these factors vary with time. The
temporal dependence would have diurnal, sea qonal as well as long term components.
The air quality predictions in the present application have been carried out by using the
air quality model CALINE3 developed by Califomia Department of Transportation.
NOx levels however have been developed for peak traffic conditions and compared with
WHO standard of 400 pgtmn for hourly average.
* Carbon Monoxide Levels:
The source enission levels for CO were estimated by using the peak hourly traffic
volumes for vehicles of five categories i.e., trucks and buses, LCVs, cars, two wheelers
and three wheelers. For assessment of air quality impacts due to the project, air quality
model simulation for regions near Sertha bypass and Kalol (Chhatral) Junction were
carried out.
The air quality scenarios for the above two locations have been developed for the peak
hourly traffic on the relevant links for the years 2000 and 2015.
The emission standards for Indian vehicles in the year 2000 as proposed by the Indian
Institute of Petroleum (IIP) were used to provide the emission factors for the different
vehicle types.
The air quality scenarios were modelled for two distinct wind cases viz., parallel and cross
wind cases
It is observed that the predicted CO levels at 10 m from ROW for cross winds in the year
2000 range forn 390-190 gglm3 and 430-210 gtmS3 for Chhatral junction. The values are.

Kadi-Kalol spur Road
about 80 percent higher for parallel wind case and range between 690-330  ig/m' at
Sertlia and 740-380 pig/m' at Clhhatral junction. The range is about 2-2.5 times higher for
the year 2015 which is approximately the ratio of traffic volume in the years 2000 and
2015 respectively for heavy vehicle which are the prominent source of air emnissions. On
comparison with the hourly standard for CO of 4000 gg/m3, it is seen that no violations of
CO standard are expected due to the project. The CO levels in fact will remain well below
the standards. The project therefore has insignificant negative impact on ambient air
quality in terms of CO.
The prediction of CO for 'Without Project Scenario' is comparatively on the higher side
at all the distances from ROW which is mainly attributable to the higher emission factors
at lower traffic speeds.
NOx Levels:
Similar to emission factors for CO, values for NOx were obtained from the standards
proposed by lIP and corrected for the variations in speed using WHO guidelines.
When compared to WHO standard of 400 gglmr, it is observed that the standard is not
expected to be violated during the year 2000 except for marginal violation (estimated
levels 430 pgl/n) upto a distance of 15 m near Sertha. The highest NOx levels at the edge
of ROW, during this year, are expected to be about 370 pg/m3 marginally below the
standard. Violations up to a distance of about 70 m from the edge of ROW, however,
may occur during the year 2015 'with' the project and up to a distance of 30 m 'without'
the project.
1.4.2  Noise Quality
The noise modelfing results for the year 2000 traffic, "with" and "without" project scenarios in
taems of drop in noise levels with respect to the distance from the center of the road indicates
hat as a result of project implementation, the day time equivalent noise levels are expected to
be about 5 dB(A) higher in comparison to "no project" situaiion. A difference of about 6
dB(A) is expected between night time equivalent noise levels for the two options. The night
time levels however lower by about 3 dB(A) with respect to day time noise levels.
When compared to the ambient noise levels as recorded during the field observations, the day
time noise levels due to the traffic are significantly lower ( about 5 dB(A)). This indicates that
the local sources of noise are the prominent contributors to ambient noise. During the day,
therefore, project will not have any significant increment to the ambient noise levels.
During the nigh, additional noise due to the project will be of the order similar to the ambient
levels. The over al noise levels along the project route would therefore will rise by about 3
dB(A).
According to the model predictions noise levels are expected to rise by about 3.5 dB(A) in the
year 2015 when compared with the year 2000. However, while estimating the future noise

levels, the impact of probable techmological changes on the vehicular noise levels has not been
considered. Technological improvements in vehicle design are expected to produce relatively
silent vehicles in the future. Even if the present source emissions are reduced by 4-5 dB(A), the
2015 noise levels in the project area are not likely to rise beyond the estimated levels for the
year 2000.
A comparison of the estimated noise levels with the day and night time standards indicate
that the standards for commercial zones will be violated up to about 200 m from the road.
The computations carried out give an indication of noise levels for the worst case scenario, i.e.
without taking into consideration the local features like landuse, barriers etc. In reality, the
noise levels are expected to be on lower side, as the areas adjacent to the proposed road will
be landscaped and covered with specially designed plantation to reduce noise impacts at the
sensitive receptors.
1.4.3  Analysis of Alternatives
Two categories of altematives were considered while finalising the project alignment. Frt
category of altemaives were in the form of choice of different alignments for the project road.
The secondary category of alternatives were in the form of different configurations of service
roads and allied facilities. Vafious options with respect to the two categories of alterafives
were considered duning the initial stages and the most suitable project option descnrbed in
Section 3 was considered for detailed environmental and social assessment. The project
altematives for the detailed assessment, thus, confined to "Build" and "No build" options
Findings of the assessment of two options have been presented in the earlier sections and it is
observed that although there are a few irreversible impacts during the operation phase of the
project, specially in terms of noise and air pollution, the impacts are essentiaDly minor.
Appropriate mitigatory  measures such  as landscaping, greenit development and
enhancement in road design through underpasses for road crossing will make the project
environmentally and socially acceptable.
The "build" option is also desirable by virtue of its beneficial impact on the local and regional
economy.

1.6   Social Assessment - An lntroduction
Road improvement and construction involve expropriation of land and structures from the
current owners/users. Besides, the economic disturbance due to land acquisition (L.A)
the construction work may displace present economic activities within the corridor of
impact of the project. This will include eviction of any squatters add removal of petty
commercial structures/encroachments from the ROW forming part of the corridor of
impact. Expropriation of land, eviction of squatters and removal of commercial
encroachments may cause social disruption and economic loss for project affected persons
(PAPs) and their families. The economic losses for the project-include loss of a
commercial structure, access to economic opportunities, -or the loss of income.
Therefore, while implementing the project one needs to take into account these
disturbances anca losses due to the project, their impact on the socio-econornic living of
the people and plan for the rnitigation measures to minimise any negative advese
impacts.
1.7   Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy
An R&R policy, encompassing the broad objectives and principles of R&R, categories of
the PAPs and their entitlements and institutional support for implementing mitigation
measures, is a pre-requisite for formulating an Action Plan. For this purpose, the R&R
policy as contained in the ESR of IL & FS formed the base for the RAP.
The IL & FS's R&R policy recognises the need to demonstrate its commitment to social
issues in each of its projects. In the context of social policy, the three cardinal principles
of IL & FS mentioned in its ESR are:
i)   enhance the quality of life in and around the project
ii) prevent adverse social situation ; and
iui) mitigate possible adverse social impacts.
These principles are in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines on Involuntary
Resettlement (OD 4.30). The present project will also be- covered under the same
guidelines. The policy takes into consideration those within the 'cofridor of negative
impact' of the project. Essentially, they are in two broad categories,
*     those with private ownership of land and other immovable-assets; and
*     encroachers on government land and squatters within the corridor of impact.

1.8   Socio-Economic Profile
The entire process of formulating Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was done in close
consultation with the PAPs.
As a prelude to the socio-economic survey, the consultants carried out .a verification
exercise of the entire corridor of impact of the project mainly to identify any structures
coming within the proposed road alignment. Most of the area within the corridor of
impact was found under private use for agriculture and commercial establishments
(essentially encroachers).
For this project report, as part of socio impact assessment, the consultants undertook:
i)    verification of all commercial units coming within the corridor of impact for both
the Highway and the Link road and establishing their ownership;
ii)   verification of agriculture lands to be acquired for the By-pass
iii)   conducting socio-economic survey among the potential PAPs whose lands were
to be acquired.
iv)   focus group meetings with affected stake-holders.
v)    preparation of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) in consultation with the PAPs .

refuised to participate in the process, however had joined in the group discussions. In
their opinion the By-pass was totafly unnecessary and the problems on the Highway could

Kadi-Kalol spur Road
2.0 INTRODUCTION
2.1   Background
The Ahmedabad-Mahesana road which links Ahmedabad with Mahesana, a major oil
town, north of Ahmedabad, has been prioritised as a strategic link by the Roads and
Buildings Department, Government of Gujarat (GoG), which needs to be improved in the
near future. The Roads and Buildings Department, Government of Gujarat (GoG) is
responsible for construction, operation and maintenance of roads in Gujarat. R & B
department of GoG is keen to widen/strengthen the existing Ahmedabad - Mahesana
Section of State Highway 41, including Kadi - Kalol link, on a commercial basis. GoG
has entered into an Agreement with Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited
(IL&FS) to develop, implement and operate this roads . The proposed alignment starts
from Km. 19 near Adalaj and ends at Km. 70.25 near Mahesana(Figure 3-2/1) . This
section of the highway is a major link between Ahmedabad City on one end and the oil
and industrial town of Mahesana on the other end. The stretch is highly congested
causing significant delays to traffic using the road.
A pre-feasibility study commissioned by GoG and IL&FS has established the preliminary
viability of the proposed project, including strengthening of the existing road and
widening it to a 4-lane road. Further, IL&FS, on behalf of GoG has conunissioned Scott
Wilson Kirkpatrick India Pvt. Ltd. (SWK) in association with Rail India Transport and
Economic Services (RITES), to undertake a detailed techno-economic feasibility study
and environment and social assessment of the project road.
2.2   Objectives and Scope of the Detailed Feasibility Study
The main objectives of the study (which includes traffic studies with preliminary
engineering for technical options, environmnental and social assessrnent) as defined in the
Terms of Reference (TOR) are:
*     to carry out a feasibility study for the proposed road project to establish its
technical, environmental, social, economnic and financial viability, and
*     to undertake risk identification and assessment, including risk analysis.
The technical studies involve necessary field investigation and surveys for
preparing prelimninary engineering design of the project and estimating the project
cost to a level of accuracy of +1- 10%. The environmental and social assessment
study is expected to prepare a well researched and documented environment and
social assessment report (ESAR) with due consideration to public opinion and
sensitivities.
The ESAR is to be prepared according to the principles and processes contained
in the Environmental and Social Statement of ILFS detailed in the TOR. The
social assessment report and the mitigation plans (Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) and Indigenous People Development Plan (IPDP)' are to be prepared in

improving the environmental quality  and   budgetary  cost estimation  for
implementation;
*      to identifIy critical environmental attributes required to be monitored subsequent to
the implementation of the proposed project; and
*      to integrate the Social Assessment (SA) study report documenting major social
issues, consequent risks and the suitable action plans with the EA report to
prepare the Environmental and.Social Assessment Report (ESAR).
2.4    Project Road
The projcct road is part of State flighway No 41 located in the State of Gujarat. It runs
approximately northward from the biggest city in the State, Ahmedabad, to Mahesana, an
important oil town, approximately 71 kms to the north. The project road comrnences at
approximately km 19 and passes through the towns of Sertha, Kalol, Chhatral, Nandesan

2.5   Study Approach
Reconnaissance survey was conducted by the consultants to identify the major
environmental and social issues. Accordingly field surveys were undertaken to determine
the ambient air quality, meteorological conditions (concurrent to the air quality studies),
water quality, ecological status, noise levels, soil characteristics, prevailing land use and
collection of data on existing industries along the project road.. The field studies were
supported by data collection from secondary sources for meteorology, land use. hydroggeology
and socio-economic aspects. The sampling locations were identified on the basis of:
*     predominant wind directions in the study area as recorded by Indian Meteorological
Departmlent (INID) at Alimedabad,
*     existing topography and location of surface water bodies like ponds, canals and rivers;
3     location of villages/towns/sensitive areas;
*     areas which represent baseline conditions and pollution pockets in the area;
*     accessibility, power availability and security of monitoring equipment; and
*     collation  3nd analysis of secondary data on baseline conditions for various
environmental attributes.
The field studies were conducted for a period of one month to determine the existing
conditions of various cnvironnicntal attributes
*     the social assessment focused on an assessment of the social impact of the project,
identification of issues and consequent risk. in the resettlement and rehabilitation
of PAPs, and to outline measures to mitigate any negative impact of the project.

*      prevent adverse environmental and social situations; and
*      mitigate possible adverse environmental and social im1pacts.
The ESAR has been prepared by the consultants within this policy framework of
IL&FS. It also addresses the legal issues on environment and social aspects
applicable to the project.
2.6.2  Key Environmental Legislation
Thle proposed project basically being, a hiighiway and bridge project, can be classified as
Category A as per the categonrzation of the projects developed by The World Bank on the
basis of the potential environmental impacts if the project involving new highways, roads and
bridges pass through or near environmentally sensitive areas.
The principal Environmental Regulatory Agency in India is the Ministry of Environment
and Forests (MIoEF) New Delhi. MoEF formulates environmental policies and accords
environmental clearance for the large projects (sector-wise listing done by MoEF).
Many State and Central legislation hiave a bearing on environment. Laws on "environment
protection" can be broadly classified in terms of focus areas vi:.,
*      Pollution;
*      Natural resources; and
*      Linkage between pollution and natural resources.
The status of key environmental legislation in India is given in Table No. 3-2/1.

Mahesana.  Whilst the road passes through agriculture areas, there are numerous
industrial units existing along the road. The project road runs a total length of 51.25
Kms. A 1 1.5 Kml long Spur from Kalol to Kadi takes off from this road at Chhatral
village (Fi,,ures 3-2/1 and 3-3/1). The project includes the streng-thening and widening
of the existin, carriageway to 4 lanes and widening as a single carriageway of the Kadi-
Kalol link road to 2 lanes. At Km 10 on existing Ahmedabad - Mahesana Road, the
road to Gandihiiiagar forms a T junction. National Hig.hwav 8C crosses the alignment at
Km 18 followed by a railway bridg;e at Km 19. Northwards, the roa-d at Km 22 passes
through agriculture land and Sertha village. Here the existing alignment is poor with a
reverse curve within the village. A new by-pass about 2.5 Kms long is proposed to the
west of the village. At Km 28, a by-pass to Kalol Town commences and a four lane,
dual carriageway, starts immediately after this. At Km 31, a road leading to Vijapur on
the National Highway No. 8 at Himatnagar forms a Y-junction. The Chhatral-Kalol
industrial belt starts from Km 36 at Chhatral Village which forms a Y-junction with the
Ahmedabad-Mahesana Road.
Bcyond Clhilatral the vehictilar traffic reduces and the industries and otiler activities on
either sidc of the road is relatively spread out. T'he road passes through Nandesan town
at Km 49 where there is another link to Kadi town. At Km 69, there is a railway
crossing. Immediately afterwards, a staggered junction occurs with the road to the west
goin, to Bcchirajee and that to the east to Himmatnagar. A four lane road commences
at Km 70.25. Apart from the above major intersections these are about 40 minor
intersections (village road crossing). A 60 meter ROW exists for most of the route
while in case of Chhatral-Kadi road spur the ROW is 24 meters.
On the Chhatral-Kadi road spur the ROW is 24 meters. The alignment is winding in
parts with a ROW of some 24m. There are a number of industrial units throughout the
road length. There are also a number of junctions with narrow roads leading off to
Rajpur and Anakhol at Km 3 and to Karannagar at Km 5. At Kadi there is a staggered
cross-roads. To the north is the road to Nandasan and to the south, to Sanand. The road
surface throughout the 11.5 Km  stretch is of asphalt concrete, generally in fair
condition.
There are four rail crossings on this road namely:
* at Km 19 (grade separated)
* at Km 26 IFFCO crossing
*  at Km 33 lcvel crossing
*  at Km 69 Mahesana crossing
The railway crossing at Km 19 is over road while at Km 26 it is level (IFFCO crossing).
At Km 33 the road crosses a single track railway line with poor approach visibility in

agricultural and industrial activity. The number of industrial units that abut the road is
about 37 of 'wicih niore than 10 are major factories like Nirma, Torrent and IFFCO.
T'he terrain throughout this section is flat and the road is mostly on embankment. The
- road surface throughout the 51.25 knis of Alimedabad-Malhesana link  is of asphalt
concrete and is generally in good condition. As reported earlier, at Chhatral, the road
proceeds westward for Kadi. The alignment is winding in parts with a ROW of some
24m. rhere are a number of industrial units throughout the road length. There are also
a number ofjunctions with narrow roads leading off to Rajptir and Anakhol at Km 3 and
to Karanna-ar at Km 5. At Kadi there are staggered cross-roads. To the north is a road
to Nandesan and to the south. a road to Sanand. The road surface throughout the 11.5
Km stretch is of asphalt concrete, generally in fairly good condition.
3.2    Analysis of project Alternatives
The feasibility of the project road depends to a great extent on the level of service
offered by the alternative routes and the overall journey times on these routes. In this
respect. an attempt has been made to discover the overall journey time, condition of the
road in terms of the riding quality, the number of traffic lanes, the width of the road, and
from environmental angle on alternative routes.
3.2.1  Main Carrigeway
Prcsently two possiblc altcrnativc routes appear to exist one on the cast and the other on
the west of the project road. The staning point of this survey is considered from Adalaj
as thiis area is very close to the Km 19. Adalaj is a land markl emerging as a focal point
for different directions of movements as it is directly linked with Gandhinagar, Sarkhej -
and Alhmedabad.
The following are the locations / roads through which the alternative routes travel. (see
Figure 3-3/2)

*     Road leading to Jotana, sinigic lane carriageway to Kadi town.
From Kadi, the road leading to Sanand is a two lane carriageway touching Thor
at a distance of 63 km from Mahesana.
*      State Highway starting, after Thor and running to Satnala some 3 km from
Sanand.

*     National Highway (NH) No. 8C to Adalaj.
*     A total distance of 124 kms.
The journey time on Alternative Route No. I was recorded as 2 hours 40 minutes. to
travel a distance of 124 km. The !eneral condition of the highway was fair with a two-
lane carriageway width throughout except the section between the State Highway
leading to Bechrajee Kadi and passing through Jotana (see Figure 3-3/2). The latter
section appears to be a major District Road with only a single-lane bituminous
carriageway having 2m shoulders on both sides. The NH 8C forms a significant portion
of the route varying from a 2 lane to a 4 lane road with a high quality surface.
Possible Shortest Alternative Route No. 2 (East - Orange)
-     From the intersection of SH No. 41 near Mahesana and SH No. 55 leading to
Himmatnagar.
-     SH No. 55 to Rampura Intersection
*     SH No. 73 starts from Rampura Intersection and passes through Gojaria Kherva,
Mewe etc villages.
*     StI No 71 starting from Gojaria and proceeds towards Boru and crossing SH
No. 138.
*     SH No.' 71 to Gandhinagar.
*     Road from Gandhinagar runs towards National Highway No. 8C.
*     NH No. 8C to Adalaj.
*     A total distance of 75 kms.
Journcy time as recorded on this altemative route is I hour 39 minutes to travel a
distance of 75 km. The condition of the road is fair with a bituminous surface
throughout and offers two lanes for a major patt of the route. About 6 km of this route
falls within NH No. 8Cv with a high quality road surface.
From the Environmental point of view there is considered little difference between these
altemative routes.
3.2.2  Service Roads
In order to ensure safe and efficient movement of traffic on the project road, it is
extremely important to provide service road facilities to segregate local and through

traffic. The decision to provide service road facilities depends to a great extent on the
landuse characteristics, location of industrial/commercial/residential activities along the
project road which would be responsible for the generation of traffic. As this project
road stretches for a lenoth of 51.25 Km from Km 19 to Mahesana compfising seven
links characteristics, the service road demand would be related to the above mentioned
parameters. Based on the origin-destination of traffic observed on each link of the
project road, the traffic flow on each service road for each link has been estimated as
presented in the Table No. 3-3/1.
Prcsently, the demand by traffic for access to road side facilities is being met by access
direct from the existing road. When the project road is upgraded to a four lane divided
carriageway, it will have to maintain a high level of access control in order to ensure
design speeds on the main carriageways are achieved. It is, therefore, extremely
important to plan and design the service roads and median openings to satisfy both the
local traffic movements as well as the through traffic.
Keeping this in view, six service road options have been considered (Figure 3-3/3 & 3-
4/4).
*  Option I A   A four lane road made up of a 7m wide strengthened existing road
plus an additional new two lane 7m carniageway together with a total
of 28 Kms of service roads located both sides of the main
carriageways at selected locations.
*  Option I B   As I A but with a total of I I Kms of service roads located both sides
at Kalol Township.
*  Option IC   As IA but divided into two construction phases. (a) Phase I being of
18 months duration between 1-4-98 to the 30-9-99 covering the
section from Km 19 to Km 35 and (b) Phase 2 of 24 months to be
constructed between 1-1-2002 and 31-12-2003 covering the section
from Km 35 to Km 71.
In the case of these three options toll collection will take place from all motorised
vehicles at four Toll Plazas situated at Km 20 and Km 68 and at the beginning of the
Chhatral and Nandesan Spur roads.
*  Option 2    A four lane road made up of the strengthened existing road plus a new
carriageway together with service roads extending both sides for the
complete length of the project road.
All commercial vehicles (trucks, buses and LCVs) must pass through
the main Tolls at Km 20 and Km 68 in this system. Non commercial
traffic, however may enter the service roads around the main Plazas at
Km 20 and Km 68 and travel from one end of the project road to the
other without payment. Should they enter either main carriageway.
however, through a minor toll (6 of which are proposed) they will be
charged.

*  Option 3A   In this lavout the dual carriagewav has service roads on both sides but
which commence aller the main tolls at Km 20 and 68 and thus all
traffic whether commercial or non commercial must pay a toll.
*  Option 3B   This is similar to Option 3A except that service roads are replaced
with a 3m wide paved shoulder. All traffic pays at the main Tolls at
Knm 20 and Km 68.

3.2.3  Sertha Bypass
A dual carriageway bypass (Figure 3-3/5) sonic 2.5 kIns long is proposed to the west of
the Sertha Town to take all through traffic out of the town. As an alternative it has been
suggested that a circular system be provided comprising a single carriageway westem
bypass around Sertha Town for northbound traffic whilst the south bound traffic makes
use of an improved existing carriageway through the town itself which however is not
the recommended option due to several reasons as provided below. The following points
arisc fi-omi thtis latter alternative:
1.    The bypass would need less landtake. Length 2.5 Kms. Width dual carriageway
= 35m. Single carriageway = 23m. Thus saving in land (2.5 x 1000 x 35) - (2.5 x
1000 x 23) = 30,000m2 = 3 Hectares.
2.    The cattle culvert which is proposed across the bypass will be shorter in the
single carriageway case 25m - 13m = 12m saving.
3.    The project road has been designed for 100 KPH, thus through Sertha Town
where there are a number of narrow sections between buildings it will, becuase
of local traffic movements be necessary to improve the horizontal and vertical
alignment and to provide where possible service roads. It is estimated these
service roads, located both sides of the main cariageway will be a total of
approximately Kms 2 long.
4.    Providing a main carriageway through Sertha, with traffic travelling at a high
sp-ed is likely to cause more accidents than on the bypass itself which lies in
open country.
5.    The noise and exhaust pollution will. if the traffic is allowed to pass through
Sertha steadily increase. This will effect particularly the people living alongside
the road. By building a bypass such pollution will be moved away from high
density habitation.
6.    Because of the local traffic and pedestrian movements Sertha will need to be
treated similarly to Kalol and the provision of an underpass, possibly two, built
to allow traffic movements from one service road to the other.
7.    The purpose of the bypass was to relieve the town of traffic (some 28,000 pcus
per day two way at present). Wliist providing a single carriageway through the
town will temporarily relieve the through traffic by eliminating the north bound
stream by the year 201 1 traffic will have increased to over 35,000 pcus per day
in one direction, in excess of the present traffic. The case for using the existing
road as a ,iiaini carriageway whtilst iiitially attractive will gradually become less
so as more congestion occurs occurs within Sertha itself.
8.    On the basis of a single carriageway one way system the distances travelled to
reach ones destination will increase. A vehicle coming from Ahmedabad and

wishing to go to Sertha Town will now have to travei to the northern end of the
bypass and the turn southwards into Sertha. If the vehicle has to travel over 4
kms more than previously. A similar situation will occur with anyone wishing to
travel to the northern end of the bvpass from the Mahesana side. They must
travel through the town of Sertha enter the bypass at the southern end and travel
northwards almost the complete length of the bypass to their destination.
9.    The difference in cost in building a single carriageway bypass including a cattle
culvert and relurbisihing tihe existing road adding service roads including an
underpass(s) through Sertha when compared to a 3..5 km dual carriageway by
pass as proposed is considered small. The bypass as proposed, however, will
confine Sertha to local traffic movements reducing both accidents and pollution.
The town itself relieved of progressively higher amounts of traffic can be
developed for local traffic movements.
10.   The advantages of Sertha town being developed without a hioth speed
carriageway being built through it together with the associated savings in
accidents and higher pollution outweighs any initial advantages in providing a
single carriageway bypass. The case for building a dual carriageway bypass in the
first place is therefore particularly strong.
3.2.4  Changes on the Vertical Alighment due to Severance
It may be necessary to move some of the public utilities to make provision for the road
improvements. In general terms it is not anticipated that the relocation of these essential
scrvices wvill causc spccific problcms. I lowcvcr. it is possiblc that the location of the
opticle fibre cabics. or piplines were not located at their reported depthis. It they are
shallower than the reported depths they may delay construction works. It is unlikely that
this potential problem would be identified until construction workls have commenced. If
shallower depths were found, the easiest solution would be to amend the vertical
alignment. However, on the basis of the reported information available, the potential
problem is not anticipated as major. Thie result may be some slippage or modification to
the construction programme.
3.3    Existing Traffic System
The Mass transport needs of Gujarat state are currently met by buses, trucks, and taxis.
At present, there are three mechanised modes of transport: Highways, Railways and

The vehicles plying on the project road include all types of vehicles like Buses, Trucks,
Cars, LCVs, Autos and Scooter/Motor Cycles. The project road not only caters to the
local regional & out of state traffic but to traffic generated from outside e.g.
Ahmedabad, Gandhi Nagar and Mahesana districts.
The road surface is in satisfactory condition despite being highly congested. A number
of industries were eqtablished alongside the project road especially during the past
decade which have added firther to the traffic movement on this road.
3.4    Future Traffic Projectiotls
This study indicates that average traffic growth rate in the study areas is of the order of
1v0% per annum. Traffic growth rate at different locations vary and generally range
from 3.87% to 8.83% lor cars, 3.87% to 7.26% for buses, 3.18% to 7.5% for trucks,
and 3.87/o to 9.53% for scooters / motorcycles. The traffic growth rates for each block
of five years upto 2030 are presented in Table 3-3/5. The Projected Traffic Volumes in
the present year, in the years when the existing two lane and the proposed four lane road
reach their maximum capacity and in the ultimate year 2030 are presented in Table 3-
3/6. As per World Bank norms absolute capacity (PCU's per day ) of 2-lane road is
35,000 and of 4-lane road is 1,10,000. The different links reach their maximum capacity
in different year. The PCLJ factors recommended by the Indian Road Congress(IRC) are
presented in Table 3-3/7.

3.5   Project Activities
Tile project envisages the following main activities. namely
* Building a new 7 m wide carriageway on the west side of the existing road,
approximately 51 Ikm long. Where possible the existing road has been retained for
strengthening. However at two locations detailed below, the new carriageway will
have to be built on the eastern side of the existing ROW.
1. At Kmi 49.6, lor somle 500 m(icirc or so, thc ItOW is only 3740 il wide. *I'his
hias resulted in insuflicient widthi remaining between the western ROW edge and
the existing road to provide a new carriageway on the eastern side of the existing
road with the need to cross the existing road in two places.
2. At Km 62.6 a tight horizontal curve (180 m radius) has revealed a similar
situation. In this case in switching the new carriageway to the east a larger
horizontal curve (approximately 330 m) has been inserted.
* Building service roads commencing with the east road followed by the west service
road, 28 Km in all,
* Reconstruct parts of the existing road prior to strengthening,
*  Strenghliening the existing carriageway (7 m wide) over a distance of some 51 kms.,
*  Buildin- access roads between the service roads and carriageways and between the
new and existing carriageway,
-  Extend existing drainage structures under the new carriageway and service roads
throughout the alignment,
* Build three cattle crossings, consisting of 3 m wide by 2.5 m high boxes, situated at
Km 22, Km 40 and Km 52,
*  Build two underpasses 4m wide by 2.5m high between service roads on the Kalol
bypass at Km 29 and Km 30,
* Build two underpasses 3 m wide by 4.5 m high through the railway embankments
and road works,
*  Construct 4 Toll Plazas, two large and two secondary Toll Plazas,
*  Build a bridge over Railway at Km 69 including approach embankments and road
wQrks.
*  Provide new railway gates and lights at Km 32.8
*  Strengthen Chhatral-Kadi Road, provide 7 m  carriageway with 2.5 m  wide
shoulders, 1.5 m paved.
The construction work- is likely to be completed in two phases. Phase-I commences in
April 1998 and will take 18 months to complete while Phase 1I commences in January
2002 and will take 24 months to complete. Construction of Chhatral Kadi link will take
6 months and commence immediately on completion of Phase II (Figure 3-3/6).

Phase I consists of the section from approximatelv Kml9 to approximately Km 35
including 13.5 of service roads. Phase 11 is from approximately Km 35 to Km 70.25
(South of Mahesana) and includes 14.5 kms of service roads.
The prourammc in Phasc II inclucdes a bridge over the railway line at Km 69. It is
assumed that the Railwavs will supervise and arrange a contractor to do this work. The
latter is likely to take the total construction period of 24 months, thus it needs to be
commenced within the first 3 months of the construction period.
Throughout the alignment there are 65 culverts (pipe and slab) and two minor bridges to
be extended under the new carriageway and service roads. In addition there is a need to
repair some of the culverts. along the existing road. One culvert needs reconstruction.
Work on culverts and minor bridges will be a continuous process in both the
construction phases.
In addition to the above structures in Phase 1, the following must also be built. Two
underpasses 32 m wide x 4.5 m high through the railway embankment at Km 19. These
are for non-motorised movements and they will provide access to such traffic through
the embankment without having to make use of the new dual carriageway facility.
Two underpasses consisting of 4 m wide x 2.5 m high reinforced concrete boxes are also
proposed at Kalol town (Km 29 and 30) in Phase I constructed from service road to
service road to accommodate cars, autos, motorcycles, cyclists and pedestrians.
Additionally three 3 m wide x 2.5 m high reinforced concrete boxes are proposed as
cattle crossings at Km 22 (Sertha bypass) in Phase I and Km 40 (Indrad village) and Km
52 (Vadpura village) in Phase II.
Two large Toll Plazas will be constructed one at the southem end in Phase I at
approximately Km 20 , and the other at about Km 68 south of Mahesana in Phase 11.
Two secondary plazas are at Chhatral in Phase I as it enters the SH 133 and the other
near Nandasan in Phase II on the road to Kadi will also be built.
A temporary Toll Plaza to cover traffic entering and exiting the system under Phase I
will be constructed at Km 35. This will be removed on the opening of Phase II.
Throughout the construction of the new works west carriageway service roads etc. the
Concessionaire / Builder will be responsible for maintaining the existing carriageway
prior to strengthening.
3.6   Plant I Equipmenit to be used
The completion of the work programme will involve a two shift system of works. The
list of the plant I equipment expected to be used is shown in Table 3-3/8.

3.7    Material Requirements
The following materials will need to be procured:
(a)   Eartliworks - fill.  Because of the depth of pavement this is likely to be
relativcly small
(b)   Watcr
(c)   Subgmde material
(d)   Sub-base - Granular Material
(e)   Aggregates for cement concrete
(f)   Aggregates for base wet mix macadam
(g)   Aggregates for base Dense - bituminous Macadam
(h)   Aggregates for wearing course - Asphaltic concrete
(i)   Cement
(j)   Reinforcing Steel
(k)   Bitumen.
In the case of (c), (d), (e),(f).(g) and (h) the materials will need to be crushed at a
quarry, transported and stockpiled near the project road. It is estimated that 1.5 million
cubic meters of aggregates will be required of which some 30,000 cubic metres may be
stockpiled near the project road in each phase, sufficient for 14 days work. Possible -
locations for stockpiling are between Km 33-34 in Phase I and at Km 50-51 in Phase
11.
Quarries are located at Himmatnagar and Chitrasani 73 Kms and 85 Kms respectively
from the nortlern end of the road. Additional quarries are located at Vadagamn and
Watrak, however, these are some 105 Kms from Kalol. It is considered that the
contractor will haul crushed material from quarries to a location for storage where he

- material, upkeep of haul roads and sitting of alphalt paint is covered under the
specifications for road and bridge works (IRC publication). Figure 3-317 indicates the
exclusion zones where labour camps, asphalt plant, plant yards and materials storage
would not be permitted. The guidelines for storage of construction materials, upkeep of
haul roads and sitting of asphalt plant is covered under the specifications for Road &
Bridge works (IRC publication)
3.8    Construction Schedules
Construction work of Ahmedabad-Mehesana Road including Kadi-Kalol link will be
completed in two phases. First phase is of 18 months approximate duration and Phase
II of a 24 month duration. However, the actual time taken to complete the project will
also depend upon the availability of funds and material. The construction schedules are
presented in Figure 3-3/6.

secondary sources. The total length of the project road is 51.25 km which begins at km
19/000 and ends at knm 70/250 of Ahmedabad - Mlahesana state highway.
Reconnaissance and survev of the study area was carned out by the consultants team in the
month of October, 1996 for the selection and finalization of the sarnpling locations.
Monitorine for ambient air quality, noise levels and continuous monitoring of NOx, CO and
HC levels during peak- traffic periods was carried out at various locations at selected sampling
'requcncies. Traflic count studies also tformed a part of the field surveys which were helpful in
correlating tile monitoring results. Surveys were conducted for assessing the ecological status
along the alignment.
Identification and prediction of impacts fomis the core of an Environmental Impact
Assessment (FIA) study. Base line description. which involves collecting data on the
existing status of the environment helps in identification of impacts. 'I'able No. 3-4/1

4.3    Meteorology
''he micro-meteorological parameters regulate the transport and diffusion of pollutants
released into the atmosphere. The principal variables which affect the micro-meteorology are
wind speed, wind directions; atmospheric stability, inversion conditions and topography of the
area.
'llie Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) broadly divides the year into four seasons as
under.
*     Winter season -                   December to Febnrauy
*     Pre-monsoon season -              March to June
*     Monsoon season -                  June to September
*     Post Monsoon Season -             October to November
Meteorological data collected from secondary sources (nearest IMD station) provides long
term data which is good for averaging purposes, while the data geneated at site is usefil to
characterise the meteorological conditions prevailing at the time of the survey.
-Irior to site observations. meteorological data for Ahmedabad for the month of October
1995 was collected from  India Meteorological Department, Ahmedabad and is
summarised in Annexure 1. A wind rose diagram was prepared from this data to

determine the wind frequency and direction (See Fitture 3-4/1). Meteorological data was
also recorded in the project area during the month of October. 1996. More details on
meicorology aie presentcd in the tollowing sections.
4.3.1  Meteorological Survey at Site
'[lie methodology adopted for monitorini, surface observations was as per the standard norms
laid down by Bureau of India Standards (BIS) and India Mieteorology Department (IMD).
Meteorological station was set up in the project area at Kalol in October 1996. Hourly
data was recorded for 30 days for wind speed, wind direction and cloud cover and is
summarised in Annexure 11. A wind rose diagram has been prepared from the recorded
data (Figure 3-4/2). Winds are generally light to moderate. The observed wind directions
were mostly from ENE and ESE and SSE. Skies were mostly clear during the sampling
period. 'I'he meteorological data from IMD) has also been collected and analysed. Based
on these Wind Rose diagram has been prepared for the observed data and that available
from IMD, and a comparison indicates similarity.
4.3.2  Upper Air Data
T'he upper air climatological data assumes significance as the assessment of air pollutants
dispersion is influenced by these conditions. The nearest station recording upper winds, is
Ahmedabad and the same data has been presented for the analysis. Following data categories
have been covered:
*     ground based inversions
3     elevated inversions
-     mixing heights
Data for the occurrence of ground based inversions is available for 00 GMTr i.e., 5.30 am and
12 GMT i.e., 5.30 pm for Ahmedabad. Ground based inversions tend to prevail more at 5.30
amn in post monsoon and winter seasons (November - March) and least in the monsoon period.
In the evening, however, the ground based inversions are almost absent.
Elevated inversions at Ahmiedabad whose base starts at heights below 100 m tend to occur
more at 5.30 am in the months of October and Febnrary - April. 'I'he same are almost absent
in the evening at 5.30 pm.
Secondary data on mixing heights for Ahmedabad compiled by Mr. B. Satyanarayana,
Department of Meteorology and Oceanography, Andhra Univerity are available for morning
at 8.30 am. The mean monthly mixng height is the least in the month of December (90 m)
while it is highest in the month of August-September (210i m).

4.4    Air Quality
'I'he baseline status of the ambient qualitv has been assessed through an ambient air quality
- monitoring network. The desiLn of monitoring network in the air quality surveillance
progranune has been based on the following considerations:
*      meteorological conditions;
*      topography of the study area; and
*      likely impact areas.
Location of the ambient air qualit) monitoring stations were selected on basis of the wind
pattern recorded at IMD, Ahmedabad over past years to represent upwind and downwind air
quality status with respect to the road. Locations were selected to represent highest impact
area due to road traffic or to represent background concentrations and for model calibration.
Ambient Air Quality Monitoring (AAQM) stations were set up at four locations for sampling
SPM and NOx at eight hourly interval. 'I'he locations of the selected AAQ stations and their
environmental setting is given in the T'able No. 34/3 and Figure 3-4/3.

l'he maximum concentration of SPM was observed in Sertha being 1405 jg/cum and
minimum at Water Parkl being 16 pg/cum. This variation is due to the variation in the
traffic pattern. it should be noted that the average SPM concentration is also high at
proposed by-pass at Sertha being 575 jig/cum, and may be due to the combustion of fuel
in the village for various activities. 'I'he minimum, maximum and average concentration of
SPM, NOx, S02, HC and CO are summarised in Table No. 3-4/5 Ambient concentration

4.5    Noise Level Survey
'I'lu: assessiiiciit olf impact of )loisc sourecs on surrouniding community depends on:
*      (Characteristics of oioisc sources (instantancous, internittent or continuous in nature). It
can be observed that steady noise is not as annoying as one whichi is continuously
varsing in loudness;
*      Ihe time of day at which noise occurs, for example high noise levels at night in
rcsidential areas are not acceptable because of sleep disturbance; and
The location of the noise source, with respect to noise sensitive landuse, which
deterrmines the loudness and period of exposure.
T'he environmental impact of noise can have several effects varying from Noise Induced
Hearing Loss (Nl-IL) to annoyance depending on loudness of noise levels. T'he environmental
impact assessment of noise from the proposed bypass construction activity, vehicular traffic
can be undertaken by taking into consideration various factors like potential damage to
hearing, physiological responses, annoyance and general community responses.
Noise survey has been conducted in the study area while covering four zones vi_., residential,
transportation. commercial and silence zones. Noise monitoring has been undertakien for 24
hours at each location.
T'he main ob)jective of noise monitoring in the study area is to establish the baseline noise
levels, and asscss the impact of the total noise expected to be generated by the proposed
highway construction activities in the villages around it.
4.5.1  Selection of Sampling Locations
A preliminary reconnaissance survey has been undertaken to'identify the major noise
generating sources in the area. Noise at different noise generating sources have been identified
based on the activities like vehicular traffic in residential and commercial land set up.
Tlhe noise monitoring has been conducted for determination of noise levels at three locations in
the study area. 'I'hese levels were recorded every hour for a continuous 24 hour period. I'he
locations where monitoring were canried out are listed below and shown in Figure 341/5.

Obserwatiois Based on Field Canip-aign
The recorded noise levels during the field survey are presented in Annexure VI and
summarised in Figure 3-4/6. The day and night time differences have also been high lighted in
Table 3-4/6. Based on the recorded noise levels followving observations can be made.

Residential zone: The day time noise level at Sertha the two locations is observed to be
exceeding the prescribed lirmits of 55 dB(A) during the dav and 45 dB(A) during the night.
Noise levels during the day at a distance of 30 m from the edge of the road mostly remain
above 62 dB(A) whereas night time levels are above 55 dB(A). The observations indicate that
during the day local activities give rise to considerable noise. Night time noise is primarily
caused by the traffic on the road.
Commercial zone: The day time noise level at Chhatral Junction is due to the traffic and
commercial activities. During the day, noise levels are observed to just exceed the prescribed
limit of 65 dB(A) for commercial areas. During the night also the noise standard of 55 dB(A)
is exceeded at almost all times. Noise levels at 30 meters from the ROW at the Water Park,
hiowever, are within the limits for commercial areas.
4.6    Landuse Pattern
Land use in the project area is mainly agricultural with some scattered industries. The
road does not pass through any reserved forest land. The proposed Sertha bypass passes
through fields. A small portion of two village ponds are also likely to be utilised in the
alignment. Table No. 3-4/7 presents linkwise landuse pattern.

4.7   'Iterrestrial Ecologn
An ecoloizical study of the ecosvstem is essential to understand the impact of development
actiVities related to industrialization. urbanization etc.. on existing flora and fauna of the area.
The objective of this section is to clharacterize and understand the present status of the
ecosvstems in the study area.
'I'he present study was undertaken to understand the present status of ecosystem along the
existing hilghway and to compare it witlh the past condition with the help of available data, to
predict changes as a result of present activities and to suggest measures tor maintaining the
conditions.
'I'hus the objectives of ecological study is outlined as follows:
to characterize the emironmental components like land, water, flora and fauna;
to understand their present status, and
to identify susceptible and sensitive areas.
4.7.1  Methodology of Data Collection
'I'he area adjoining the existing lighway (approximately 1-2 km on either side) has been
considered for the primary survey to study the tenrestrial ecosystem. Data from secondary
sources luave been compiled for the arca. Following methods are being adopted for the
ecological study:
Generation of primary data through undertaking systematic ecological studies along
the existing highway and in the study area;
Secondary data collected fiom publications of various Government agencies like
Forest Department, Agriculture Department etc.; and
*     Consulting local people for gathering information on ethnobotany, local plants and
animals.
This section describes terrestrial ecology of the area based on reconnaissance survey and
information gathered from secondary data available for the area.
A reconnaissance survey was done to have an overview of the terrestrial ecosystem of the
area. 'T'he area depicts a nwmade ecosysten with natural vegetation limited to small patches
at certain places. The bio-diversity of vegetation in the area is not very high due to intense
biotic pressure.
The project area is in a flat and monotonous terrain and is devoid of luxuriant forest
cover. A list of trees and other plants occurring near the project area have been compiled
and presented in Table No. 3-4/8. The project area is not a suitable ecological habitat for
wild animals. 'I'his can be attributed to the non-availability of forests and wild cultivation
of land for food and fodder. Non-wild animals near the project area are common species

The present Scction identifies and appraises vanrous impacts from the proposed project
based on environmiental baseline conditions and analvsis of the field data as discussed in
Section 4.0.
The environmental impacts are categorized as either primary (direct) or secondary
(indirect). Piniarv impacts are those which are attributed directly by the project whereas
secondar  impacts are those which are indirectly induced and typically include the
associated investment and changing pattems of social and economic activities due to the
proposed action. Typically, the potential direct and indirect impacts of such highway
projects are suniniarized in Table No. 3-5/1.

is discussed below.
5.3      Impact on Physical Resources
5.3.1    Impact on Topography
During the construction of the proposed road the topography will change due to
excavation of borrow areas, stone quanying, fill and cuts for project road and construction
of project related structures etc. Provision of construction yard for material handling will
also alter the existing topography. The change in topography will also be due to the
probable induced developments of the project. With adequate planning, all topographical
impacts could be made to enhance the local aesthetics. Similarly, it will invite benefits in
the form of land leveling and tree plantations in the vicuinty ofthe project site.
5.3.2    Impact on Climate
The study area is moderately vegetated all along the highway, while small patches of
forests covered by dense scrubs are scattered in the area. Good tree cover, however,
exists *vithin the ROW all along the road from Chhatral ( Km 36) to railway crossing
near Mahesana (Km 69).

Comparison of regional data on temperature and relative humidity with the monitored data
at the project site does not show any appreciable vanrations This implies that the existing
road does not have any siunificant micro-climatic impacts.
Site clearance for construction of the project, does involve removal of a number of
existing trees within the ROW. Considerably higher number of trees are planned to be
plantcd undcr thc landscaping of thc ROW as part of the project construction. As a result
of the project development, therefore, no significant micro-climatic change is expected.
The overall impact of the project on local vegetal cover and aesthetics, however, is likely
to be positive.
5.4       Impact on E'nvironmnental Resources
5.4. 1    Ipiliact on Ai- QualitV
Vehicular emissions are one of the major source of air quality impacts. By virtue of
being a road project that facilitates efficient travel between two nodes, during its
operation phase, the project will have beneficial air quality impacts by virtue of lower
emissions per unit volume of traffic on the road. However, when viewed with respect
to the existing ambient air quality or with respect to compliance of ambient air quality
standards during the post commissioning phase of the project, due to the increase in
the traffic volumes. the air quality along a narrow corridor of the roadway is likely to
be lower.
The construction phase air quality impacts of the project, although transitory, could
also bc significanit. 'Ilic rcgions downwind to the construction yards are likely to be
mnost vulncrabic arcas in this rcspect. Details on probable air quality impacts during
the construction and opicrationi phases are provided in the following sections
Conistructioni Plhase Impacts
Consumption of diescl in construction activities will be the principal cause of
incremental air pollution during the construction phase. Diesel powered trucks
required for haulage of aggregates, earth and other construction material and running
of construction machineries at the construction yards are the major sources of air
pollution.
Estimates of quantities of construction materials required for the project indicate that
transportation of about 1.5 million cubic meters of aggregates from  the nearby
quarries will be necessary. The   major quarries in the region are located at
Himmatnagar and Chitrasani. 73 Kms and 85 Kms respectively from the northern end
of the road, and at Vadagam and Watrak, about 105 Kms from Kalol. The materials
will be crushed at a quarry. transported and stockpiled in the lots of about 30,000
cubic meters. sufficient for 14 days work, near the project road.
If it is assumed that the material is hauled over a period of six days, the additional
truck movement required to transport the aggregates will be equivalent to about 3000

PICUs per day. Compared to thc cxistinig tratlic of about 30,000 PCUs. the rise due to
the material haulaue and other construction activities is expected to be within 15 per
cent during the period of major matenral transport and within about 5 per cent during
the penrod of normial construction activity. The air quality and noise impacts due to
the movement of construction material. therefore, will not be significant. The impacts
can further be minimised by transporting the materials during the off-peak hours.
To provide estimate of emission of air pollutants at the construction vard. fuel
consumption rates and approximate operation schedule for major construction
machinery were estimated. The data on fuel utilisation rates of units expected to be in
operation during the road construction are provided in Table No 3-5/2. During the
period of maximumii construction activity the fuel consumption at a construction yard
is expected to be about 200 litrcs dicscl per lhour.

Due to  around  level temperature inversion at the site during  the winter,
meteorological conditions after the sunset tend to become stable. The overall
meteorological parameters thus constitute adverse conditions for dispersion of ground
based air pollution emissions. Under adverse meteorological conditions, therefore, it
is possible that the NO2 standards (80 ttglm' for24 hourly average) may be violated if
the construction work is carried out round the clock.
There will be also be a rise in SPM levels due to the construction activities.i-The SPM
standards. however, are not expected to be violated as the background levels are very
low and the particulate tend to settle during the low wind and stable conditions which
give risc to higher levels of gaseous pollutants.
*     Operational Phase
During the operation phase of the project the primary air quality impacts due to the
project will be due to the flow of the traffic on the project road. The extent of these
impacts. at any given time. will depend upon (i) the rate of vehicular emission within

a iven stretch of the road and (ii) the prevailing meteorological conditions. The
impacts wvill have strong temporal dependence as both of these factors vary with time.
The temporal dependence would have diumal, seasonal as well as long term
comiiponents.
The air quality predictions in the present application have been carried out by using
the   air quality model CALINE3  developed by California Department of
Transportation. The model is based on Gaussian diffusion equation and uses a mixing
zone concept to characterise pollutant dispersion over the roadway. The model has
becn extensively tested lor its predictive capability ror traffic related air quality
impacts. Given source strength, meteorology, site geometry and site characteristics
the model can reliablv predict pollutant concentrations for receptors located within
150 meters of thc roadway, the most important region for estimating the impacts of
road project duc to the low clevation cmissions.
The seasonal dependenice of iiiodel outputs. primarily due to the  variations in
meteorological conditions over the year, has been accounted for by developing the
predictive scenarios for the winter months during which the air quality is poorest due
to low dispersion of the pollutants.
The long term variations in air. quality scenarios during the project life are expected
due to the change in traffic on the project road with time. The traffic volumes for the
year 2000 and 2015, respectively, have been considered to project future air quality
scenarios to provide an indication of long term variations in air quality. A longer time
horizon has not been considered because of uncertainty in ascertaining the emission
factors for various categories of vehicles beyond the year 2015 due to the probable
change in technology and fuel use.
To account for the effect of the diurnal variations in model inputs (vehicular
emissions and meteorological conditions), the averaging time for model predictions
has been restricted to 60 minutes. The averaging time is so selected because the
prnmary meteorological factors that influence the air quality predictions i.e. wind
speeds and directions do not remain steady for longer time periods. Also, during the
peak traffic hours, traffic volumes typically show significant variations over periods
longer than one hour. Due to averaging time of 60 minutes, the project impacts on air
quality are essentially assessed based on one hourly standard for CO.
Due to non-availability of hourly variations of meteorological conditions over 24
hours, dailv average levels could not be predicted for comparison with the relevant
standards of NOx and SPM. Further scale up factors for estimating 24 hourly average
concentrations for 1 hour are not reported. In any case such an exercise requires that
the wind is blowing in the same direction for all 24 hours - which is not a practical
assumption.
NOx levels however have been developed for peak traffic conditions and compared
with WHO standard of 400 ptg/mr for hourly average. HC was not modelled since its
limits are not specified for ambient levels in the Environment Protection Act. In the
absence of Indian standards for HC, the predictions could have not been interpreted

Carbon Monoxide Levels:
'I'he source emission levels for CO were estimated by using the peak hourly traffic
volumes for vehicles of five categories i.e., trucks and buses, LCVs, cars, two
wheelers and three wlheelers. For assessment of air quality impacts due to the project,
air quality model simulation for regions near Sertha bypass and Kalol (Chhatral)
Junction were carried out.
T'raffic volumes on link-" were used for simulations near Sertha bypass, whereas
traflic volumes on links-4.5 and 6 were used for Kalol junction. The location near
Sertha bypass was selected as it represented shift of traffic from existing route
through the Sertha town to a route that will pass through lands under agriculture. At
this location, as a result of the project impleme.ntation, considerable relief is expected
in terms cf exposure to air pollutants to the population. Kalol junction caters to
maximum traffic volume on the project road and thus is the location of highest air
quality impact.
TI he air quality scenarios for the above two locations have been developed for the
peak hourly traffic on the relevant links for the years 2000 and 2015. As described in
Section 3, possible alternatives for the route aligunent were screened at the initial
stage of the assessment itself At this stage, for detailed comparison of" build "
option with the only altemative of" no project  situation, both " with ' and  without
project" scenarios have been evaluated for respective years. T'he traffic volumes and
speeds for various categories of vehicles used in the simulations are presented in Table
No. 3-5/3. It is observed from the 'I'able No. 3-5/3 that although the traffic volumes
for the year on difterent links during the year 2000 is expected to be similar, the traffic
speeds will reduce considerably. In the year 2015, the road under " no project "
situation, the road will exceed its capacity which will reflect in poor service levels
withi average speed of traffic reducing to about 30 kmph.

The emission standards for Indian vehicles in the year 2000 as proposed by the Indian
Institute of Petroleum (IIP) were used to provide the emission factors for the different
vehiclc types. In order to account for variation in emission factors with speed, the
values proposed by IIP were assumed to apply for a vehicular speed of 60 kmnh and
modified for relevant speeds according to the guidelines presented by WHO in their
1993 publication on Assessment of Sources of Air, Water and Land Pollution. The
speed corrected emissions factors for expected speed of 60-80 kmph after the project
implementation are presented in Table No. 3-5/4. Table No. 3-5/4 also provides
emission factors for an average speed of 25-30 knm/h that are the expected speeds in
the year 2015 for " no project " situation. For car separate emissions for 80, 60 and
25-30 kmph have been provided.

As brouaht out in Section 4. the site specific meteorological data was collected for
October 1996 durinst the coursc of field studies. This data was not useful for
developing the air qualitv scenarios for the winter months. Also, no other data which
could have been used to represent the local hourly variation in wind during the winter
was available. In order to overcome the data limitation. air quality scenarios were
developed for stability classes I) for a low wind speed of I m./s. Stability class D
was selected as it represents the most frequently occuring stability  condition during
the evening hours in the project region when the traffic volumes are within 10 per
cent of the peak} traffic volumes and also some times coincide with the peak hourly
volumes.
Along the most of the project align.iaent. the ROW of 60 m has already been acquired.
At a few places commercial encroachments have been observed within the ROW.
However, there are no dwellings within the ROW. For air quality predictions,
therefore. receptor locations beginning from 30 ni from the center line of the road to
250m were selected.
I'lhc air qtuality sccnarios wcre modellcd for two distinct wind cases wz:., parallel and
cross wind cases. 'I'he results of these simulations for peak hourly traflic for the year
2000 and 2015 for Sertha bypass are presented in Figures 3-5/1 and 3-5/2
respectively. The projected air quality "with" and "without project" options have been
considered. Figures 3-5/3 and 3-5/4 presents the expected CO levels for Kalol
junction.
It is observed from the Figures 3-5/1 &-3-5/2 that the predicted CO levels at 10 m
from ROW  for cross winds in the year 2000 rangc form 390-190 pg/nil and 430-210
ltglm3 for Chhatral junction. The values are about 80 percent higher for parallel wind
case and range betweeni 690-330 pg/n3 at Sertha and 740-380 )S g /rg3 at Chlhiral
junction. The range is about 2-2.5 times higher for the year 2015 which is
approximately the ratio of traffic volume in jhe years 2000 and 2015 respectively for
heaw  vehicle which are the promincnt source of air emissions. On comparison with
the hourly standard for CO of 4000 gg/rni. it is seen that no violations of CO standard
are expected due to the project. The CO levels in fact will remain well below the
standards. Thc projcct thcrcforc has insignificant ncgativc impact on ambicnt air
quality in terms of CO.
I'he prediction of C'O for 'Without Project Scenario' is comparatively on the higher
sidc at all the distances from RtOW  whichi is mainly attributable to the higther emission
factors at lower traffic speeds.

NOx Levels:
Similar to emission fihcbors lor CO. values for NOx were obtained from the standards
proposed by IIP and corrected for the variations in speed using WHO guidelines. The
emission factors thus derived are also presented in Table No.3-5/4. One hourly
simulations for NOx were carried out on the lines similar to CO. The stability classes
D with wind speed of I m/s wvas considered for both wind cases.
Thc results for I hour average values for NOx for the years 2000 and 2015 at Sertha
bypass for cross and parallel wind cases are presented in Figures 3-5/5 and 3-5/6
respectively. The estimated NOx levels in the area around Kalol junction have been
depicted in Figures 3-5/7 and 3-518 for the years 2000 and 2015 for respective wind
condition. It is observed that the expected NOx levels in 2015 are about two times
higlher than the levels expected in the year 2000. Also 'with project' NOx levels are
about 20 per cent higher than the 'without project' scenario and pertain to higher NO.
emission at higher speeds.
When compared to WHO standard of 400 pg/m3, it is observed that the standard is
not expected to be violated during the year 2000 except for marginal violation
(estimated levels 430 pg/lrn3) upto a distance of 15 m near Sertha. The highest NOx
levels at the edge of ROW, during this year, are expected to be about 370 pg/rn3
marginally below the standard. Violations up to a distance of about 70 m from the
edge of ROW, however. may occur during the year 2015 'with' the project and up to
a distance of 30 m 'without' the project.
Due to unavailability of data on meteorological conditions, 24 hourly average
simulations have not been possible. Regions of probable violation of Indian Standard
of 80 pg/mr for 24 hour average levels therefore could not be stated. Considering the
fluctuation in the wind directions- over a period of 24 hours during the winter,
however, it is safe to assume that such violations will not be more than the violations
of I hourly average standard of 400 pg/m3.
When viewed with respect to the short term standard for NOx, therefore, the impact
of the project will be marginally negative with respect to " without project" option.
5.4.2     Impact on Noise Levels
J  *  Construction Phase
During the construction, the major sources of noise pollution are movement of vehcles
transporting the construction material to the constmction yard and the noise geneaing
actiNities at the yard itself Concreting. mixing casting and material movement are primary
noise generating activities in the yard and will be uniformly distributed over the enire
construction period. Construction activities are expected to produce noise levels in the
range of 80 - 95 dB(A). The major work will be carried out during the day time. The noise
produced during the construction *%ill however not have a significant impact on the

the proposed alignment bypasses Sertha village, one of the prominent habitation
along the project road;
designation of exclusion zones for construction activities will adequately protect
the sensitive receptors and
*    exccpt for constructions yards,  construction activity along the alignment is
transicnt in nature and, for any particular phase of construction, does not last for
miore tlat abouLt two weeks at onc location
Due to the hi-h noise levels of construction machinery, however, the personnel operating
the machines and workers stationed close to the machines are prone to exposure to high
levels of noise. Use of proper personal protective equipment, therefore, is necessary to
mitigate the adverse impact of the noise generated by such equipment.
The noise levels in the working environment are compared with the standards prescribed
by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA-USA) which in-tum are being
enforced by Govemment of India through Model rules framed under the Factories Act.
The acceptable limits for each shift being of 8 hour duration, the equivalent noise level
excposure during the shift is 90 dB(A). Hence noise generated due to various activities in
the construction camps may affect workers, if equivalent 8 hour exposure is more than the
safetv limit. ACGIH (American Confercnce of Government Industrial Hygienists)
prolpsed an 8 lu)tr I  limit or 85 dl3(A). Exposure to impulses or impact noise should
not exceed 140 dB3(A) (Icak- acoustic prcssure). Exposure to 10,000 impulses of 120
dB(A) are pernissible per day.
Thie noise likely to bc gencrated during excavation, loading and transportation of material
near the borrow areas will be in the range of 90 to 105 dB(A) and this will occur only
when all the equipment operate together and simultaneously. This vwll be a remote
possibility. The workers in general are likely to be exposed to an equivalent noise level of
80-90 dB(A) in an 8 hour shift for which all statutory precautions as per 'B' laws should
be taklen into consideration.
The noise levels can be, however. reduced by careful planning of machinery operations
and scheduling of operations.
i Operationtal Phase
During the operation plase of the project, uninterrupted movement of heavy and light
vehicles at high speeds is expected to give rise to higher ambient noise levels along the
road%%ay. The sensitive receptors such as schools and hospitals, situated within the zone of
noise impacts, are thus likely to be adversely affected. In order to quantify the project
induced impact with respect to existing noise levels, noise monitoring was undertaken at
Sertha. Chhatral and Water Park- near Mahesana. The observed noise levels have already
been presented in Table No. 3412. It is observed that during the day time the noise levels

been considerably lower, ranging from 48 to 55 dB(A) Wsith most of the observations
beinut below 50 dB(A).
Assessment of noise impacts due to the project at the locations adjacent to the project road
has been carried out by using Highws'ay Noise Model based on the guidelines suggested
by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The details of the model and the model
computations are descnrbed below.
5.4.2. 1    Noise Modeling
*  Details ol Noise %liodel
The Sound Pressure Level (SPL) generated by noise sources decreases with increasing
distance from the source due to wave divergence. An additional decrease in SPL with
distance from the source is expected due to atmospheric effect or its interaction with
objects in thc transmission path.
Estimating highway noise impact involves complex process. which will require a large
computer analysis to model in detail. However, the methodology presented below is a
general highway noise model, that predicts the equivalent noise level (L,,) and is adequate
for most noise assessimient requircments. The advantage of the model which predicts L.1 is
that L4 is the "ui,eigr A wrage" noise level and as such is not dependent on the statistics
of tihe trallic flow. In contrast, thc noisc descriptors L,. Lyi. Lx, can be vcry sensitive to
he lflowv cliaracteristics of the traflic. Further, the model presented below can be applied
equally wvcll to high and low traffic volume roadways.
The Highwav Noise M\odel presented below is for calculating the one hour L.,. The model
is based upon calculating the hlourly L., for automobiles and trucks separately and then
adding these logaritihanilicallv to obtain the overall hourly L, as follows:

The noise standards for the day and night time conditions are defined in terms of
equivalent noise levels from 6 AMI to 9 PMl (15 hours) for the day and from 9 PM to 6
AMi ( 9 hours) for the night. In order to pro.ide the traffic input to the noise model
therefore. it was necessary to proNide day and night time split of the traffic for each
cateuonr of vehicle. It was assumed that the day and night traffic ratios as observed during
the traffic survey during 1996 %vill also appl) in future. Accordingly.for respective links,
averag,e daily traffic volumes for each category of vehicle, for the years 2000 and 2015,

Shieldinig Factor
The shielding factor (Delta S) takes into account the various physical characteristics
surrounding the roadway and the observer. A reduction of up to 5 dB(A) is possible if
tliik vegetation separates thc roud and ithc receptor. For developing the noise
scenarios, however, shielding factor has not been considered. T'he predictions,
therefore, provides conservative estimate of noise levels, specially, for " with project"
scenario as the green belt and landscape will be so designed as to reduce the noise
levels at the sensitive receptors along the project alignment.
5.4.2.2.2  Presentation of results
The model results for the year 2000 traffic, "with" and "without" project scenaios in
terms of drop in noise levels with respect t the distance from the center of the road are
presented in Figure 3-5/9 and Table 3-5/8. It is observed that as a result of project
implementatiorL the day time equivalent noise levels are expected to be about 5 dB(A)
higher in comparison to "no project" situation. A difference of about 6 dB(A) is
expected between night time equivalent noise levels for the two options. The night time
levels however lower by about 3 dB(A) with respect to day time noise levels.

When compared to the ambient noise levels as recorded during the field observations, the
day time noise levels due to the traffic are significantly lower ( about 5 dB(A)). This
indicates that the local sources of noise are the prominent contributors to ambient noise.
During the day, therefore, project will not have any significant increment to the ambient
noise levels.
During the nighlt additional noise due to the project will be of the order similar to the
ambicnit Icvcls. IlIc ovcr all noise levels along thc project route would therefore will rise by
about 3 dB3(A).
The model results for the year 2015 traffic, "with" and "'without" project scenarios are
presented in Figure 3-5/10 and Table No 3-5/9. According to the model predictions noise
levels are expected to rise by about 3.5 dB(A) in the year 2015 when compared with the
year 2000. However, while estimating the future noise levels, the impact of probable
technological changes on the vehicular noise levels has not been considered.
Technological improvements in vehicle design are expected to produce relatively silent
vehicles in the future. Even if the present source emissions are reduced by 4-5 dB(A), the
2015 noise levels in the project area are not likely to rise beyond the estimated levels for
the ycar 2000.

A comparison of thc estimated noise levels with the day and night time standards
indicate that the standards for commercial zones will be violated up to about 200 m
from the road.
The computations carried out give an indication of noise levels for the worst case scenario,
i.e. without tak-ing into consideration the local features like landuse. barriers etc. In reality,
the noise levels are expected to be on lower side, as the areas adjacent to the proposed
road will be landscaped and covered with specially designed plantation to reduce noise
impacts at the sensitive receptors.
5.4.3     Impact on Water Quality
i    Impact on Surface Water Quality
The construction and operation of the proposed highway project will not have any major
impact on the surface water quality in the area. Contamination to water bodies may result
due to spilling of construction materials, oil, grease, fuel and paint in the equipment yards
and asphalt plants. But, the quantities of such spills is very negligible.
Care. however needs to be taken to provide adequate sanitary facilities and drainage in the
temporary colonies of the construction workers. Provision of adequate washing and toilet

facilities with septic tank-s and appropriate refuse collection and disposal svstem should be
made obligatory.
I Impact on Ground W ater Quality
Ground water pollution can take place only if a dump contains chemical substances, which
will get leached by precipitation of water and percolate to the ground water table. This is
not the case with the present project as the activity does not contain any hannili
ingredients which could leach down to water table. Hence impact on the ground water
quality is not anticipated from the project during the construction and operational phase
5.5       Impact on Ecological Resources
The baseline flora and fauna hias been depicted in Section 4.0. Accordingly, there is no
wildlifc sanctuary, rcscrved or protected forest in the close vicinity of the proposed
highway. The arca in a radius of 50 kIm hosts small patchcs of forest land, which mainiy
consists of few scrubs and trees. There are no endangered or rare species in the forest
patches. The impacts are briefly described in the following sections.
5.5.1     Impact on Terrestrial Ecology
The initial construction works at the project site involving land clearance, cutting, filling
and leveling. will cause loss of potential agricultural productive land and loss of vegetation.
A total of about 5000 trees out of about 1000 trees with girth more than 600 mm are
required to be felled for the construction work. The loss of trees need to be fully
compensated by landscape development all along the project road to minimise any long
temi impact of site clearance.
Inevitably. there will bc a short term impact of availability of ncsting sites for the birds.
Since thc arca halh1iOLs manly,14) local grainivourous avian fauna, this shoiold not afTect their
nesting reqLiireiiients. Further, thicrc is no sensitive ecological area near the cxisting road,
so the impact will not be of significance. With the landscaping after the project, the
number of trees are expected to be more than earlier numbers and will allow the short term
impact to be reversed.
The ROW requirements and the borrow areas does not involve any reserved/protected
forest land, hence impact is not envisaged due to the project.
The barren/grassland areas covered by the alignment have little or no tree growth.
The removal of herbaceous vegetation from the soil and loosening of the top soil generally
causes soil erosion. However. such impacts would be primarily confined to the project site
during initial periods of the construction phase and would be minimized through adoption
of mitigative measures lik-e paving and surface treatment, water sprinkling and appropriate
plantation programme. The project site will be landscaped with the development of green
belt consisting of a variety of trees wihicih would enrich the ecology of the area and add to
the aesthetics.

*  Wild Life
No rare or endangered species liave been reported from the area covered by the proposed
alignment. No wild life travel routes of simnificance have been noted/recorded along the
alignment. The wild life in these area do not confer any significant benefit on the local
population.
The increased velicular traffic coupled with higher noise levels due to various
constructional activities may drive away the local fauna from the project site to the
neighbouring area. As the project is devoid of forest and trees, it does not harbour any
fauna of importance. I'herefore, tile impact of constructional activities on fauna will be
negligible.
5.5.2     Impact on Aquatic Ecology
l
The proposed road does not crosses or passes near any major water body. No significant
impact on the Aquatic Ecology of the area, therefore, are expected due to the
construction and operation of the road. The construction of road, however, requires filling
of some ponion of a. pond near Sertha. Measures to deepen the pond so that its water
holding capacity is not reduced will be necessary to mitigate the adverse impacts due to
partial acquisition of pond area.
5.6        Impact on lumaii Use N'alues
5.6. 1     Soils
The impact on soil due to this project is in terms of top soil erosion. Considerable care
should be taken while'locating the camps buildings, borrow pits, quarries, spoil and
disposal site which will minimize the soil erosion. The impact of construction would be
minor as a very smnall area is susceptible to excessive soil erosion. Soil pollution would
takle place to a negligible extent due to spillage of construction material, oil, fuel, grease
and asphalt around the construction yards.
5.6.2      Land Use Development
The development in the study area will definitely bring substantial chanues in the landuse
pattern. In this process, areas presently under agriculture and vegetal cover will be diverted
for development and for other usage. The acquisition of less fertile fallow lands mostly
covcred under the revenue land and its conversion for different developments will lead to
enriched land uses which include construction of residential area, offices and other
infrastructural facilities and thcse activities may occur in the immediate vicinity of the
proposed project area.

'Ilic proposed pruicct includcs landscaping trec plantation all along thc road alignment
wvhicil will add to thc qtuality of lifc and aesthetics of the area.
Another critical factor would be the degiradation of the borrow  areas outside the
construction zone. These borrow areas should be reclaimed by flling up the trenches and
development of greenbelt over them.
* Land Acquisition and Transfornation
The extent of area for land acquisition for the proposed project has been identified and
does not involve any sensitive archeological monuments etc. The social impacts of land
acquisition and adequate mitigation measures are brought out in the Social Assessment
report.
*  Construction of Roads and Bridges
This acti%itv involves construction of the main highway road, road over bridge, cross
drainage works, approach roads, and other supporting structures. This activity involves
use of bulldozers, road rollers, water tankers etc., This activity is machinery intensive
resulting in noise and dust generation. However, this activity will be a short-term effenft.
Protective measures should be undertaken during the construction phase.
The construction activity can provide ample employment opportunities for the residents of
the nearby villages. The construction of proposed road would also promote business
avenues for the local people, better transportation facilities and development of
industrialization in the area.
' Construction of Site/Camp Buildings
This acti%itv involves construction of buildings for office, construction camps and
hlabitation during the construction period.
This may result in cicaring of vcgetation and pose sanitary and health problems in the
construction camps. Due care should be taken to maintain hygienic conditions at site.
5.6.3 )   Socio-economic Impacts
Emplovment Opportunities
The project is likely to be completed in a period of 3.5 years in two phases. During
this period manpower will be needed to take part in various project activities. About
500 persons per day are likely to work during peak periods. In the post-construction
phase about 300 persons/day will be employed for operation and maintenance of the
system. Thus. the project would provide social benefits in terms of direct employment.
Additionally more people may be indirectly employed in allied activities and trades.

Ahimcdahad to Nilahcsaiia with improved conditions. This will l'acilitatc the rural
population to move from onc State to another to bring and sell tiheir produce. The

an(d return tlie-elioii Xt'ili thc devclopmcnt of project. it is likely that niorc pcople
from the region will be involved in trade. commerce and aliied services. Witih the
availability of dependable road link with Ahmedabad the overall industrial and
commercial growth in the region is also likely to witness accelerated growth.
*  Reduction in Time of Travel
Savings in travel time will be the major benefit to the road users. Implementation of
the project wvill raise the average vehicle speed by more that 20 kmph for all
catceorics. For the expectcd speeds in the year 2000. the rise in traffic speed will
translate in a savintgs of about 25 minutes in the travel time between Ahmedabad and
Mahesana.
d Enhanced Safety oni the Road
The traffic currently utilising the project road is a mix that arises due to local trips by
the rural population, industrial and commercial activities in the project area and the
long distance through traffic. At some locations considerable pedestrian movement
is observed. As a result, a few traffic bottlenecks, specially at Sertha and Chhatral
have developed. As a result the number of accidents on the road is constantly on the
rise. With the three fold estimated rise, under the "no project" situation by the year
2015, the problem will further deteriorate very considerably. Augmentation of
existing 2-lane undivided carriage way to 4-lane divided carriageway with service
lanes at critical siretchcs will provide major improvement in road safety by segregating
thc fast and slow moving trafirc and increasing the road space.
5.7       Other Issues
5.7.1     Transport of Hazardous Material
As brought out in Section 3. during the road side survey, it was found that about 23.9% of
the commodities transported through the existing.road are of hazardous type comprising
of petroleum products (0.6%No). industrial raw materials (9.5%), petrol and oil (7.0%/a) and
chemicals and fertilizers (6.8%).
After the implementation of the proposed road, increase in traffic is envisaged due to
development of industries and other allied activities in the close vicinity. On the other side,
congestion problems and probability of accidents will reduce considerably due to the better
design service level.
The spillage materials on the road near the ponds or rivers/canals may cause loss of life or
property as also adverse water quality impacts, if the materials find their way into smrface

water bodies. Transport of the hazardous matenrals by road is regaulated bv Motor Vehicles
Act 1989. which provides precautions to be followed by the consignor. owner of the
i±oods carrier and its driver to mininize the nrsk of accidents and damane control in the
event of mishap. As a precautionary measure. Special Purpose V ehicle (SPV) should
obtain insurance cover to provide for loss of property and life and also for the cost of
cleanup operations. The nearest fire brigade stations should also be upgraded adequately
to handle the emergencies arising from accidents involving spillage of hazardous materials.
5-7.2     Severance Issues
J'      The Severance studies were conducted all along the project road including Sertha
bypass. The community utilities like water pipeline, road-crossings, electrical
installations. telephone poles and liigh tension power lines, schools, religious places,
burial grounds, etc. were noted.
The section-wise (each kim) details of the utilities like telephone, electric poles and fibre
optic cables have been shoun on the Drawings (see Volume 5, Part I & Part 2)
An oil and gas pipeline together with an optical fibre cable lies beneath the road from
A,hmedabad to Mahesana, the former at a depth of 2-2.5 in, the latter at about I - 1.25
m. deep. The vertical alignment will be designed to keep above these facilities. There
are about 1000 telephone and electricity poles within the ROW and these will require
relocation. There are two graveyards at either side of the road at Chhatral (Km 36).
These limit the right of way at the locations. It would be culturally and socially
unacceptable to consider removal of these sites from their existing locations, hence the
road will be narrower at this section.
As regards cattle and pedestrian movement across the road is concemed. it is necessary to
nitigate the adverse impact by providing sufficient road crossings over all the critical
locations along thie road.
5.7.3     Cross Drainage Works
The proposed project envisages repair/reconstruction of the existing Cross Drainage (CD)
workls and bridges where warranted and construction of new bridges and CD works
adjacent to the existing ones (due to widening of the carriageway). Hence impact of CD
workLs is not considered to be of significance.
5.7.4     Environmental Impact at Quarry Sites
Import of earthfill material and stone aggregates for construction of highway form the
major quarrying needs for the project. The overall material requirement for earthfill
iailcrial and stonc aggrcgates have been estimated to be about 2.2 million tonnes.
Mining is under progress in the identified stone quarry and is under lease arrangement with
the Department of Mining and Geology. Accordingly, the lease agreement stipulates
implemientationi of cnvironmiental management plan incorporated in mining plan approved
by the Indian Bureau of Mines. during and at the closure of mining operations. Under the

impacts on local environment are therefore not envisaged due to stone aggregate mining of
the project.
Further it needs to be noted that the existing qliames are being utilized for supplying
material to Mahesana and Ahmedabad. The proposed project will require only a fraction
of the annual output of these quarries.
5.8       Summarn of Impacts of the Project
The potential impacts of typical highway projects was given in Table No. 3-5/1. The Table
No. 3-5/10 below summarizes ilte impacts specific to this project considering the present
environmental setting.
5.9       Analhsis of Allernatives
Two categories of alternatives were considered while finalising the project alignment. First
category of altematives were in the form of choice of different alignments for the project
road. The secondary category of alternatives were in the form of different configurations
of serNice roads and allied facilities. Various options with respect to the two categories of
alternatives were considered during the initial stages and the most suitable project option
described in Section 3 was considered for detailed environmental and social assessmnent.
The project altematives for the detailed assessment, thus, confined to "Build" and "No
build" options. Findings of the assessment of two options have been presented in the
earlier sections and it is observed that although there are a few irreversible impacts during
the operation phase of the project, specially in terns of noise and air pollution, the impacts
are essentially minor. Appropriate mitigatory measures such as landscaping, greenbelt
development and enhancement in road design through underpasses for road crossing will
maike thc project environmentally and socially acccptable.
The "'build" option is also desirable by virtue of its beneficial impact on the local and
regional economy.

6.0   ENVIRONIMENT!AL MANAGEMSlENT 1PLAN
(,. I  ltItrI-flhtICti .... ,
This section enumerates the set of measures to be taken during project construction and
operation to eliminate or reduce adverse environmental impacts to acceptable levels,
based on an Environinicntal Nianagement Plan (EMP).
Broadly, the EMP is divided into the construction and operation components. For the
integration of the EMP with the project implementation, identification of the responsible
institutions has been done and appropriate budgets have been shown. Finally, a
monitoring and institutional plan has been presented.
6.2   EMP During Construction
EMP during construction addresses issues such as,
*  Compcnsation for Loss of Land
*  Rehabilitation and Resettlement during Land Aquisition
*  Labour Camps
*  Soil Disposal and Soil Erosion Control
*  Air Pollution
*  Water Pollution
*        *  Impact on Natural Pond at Sertha Village
*  Compensatory Afforestation along with road
*  Lighting Provisions
6.2.1  Compensation for Loss of Land
About 13 hectare of land needs to be acquired to construct 2.5 km long bypass for Sertha
village. Out of 13 hectare about 9.54 hectare is under private ownership. Several social
and economic issues are involved with the acquisition of such lands. Importantly, for
those families which loose significant land holdings to the project, adequate measures to
restore income levels are necessary to be integrated with the project development. All
relevant issues related to land acquisition and removal of structures falling within RoW
have been discussed in Section 10.
6.2.2  Labour Camps
During construction, it is estimated that a labour force of 425 people will be working on
the project for a duration of 3.5 years and in two shifts. Most of the labour would be
collected for the daily shif, howevcr, a need exists for at least one or two labour camps at
the site.
Although the location of labour camps is the responsibility of the contractor, local
authorities would have to be consulted. Further, labour camps should not be set up at
certain exclusionery zones. Figure 3-3/7 shows the locations where labour camps are not
recommended.

The provision of potable water and sanitation labour camps should be covered by the
(icncral Conditions of Conitract (GCC) and sliould be framed such that tile labour camps
receive safe and adequate quantity of water and sanitation facilities take care of the
disposal issues in an hygenic manner.
Water supply to thc iabour camps may be done from existing tube wells along the
alignment whlich are owned by the farmers. Water abstraction from natural ponds (such as
those near Sertha) should not be done, unless consented by the pond users.
Sewage and the domestic solid waste generated at the construction work-ers colony would
have a negative impact on the aesthetics and environment of the surrounding area, if not
disposed ofl in an efficient manner. Sanitation blocks consisting of low cost solutions such
as dry pit latrines may be considered with a provision of adequately sized septic tank. A
provision of Rs. 0.35 million has  to  be made for provision of water supply and
sanitation facilities.
About 425 people per day will be work-ing for 3.5 years in two phases during the
construction period. According to the criteria of the Ministry of Health and the World
Health Organisation (WHO), the labour camp should have a Health Centre with one
doctor and support staff. Contractor will be responsible to provide the health facilities to
the labour workling for this project. A provision of Rs. 0.35 million has to be made in
the project estimate.
6.2.3  Soil Disposal and Soil Erosion Control
Construction of road involving cut and fill and embankment is a specialised and a
complex task. For safcty and environmental reasons, elaborate measures need to be
adopted  for  collection, transfcr and disposal of excavated soil.  Soil collection,
transportation, disposal and its trcatmcnt nced to be carried out in a systematic manner.
These containers should be such that soil should not spill during transportation to the
disposal site. The excavated soil will be first collected at temporary sites and then
transferred to the disposal sites.
The construction activities in this project are expected to generate about 880,000 m3 of
soil. Out of this, about 600,000 itn is lik-ely to be re-utilised in filling. As cut and fill sites
are at different places, and the fact that the available volume exceeds requirement
disposal, identification of temporary and final disposal sites is necessary during
construction/detailed study.
A tnick has a carrying capacity of about 8 tonnes. and hence about 4 m' of earth could be
disposed dtirinig every trilp, and on this basis 70.000 truck trips will be required during
construction. IThis means about 125 truck trips will be required everyday. Movement of
the trucks should be restricted to only two shifts of the day to avoid nuisance to the
neighborlhood.

Kadi-Aalol spur Road
It is estimated that about 12 ha of land will be required to dispose off the excess volume.
For ilic control orsoil crosion, grass vegctation is reqjuired at the final disposal sites. The
cost of grass vcuctation is about Rs. 7,000 per ha. Ilence the total cost of grass
vegetation works out to Rs. 84,000/-
6.2.4  Impact on Air Quality
During construction period the impacts on air quality are mainly due to the material movement
and the actual construction activities.
Due to material movement air quality over a large area is affected though, not in significant
levels. There is an increase in the dust levels all along the haul roads, the borrow areas and the
dumping areas.
The emissions from the construction machiinery are the major source of ambient air pollution
during the actual construction. Continuous use of concrete mixers, generators, bulldozers,
rollers, crane, trucks etc., give rise to the ambient NO2 levels which may exceed the
permissible concentration limits. The degree of impact may increase during winter season and
during night time.
Mitigation Mieasures for Mobile Source Emissions
In order to curb the increased fugitive dust emissions in the area due to vehicular
movement and raw material transport, provisions should be made for sprinkling of
water on all the haul roads in the area. Sprinkling of water should be carried out at
least twice a day on a regular basis during the entire construction period especially in
the winter and summer seasons. Special attention should be given to all the haul roads
passing through residential areas in the region. Daily inspection at haul roads and at
construction site should be caffied out to ensure removal of construction debris to the
landfill sites;
Dust covers should be used over the beds of trucks which will be used for the
transportation of materials prone to fugitive dust emissions. Additionally any of these
materials which may collect on the horizontal surfaces of these trucks dwuing loading
should be removed before transportation;
*      Construction requiring street closings in heavy traffic areas should be performed
during off-peak, hours;
*      Idling of delivery trucks or other equipments should not be permitted during periods
when they are being unloaded or are not in active use,
*      Concrete should be supplied from an on site batching plant in order to reduce travel
distances of concrete delivery trucks; and
*      Low emnission (diesel) construction vehicles should be used wherever possible.
Mitigation Mleasures for Fixed Source Emissions

The construction yards N02 emission is expected to a have significant influence up to
I km distance on the downwind side under adverse meteorological conditions. Hence,
it is essential that it should be located within I kn of major villages likle Sertha,
Chhatral and Kalol;
All stationary equipmcnts sliould be located as far as practicable from receptor
locations in order to allow dispersion of emitted pollutants;
*     Areas prone to fugitive dust emissions (such as demolition, excavation and grading
sites and routes of delivery vehicles across areas of exposed earth) slhould be stabilized
by usint water;
*     Though the exclusion area for construction will allow control of NO2 at major villages,
during winter season the ambient air quality in the predominant downwind direction
should be monitored at a frequency of two days per week for 24 hours to assess the
prevalent emission levels at sparse settlements to decide the need and extent of
restrictions on night time construction activity. If the air quality limits are found to be
violated, the construction operations during night time especially in the winter season
should be carried out under rcstricted conditions. The work schedule and the operation
timrn of each machine can be suitably modified and have limnited construction activity to
exercise a control on the ambient air quality levels;
*     Proper care should be taken for storage of furnace oil, LDO etc.; and
*     As soon as construction is over the surplus earth should be utilized to fill up low lying
areas.
6.2.5  Afforestation
In the absence of proper planning, the project may leave behind ditches and scars in the
area all along the road alignment, seriously affecting the aesthetics and public health. An
approved code of practice for developing barren area will have to be followed. Also
landscaping proposals shall have to be worked out to suit the terrain through which the
road is passing. The Contractor will be responsible for landscaping along the road
alignment and development of barren areas.
The Department of Forests, Ahmedabad is responsible  for the  conservation and
management of trees/forest in the project area. The Forest Conservation Act of 1984
stipulates strict forest protection measures and outlines procedures (guidelines 1/08-
1 (ii)) for compensatory reforestation if the department accepts conversion of forest land
for other purposes:
*     if non-lorest land is not available.  compensatory  forest plantation is to be
established on degraded forest land to the extent of twice the affected or lost-
forest areas:

Adali-AuhtI spur Rnuad
*     if non-forest land is available, compensatory forest plantation is to be raised
over an area equivalent to the affected lost area of the forest.
For the present project. it is found that about 5,000 trees are likely to be lost due to the
project construction. Following the forestry rules, double the number of trees, i.e. 10,000
will have to be afforested along the road alignment. The objective of the afforestation
programme is to develop natural areas in which ecological functions could be maintained
on a sustainable basis. Therefore, planting of miscellaneous indigenous tree species
should be applied. The recommended tree species are given in Table No 3-6/1.

6                       Jeilji                       Bauhinia racemosa
Apart from the afforestation requirements, development of green belt along the road
length is desirable as it attenuates the air and noise pollution, adds to aethetics, provide
shade to road users and camels, serve as nesting ground for the birds and helps in
maintaining the micro-climate. With these benefits of afforestation in mind, a plan of
landscaping and planting of tress is propsed along the entire road length. Based on Rs.
600,000 lkm, the costs of compensatory afforestation and landscaping for this project
workl out to 312 lak-hs.
Landscaping should be done with a lag of 3-4 months from the start of the work on any
section. The section should be deemed to be complete when the landscaping is over. An
agency must be appointed thereafter to maintain the survival of plants and paid on plant
survival rate;
Plant species suitable for the area should be planted at the onset of monsoon season. The
plants should be provided adequate protection from animals and proper monitoring should be
carnied out to assure their grosth.
6.2.6  Noise Control
During the construction stage, there would be an increase in the ambient noise levels of the
region due to continuous traffic movement and the construction vehicles.
Mitigation Measures
The siting of construction yards sites should be done leaving at least 100 m  distance-

The main noise producing sources such as the concrete mixers, generators, grader etc.
should be provided with noise shields around them. The noise shields can either be a
brick masonrv structure or any other physical barrier which is effective in adequate
attenuation of noise levels. A three meter high enclosure made up of brick- and mud
with internal plastering of a non-reflecting surface will be very effective in these
regards.
Noise measurements should be conducted during the construction to assess the
prevailing noise levels. For protection of construction workers, ear plugs should be
provided to those working very close to the noise generating machinery.
The exposure of workers to high noise levels especially, near the ROW needs to
be minimised durin, construction period. This could be achieved by:
job rotation
The workers employed in the high noise level area could be employed
in low noise level areas and vice-versa from time to time.
noise control methods such as mufflers or barriers
Special acoustic enclosures should be provided for individual noise
generating equipment, wherever possible. During construction, there may
be high noise levels due to use of Cement Concrete Mixers, Generators,
Dumpers/Trucks, Bulldozers, Rollers, Excavators, Pavers and graders.
Effective measures should be taken during the construction phase to
reduce noise from these sources for instance by fitting exhaust and intake
mufflers.
The operation of the above construction equipment can produce noise
levels upto 100 dB(A) at a distance of 25m. The noise level could be
reduced by using a combined sound absorbent to 70dB(A) at a distance of
15m. The construction contract should specify the use of equipment
producing not more than 90 dB(A) for the eight hour operation shift
Use of noisy construction equipment should not be permitted during night
hiours.
Noise level from loading and unloading can be reduced by usage of
various types of cranes and by placing materials on sand or the beds of
sandy bags.
6.2.7 Water Pollution
The proposed project will not alter the existing water quality on a permanent basis, but duwing
the construction phase extent of surface runoff and silt load may increase giving nse to a
negative impact on receiving natural water bodies, especially the ponds.

Runoffs from the construction site should be passed through silt traps.
6.2.8  Impact on Natural Pond at Sertha Village
Another negative environmental impact would be due to the alignment by the by-pass at
village Sertha The by-pass alignment cuts an existing pond at village Sertha by about 10% and
hence 10/o of the pond area needs to be filled up. Any alternate alignments are either leading
to more land aquisitions or not acceptable from the transportation engineering point of view.
The impacts of such an intervention are three fold,
*     Loss of pond's hydraulic capacity with risks of flooding in monsoon.
*     Risks of induced soil erosion and water pollution by vehicular ermissions
*     New alignment causing a bamer to the existing pond users, including cattle.
In ord:r to minimize the above impacts, following mitigations have been recommended.
Mitigation Meawres
*     Measures like deepening of the pond, bank improvernent works should be done in
order to maintain the same voluretric capacity of the pond;
Proper vegetation or landscaping at the sides of the pond boundary can minimize the
extent of contamination of the pond due to pollutants released by vehicular traffic.
Adequate underpass should be provided as close to the pond as possible to allow the pond
users from the either sides of the road, especially the cattle to continue accessing the
pond. This provision has been already made in the design and cost estimation of the
project, based on the interim recommendations of the EAISA study.
6.2.9  Lighting Provisions
It is proposed to provide the illumination at Toll Plazas, Kalol Bypass, major
intersections, underpasses and cattle crossings. Normnal requirements for illumination arc
summarised in Table No 3-6/2. The Contractor will be responsible for providing the
illumination at the various points listed.

6.3    EMIP durinig Operation
The operation of the proposed highway would be socio-economically beneficial to the entire
area due to a reliable and fast transport facility with a high level of service. Traffic congestion
and resulting delays and accidents would be minimized on all other roads of the area.
A rise in air pollution in the areas in the downwind direction ofthe road will be observed as the
traffic grows in future. The observed levels will be however lower than the expected levels as
smooth traffic flow will reduce the emission levels per unit distance travelled. Also noise levels
will be lower due to re-routing of the aligment away from the population centres.
6.3.1  Impact on Air Quality
Afier the project implementation the ambient air quality levels in future years will be better
with respect to without project scenario. However, as the traflic increases, the ambient air
quality will rise. The effect will be more pronounced during winter season when night time
ground level inversion are observed in the area.
Mitigation Measures
The most effective control methods of air pollution due to vehicular emissions is to use
fuel efficient engines, introduction of catalytic converters for petrol vehicles and use of
smoke traps for diesel vehicles;
It should be made compulsory for all vehicles to adhere to the engine maintenance
schedules and standards to reduce air pollution due to vehicular emissions.
*     Along the highway plantation of trees such as neem which has known properties to
absorb HC is recommended. Care should however be taken to space the trees so as
not to restrict movenent of air, and
*     Development of landscape along the main road can bring about 30 percent_eduction
of concentration of pollutants at the ground level. It is therefore recommended that the
area available on both sides of the highway should be used to develop a green belt
with dense canopy to mininize the air quality impacts in the downwind regions. Such
development will also improve the general aesthetics in the region.

due to coniniiiuous trallic Movement. Amuibient niu ht time noise levels would experience high
levels due to movement of heavy traffic.
Mitigation Mleasures
Development of greenbelt along the main road can also bring about considerable
reduction in noise levels. The area available on both sides of the road should be used
to develop green belt comprising selected species of trees with high canopy to provide
added attenuation of noise;
Use of air homs should be minimized on the highway during night time. During
daytime use of homs should be restricted at few sensitive locations. This can be
achieved through the use of sign boards along, the roadside; and
Future development along the road should follow correct landuse norns so that
sensitive receptors are not located along the road, specifically along the bypasses.
-     Formal recommendation can be made to GoG about the need to restrict any maor
activities within the impact zone due to voilations of noise standards both near
residential and commerical areas upto a distance of about 150 m from the ROW (after
taking attenuation of noise due to landscaping etc., into consideration). In the absence
of any such laws on land development along the road in the existing situation, the
social and financial implications of which have not been addressed in the report
including its viability.
6.3.3  Emergency Measures
Emergency measures are adopted to avoid total failure in the system e.g. lights, fire and
accidents. The aim of the Emergency Action Plan is to identify areas, population and
structures likely to be affected in the event of a catastrophe. The action plan should
also include preventive action, notification, warning procedures and co-ordination among
the various relief authorities. These are discussed in following sections:
Emergenicy Lihliting
Emergency lights operated on battery power should be provided at each toll plaza,
subway and crossways.
Accidents, Fire and Emergency Medical Aid
As the proposed project road will lead to continued and increased transportation of hazardous
substances, even if they are expected to follow the Environmental Regulations regarding
storage, handling and transport it is necessary to provide for some back-up facilities in the
event of an accident. It is recommended that the following facilities be provided as a part of
the project:

ii.    tow truck for rcmoving damaged vehiclcs
iii.    communication facilities at each (and in between) ends
iv.    access to fire-local (district) fighting facilities.
In the current operation scenario of the project, it is necessary for the project operator to
undertake additional responsibility for above back-up facilities in view of the stakes involved in
operation of the toll road. However, like any other national/state highway, the operator's
responsibility is nevertheless limited since it is the district administration's job to highway
accidents.
6.4    Insitntional Arrangements
Table No 3-6/3 highlights some environmental issues which are directly related with the
project. Appropriate mritigation measures with respect to these issues entail participation of
concerned departments of Govemment of Gujarat. Thus the sugested measures with respect
to these issues, therefore, are advisoTy in nature and not binding on SPV or the prospective
contractor.

The views of the villagers should be elicited and the questionnaire (in the form of Information
Brochure I Leaflet) need to be expalined for the personal interviews. Formal meetings are to be
organised with the women and vouth groups at major villages along the project route. These
proccedings should emphasize on the cormmnunity profile of the most affected villages including
their problems, basic issues and concern over acquisition of pond, land and temple etc.
6.4.2  EnvironimumLal nmonilorinig and institutional arrangements
The rmitigation measures suggested in Table 3-6/3 requires monitoring of ambient air quality and
noise levels during winter and peaki construction activities at the construction yard respectively.
The monitoring requirements can be adequately met by sub-contracting the assignment to an
organization undertaking ambient air quality and noise monitoring.
It will be desirable to formalize a mechanism for the incorporation and supervision of
recommended mitigatory measures during the construction. As a first step the mitigation plan
should be made a part of bid document to enable the prospective contractor a good
understanding of recommended measures and his responsibilities towards their implementation.
To supervise effective implementation, SPV should take the following steps during construction
phase of the project.
*     Assign all supervision to an official conversant with environmental and social issues
related to the project;
*     Constitute ('iziL' ('omnnltlee with due representation from women, Non Government
Organizations (NGOs) and elderly residents to provide regular feedback on adequacy of
mitigatory efforts;
Arrange for monthly report from the contractor on steps taklen for implementation of
mnitigatory measures;
Report and discuss the progress of implernentation with public through Citizens
Committee at an interval of every three months; and
Formulate a system of forewarning the users and residents of the road section
under strengthening considering the constrained traffic flow during construction
of the road.
6.5    Budgetary Cost Estiolates For Emiviroinienlt Prolectiowi
The mitigation measures suggested in Section 6.4 require monitoring of ambient air quality,
noise levels and maintenance of green belt (Landscaping) along the proposed highway. The
monitoring requirements during the construction phase can be adequately met by sb-
contracting the assignment to an organization undertaking these studies by SPV. The cost
estimates presented in this section (Table No 3-6/9) are for the mitigation measures brought out
above. Tlhese cost estimates give only a an indication of likely cost.

proposed project will be strengthening the existing CD works and proposing new ones
adjacent to the existing ones, hence the CD works is not an issue of significance in this
pro."'tl
However, as the proposed project road will lead to continued and increased transportation of
various commodities, including hazardous substances, even if they are expected to follow the
Environmental Regulation regarding storage, handling and transport, it is necessary to
provide for some back-up facilities in the event of an accident. lt is reconunended that the
following facilities be provided as a part of the project:
i)     ambulance stationed at the toll booth
ii)    tow truck for removing damaged vehicles
iii)    comnmunication facilities at each (and in between) ends
iv)    access to fire - local (district) fighting facilities
In the current operation scenario of the project, it is necessary for the project operator to
undertak-e additional responsibility for above backup facilities in view of the states involved in
operation of the toll road. However, like any other national/state highway, the operator's
responsibility is nevertheless haunted since it is the district administration's job to highway
accidents.

Social Assessment - An Introduction



A###ll-A##tiOll r % ff111 tJ
7.0    SOCiA,l ASSESSMENT- -AN INTRODUC'10N
7.1   lutro1odiactiall
Road improvement and construction involve expropriation of land and structures from the
current owners/users. Besides, the economnic disturbance due to land acquisition (L.A)
the construction work- may displace present economic activities within the corridor of
impact of the project. This wvill include eviction of any squatters and removal of petty
commercial structures/encroachments from the ROW forming part of the corridor of
impact. Expropriation of land, eviction of squatters and removal of commercial
encroachments may cause social disruption and economic loss for project affected persons
(PAPS) and their families. The economic losses for the project-include loss of a
commercial structure access to economic opportunities, -or the loss of income.
Therefore, while implementing the project one needs to take into account these
disturbances and losses due to the project, their impact on the socio-economic living of
the peoplc and )lenI for the mitigation measures to minimise any negative adverse
impacts.
As the -project will be implemented by IL & FS, the principles as laid down in- its
Environment and Social Assessment Report (ESAR) become applicable. The ESAR is in
conformity to the World Bank's resettlement policy as contained in Its Operation
Directives 4.30 on in-voluntary resettlement. The ESAR emphasises that the population
displaced and/or adversely affected receive benefits from the project and that where
displacement is unavoidable, the project should assist with the means to improve the
former living standards, income generating capacities and production levels or at least
maintain the previous standards of living of those displaced-and adversely affected. This
requires socio-economic study of the affected area and its people so as to understand their
social, economic and cultural conditions and identify factors which influence the lives of
those affected. The results of such a survey -will indicate the social impact of the project.
This will also provide base line information to plan measures to mitigate any adverse
impacts of the project on the people. These mitigating measures and the strategy for
their implementation are contained in a Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation
Action (LA & ERAP) detailed in subsequent sections of this document. The task of
conducting socio-economic survey and preparation of the LA & ERAP was entrusted to
Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick (SWK) in association with RITES for the project.
7.2   Information oo Project and Scope ror Social Assessment
ROW (Right of Way) refers to the public space which is under the control of RBD
(Roads and Building Department). It is understood from preliminary studies conducted
by IL&FS that ROW of 60 m. exists generally for the whole route between Ahmedabad
and hiahesana except at Sertha village where the By-pass has been proposed. The
proposed by-pass at Sertha village would necessitate land acquisition. Approximately 13
ha, of land has to be acquired from the villagers for the construction of Sertha By-pass.
Information for this has been collected with the help of Revenue Officials and Revenue
Records.

Kadika8lolspvur Roadl
In case of Kadi-Chhatral link Road. the ROW is 24 m and strengthening the single
carriagc way of two lanes is proposed.
- On botli Lhe Ahmlledabad Mchsana State Highway and the Kadi-Chhatral link road there
are commercial encroachers along the roads. These are primarily located at cross roads
and near some prominent industries. Thus the mitigation measures for these activities will
not require any land-acquisition.
The construction of an over-bridge at a Railway Crossing is also proposed.
7.3    Objectives of the Study
The focus of the exercise is to assess the social impact of the project, identify issues and
consequent risks in the resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) of PAPs, outline measures
to mitigate any negative impact of the project. In other words, the exercise has two main
components: (i) a General Social Impact Assessment (SIA), the results of which will
becomc the base for (ii) an LA & ERAP.

8.0   LAND ACQUISITION PROCEDURE AND ENTITLENIENT FRAMEWORK
8. I   Legal ;nrauiework for Lauld anid Property Acquisition
8.1.1  Land Acquisiton for Road Improvement
Lands coming within the 'corridor of impact' will have to be acquired to undertake
related civil works. The Land Acquisition (LA) office in the Revenue Department (RD)
and the RBD have jointly verified the lands falling in the 60 mtr. ROW. Land records
were acquired from Revenue officials.
The prcscnt study has been carried out as a general Social Assessment by collecting
relevant socio-economic data from the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and to prepare a
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the adversely affected PAPs.
All LA for any public purpose in the state is governed by the Land Acquisition Act (LAA)
1894 amended in 1984. It is a Central Act and empowers the govemment to acquire
Compulsorily any land not owned by it but is required for public utility. The LAA applies
to those with legal entitlements to land and structure thereon. In this RAP these are
referred to as 'title holders' of the land and other properties there on.
In accordance witlh this Act,
*    Compensation for land can be awarded by granting 'land for land'.
D    Thfis is granted by the Collector in particular circumstances.
3    Where compensation of privately owned lands, trees, structures and other assets is
paid in money, it is provided at the prevailing 'market value'. According to the
Land Acquisition Manual, market value is the price whichi a willing vendor might
reasonably expect to obtain from a willing purchaser. In addition to market value a
sum equivalent to 30 % of the value of compensation, known as Solatium amount
is paid in consideration of the compulsory nature of the acquisition. Interest is paid
on the compensation and solatium amount from the date of notification -of the land
acquisition or the date of possession of the land, whichever is the earliest.
If there arc any disputes relating to the fixation or rates, these are referred to the
court for settlement
If the land acquisition results in a holding to be operationally nonviable, the entire
holding will be acquired and compensated accordingly.
8.1.2  Procedure for Land Acquisition
For any LA, the Act under section (uls) 4(l) stipulates publication of a notification to
that effect in the official Gazette and in 2 daily newspapers, circulated in the locality of -
which at least one shall be in the regional language. Such a notification enables the -
concemed authorities to enter upon the land, make preliminary survey and determine the
exact portion of the land to be acquired. The substance of this notification is given as

concerned authorities to enter upon the land, make preliminary survey and determine the
exact portion of the land to be acquired. The substance of this notification is given as
public notice at a convenient place in the locality in which the land to be acquired is
located. Such a notification provides an opportunity to the parties interested in the land to
file objections if any, u/s-5A to the proposed acquisition.
The next stage of LA is the declaration u/s-6 of the Act specifying the precise boundaries
of the arca of the land to be taken. Every declaration is publishled in the official Gazette
;iid 1in Iwo tdiily nCwspapcrs hIaIving local circulationi.  Withl thc nppearancc ol' this
notification in the Gazette, Government in RD issues direction to the Collector u/s - 7 of
the Act to take order for the acquisition of the notified land and/or other immovable
properties. Section-8 of the Act requires land to be marked out, measured and planned,
while u/s-9 notices are served to the concerned stating the intention of the govemment to
take possession of the land and that any claim for compensation should be made to the
Collector. Finally, the award is made by the Collector u/s- Il of the Act after enquiring
into objections (if any) in pursuant to the notice given u/s-9, to the measurements made
u/s-8 and into the value of the land on the date of publication of the notification u/s 4(l).
The award u/s - 11 is made within two years from the date of publication of the
declaration and if no award is made within this period, the entire proceedings of the LA is
lapsed and fresh notification u/s 4(l) needs to be initiated. Once the award is passed, the
Collector takes on of the land, which there upon vests absolutely in the Government from
all encumbrances. However, in case of urgency Section-17 of the Act empowers the
Collector to take on of the land even though no award has been made. Such land
thereupon vests with the Government to free from all encumbrances. However, while
paving compensation, interest is paid on the amount from the day the landholder loses
access to die land.
8.2    Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy
An R&R policy, encompassing the broad objectives and principles of R&R, categories of
the PAPs and their entitlements and institutional support for implementing mitigation
measures, is a pre-requisite for formulating an Action Plan. For this purpose, the R&R
policy as contained in the ESR of IL & FS formed the base for the RAP.
The IL & FS's R&R policy recognises the need to demonstrate its commitment to social
issues in each of its projects. In the context of social policy, the three cardinal principles
of IL & FS mentioned in its ESR are:
i)   enhance the quality of life in and around the project
ii)  prevent adverse social situation ; and
iii) mitigate possible adverse social impacts.
These principles are in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines on Involuntary
Resettlement (OD 4.30). The present project will also be covered under the same
gtuidelines. The policy takes into consideration those within the 'corridor of negative
impact' of the project. Essentially, they are iff two broad categories,

encroachers on government land and squatters within the corridor of impact.
S.2. 1 Deiiiiition ol I'Al'
Every adult person affected by the project implementation through acquisition of land
and other properties or removal of squatters and eviction of encroachers from the
'corridor of impact' or indirectly by the loss of any economic opportunities due to the
project is, considered as a Project Affected Person (PAP). And a PAP displaced as a
result of acquisition or removal of structures from the 'corridor of impact' is considered as
a displaced person or displaced business depending upon the purpose for which the
structure is being used.
8.2.2 Cut off Date
The cut-off date for the PAPs losing their privately owned land and structures outside the
public land (ROW) and the persons losing to land and other structures within the ROW,
and their eligibility for R&R assistance is the date of the socio-economic survey in the
area and for this project the cut off is October, 1996.
3.2.3 Categories of PAPs
In the context of this Project the following are the major categories of PAPS:
i)   who lose agricultural land including tenants
ii)  whose livelihood/tradeloccupation is affected
iii) who is deprived of occupational assets
iv) whose occupation is affected by loss of customers and services
v)  who loses access to common property / resources
vi) others found / reported affected by the project.
8.2.4 Entitlements
IL&FS is committed to minimise displacement as a result of implementing a development
project. The ultimate objective of the compensation for the asset lost for the project and
any resettlement assistance to the PAPs is to improve their standards of living above the
levels thcy cnjoyed before the project. The entitlement framework is given below:

9.0   SOCIO-ECONOMIlC PROFILE
9.1   Introduction
The entire process of formulating Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was done in close
consultation with the PAPS.
The Social - Assessment Study has been carried out in the three parts.
1.    The ROW  proposed under by-pass at Village Sertha.
2.    State Highway between Ahmedabad-Mahesana excluding Sertha by-pass.
3.    The link road between Kadi and 'Y' Junction at Chhatral.
As a prelude to the socio-economic survey, the consultants carried out a verification
exercise of the entire corridor of impact of the project mainly to identify any structures
coming within the proposed road alignment. Most of the area within the corridor of
impact was found under private use for agriculture and commercial establishments
(essentially encroachers).
For this project report, as part of socio impact assessment, the consultants undertook:
i)    verification of all commercial units coming within the corridor of impact for both
the Highway and the Link road and establishing their ownership;
ii)   verification of agriculture lands to be acquired for the By-pass
iii)   conducting socio-economic survey among the potential PAPs whose lands were
to be acquired.
iv)   focus group meetings with affected stake-holders.
v)    preparation of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) in consultation with the PAPs .
9.1.1  Verification Exercise
Verification exercise was planned basically to identify the primary stake holders of the
project and subsequently to carry out the socio-economic survey among the potential
PAPS. For this purpose, consultants initially contacted Revenue Officials to get the land
records. They also collected relevant details, as available with the RBD, on the LA in the
area.
A verification format was used to note down all the relevant information including
ownership and present use, dimensions and type of structure, and distance from the
existing central line of the road. This was done by contacting individuals/ owners/
occupants of structures/ landholders within the ROW; and the by-pass. The data so

collected formed the base for minimising displacement and other adverse impact of the
project.
9.2 - Socio-Economic Survey
As indicated earlier, a prerequisite for conducting socio-economic survey was the
verification exercise to identifi primary stake holders of the project. It was decided to
carry out the household survey among all the land owners and also the occupants of
structures (used for commercial activities coming within 60 mtrs. ROW of the Highway
and 24 mtrs. of the spur road).
A well designed and pretested '1louselhold interview schedule' was used for collection of
data. Important aspects covered in the questionnaire were the identification particulars of
the PAP, his/her family details work participation and employment asset/possession,
likely losses of household income, opinion on the project preferences for their
rcsetlemcent etc. Most part of the qucstionnaire was precoded excepting those reflecting
the opinion and choices of the PAP which were left open ended. (Annexure VII).
Through focus group discussion held in both the segments a better understanding of the
nature of the commercial activity and the perception of the group to the project was
ascertained.
9.2.1  Commercial Encroachers on Ahmedabad-Mahesana and Kadi Chhatral Link Road
A verification exercise was undertaken to identify the encroachers on the Highway and
the Kadi-Chhatral Link road.  During this period the owners of the commercial
establishment were taken into confidence and explained the requirements of the Project.
Their confirmation to participate in the Socio-economic survey was also obtained during
this process.
It was evident that the owners are aware of the unauthorised nature of their activity.
Subsequently their investments in the activity is also limited, as all the structures
constructed in the ROW are of a temporary nature. Iron frames and wood has been
primarily used without any foundation, so dismantling and shifting would be an easy task.
Interestingly the strengthening and developing of the Highway and the spur road was
welcomed by the owners, who saw the potential of more traffic and therefore better
business. The construction of the overbndge at a Railway crossing will also definitely
benefit the commercial activity due to movement of traffic. They therefore expressed
willingness to shift their structure at appropriate alternate sites.
9.2.2 A Brief Profile of Commercial Encroachers on Ahmedabad-Mahesana Road
Information gathered throws up some pertinent issues with impfications for the RAP
(Table No. 3-9/1).

* Total 36 is because one owner has recorded 2 units on his name. (Total 35 unit
owners).
Thus as is observed the majority of the activities are of fairly recent origin. The
development of the District as an industrial centre and the consequent increase in the
highway traftic would explain this.
With the subsequent improvement of the highway and classification of this group as
economically affected and thus eligible for a compensation, it is pertinent that no further
encroachment takes place and/or that the cut off date for eligibility is fixed at the data of
survey. This monitoring could be entrusted to the NGO working on the R&R of the
Project.

Rs. 10,000 investment motor-repair shops are included. The sole encroacher who has
invested Rs. 20,000 has the only totally "Pucca" encroachment, where he conducts a

In the case of this group though the size of the units remain relatively snall i.e. upto 10
sq.m.. it is observed that more than 50% of the units have reported the use of iron and
corruw.ated sheets in putting up the structure, which gets reflected in the higher investment

Table No. 3-9/7 indicates the income levels as reported by the respondents. It is evident
that 5 of the encroachers are falling below the poverty line.
9.2.4  Overview
Both the groups of encroachers represents an all too familiar scenario in the process of
industrialisation and urbanisation of a region. The petty servicing sector and vendors who
are dotted all along the highways and industrial units are essentially in the informal
sector and responding to consumer demand for the services and goods they offer. For a
majority of families owning these units is their main source of income due to their
inability to'get jobs in the formal sector. Thus an important consideration of relief to units
that have to be shifted for improving the ROW is necessary in the RAP.
The income of 13 families on A-M Highway and 5 families on the Kadi-Chhatral Link
road falls below the present poverty-line and thus special measures will have to be taken
for these families, which will be discussed in RAP.
9.3   Social Assessniemit Anid Profile or Families Losinig Lind in Tlie ROW  Area at
Proposed By-Pass at Village Sertha
Land acquisition for the proposed By-pass (Refer Figure 3-3/5) poses an altogether
different set of issues for the preparation of the RAP.
A Socio-economic profile of the families and the nature of land loss is presented to
identify the special needs of this group. The methods used for this assessment, were both
group discussion and a survey which was administered to each land owner.
From initial verification of the By-pass alignment it was evident that there would be no
impact an any structure either residential or commercial, so the issue of resettlement of
families was totally avoided.

in a series of group meetings held with the villagers who would be affected by the loss.of
land. efforts were made to explain the rational of the project by presenting before them
the alignment and the issues emerging from it.
The major reactions as presented by the villagers on the present alignment are presented:
(i)    The iteed of the By-pass for diverting tIze traffic anid preventing thze traffic jams
ont the highwray wvas wrelcomed by thze villagers. The residenits of Sertha nleed to
cross the highimay very ofteni for variouis activities and tlhe present incessant
traffic janis makes this a risAy affair. Noise a nd air pollutiott caused by the
hemay ritck traffic is also iroublesomzefor the villagers.
(ii)    While discussing the alignnmenti of ithe By-pass it was poizned ouit by t*ze villagers,
thlat the locationi is very imear to the prinmary sch0ool, iihich is beinlg used not onfly
hv tlhe chiildren of Sertha village but tlhe nieiglhbouring villages. Thus there was
somne apprehentsion about tihe safety of 1the chzildrent on accounzt of tihis proximity.
(iii)  hi a similar mtainner, the present aligmnment lies in between the village pond anid
!he resvidentiial part q?f the village. (in fact part of tIhe lancd to he acqutired is utnder
the ponid).  Impact .f bjpass oIt potnd users needs to be investigated ani
adequately mitigated.
Though 47 owners had been identified whose lands were to be acquired only 44 families
responded to the survey forms. The three families who refused to participate in the
process, however had joined in the group discussions. In their opinion the By-pass was
totally unnecessary and thc problems on the Highway could be solved by improving and
strengthening the existing road itself. They were against the acquisition of their lands.
It.was evident that these families did not wield much pressure at the community level as
they could not influence the opinion of other land holders. However the NGO engaged in
the R&R phase would need to pay special attention to the issues raised by this group and
reconcile them to the process of land acquisition, which may other wise become a
-  inderance in the process.
9.4    Key Survey Findings
Key variables which will be relevant to the formulation of the RAP and subsequent R&R
activities are identified and analysed.
9.4.1  Distribution of Families by Caste.
All the families are Hindu by religion, representing a homogenous group. it was observed
that there is only one family belonging to the S.C. and 9 families belonging to the OBC
(Table No. 3-9/8). The NGO engaged in the R&R can thus mobilise the special facilities
available as per present State Government Policy to augment the rehabilitation efforts for
these specific families.

9.4.2  Distribution of families and PAP by Family Size.
As the data indicates 50% of the families have a family size of more than 8 members and
another 3' 2% of families have a size of 5-8 members. Thus the pattern of agriculture
based families still being joint families is very much evident here. Of the 406 identified
PAP, 91.86% belong to the above two set of families (Table No. 3-9/9).

of wonien working on their agriculture lands were reported in the age group of 18-45
years. The concept of female panicipation in work force is not prevalent. By and large
the pattern of 'owner-cultivator' is observed and it was reported that casual farm hands
- were engaged on a daily basis now and then.
A critical point of enquiry was to ascertain loss of livelihood of non-land owning families
who may be dependent on the lands to be acquired. No such families were however
reported during the field work.
9.4.3  Income Levels and Sources of Income
It is evident that all the 44 families that have responded to the survey have reported
agriculture income (see Table No. 3-9/11). In addition, 13 families i.e., 300/o approx. have
also reported income from non-agriculture sources. (Annexure VIII)

Total                   44*                      100
*No response= 3 families.
Majority of the families ie., 79.4% have reported an annual income of upto Rs. 40,000
from agriculture. The analysis of land holding also indicates that all families are having
the minimum economic holding and thus engaging in agriculture is economically viable for
them at a lower level.
On analysis of non-agriculture income an interesting picture emerges. Of the 13 families
who reported non-agricultural income 9 families i.e. 69.2% had an agriculture income of
upto Rs. 20,000/- only. This explains the need to tap other sources of income for these
families. The remaining 4 are in a higher agriculture income bracket i.e., between Rs.
20,000 to Rs.40,000 approximately.
Thus the distribution of families when analysed by gross annual income from the all
sources, undergoes a modification, as shown in Table No. 3-9/12.

Total                    44                       100
While analysing the gross annual income the number of families reporting an annual
income upto Rs.40,000/- has dropped to approx. 66% (from the earlier 79.4% in only
agriculture income)  thus indicating the importance of non-agriculture sources for
maintaining the viability of family income level .
In the face of the growing urbanisation and industrialisation of the region it would be
pertinent to equip the youths from the region with appropriate skills necessary for the
formal industrial sector. Appropriate training in self-employment and vocational skills can
form an important aspect of the NGO - social rehabilitation measures more specifically for
families below annual income of Rs.20,000/-
Agriculture is a traditional way of life for the PAP families. Various items for family
consumption are obtained from the land. Thus land asset is an important factor in the
PAP's perception of future development in the region.  Overriding all this is the
attachment to paternal land holdings, which explains the reluctance to part with
agriculture land.
This is thus an important factor when analysing the loss of land under the proposed By-
pass project and its consequent impact on economic earnings of the affected families.
The detailing of land acquired and consequent compensation package is an important
component of the RAP that needs to be monitored in the R & R stage by the NGO.

10.1 Iltrodiactioii
The TOR provided to the Consultants underscores the importance of a satisfactory
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), which is to be formulated on the basis of the socio-
economic data and social assessment obtained through the group meetings and personal
interviews.
Durin, the period of tlie field ivork a number of concerns have been expressed by the
PAPs and the RAP, in an effort to ensure fair and just mitigation measures for the affected
families within the Entitlement Franmework provided by IL & FS mentioned earlier.
The RAP thus addressed the following concerns:

Approximaicly  13  1a. of land has to be acquired  from  the villagers  for  the
constructioni of' tie Sertila bypass involving displacement of PAPs. Data lias been
collected from the land loser PAPs by identifying them with the help of Revenue
Officials and Revenue Records. A village map showing the route alignment finalised by
R&3B Govcrnment of Gujarat (Figture 3-3-/5) indicates that a total_ofl64plats are to be
acquired for constructing the bypass. Data collected has been scrutinised and it is found
that in many cases two or more plots are owned by the same person. A total of 47 land
owners were identified owningg 69ptots whereas 7 plots are owned by Gram Panchayat
and ONGC. Each and every family so identified has been contacted during the survey.
For the purpose of real assessment actual land loss to individual land owners has been
assessed and the details are given in the following statement.
Since three PAPs have not responded to the survey, it is assumed that they are losing the
entire land under the survey No. indicated in the statement.
As per the Gujarat state norms non-irrigated agricultural land holding below 1.4 ha. is
considered to be non-viable in economic terms, assuming that most of these lands are
non-irrigated and in view of non-economic holding under 1.4 ha. the table indicates that
21 land owners are non-viable even before the land acquisition 2 more land acquisition
taking the total to 23 land owners. wvho will have to be given extension and support
services to make these famiers economicaliv viable. A provision for such a rehabilitation
measure will have to be made in the budget.

Thc assessment indicates that the maxinimLi  land loss to  an individual taniilv is 0.5790
ha. It lirilher indcicates that out ot 1  ha. landl to be acquired 3.36 hia. belongs to Sertha
Cirami l'anchavat and U.168 lha. belongs to ONGC.
It is important to know  io0W individual families are afYected by land  acquisition. This is
brought out bv an assessment of percentage of land which each individual family is
losing due  to the  proiect (Table No. 3-1012).  For the purpose, size of total  land
owned by individual PAPs is ascertained and the percentage of land to be acquired has
been uiven in the Table No. 3-1013.
Data included in the statement indicates that most of the people are losing insignificant
proportion of their land.  It is evident  from   the fact that more than 40°,o PAPs are
losing less than  I 0%O  of their owned land and on the other hand only 6.38%  PAPs are
losing more than 50°,0 of their owned land.  It can  also be  observed that around 80%
PAPs are losiniz less than one thiird of thieir owned land.
Intercstingly an analvsis of the income levels of the families losing more than 50%0 of land
reveals the followinu:

Given the lower level of income from agriculture of these three families there is a good
potential of encouraging family members to also undertake non-agricultural pursuits by
necessary training and skill development inputs in the rehabilitation phase.
If one considers the remaining eight famnilies losing more than 20% and below 50%/o of the
land, only three families have non-agriculture income and hence the remaining five
families will have a direct negative impact on their Gross-annual income. This group
should also be entitled to a rehabilitation impact for supplementing their income. This is
pertinent because most of the families have small land holding i.e. less than 2 Ha. and
agricultural operations may become economically non-viable.
In the course of the consultation with the PAP groups losing land, a marked preference
was expressed to a 'land for land' compensation package. Assistance from the revenue
officials will have to be sought to identify such alternate lands. This issue may be more
critical to the families losing more than 20% of their land.
In the absence of viable altemate land at convenient location monetary compensation is
proposed. Enquiries revealed that the prevalent market rate in the project area was
approximately  Rs.6.25  lakhs  per ha.   Negotiation  for an  acceptable  monetaly
compensation will have to be facilitated by an NGO on behalf of the Project Proponents
to ensure fair and speedy disbursement and ensure the goal of social-justice.

Care should be taken that the land acquisition schedule does not destroy the standing
crops for thlat year. This will allow the PAP to avail of the income for the year and in tum
generate a positive good will for the project.
In the event that it is not possible to synchronise this with the construction schedule - then
cash compensation for standing crops at the prevalent market rate should be given.
10.3  Land Owned By Gram Panchayat/ONGC
The following issues are identified in this context:
a.    loss of Pasiture lanid
b.    sliiftiig of BaAliaudi
c.    acqiisitioni of land parilyv occupied by village ponid
d.    proxinitzty of Ai -p7ass io village p)rinary school.
(a)   Loss of Pasture land: In the event that residual pasture lands are available these
could be developed by Gram Panchayat through a compensation by Project
proponent to ensure undisturbed supply of fodder for cattle.
(b)   Compensation for loss of Balwadi: Monetary compensation that would allow for
a better planned and equipped  structure should be undertaken by Project
Proponents in land identified by Gram Panchayat. Construction of Balwadi and
land scaping and beautification of campus should be undertaken to ensure the
provision of a community asset that can be put to multi-purpose use (for ex-
meeting hall, training centre, recreation centre and library). This will ensure a
social facility that will enhance the quality of life of the village who can organise
themselves and derive multiple benefits from this centre.
The management and monitoring of this activity can be entrusted to the NGO,
who will facilitate local groups to optimise the use of the resource and ensure
community involvement in the process, ultimately leading to handing over of these
structures to the community groups and withdrawal of NGO from the area, within
a specified time frame.
(c)   Acquisition of land partly occupied by village pond: The By-pass will separate the
pond from the residential pocket of the village. Acquisition of part of the pond
land will impact the quantity of water available. The road will cause a safety
hazard to the frequent movement of people and animals to the pond. The
following mitigation. measures to be undertaken by the project proponents will
minimise the negative impact of this land acquisition.
i.     Provision of alternate/addition water supply to the village by piped water supply
scheme to be installed on the existing pond thereby eliminating the need to cross
the highway and augmenting this suppiy with the tube wellslbore wells in -
consultation with Gram Panchayat and residents.

ii.   undertake the land scaping and deepening of the pond to ensure adequate
collection of water. Encourage social-forestry programme in Pond area to reduce
siltation of the pond.
(d)   Proximity of By-pass to village primaTy school.: The situation poses a serious
threat to children's safety as the natural tendency of the children to run across
cannot always be controlled.  The project proponents should undertake the
following measures to mitigate the negative impact.
1.    provision of adequate protection boundary/wall for the school campus adjoining
the By-pass road.
2.    provision of proper passage across the road with sign-posts , speed breakers,
traffic-lights and Construction of Pedestrian bridge across the road in addition to.
3.    Afforestation of boundary to provide a Green Belt to mitigate negative impact of
noise and air pollution - that will directly impact the children studying in the
school.
The Social facilities in the village that will be negatively impacted by the project are
common property resources. The NGO thus will require to establish the confidence of
the residents and ensure their participation in the mitigation measures. Working through
existing local - groups or assisting in the creation of community based organisation is a
major area of intervention for the NGO.
Furthermore the NGO with the active assistance of the CBOs would be able to mobilise
additional social-programmes from the various government schemes for enhancing the
social activities in the village. These would be maternal and child care programmes funds.
for balwadi and creche, literacy programmes and non-formal education activities, etc.
Of special relevance in this effort would be the inputs for skill training and presenting
before the residents the scope for engaging in self-employment to adequately respond to
the new opportunities that the opening up of the region will present.
A major role for the NGO would be to ensure a continuous and smooth communication
process between the Project - proponents and the residents. Advocacy on behalf of the
residents in the case of gemine givevances would also be necessary.
10.4  Commercial Encroachers in ROW  or Ahmedabad-Mahesana Highway And Kadi-
Chhatral Link Road
The following commercial encroachers have been identified in the Project Area
i.    Ahmedabad-Mehsana Highway - 36 units
ii.    Kadi Chhatral Link Road    - 23 units

On the Ahemedabad-Mehsana Highway commercial encroachers are at 11 different
localions. L.ocation stcII as rnaci crossings. rnilwny crossing, cross-roads, nnl lit thc gntc
of a major inidustr-ial unit (ONCiC) attract the maximum comnmercial encroachers.
The survey analysis indicates that 13 unit owners on A.M. Highway and 5 unit owners on
Kadi-Chhatral link road are presently having family incomes below the prevalent poverty
line (i.e., Rs. I 1,000 annual household income). Majority of the remaining unit owners
have reported incomes that places them just above the poverty line.
Displacement of 61 units that are in the ROW will cause major hardships to all the unit
owners. Thus the RAP will consider the following:
1.    Special inputs for the 18 below Poverty level families - all existing Government
schemes and programmes should be tapped to assist the families in addition to the
measures undertaken by the project. This task could be undertaken by the NGO
working on R & R.
2.    Replacement cost for loss of structure: 46 units i.e., 75.4% have a size of upto 5
sq.mtr. Another 13 units i.e., 21.3% have a size between 5-10 sq.mtrs. The
smaller size of the unit and nature of the material used to put up the temporary
structures is also reflected in the investment patterns made by the unit owners.
Requirement of structure replacernent cost for all 46 unit owners having upto 5
mtrs. will be entitled to the replacement cost of 5 sq.mtr each. For the remaining
15 units the replacement cost of the structure would be based on actual structure
size as per the details given below: (Table No. 3-10/4)

3.    Identification of alternate sites for commercial units: (i)As the present strategic
location ensure an economic viability of the activity, the units displaced should be
given the priority for conducting their business from within the ROW where
service-bays, etc. are provided (ii) If this is not possible land at strategic location
will have to purchased and allotted to the units owners for putting up their
commercial activities. -As seen in the earlier table the project would require to
acquired 365 sq. mtrs. of land for the total 61 commercial units.
The NGO will play a pivotal role in assisting and monitoring the rehabilitation of
commercial encroachers. It is also important to ensure that once the unit owner

are shifted for the project and rehabilitated at alternate sites, they would enjoy a
legal status.
The issues of legal status of the activity and requisite permission is an issue to be
managed by the state R & B within its existing legal and policy frmework.
However it must be noted that the goods and services provided by the commercial
encroachers are catering to the needs of hiighway travellers, botli passenger and
goods transport, who are patronising these facilities. Thus any measure to check
this activity should not lose sight of the 'demand led' nature of this activity and
provision of alternate facilities through a participatory mechanism to identify
alternate sites is necessary. This should be undertaken by the NGO. The technical
design may incorporate the provision of parking - bays and rest areas and service-
sites where these PAP groups should be given a priority in setting up their
commercial activity.
10.5  Measures for Mitigation of Any Negative Impact During Construction Phase
Any major construction activity in and around the vicinity of existing settlements and
social facilities throw up a host of issues which could lead to long lasting negative impact
on the local population and settlements if not managed properly.
These are broadly listed as under.
*  requirements of land/space for putting up temporary structures for the use of site-
offices, materials godown and residential camps for construction labour.
3  safety measures necessary during blasting and use of dynamite.
*  pressure on existing goods and services because of influx of temporary construction
labour ex-water, ration-shops, local vegetable and grocery market and a consequential
increase of prices impacting the local population.
* issues of social conflict because of presence of "outsiders" and consequent concern
for the safety of girls and young women in the village.
It is therefore, necessary that Project proponents are sensitised to these situations and
undertak-e definite commitments from  the civil works contractors undertaking the
construction, to reduce the negative impact. It will be the responsibility of the Project
proponent to monitor closely the inputs of the contractors during the process of
construction.
Additionally some positive steps could also be undertaken to minimise negative impact
and ensure a cooperative environment from local villagers for timely completion of the
Project. Some of these are:
1.    priority for engaging local labour skilled and.unsk-illed.
2.    awarding of petty contracts for earth work, digging, cleaning, and supply and
transport of material etc. to local civil works contractors and residents.

3.    isolating self sufficient labour camps and ensuring removal of structures on
completion ofjob.
10.6  Entitlement
IL&FS is committed to minimise displacement as a result of implementing a development
project. The ultimate objective of the compensation for the asset lost for the project and
any resettlement assistance to the PAPs is to improve their standards of living above the
levels they enjoyed before the project. The entitlement package for the project is given
below in Table No. 3-10/5.

11.0  INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
11.1  Introductioii
The Ahmedabad-Mlahesana road proejct is envisaged to be implemanted by a special
purpose vehicle (SPV).
The SPV  has the representation of financing agencies, GOG  and IL &   FS.
Implementation of the LA and social and economic rehabilitation (ER) component of
the project will be the responsibility of the LAO and SPV. The responsibilities will
include planning, implementing and monitoring of all the activities related to LA and
rehabilitation  programmes of the project.  The LA  &  ER  programmes will be
implemented in the Mehasana District. The SPV will implement economic and social
programmes with the help of NGO.
LA is the responsibility of the Revenue Department which is done through Special
Deputy Collector or the District Land Acquisition Officer at the district level who
acquires land and other properties as per the requisitions received from the
concerned project authorities and in the present case it is the RBD on behalf of the
project. At the district level, requisition is placed by the District Executive Engineer at
the divisional level and submitted to the District'LAO. Land plan schedules indicating
the details of the lands required are prepared by the Executive Engineer at the divisional
level and submitted to the District LAO to initiate LA proceedings.
At the project level, the SPV will be responsible to implement the project and
coordinate all activities, relating to the implementation of LA and rehabilitation
programmes. Since no displacement problem is expected, no separate staff is envisaged
to implement LA & ERAP. The Divisional Executive Engineer will assist the SPV in
planning, implementing and monitoring rehabilitation programmes at the district
level. For all practical purposes, he will be the District Rehabilitation Officer
(DRO). The DRO will be assisted by the staff under his control including Assistant
Engineers and other sub-ordinates. The Project Environment and Social Consultant
from IL & FS will review and advise SPV programmes. It will approve rehabilitation
programmes and advise on the type of economic assistance to be provided to the PAPs.
Various  government  departments  and   public  agencies particularly from the
Department of Roads and Buildings, Revenue and Rural Development and Financial
Institutions have great role in implementing the RAP. The RD is responsible not only
for acquiring the land and other properties and handing them over to the project
authorities, it is also required to allot available govemment land for housing and
agricultural purposes.  The District Rural Development Agency will extend  the
development schemes  for  the  welfare  of the  community.   In  fact,  the
representatives of some of these departmentslagencies in the DLRC will help primarily to
integrate various development schemes for the economic rehabilitation of the project
affected community.
The other major stakleholders in the project are:

within the ROW of Ahemedabad-Mehsana Highway (approx. 51 km.) and
the Kadi-Chhatral link- road (approx. 12 kmr).
11.2  Strategy For Imnplenientation
The project involves the resettlement and rehabilitation measures and the acquisition of
land for the project will have impact on 23 land holders. Therefore, there is a need for
concerted efforts to see that the affected families are rehabilitated properly. This
requires working closely with the PAPs, understand their problems and help to minimise
any adverse effect of the project. The LAO, is the only functionary in the district who is
presently in touch with the PAPs. Generally, the LAOs are drawn from the RD and are
well exposed to dcal with all revenue matters. It is here that the NGOs can be of great
help. NGOs will also ensure greater involvement of PAPs in decision making at the
field level and implementing R & R programmes.
For purposes of efficient people oriented and timely project - implementation it is
proposed to introduce the following agencies in addition to the existing arrangements,
who will also be assigned specific responsibilities:
i.    Non-Govemmental Organisation (NGO)
ii.    Monitoring and Evaluation Agency (M & EA)
11.2.1 Role of an NGO
Local NGOs are also new to this aspect of social problem. However, given their
exposure and experience to work at the grass root level, they are relatively better
equipped to feel and comprehend the pulse of the PAPs and work with them. Thus,
with their long experience of working with the local population, their help in the
economic rehabilitation (ER) of the PAPs assumes importance.
In the present context, an NGO will work as a link between the project and the affected
community. It will educate PAPs on the need to implement the project, on aspects
relating to LA and rehabilitation measures and ensure proper utilisation of various grants
extended to them under the R & R package.

11.2.1.2 Selection of NGO
It is of utmost importance to select an NGO which is good, genuine and
committed to the task assigned. NGO having local presence and experienced to deal
with social problems like the involuntary resettlement will be preferred. Since the
magnitude of R & R is relatively small, only one NGO will be selected to help the
project authorities and the LAO in the implementation of the RAP. Selection of the
NGO will be done by the project authorities i.e., Special Purpose Vehicle '(SPV).
I 1.2.1.3 Contracting NGOs
NGO will be involved in the implementation of the PAP through mutually agreed
upon terms and conditions with  specific responsibilities  and   adequate  inbuilt
accountability. AMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) will be signed with the

services will be required for 18 months. Monitoring and evaluation of the LA & ER
Action Plan (LA & ER AP) will also include the performance of the contracted NGO.
11.2.2 Monitoring And Evaluation (M & E)
The M & E will be simultaneous with the implementation of the LA & ERAP. For this
purpose, conventional monitoring by the SPV, as described will continue which
mostly relates to the extent of LA and compensation paid, number of families receiving
compensation, extent of government land identified and allotted to the PAPs, extent
of private land identified and transactions settled, other ER assistance extended and the
related financial aspects etc. However, an extemal M & E agency will be engaged for
meaningful and realistic monitoring and evaluation of LA and ER programmes on
periodical basis. -
11.2.3 Project Level Monitoring
The SPV will be responsible for setting up and putting in place a monitoring framework
for the R & R implementation of the LA and ER component of the project. Since M
& E will be simultaneous with the initiation of LA & ER activities, the SPV will
develop proforma for monitoring at different levels - project and district. Such a
.monitoring system will help in developing quality control and planning for remedial
measures to overcome implementation problems and build them into the programme of
activities. Besides focusing on various physical and financial aspects, preparation of
quarterly progress reports on the progress of LA & ER activities will form the
important task of the SPV.
In  order to strengthen monitoring of LA & ER programmes,  a Project   Level
Rehabilitation Committee (PLRC) will be constituted. The committee will meet once
in three months to approve plans and monitor implementation of LA & ER activities. it
will advise project level staff on various aspects of the programmes to make
implementation more effective. The organisational chart and composition of the team
and its functions are given below:

level there is an Environmental and social Management Group (ESMG) which
comprises of specialists with adequate expertise and skills to understand the critical
issues concerning environment and social aspects. Besides, IL & FS also retains the
