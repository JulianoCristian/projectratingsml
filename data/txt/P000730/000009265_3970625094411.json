The proposed project would:  (a)\n            relieve congestion at the Assab port; (b) alleviate\n            bottlenecks at Assab; (c) carry out the detailed engineering\n            and other studies of phase 2; and (d) finance studies of the\n            Marine Transport Authority's (MTA) staffing, training,\n            cost accounting and tariffs.  The project, itself, would\n            involve several components.  They include:  (i) tug berth\n            construction; (ii) port cargo handling and workshop\n            equipment; as well as (iii) site investigation and detailed\n            engineering for phase 2 development of the Assab port.  The\n            project would also finance; (iv) a study to update economic\n            analysis of phase 2 together with financial analysis; (v) a\n            study of MTA's manpower development, cost accounting\n            and tariffs; and (vi) training of MTA staff.  The\n            construction of the tug berth will release an existing berth\n            for general cargo use."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
