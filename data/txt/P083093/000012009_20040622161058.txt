1. CHARACTERISTICS OF MINE AND SURROUNDINGS

       The Kompania Wglowa S.A. Zaklad Górniczy (Hard Coal Mine) "Bytom II",
hereinafter called Mine "Bytom II" was established on 1st February 2003. The Mine employs

at present 1540 persons and extracts 2000 tons of hard coal per day. The mining area of the

Mine is located in the northern part of the Silesian Upland within the territories of Bytom and
Piekary lskie municipalities. The surface of the mining area presently amounts to 5.14 km2,
of which 4.50 km2 is located within the Bytom municipality and 0.64 km2 within the Piekary

lskie municipality. The surface of the mining area of Mine "Bytom II" comprises:

 in the south-western and western parts ­ city building, eastern borders of Bytom
   downtown,

 in the south-eastern part ­ two concentrations of buildings: in the region of the so-called
   "Awaryjne" Housing Estate of ZGH (Mining and Metallurgical Works "Orzel Bialy") and

   in the region of Harcerska Street in Brzeziny lskie, a district of Piekary lskie,

 in the southern part ­ industrial and housing building along the Siemianowicka Street in
   Bytom,

 in the central, northern and northeastern parts of the mining area ­ workers' gardens,
   agricultural fields and idle land.

The urbanized part of the mining area has territorial (underground) development with water-

pipe, sewage, power grid, gas, heat distribution, and telephone networks. The mining area of

Mine "Bytom II" is crossed by main traffic roads connecting Katowice with Pozna and

Kraków with Wroclaw, as well as PKP (Polish State Railways) railway tracks Katowice-

Tarnowskie Góry, Chorzów Stary-Tarnowskie Góry and railway trunk line of sand mine

"Szczakowa". The southern part of this mining area is crossed by tracks of tramway lines

No. 8, 6 and 41. From the hydrographic point of view, the mining area of Mine "Bytom II" is

located within the watershed of the Wisla (Vistula) and Odra (Oder) drainage areas. No river

flows directly through the mentioned above mining areas. There are 12 natural water

reservoirs located in depressions and post-mining subsidences (basins without outflow) fed

with precipitation waters as well as three artificial water reservoirs.

       The Management of Kompania Wglowa S.A. has appointed a Liquidator of Mine

"Bytom II" and obligated him to realize the mine liquidation process within the following

time-limits:

     initiation of the liquidation process - 1st February 2004
     termination of production                - 31st December 2004


                                                                                            3

2.      ENVIRONMEN1TAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

2.A. ENVIRONEMNTAL IMPACT REDUCTION PLAN OF KW SA ZG
        ,,Bytom II" LIQUIDATION

     The environmental management plan in the Mine "Bytom II" liquidation process

contains the following projects (tasks):

1. backfilling of needless mine workings,

2. backfilling of the shaft "Stalmach",

3. carrying out of mine drainage,

4. demolition of buildings, dismantling of installations, disassembling of machines and

   devices.

        Apart from the four mentioned above projects in the liquidation process other

operations will be conducted, among others ground reclamation in areas degraded as a result

on mine activities as well as repair of generated mining damages. Because their realization

will be conducted in connection with the removal of effects of Mine exploitation, and not

effects of its liquidation, the ,,Liquidation Program" will cover them.


BACKFILLING OF NEEDLESS MINE WORKINGS

        According to the regulations of the Geological and Mining Law, the liquidation of

Mine "BYTOM II" requires the liquidation (backfilling) of needless mine workings. There

will be backfilled 12,380 m of mine workings, of which 11,050 in 2005, and the remaining

1330 m in the year 2006.


The mine workings will be backfilled with filling material, including wastes. Filling of closed

mine workings will be realized in sections determined in the liquidation technical project.

Before filling, the given section of working will be dammed off from both sides. The filling

material (wastes) mixed with water will be directed to the dammed off section of the mine

working through a pipeline. The excess of water will be discharged into the Mine drainage

system.

   During the contact of the filling material (wastes) with water, pollutants will be washed

out from the waste mass. Water polluted in this manner will be discharged into the

environment by means of the Mine drainage system. In connection with the above it is

necessary to use only materials with suitable physic-chemical properties to be checked during

monitoring performed as specified in detail in item 2B.


                                                                                            4

BACKFILLING OF THE SHAFT "STALMACH"

The total depth of the shaft "Stalmach" amounts to 560 meters. From the shaft diverge

roadways on the levels: 150, 250, 350, 540 and 660 meters. The shaft tube crosses at the depth

of 70 ­ 120 m two Triassic water-bearing levels. These levels have connection with the Main

Underground Water Reservoir "Bytom" T/3.

        Before starting operations connected with shaft backfilling, dams in order to protect the

workings around the shaft should be constructed. The shaft will be backfilled with wastes.

Operations will be executed taking into consideration isolation by means of plugs of materials
with water permeability coefficient lower than 10-9 m/s in order to isolate the Triassic water-

bearing level. Between the plugs will be placed material being inert in relation to the water
environment. It is anticipated to use 14,500 m3 of material for shaft backfilling, including:
11,911 m3 of debris, 1,294.5 m3 of inert material, and 1,294.5 m3 of isolating materials with
water permeability coefficient lower than 10-9 m/s.

        It is necessary to use only materials with suitable physic-chemical properties to be

checked during monitoring performed as specified in detail in item 2B.


CONDUCTING OF MINE DRAINAGE

        According to the regulations of the Geological and Mining Law, the Liquidator of the

Mine is obliged to conduct Mine drainage in order to protect underground workings of

neighboring mines. Mine "BYTOM II" drainage is conducted through the shaft "Barbara"

where draining equipment (pumps) are installed. The water collected in water reservoirs at the

depth of 660 meters is pumped by means of a 6-pump system to the surface and then discharged

by pipelines to the ditch "Orzel Bialy", a tributary of Brynica river.

        The Mine "BYTOM II" has a water-legal permission to discharge underground waters

into the ditch "Orzel Bialy", a tributary of Brynica river of maximum quantity amounting to
11,230 m3/day. With respect to the change of water management manner resulting from

liquidation operation conducting, the establishment carrying out these activities will be obliged

to attain a new water-legal permission. For that reason a new "Water-legal environmental

impact statement" will be worked out.

        In order to control the conformity of the quantity and quality of discharged waters with

the conditions determined in the water-legal permission, monitoring of these waters will be

conducted. The scope and frequency of conducted are described in plan of monitoring.




                                                                                              5

DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS, DISMANTLING OF INSTALLATIONS,

DISASSEMBLING OF MACHINES AND EQUIPMENT

Demolition and dismantling operations will be carried out using heavy construction equipment

and partially manually on the area of Main Shafts and Shaft "Barbara".

Total cubature of buildings for demolition amounts to                             250,211 m3

Total surface of sites and stacking yards for liquidation amounts to               22,278 m2

Total length of railway subgrades for dismantling amounts to                       10,773 m

Total length of roads and sidewalks for liquidation amounts to                      2,361 m

Total length of pipelines for dismantling amounts to                                2,080 m

Total length of power and telephone cables for liquidation amounts to              19,570 m

It is estimated that during demolition and dismantling (liquidation) operations the following

        waste quantities will generate:

No.                              Name of waste                            Estimated quantity

  1    Wastes from demolition and liquidation such as brick rubble,           55,500 tons
       concrete rubble, ceramic wastes, elements of equipment,
       plastering

  2    Iron, steel, cast iron                                                 550,000 kg

  3    Cables without hazardous substances content                            500,000 kg

      and the following hazardous wastes

  4    Devices containing PCB                                                Total weight of
                                                                            devices 2,490 kg

  5    Chemical reagents                                                        267.5 kg

  6    Wastes containing asbestos                                              22,505 kg

  7    Hydraulic, motor, gear, and transformer oils without halogen-             60 tons
       organic compound content

  8    Lead-acid accumulators                                                     2 tons

  9    Nickel-cadmium accumulators                                                5 tons

 11    Respiratory protection means                                              16 tons


        With regard to the change of the quantity and quality of generated wastes connected

with liquidation operation conducting, the Mine carrying out these operations will be obliged to

prepare a new Waste Management Plan, which will constitute the basis for a new decision ­

permission for waste generation.

Demolition and dismantling operations will cause the following impact on the environment:


                                                                                            6

2.B. MONITORING PLAN OF MINE LIQUIDATION PROCESS

LIQUIDATION OF UNNECESSARY MINING WORKINGS

During liquidation of unnecessary mining workings substances to be used are wastes and

drainage water (wastewater)

       The scope of waste monitoring will include measurement of quantities by weighing

and counting of wastes to be used and determination of their quality. Quality of wastes for

each origin will be determined based upon updated physic-chemical analysis. The scope of

analysis includes chemical composition ­ basic components, contents of elements in trace

quantities and chemical composition of water extract.

       The results of analyses shall be compared with acceptable values determined in the

according to the Ordinance of the Minister of Environment dated 29 November 2002 on

conditions, which should be fulfilled when discharging wastewaters into water or ground and

on substances particularly harmful to the water environment (Dz.U. ­ Polish abbreviation of

Government Regulations and Laws Gazette ­ No.212, item 1799) and the standard PN-G-

11011 "Mining. Materials for consolidated stowing (filling) and sealing of goafs")

       Wastes complying with the a/m regulations will be accepted for use.

       With regard to the fact that the quality of wastes from the given source of origin can be

subject to changes, for control objectives monitoring of drained waters will be conducted. The

frequency and scope of conducted monitoring will be as follows:

-  once a month a short analysis comprising the following parameters: reaction, total

   suspensions, chemical oxygen demand, chlorides, sulfates, sodium, and potassium,

-  once a quarter: full physic-chemical analysis: reaction, total suspensions, chemical oxygen

   demand, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, chlorides, sulfates, sodium, potassium, total

   iron, arsenic, total chromium, cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, petroleum ether extractable

   substances.

       The results of drained waters monitoring will be compared analogically as the

monitoring results of water extracts from wastes.

During liquidation of "Stalmach" shaft the wastes to be used will be subject to monitoring.

       The scope of waste monitoring will include measurement of quantities by weighing

and counting of wastes to be used and determination of their quality. Quality of wastes for

each origin will be determined based upon updated physic-chemical analysis. The scope of



                                                                                             17

quantities and chemical composition of water extract.

        The results of analyses shall be compared with acceptable values determined in the

according to the Ordinance of the Minister of Environment dated 29 November 2002 on

conditions, which should be fulfilled when discharging wastewaters into water or ground and

on substances particularly harmful to the water environment (Dz.U. ­ Polish abbreviation of

Government Regulations and Laws Gazette ­ No.212, item 1799) and the standard PN-G-

11011 "Mining. Materials for consolidated stowing (filling) and sealing of goafs")

        Wastes complying with the a/m regulations will be accepted for use.


CONDUCTING OF MINE DRAINAGE

        The Mine "BYTOM II" has a water-legal permission to discharge underground waters

into the ditch "Orzel Bialy", a tributary of Brynica river of maximum quantity amounting to
11,230 m3/day. In order to control the conformity of the quantity and quality of discharged

waters with the conditions determined in the water-legal permission, monitoring of these waters

will be conducted.

This monitoring will comprise:

-  continuous monitoring of quantity and electrolytic specific conductance of waters by means

   of automatic apparatus installed on the outlet of underground waters to the ditch "Orzel

   Bialy",

-  periodic monitoring (twice a year) of qualitative parameters of waters from inflows to water

   reservoirs on the level 660 m: total suspensions, chlorides and sulfates,

-  periodic monitoring (once every two months) of qualitative parameters of waters discharged

   into surface waters, on the outlet of underground waters discharged into the ditch "Orzel

   Bialy": total suspensions, chlorides and sulfates.

The scope and frequency of conducted monitoring result from the water-legal permission.

    correction of acoustic screen positioning.

       Wastes - The scope of waste monitoring will include measurement of quantities by

weighing and counting of wastes to be used and determination of their quality. Quality of

wastes for each origin will be determined based upon updated physic-chemical analysis. The

scope of analysis includes chemical composition ­ basic components, contents of elements in

trace quantities and chemical composition of water extract.

       The results of analyses shall be compared with acceptable values determined in the

2.E. INSTITUTIONAL SETTLEMENTS


        For correct implementation of the liquidation process and monitoring of its impact on

the environment is directly responsible the Mine Liquidator, who executes his duties through

subordinated to him organizational units: Construction Supervision Service, Energy-

Mechanical Department and Environmental Protection Department.

        According to the presented monitoring activities, the Liquidator's employees will

execute dustiness measurements, however, noise measurements and water and waste

monitoring will be performed by laboratories possessing the implemented quality control

system, independently of the Liquidator. Monitoring results will be conveyed to the

Liquidator in the form of reports of carried out tests within periods resulting from the

monitoring plan.

        The monitoring results will be recorded in the electronic Environmental DataBase in

the Department of Environmental Protection. This Department will be responsible for data

collecting, their segregation and preparation of specifications and analyses for the

Liquidator's needs. On the basis of obtained information, the Liquidator, in order to eliminate

observed arduousnesses, takes himself or at the instance of the Environmental Protection

Inspector appropriate decisions concerning the correction of individual tasks or change of

operation technologies.

        Once (1) a year the Liquidator will submit a report about the quantity of generated

wastes and manner of waste management to the Marshal of the Province (Voivodeship) of

Silesia.

        In quarterly periods the Liquidator will submit to the Marshal of the Province

(Viovodeship) of Silesia a report concerning the quantity and quality of waters discharged

into the environment.

        Control functions regarding environmental management within the liquidation process

fulfil:

-   Local authority organs ­ the president of the City of Bytom,

-   Regional Mining Authority in Gliwice,

-   Provincial Environment Protection Inspector in Katowice.




                                                                                            33

2.F. CONSULTATIONS WITH LOCAL NON-GOVERNMENT
        ORGANIZATIONS AND GROUPS AFFECTED BY PROJECT
        REALIZATION


       The Mine "Bytom II" informed the public about putting the mine under liquidation

proceedings, and about the realization of the "Environmental Protection Plan in the process of

liquidation of Mine Bytom II". This information was published in the national newspaper ­

Gazeta Wyborcza on 4 March 2004 and in a regional one ­ ycie Bytomskie on 8 March

2004. In the announcement the scope of planned works and assumed counteractions towards

arduousness that can occur in the mine liquidation process were given. All persons interested

in environmental protection in the mine liquidation process have been invited to take part

in consultation meetings. The consultations took place from 8 to 12 March 2004 from 9.00 ­

14.00 on the mine "Bytom II" area in the building "C" room 12.

       Social consultations will be conducted during the entire mine liquidation process.

       According to the adopted procedure, the "Plan of environmental management in the

closing process of Mine Bytom II" will be put on to the Kompania Wglowa S.A. website and

also to the World Bank website, what was announced in the press notice. The plan will be

freely available for inspection through the whole period of the liquidation process and the

society will have the possibility to submit remarks relating to this plan. The employees of the

Department of Environmental Protection will analyze all submitted remarks, and the resulting

from them suggestions will be conveyed to the Liquidator. In justified cases the Liquidator

will be entitled to take decisions that can lead to Plan updating.

       The adopted tasks for realization, which are subject to the procedure of assessment of

the environmental impact, according to the Polish law (Act of 20 June 2001 ­ Environmental

protection Law, Dz.U. No.62, item 627 with subsequent amendments) is also subject to the

procedure of consultations with the public. In these consultations can participate both local

non-government organizations and private persons. The organ that takes decisions relating to

the realization of individual scope of operations performs such consultations.




                                                                                            34

2.G. CONCLUSIONS FROM CONSULTATIONS PERFORMED


       In spite of the fact that the information about planned mine closing was published in

the national newspaper and in the regional one, up to present the local society has not shown

any interest in the consultations concerning environmental aspects. Only one person came to

the consultations but he did not have any remarks or conclusions to EMP. Local inhabitants in

the form of a letter or a petition submitted no other remarks related to the problem. It is

supposed that such attitude of the local society to the consultations of environmental aspects

results from low level of society's ecological education. The local society is emotionally

associated with the closing mine, but it has social background. It concerns the fear of losing

jobs.

At present there are no possibilities to obtain measurable effects of social consultations for

EMP.
