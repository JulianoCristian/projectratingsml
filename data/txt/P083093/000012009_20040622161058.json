It is required to ensure participation of\n            the society in the process regarding environmental impacts\n            leading to the environmental assessment, and, to disseminate\n            information on mines closures to local communities and\n            nongovernmental organizations. To this end, the environment\n            management framework (v. 1) stipulates the following\n            mitigation measures. A waste management plan shall be in\n            place for appropriate disposal of wastes generated by the\n            debris from building structures, machine, and equipment.\n            Particular attention will be given to the final waste\n            disposal of dangerous materials, i.e., asbestos, oils and\n            lubricants, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), to comply\n            with international standard regulation. Contractors will be\n            responsible of waste collection, transportation, and\n            disposal, through a binding precautionary clause contained\n            in the bid documents, in strict compliance with\n            environmental regulations. In addition, contractors will\n            also be responsible for the use of new technologies that\n            ensure minimum noise and dust emissions, as well as\n            appropriate casings or protective barriers, and spraying\n            surfaces regularly. Strict compliance requirements will be\n            applied to contractors responsible for structures\n            demolition, particularly if containing asbestos. However,\n            the mine company itself shall undertake periodical\n            maintenance and reviews of de-watering equipment, performed\n            under strict supervision by its environmental protection\n            services. Additionally, chemical and laboratory tests of\n            underground water will be outsourced, focusing on the\n            contents of chlorides and sulphates in discharges waters,\n            including properties such as suspended matter, dissolved\n            substances, etc. Other volumes address specifically the\n            liquidation process of the Zaklad Gorniczy coal mine (V. 2)\n            and the Katowice Kleofas mine (V. 3) environmental\n            management plans."}, "docdt": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
