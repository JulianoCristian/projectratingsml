The most important lessons learnt from this\n            operation show that successful change does not come easily.\n            Clearly, progress with respect to privatization has moved\n            slower than what was originally envisaged. One of the\n            reasons given to the World Bank Coal Team is the general\n            negative opinion that the public has regarding privatization\n            of other industries: like steel and shipyards. There is\n            concern over potential job losses and the transfer of\n            profits outside of the country. It seems apparent to the\n            World Bank Coal Team that so far there has not been a fully\n            adequate explanation to the mining companies workers of the\n            potential benefits of privatization to them. Both Spolka\n            Restrukturyzacji Kopaln S.A. (Mine Restructuring Company)\n            (SRK) and Bytomska Spolka Restrukturyzacji Kopaln Sp. z o.o.\n            (BSRK) underlined that the beginning of the Projects\n            implementation has been a challenge for them since they were\n            not familiar with the World Banks procurement procedures,\n            however thanks to the regular trainings organized by the\n            Banks staff and frequent updates of the Operations Manual,\n            these procedures were eventually internalized. The\n            implication is that the use of Sector Wide Approach (SWAps)\n            may be most effective where differences in Banks procurement\n            and national procurement procedures are minimal, easily\n            resolved and conveyed to implementing agencies prior to\n            implementation, in cases where country systems are\n            undeveloped or inadequate and full harmonization of\n            procedures is not possible."}, "docdt": "2007-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
