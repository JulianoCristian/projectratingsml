          Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Poland, is to enhance private\n            sector-led growth, and employment creation through\n            enterprise restructuring, and, support for coal sector\n            reform was included as a priority within that pillar in the\n            CAS. The Hard Coal Mine Closure Project will directly\n            support the physical closure, and environmental reclamation\n            of excess coal mine capacity from CY 2004-2006. It envisages\n            main economic and social objectives, that improve\n            profitability, and the financial liquidity of the sector,\n            i.e., allows regular payments of its liabilities, including\n            payments of environmental fees, and, mitigates the social\n            consequences of the program's implementation. The\n            objectives are to be achieved through reform, in the areas\n            of industry structure, mine closure, employment and\n            financial restructuring, and, privatization. Through its\n            five components the project will, first, liquidate\n            underground workings and shafts, remove equipment, and\n            secure underground areas. This will entail closure of\n            underground roadways through dams, and if necessary,\n            dewatering should prevent water hazards to neighboring\n            operating mines, keeping the underground partly functional.\n            Following liquidation, demolition and clearing surface\n            structures will take place. Activities include shafts\n            liquidation, by isolating materials such as clay, closing\n            with a cement cap; demolition of existing buildings, or, if\n            possible, for sale option; dismantling of installations,\n            structures, and equipment; stabilization of waste dumps,\n            and, closure of tailings ponds. Preparation of a\n            comprehensive dewatering master plan, environmental\n            management plans, and mine closure plans, including\n            engineering design studies and supporting documentation will\n            be conducted. Land reclamation will be implemented in two\n            phases: a) preparation of land for industrial activity,\n            which will include clean up and ground leveling, and, b)\n            preparation of land for recreational purposes, to include\n            remediation actions, such as vegetation propagation.\n            Finally, following the mine closure, monitoring and\n            maintenance will take place, particularly emphasizing\n            dewatering activities, as needed."}, "docdt": "2004-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
