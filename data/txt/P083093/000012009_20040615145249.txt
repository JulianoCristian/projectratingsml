Country Assistance Strategy. The CAS for Poland (discussed by the Board on December 10, 2002
and covering FY03-05) identified a number of structural problems in the economy, including a
suboptimal tight monetary, loose fiscal policy mix, inefficient allocation o f public resources, and a
highfiscal deficit with unfavorable debt dynamics. The single lending scenario inthe CAS hinged
on one macroeconomic trigger, which was defined as follows: Publicfinances will remain on track
for an increase in central government savings of I percent of GDP over the period of the CAS,
starting from the estimated level of -4. I percent of GDPfor 2002. This would in addition entail
increases in central government savings each year of at least 0.25percent of GDP, and no evidence
of deterioration in recurrent balances of the rest of general government.

The general government deficit for 2003 i s estimated at 6.3 percent o f GDP compared to 6.4 percent
o f GDP in2002. The central government's saving balance improved from -4.1 percent of GDP to -
 3.4 percent of GDP, thus meeting part of the macroeconomic trigger for 2003.' However, there was
deterioration inthe recurrentbalances o f the rest of general government. (See Table 1.)

 The 2004 budget envisages further fiscal expansion largely linked to structural rigidities resulting
 from the delay inimplementingpublic finance reforms. The general government deficit for 2004 is
projected at around 8 percent of GDP, and the central government's savings-investmentbalance i s



      The main focus o f the trigger was on central government savings because the fiscal deterioration of 2001-02 took
place almost completely in the central government's recurrent balance. Based on currently available data, the central
 government exceeded the minimum annual improvement set by the CAS trigger o f 0.25 percent o f GDP, while
preliminary data indicates that the deterioration in the recurrent balances o f the rest o f the general government was
 small. A more definitive assessmentwill only be available inMay 2004 giventhe lags inavailability o f relevant data.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1

expected to deteriorate to -5.5 percent o f GDP. Based on this budget, the macroeconomic trigger
for 2004 will not be met.

In addition to somewhat weaker anticipated growth in 2004 than projected inthe CAS, the fiscal
deterioration implied by the 2004 budget reflects a fiscal stimulus o f around 1% percent o f GDP
arising from roughly equal shares o f higher outlays relating to EUaccession, reduced corporate tax
rates, and higher current expenditures. The budget needs to be restructured to make room for
significant co-payments to utilize the EU's structural funds for developmental purposes while
substituting some own-spending with EU grants. Moreover, in the absence o f policy initiatives,
public debt will exceed the limits posed by the Public Finance Act as early as this year. In
particular, debt i s likely to exceed the 55 percent GDP threshold in 2004 (reflecting in part the
weakening o f the zloty), which--unless countered by significant additional adjustment or non-debt
financing--would trigger mandatory fiscal adjustment inthe context ofthe 2006 budget.

As public debt approaches legal thresholds, a sense o f urgency has risen among policymakers. In
January 2004, the Government approved a plan o f administrative measures and social reforms
named after its author, Minister o f Economy Hausner (the "Hausner" plan). If fully implemented,
the plan would be a decisive first step in reforming government finances. Over the medium term,
the plan could bringpermanent improvements inthe budget equivalent to about 2 percent o f GDP
(including some additional planned revenue measures), thus contributing importantly to a gradual
reduction in the deficit from 2005 onwards and arresting the unsustainable debt dynamics. While
the CAS targets are unlikely to be met in2004 even with implementation o f the Hausner plan, they
could be met in 2005 if additional measures currently estimated at % to 1 percent o f GDP are
adopted.2

Proposed Support for Coal Sector. Notwithstanding, the status o f the CAS macroeconomic trigger,
it is considered especially important to proceed with the proposed Hard Coal Mine Closure
operation at this time. Substantial coal sector reforms were undertaken in 1998-2001, but progress
slowed in 2002 and 2003 when unemployment increased to about 18 percent in Silesia and
nationwide. Nevertheless, further reform i s essential, first, to comply with EUregulations regarding
state aide support and rules on competition and environment; and, second, to mitigate the risk that
remaining over employment and excess capacity could jeopardize the accomplishments so far and
create further renewed pressure from the coal sector on overall fiscal performance. Inthis situation,
notwithstanding the high level o f unemployment, the Government has now embarked on a new
round o f employment downsizing andmine closures starting inearly 2004. These reforms are being
supported by the Bank through the Hard Coal Social Mitigation Loan which was approved on
March 30, 2004 andthis companionHardCoal Mine Closure operation.

2. Sector Issues

While Poland has made extensive progress in reforming its economy over the past 10-15 years,
considerable structural rigidities remain, especially in the large capital intensive industries. These
industries with large employment and high losses are a drag on the economy that must be addressed
ifPolandistobecomeacompetitivememberoftheEuropeanUnion.Coalremainsthelargestof
these industries. Annual losses for the coal sector peaked at nearly US$1 billion in 1997. In 1998,


  The precise amount o f additional measures required will depend on the impact o f the Hausner Plan as eventually
passedby Parliament and could be either less or more than this current estimate.

                                                           2

the Government introduced a five-year (1998-2002) Hard Coal Sector Reform Program to address
the sector's problems. The Program was successful in reducing employment from 248,000 at the
beginningo f 1998 to about 140,000 at the end of 2002. (By comparison, the steel industry, which
suffers from similar problems, employs less than 40,000.) The industrymade a small profit on coal
operations in 2001, but losses returned in 2002, when the pace o f reform slowed, prices declined
andcosts increased.

The sector comprises three mining holding companies - Kompania Weglowa (KW) with about
83,000 employees and 23 mines producing about 51 million tpy coal; the Katowki Holding
Weglowy (KHW) with about 25,000 employees and 9 mines producing about 19 million tpy coal;
and the Jastrzebska Coking Coal Company (JSW) with about 20,000 employees and 5 mines
producing about 14 million tpy coal - plus three individual mines (Budryk, Bogdanka and
Jaworzno) with about 8,500 employees betweenthem producing about 11million tpy coal. There is
also a Mine Restructuring Company (SRK), which is responsible for mine closures andreclamation.
Further information on the structure o f the sector i s provided in Annex 1 Section (a) Better
performance of the sector i s constrained by a combination o f physical factors, namely excess
production capacity and surplus employment and financial factors, including working cash
shortages, poor cash flow and unmanageable debt overhang. The situation is most severe at KW,
which has most o f the excess production capacity and surplus employment, is loss making and i s
unable to meet a hard budget constraint (Le,, to pay all o f its obligations to Government and
environmental funds for current production). KHW andJSW are bothprofitable companies and able
to meet a hardbudget constraint.

Experience in other countries indicates that "no quick fix" is possible and the Government
recognizes that it will require a further multi-year effort to successfully complete the reforms. The
government has prepared and i s now implementing a new Program o f Restructuring o f the Hard
Coal MiningSector for 2003-2006 (2003-2006 Program). The Program i s a multi-faceted approach
- covering employment restructuring, capacity liquidation and financial restructuring, as well as
profound changes in the structure and management o f the industry. But implementation of the
Program will not be easy since unemployment i s now about 20 percent nationally (compared to
about 6 percent in 1998 when the first Program started). Important characteristics o f the 2003-2006
Program are that the workforce reduction is on a voluntary basis and is supported by specific job
creation incentives to help create new employment opportunities, especially for younger surface
workers leaving the coal industry. There i s also a companion "Program of Alleviating Hard Coal
Mining Employment Restructuring Effects in the Region of Silesia" (the Silesia Economic Program)
which is aimed at job creation and economic recovery initiatives for the whole o f the Silesia Region
(not just the coal industry). The final stage in the Program i s privatization o f the industry. This
should ensure sustainability of the reforms. KHW andJSW will be candidates for early privatization
once their balance sheets have been restructured, but substantial further downsizing will be needed
inorder for KWto become financially viable andready for privatization.

3. Rationale for Bank involvement

As Poland joined the EuropeanUnion on May 1, 2004, it is clear that the World Bank's role, both
interms oflending and advisory services, will haveto evolve to adapt to a new situation. The Bank
has previously provided two SECALs (Hard Coal SECALl for US$ 300 million in June 1999 and
Hard Coal SECAL2 for US$lOO million in August 2001) to support implementation o f the 1998-
2002 Hard Coal Reform Program. The Government has requested the Bank for further significant

financial support and technical advice to support the next phase o f sector restructuring, because coal
i s one o f the larger sectors in the economy and downsizing in the coal sector reaches into many
other sectors o f the economy impacting employment and income. The extent o f the impact o f coal
sector reform is illustrated by a decline from an estimated 4 percent o f GDP from the late 1980s to
about 2 percent o f GDP today. It is a sector that has great political as well as social sensitivity, and
i s seen by many in the country as one o f the key indicators o f the government's commitment to
implement the structural changes inthe economy.

World Bank support i s sought for its knowledge, expertise and experience inthe sector, in addition
to its financial support. More specifically, the Bank is expected to play a key role through this
project in providing support for the following areas: (i)  supporting design and implementation o f
capacity restructuring activities, including mine closure activities, environmental reclamation and
post closure monitoring and maintenance activities; (ii) ensuring that the mining companies address
the environmental problems related to mining operations;           (iii)ensuring that the subsidence
problems are addressed properly by the mining companies, S R K and BSRK; (iv) reviewing the
Year 2005 and Year 2006 operating plans and cash flow for KW, KHW and JSW to verify that
they are responding in a responsible and efficient manner and that they meet all their payment
obligations on current liabilities to Government and environmental funds; (v) ensuring that
appropriate implementation and monitoring arrangements are in place; and (vi) ensuring that there
is a public information campaign and that meetings are convened with local communities so that
they are informed about progress inimplementingthe Program.

4. Higher level objectives to which the Project contributes

A major pillar o f December 2002 CAS is enhancing private sector-led growth and employment
creation through enterprise restructuring. Support for coal sector reform was included as a priority
within that pillar inthe CAS which includes the following assessment (paragraph 68 ofthe CAS):

         The Bank will assist Poland's enterprise restructuring plans primarily through
         continuation of the assistanceto the coal reform program, which began in 1999.

 Specifically, the CAS identified a US$200 million adjustment operation for FY04. According to
the CAS (paragraph 76) the trigger for the proposed operation is:

         Adoption and initial implementation of a reform program whichfaces an ultimate
        privatization of the bulk of the sector and includes a time-bound plan for initial
         transactions, and which is consistent with EU requirements, and is accompanied by
         appropriate social support.

 The 2003-2006 Program i s considered to meet this trigger. The Government has subsequently
requested a series of three investment operations to support implementation o f the 2003-2006 Coal
Restructuring Program. The first i s the US$200 million equivalent, Hard Coal Social Mitigation
Loan that was approved on March 30, 2004. Second i s this operation, i.e. the US$lOO million
 approx. Hard Coal Mine Closure (HCMC) Loan that will directly support the physical closure and
 environmental reclamation o f excess coal mine capacity from C Y 2004-2006. Inaddition, a possible
US$200 million third investment loan has been requested which would support any hrther needed
 employment restructuring, social mitigation and privatization in 2005 and/or 2006.         Section B.6
 discusses the use of investment loans rather than adjustment lending. Total costs o f the 2003-2006

                                                   4

Coal Restructuring Program are estimated at PLN 6.2 billion (equivalent to US$ 1.55 billion at
present exchange rates). Ifthe three proposed Bank loans take place, Bank support would finance
about 31percent o f the 2003-2006 program (Annex 5).

5. Government Commitment to the Project

The CAS discussions have clearly demonstrated that this is one o f the highest priorities for
Government. The Government commitment to implementingthe program in 2004 is reflected first
by passage o f the new Coal Act o fNovember 2003 on Restructuring the HardCoal MiningSector
for 2003-2006; second, by the inclusion o f funding o f the program in the Government's          2004
budget; third, by the strong engagement with the trade unions to gamer their support for program
implementation; and fourth, by the request for the Hard Coal Social Mitigation loan and for this
HardCoalMineClosure loan.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The HCMC is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL), with Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) features,
whereby loan proceeds will be pooled with Government funds and used to directly support physical
mine closure and liquidation (including dewatering), and environmental reclamation o f closed mine
sites. The borrower has selected a Euro-denominated loan because Poland i s increasing the
European portion o f its foreign debt portfolio in light o f its membership o f the European Union
(EU) and strong economic relations with the other members states of the EU. Also, the Borrower
considers these terms would give a lower cost o f servicing the loan and debt repayment in the
future.

2.     Programobjective and phases

The 2003-2006 Hard Coal Restructuring Program envisages the following main economic and
social objectives:
0   the economic objective - to improve profitability and financial liquidity o f the sector so it is
    capable o fregular payments o f its liabilities including payments o f environmental fees; and
e   the social objective - to mitigate the social consequences o f program implementation and the
    proposednew sector restructuring.

The objectives are to be achieved by reform in the areas o f industry structure; mine closure and
liquidation; employment restructuring; financial restructuring; andprivatization.

The 2003 - 2006 Program i s the second phase o f the reform o f the coal sector. The Program, as
originally approved by the Council o f Ministers on November 21, 2002 called for 7 mine closures
andlayoffs o f 30,000 workers. But this was strongly opposed by the workers andtheir trade unions
because, unlike the 1998-2002 Program, it involved involuntary layoffs and had no special income
support measures for mining industry workers losing their jobs. This was at a time when
unemployment has risen to around 20% both in Silesia and nationally (from about 6 percent when
the reforms started in 1999). Inthe face o f strong protests, the Government made five substantial




                                                     5

adjustments to the 2003-2006 Program, which were adopted by the Council o f Ministers on January
28,2003:
   (i)     The layoff are now voluntary (instead o finvoluntary);
   (ii)    the number o fmine closures has been reduced to four (from seven);
   (iii)     the size o f the targeted labor force reduction was reduced (from 30,000 to 27,200);
   (iv)     income support measures were introduced for about 14,100 underground workers; and
   (v)     job creation incentives were introduced to create 8,600 jobs outside the coal industry for
            surface workers leaving the coal industry.

Further modifications to the Program were introduced by the Government in a revision to the
Program that was approved by the Council o f Ministers on April 27, 2004. These modifications
take into account an unexpected surge in coal export prices which have increased by 21 % for
coking coal and 5 % for thermal coal (see Annex 1pages 24 and 25). Inlight o f the much stronger
market situation, the April 2004 Revision to the Program provides for a Base Scenario (if prices
return to previous levels) with 25,500 net reduction inemployment and 14 million tons reduction in
capacity from 2004-2006 and an Alternative Scenario, based on prices being sustained at the new
higher levels, with 19,500 net reduction in employment and 7.8 million tons capacity reduction
from 2004-2006.

The capacity reduction will consist o f about 4.4 million tons whole mine closures to be undertaken
by SRK and 3.9 million tons closure o f parts o f mines to be undertaken by the miningcompanies.
Two whole mines have already been selected by the mining companies for closure and will be
transferred to SRK when production i s terminated, namely the Katowice Kleofas mine (where
production will terminate in September 2004) and the Bytom I1 mine (where production will
terminate in October 2004). Other mines will be selected by the mining companies depending on
how coal sales prices move.        The two main criteria used in selecting mines for closure are: (i)
exhaustion o f resources; and (ii)economics.              Other factors taken into account include
environmental and social impacts.

Most of the mines are subject to the threat o f flooding from underground water flows.
Consequently, dewatering activities are needed to ensure that water does not rise to a level where it
endangers the underground workings.           Such activities need to be carried out not only during
production but also during mine liquidation and often during the post liquidation stage in order to
protect adjacent operating mines from possible flooding threats from water in the closed mines.
Dewatering i s a major expense presently costing S R K and BSRK about 140 million PLNper year.
SRK has identified four options that could reduce the costs; (i)      replacing stationery pumps with
submersible pumps which would require some initial additional capital expenditures but have
lower operating costs; (ii)     shifting the pumping activity from SRK to the operating mine (which
would save money by reducing the need for two separate pumping operations; (iii)            introducing
heavy pressure underground dams to prevent the flow o f water between different sites; and (iv)
updating the assessment of the extent o f the underground water and actions which create the need
for pumping at closed mines to protect operating mines. As part o f the project MOEL will
undertake a study to prepare a least cost Dewatering Master Plan to identify the least cost options
and measures needed to implement themwhich may require regulatory and institutional changes

The Revised Program also provides for environmental improvements, sets a timetable for the
privatization o f KHW and JSW and commits the mining companies to maintain a hard budget
constraint and to provide improved public access to their financial results and audit reports. The

                                                      6

Revised Program will be implemented through the mining companies annual Technical and
Operating Plans and the miningcompanies' 2004-2006 Environmental ProtectionPrograms.

The main features o f the program and the timetable are shown in Annex I.Section (b) The
Government has prepared a Letter o f Sector Development Policy (LSDP) which addresses overall
energy sector policy; employment and capacity restructuring aspects in 2004, privatization;
environmental and implementation and monitoring aspects, including public information campaign,
attached as Annex I,    section (c).

The estimated costs o f the 2003-2006 Program are PLN 6.17 billion o f which: (i)     3.25 billion P L N
i s for carryover costs ("miners leave" redundancy payments) fi-om the 1998-2002 Program; (ii)     2.88
billion P L N is for the New 2003 - 2006 Program consisting o f PLN 1.73 billion for new social
mitigation expenditures and         PLN 1.15 billion for capacity restructuring and liquidation o f
subsidence and other miningdamages; and (iii)     PLN0.04 billion for other costs. Further details are
given inAnnex 5.

3. Project development objective and key indicators

The overall objective o f the Bank's assistance to the borrower for coal sector reform is for the hard
coal industry to become a profitable sector that contributes to economic growth andimproved living
standards in support of Poland's economic integration into the European Union. The specific
objective o f the Project i s to improve the efficiency o f the hard coal industry by supporting the
implementation o f capacity restructuring, environmental improvement and subsidence repair for the
calendar years 2004-2006 o f the 2003-2006 Hard Coal Sector Restructuring Program and on-going
commitments from the 1998-2002Hard Coal Sector ReformProgram. The project will also support
improved financial performance and sustainability o f the reforms.

Specifically, there are four "pillars" o f higher level objectives, namely (a) capacity restructuring,
(b) improving environmental performance at both closed mines (including mine reclamation and
subsidence repair) and operating mines; (c) improving efficiency and financial performance, and (d)
 sustaining the reform. Specific Project Development Objectives (PDOs) include (a) uneconomic
mines are closed in least cost and environmentally satisfactory manner so that environmental
liabilities o f participating mines are reduced and not longer a potential obstacle to privatization; (b)
mining companies operate in an environmental responsible manner so that subsidence and other
 environmental problems are no longer a threat to the community; (c) KW, KHW and JSW mining
 companies improving efficiency, adhering to a hard budget constraint and improving their balance
 sheets so that they meet their obligations to for payments to public authorities; and (d) KW taking
 steps towards privatization so that the reforms can be sustained. Further details are given in Table

4. Project components

The Project will support SRK's and BSRK's mine closure activities for the period 2004-2006. In
view o f the present high coal sales prices, the S R K and BSRK Programs for 2005 and 2006 are
presently based on the Alternative Scenario, so that a minimum closure o f about 4.4 million tons
closure o f whole mines is assured (i.e. Katowice Kloefas, Bytom I1and a third as yet unidentified
mine) all o f which will be closed by SRK. Closure could be higher if prices decline and the Base
Scenario takes effect.
        The mine closure activities consist o f the following five components.

        A.     Liquidation o funderground workings and shafts including removal o f equipment and
               securing underground areas.
        B.     Post liquidation, including demolishing and clearing surface structure, buildings,
               plant and equipment and, ifnecessary, stabilization o f any work dumps
        C.     Preparation of: (a) a Dewatering Master Plan 2005-2025; (b) Management Plans
               Environmental; and (c) Mine Closure Plans and Engineering Design Studies and
               Documentationneeded to obtain necessary approvals.
        D.     Reclamationo f land.
        E.     Post mine closure monitoring and maintenance, with particular regard for any post-
               closure de-watering requirements ifneeded.

Since, as noted in Section B.3, dewatering costs (which are necessary to protect adjacent mining
operations) have become a very significant cost item and will likely continue for as long as 20 - 30
years or more in the future in some cases, Component C will support preparation o f a Dewatering
Master Program.

All o f the works inComponent A, B, D and E would be undertaken according to the Engineering
Design studies and approvals in Component C and are subject to prevailing environmental and
safety requirements which are in line with EUrequirements and considered satisfactory. While the
main focus i s on the liquidation o f additional mines, the project will also support completing the
liquidation o f mines previously transferred to S R K and BSRK for which liquidation is already
nearlycomplete. Although the project has 5 components, disbursement will bemade under a single
category using Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) type features.

The total 2004-2006 estimated costs for SRK's and BSRK's capacity restructuring activities for the
Alternative Scenario are about 971 million PLN consisting o f about 839 million PLN for mine
closure and 132 million PLN for subsidence repair. The 839 million PLN for mine closure consists
of 597 million PLN costs (about 71%) for payments to contractors, service providers, utilities and
suppliers which are considered to be eligible for Bank financing under the H C M C operation and
about 242 million P L Npayments for (a) VAT; (b) employment relatedpayments to ex-mineworkers
and (c) administrative cost. which are not considered eligible for Bank financing.

The proposed loan o f USDlOO million equivalent (about 400 million PLN) consists o f USD84
million to hnd SRK and BSRK mine closure activities under the Alternative Scenario from 2004-
2006, as "Hard Coal Mine Closure Transfers", plus USD1million approx front end fee and USD15
million (i.e. 15%) unallocated contingency which would help ensure that hnds are available to
assist with additional mine closures above the Alternative Scenario ifcoal prices decline. The USD
84 million (about 336 million PLN) would provide funding for about 40% o f the SRK and BSRK
839 million PLN overall mine closure activities and about 56% of the estimated eligible
expenditures o f 597 million PLN from 2004-2006.         (This excludes the unallocated which is
available for additional closures above the Alternative Case and would likely be used inFY 07 and
FY 08). The balance of 439 million PLN needed for SRK and BSRK 2004-2006 mine closure
activities would be funded from general budgetary resources. In addition, S R K and BSRK would
receive about 132 million PLN from the budget in 2004-2006 to repair mining damages caused by
subsidence from the underground workings at the mines which they are liquidating. Further details
are given inAnnex 5.

 The Project Completion date is September 30, 2007 and Project Closing date is March31, 2008.

5. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

The project design includes the following features reflecting previous operations and good
practices:
    0   builds on the lessons learned from SECAL 2 in that it: (a) directly supports further
        restructuring of the industry, including capacity restructuring measures; and (b) supports
        implementation o f a comprehensive reformprogram that will lead to privatization.
    0   reflects the outcome o f a consultation with mining community representatives, workers,
        companies and Government officials which was held in Katowice in June 2003 and M a y
        2004 where capacity andemployment restructuring were raised as a dominant issues.
    0   reflects the experience with coal reform in the ECA Region (the Russia, Ukraine and
        Romania operations) that implementing coal sector reform is highly dependent on overall
        macroeconomic conditions and that a highlevel o f commitment is required over a decade or
        more to achieve sustained change inan industry such as coal.

Further valuable lessons for actionable programs, and notably the importance o f fast acting and
targeted support have been derived from other mine closure operations in the E C A Region. These
operations show that the selection of capable implementing agencies is crucial.         This has been
achieved in the project design through close cooperation in implementing the 1998-2002 Program
between the mining companies, S R K and BSRK, the MoEL and the ARP local office o f the
Katowice Region. Further details are provided inAnnex 2.

6. Alternativesconsideredandreasons for rejection

The Government has encountered extensive opposition from the workers and trade unions to the
design and implementation o f its 2003-2006 Program. Instead o f continuing support for the
Program with a broad-based adjustment operation as was proposed in the CAS that would provide
financial support to the budget, the Government have requested that the Bank continues its support
for coal sector reform with investment loans so that, as inthe case o f the HCSM loan, there will be
direct Bank support for selected aspects o fprogram implementation.

There were two main alternatives considered for Bank Lending. The first alternative was one or
more further SECAL's. The main disadvantage was that it would be very difficult to set the tranche
release conditionality for the latter stages o f the program, especially since further as yet undefined
employment and capacity restructuring may be needed. The MoF was also concerned that (a) there
would be a potentially large front-end fee and (b) it would be difficult to synchronize the release o f
funds (which are largely needed at the front-end because of the timing o f the mine closure and
redundancies, as well as the time profile o f the carryover costs) with the completion o f key actions
taking place towards the end o f the program. The second alternative was to undertake programmatic
lending approach which could have been well suited to address this type o f situation through the
identification o f an overall up-front policy framework for all o f the operations plus specific triggers
for later operations.    However, strong opposition o f the trade unions to further employment
reductions and mine closures meant that it would be difficult to define triggers on a comprehensive
basis. Instead the preferred approach is for a narrow focus and an investment operation that
provides direct linkage o f Bank financing to the closure expenditures, which i s the foremost issue at
present.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements
There is no direct financing o f the project by other agencies

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

        (a) InstitutionalArrangements

The Ministry of Economy and Labor (MoEL) has overall responsibility for program
implementation. M o E L and Ministry o f Finance (MoF) will work closely together to ensure that
the Program is adequately funded throughout its life with transparency and clear accountability and
that the necessary arrangements are put in place to ensure satisfactory                   coordination,
implementation, monitoring and auditing for a Program o f this complexity and challenge. The
Ministry of State Treasury (MOST) i s responsible for implementation o f privatization activities


                                                     11

under the Program.        The Ministry of Environment (MoEN) i s responsible for overseeing
environmental aspects o f the program.

SRK and BSRK As with the 1998-2002 Reform Program, the implementation o f complete mine
closures will be the responsibility o f the Mine Restructuring Company (SRK) and Bytom Mine
Restructuring Company (BSRK).Inaddition, partial mine closures will be the responsibility o f the
mining companies. SRK is ajoint stock company created in2000. Creation o f SRK was included
in the Government Hard Coal Mining Restructuring Program 1998-2002. BSRK is a limited
liability company created in 2001. The business activities o f SRK and BSRK include:
implementation o f the coal mine liquidation process, management o f the real estates and other fixed
assets o f liquidated mines, and job creation in particular for liquidated mines' employees. Both
companies operate on the basis o f legal acts including inter alia the Commercial Code, the
Geological and MiningAct, and the Hard Coal MiningRestructuring 2003-2006 Act. On the basis
o f the M o E L Decree dated January 28, 2004 on Subsidies for Financing o f Mines Liquidation SRK
and BSRK receive subsidies for the tasks included in the Decree and approved by Minister o f
Economy inannual liquidation plans.

The Agency for Industrial Restructuring (ARP) i s the monitoring agency for the project. On the
basis o f the law and agreement with MoEL, ARP acts as monitoring body o f the coal sector. ARP
is responsible for processing and initial verifications SRK and BSRK applications for budget
support for payments of costs related to physical mines liquidation, post liquidation including
dewatering and subsidence removal. ARP will also undertake program audits for these subsidies.
ARP is also responsible for monitoring industry performanceunder the Program.

All of the activities under the HCMCL operation are a continuation o f activities that were
undertaken in a fully satisfactory manner under the 1998-2002 Program, which was supported by
SECALs 1 and 2. The satisfactory experience o f that first Program and the first two loans gives a
strong basis for expecting satisfactory implementation o f the 2003-2006 Program. The respective
implementing institutions are considered to have adequate capacity.          Further details o f the
institutional structure are given inAnnex 6

        (b) ImplementationArrangements

Flow of funds and Disbursement Arrangements. Funds will flow from the MoF, to the MoEL, to
the SRK and BSRK, to their respective branches (mines) and finally to contractors to cover the
eligible project costs, subject to financial agreements to be signed between (a) SRK and M o E L and
(b) BSRK and MoEL. The SRK and BSRK will record the funds received from government as
subsidy and certain benefit related payments to redundant miners and ex-miners as costs in their
accounts in line with accounting regulations. Loan funds would be disbursed quarterly from the
World Bank into the Special Account opened by M o F ,(or at such other intervals as the Bank and
the Borrower shall agree) based on satisfactory documentation, being the receipt o f Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) providing inter alia information on planned and forecast project
expenditures and actual transfers o f subsidies from M o E L to SRK and BSRK. ARP will receive
application for funds from SRK and BSRK on a monthly basis, and after verification procedures
will forward applications to MoEL for approval and transfer o f funds directly to SRK and BSRK.
MoEL will receive loan funds from the Special Account held by M o F through regular budgetary
channels. Procedures will be fully defined inthe Project Operational Manual. The first disbursement
will be based on actual transfers from MoEL to SRK and BSRK for eligible expenditures in the

                                                  12

period January 1, 2004 through to loan signing up to an aggregate amount o f  8.4 million. The
MOEL, through the ARP: (i)will prepare Financial Monitoring Reports and disbursement
applications; (ii)will monitor realization o fthe liquidationprocess andwill arrange regular program
audit visits to ensure that funds have been used for intended purposes; and (iii)          will initiate
corrective action whenever they uncover anomalies. The actual progress o f the project will be
monitored on the basis o f ARP monthly reports submitted to the World Bank. There will be an
annual audit o f CY2004 project financial statements, FMRs and the Special Account. Since the
operation is supporting the 2004-2006 program, disbursement o f the funds would also be
conditioned on satisfactory progress regarding adherence to a hard budget constraint by the
companies and implementation o fnext steps towards industry privatization.

Strengths and weaknesses. The strengths that provide a basis o f reliance on the project financial
management system include: (i)     the experience o f M o E L and the coal companies since 1998 in
implementing the Coal Reform Programs and o f ARP since 2003 inmonitoring government support
for hard coal sector; (ii)
                         overall strong organizational and financial capacity o f ARP as monitoring
and reporting entity, (iii)existing accounting and reporting systems in SRK and BSRK providing
detail and aggregate periodic reports on liquidation expenditures. The weakness o f the system i s in
the quality o f the SRK and BSRK external auditors. However, this will be mitigated for the project
by requiring the auditor o f the project to be acceptable to the World Bank. In addition, the Bank
will, upon the request o f the coal companies' Supervisory Boards, provide advice on best-practice
procedures to select appropriate independent auditors.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results
The Government closely monitored the use o f capacity closure funds and severance funds under the
1998-2002 Program. The flow o f funds for mine closure was audited and monitored by various
authorities including the SRK and BSFX's auditors, the Supreme Chamber o f Control (NIK)and
the Katowice Tax Office. These audits all confirmed that funds were properly used and similar
procedures are being continued for the 2003-2006 Program.            ARP has the responsibility for
compiling data regarding employment, production, capacity closure, mining damages and industry
financial performance.    ARP has demonstrated capability to do this and presently produces a
comprehensive set o f monthly monitoring reports for the sector. They use an excel based system to
monitor the government subsidies for coal mines liquidation and subsidence costs. The source data
comes from the records and financial accounts o f the mining companies, SRK and BSRK each o f
whom have a demonstrated capability to do this. Indicators will be used by the ARP to assess
progress in implementing the Project and the Program. They will also be provided on a monthly,
quarterly and semi-annual basis as appropriate to the Inter Ministerial Coal Monitoring Committee
(IMCMC) who will review them at meetings which will take place every two months or more
frequently to assess both the project andProgram effectiveness.

4. Sustainability
The are three important factors for sustainability o f the H C M C project. The first i s the support o f
the trade unions for coal sector downsizing at a time o f high unemployment. To this end, the
Government has engaged extensively in recent months with the trade unions, and this has resulted
inthe designofan attractivepackage ofseverance measures. The Government is also undertakinga
public information campaign to disseminate the information.                Second is the continued
implementation o f the Government's 2003-2006 coal sector restructuring program, moving from
employment downsizing to mine closure and then to privatization, to ensure that the coal sector will
not return to being a drain on public resources in the future. Over the longer term, privatization of

                                                    13

the industry is the key to sector sustainability since private owners will ensure that the industry
operates according to competitive market conditions, and any further adjustment would then be
undertakenby private sector owners, not government. The third most important factor for program
sustainability would be improvement in overall growth and job creation which would lead to a
lower unemployment rate and facilitate the absorption into other sectors o f workers leaving the
mining sector. While the industry returned to losses in 2002 this was largely due to the pace o f
reform slowing inthe face of rising unemployment. The further capacity restructuring supported by
the 2003-2006 Program, together with the employment restructuring under the Program (which i s
being supported by the Hard Coal Social Mitigation operation), should ensure that the industry
becomes profitable on a sustained basis and i s thenprivatized.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

This is the fourth ina series o f Bank loans since 1999 supporting coal sector reforms that started in
the 1998-2002 Program and are continuing inthe subsequent 2003-2006 Program interms of:


   0    Proven reduction o f production capacity from 143 million tons per year in 1998 to 100
        million tons per year today and target o f 86 - 92 million tpy by end 2006 depending on the
        scenario (PAD Annex 1).
    0   Proven reduction o f industry labor force from 248,000 in 1998 to 140,000 today and target
        of 113,000 - 119,000 by end 2006 depending on the scenario (PAD Annex 1).
    0   Increases inproductivity from 520 tons/coal per worker in 1998 to 735 tons/coal per worker
        today and an estimated 790 - 820 tons/coal per worker target in2006.

Since this i s a capacity closure and environmental improvement project there i s no calculation o f
financial or economic rates o f retum for the project. However, it i s expected that the project will
achieve the planned capacity closures and environmental improvements on a least cost basis (see
next section).

2. Technical
The main technical issues are to ensure that the capacity closures and environmental improvements
take place in line with good internationalpractice so that work i s done (a) on a least cost basis, and
(b) is technically sustainable. Competitive biddingprocess and time bound completion schedules
will help ensure that mines are closed in a least cost basis. Technical reviews o f SRK's activities,
which have taken place on a regular basis by the Bank since SRK was established, confirm that
S R K and BSRK operate according to good international practices.

3. Fiduciary
The institutional arrangements for implementing the project utilize M o E L financial management
system and reports with supporting systems and information beingmaintained and provided by the
ARP based on the data supplied by S R K and BSRK as implementing entities. A Bank assessment
o f the project's financial management arrangements confirmed that these arrangements are
acceptable to the Bank with the exception o f financial section o f Operational Manual which needs
to be ready inplace prior to Loan Effectiveness (Section C.6.3). The country financial management


                                                   17

issues identified in the Bank's Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) o f Poland o f
1999, particularly with respect to the need to modernize accounting and reporting functions have
been addressed through the use o f the program-specific financial management arrangements at the
ARP (Annex 7).

4. Procurement
SRK and BSRK should be responsible for conducting procurement both following the Polish Public
Procurement Law (PPL) and the Bank's Guidelines. The Polish Public Procurement Law (PPL) was
reviewed to determine its acceptability for use inthe Bank-financed procurement under the Project.
As a result the use o fthe National Competitive Bidding(NCB) inaccordance with the procurement
procedures allowing the open competition, specified in PPL, for works and goods up to the
thresholds, determined by the Bank, was discussed. However, with regard to procurement for
preparation o f technical design and studies, the Bank's procedures for Selection of Consultants will
need to be used.

Procurement capacity o f SRK and BSRKwas assessedand found it to be satisfactory with regard to
use of the Polish Public Procurement Law. However, with regard to selection o f consultants
following the Bank's Guidelines, SRK and BSRK procurement staff will need to be trained. The
detailed description and conclusions with regard to the procurement arrangements and the
procurement capacity assessment are included inAnnex 8.

5. Social
To the extent that there is a major risk, it relates to social issues. There is a significant change for
the new 2003-2006 Program (which this project supports) compared to the previous 1998-2002
program (which SECALs 1 and 2 supported) in that the additional proposed mine closures and
redundancies must take place at a time when the national and regional unemployment rates are now
about 20% compared with about 6% when the program started in 1998.

The socialrisks are well recognizedbyboththe Government inpreparingthe Program andthe Bank
team and i s being addressed under the companion HCSM loan. Approval o f the HCSM loan was a
precondition for the preparation o f the HCMC loan. Both the Program and the HCSM project each
place a very strong focus on designing and implementing social mitigation actions to support
workers who are being made redundant in the present difficult labor market situation. Inaddition,
structural reforms to help realize increased economic growth and higher employment are at the
heart o f the recommended economic measures and proposed Bank activities in the Country
Assistance Strategy.

Major stakeholders under both projects include national Government, mining companies, trade
unions, employees and their families, and local and regional Governments. Incase o f HCMC loan,
the potentially affected people are (i)mineworkers who will be made redundant and their families;
 and (ii)
        communities impactedby subsidence.

 Consultation with civil society and media reports indicate that the public perception is that
 something needs to be done to stem the losses o f the mining industry and reduce the discontent o f
the miners. The consultations indicate that the Government program achieves a reasonable balance
between special treatment to the miners and the needs o f the general unemployed since coal
industry downsizing is taking place at a time o fvery highunemployment but is essential inorder to


                                                   18

place the industry on a sound financial footing and prevent further losses which would need to be
coveredby the Government budget.

Social monitoring. The Government i s committed to a continuing program o f social monitoring to
track the social impact o f the coal restructuring program and MOEL will contract for similar
surveys to be undertaken as for the 1998-2002 Program using a similar but redesigned and simpler
questionnaire. The social monitoring process will include ongoing analysis of the labor market,
income levels and poverty measures; short-term projection of economic and labor market
conditions; highlights o f the implications o f the projected changes in economic and labor market
conditions for employment and unemployment; and tracer surveys to determine the specific impact
o f the redeployment schemes on affected employees. This information will be publicly available to
all o f the stakeholders. Social monitoring reports which cover the above issues and measure overall
compliance with the social impact indicators will also be submittedto the Bank and the I M C M C on
a semi-annual basis.

6. Environment
The 1998    - 2002 Hard Coal Reform Program, whose implementation was supported by SECALs 1
and 2, involved expenditures by the government and the mining companies for closing mines and
reducing production, mitigating past environmental impacts and improving present environmental
performance. A Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) was prepared under SECAL 1 which
included mine specific environmental action plans for each operating mine. The main
environmental impacts identified in the SEA were from: saline water discharge into the local river
system; surface disposal o f waste from the mines; coal washing plants; and ground subsidence in
certain areas from undergroundminingandmethane release from some mines.
The physical closure and reclamation work under the new project is a continuation o f the work
started under SECALs 1and 2. Main environmental issues associated with mine closures under this
project are (a) possible failure to decommission and rehabilitate mine sites properly; and (b)
possible failure to address subsidence issues in a satisfactory manner. The project's environmental
approach follows boththe World Bank and government EA policies andprocedures.(see Annex 10).
Mine closure implies physical closure activities and their consequent environmental impacts
associated with mine decommissioning and mine site reclamation. These activities include: sealing
underground mine workings, demolishing surface plants and removing reusable equipment;
rehabilitating mine sites and waste disposal areas, and ensuring that no hture subsidence will occur
and that any present subsidence had been properly mitigated. Because all mines are underground
mines, mine sites and ancillary facilities and infrastructure such as waste dumps are quite small and
impacts are localized.
Environmental issues at the mines or parts o f mines to be closed can be identified because under the
first two SECALs Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) have been prepared for each o f the mines to
be closed, as well as for the mines that remain inoperation. Mine closures were undertakenproperly
under SECALs 1 and 2 and there are no new issues or circumstances to be dealt with.
Implementation o f the environmental action plans started under SECALl and was continued under
SECAL2. The project will support continued implementation o f these Environmental Action Plans.

The project has no large scale, significant or irreversible major negative environmental impacts. To
the contrary, the project will support clean-up o f past environmental liabilities through the
environmentally responsible decommissioning and rehabilitation o f closed mine sites.     The project


                                                   19

i s envisaged to follow-up on the environmental improvements at operating mines. No lending i s
expected for this specific item, but implementation o f the Mining Company 2004-2006
Environmental ProtectionPrograms for 2003-2006 will berequired as a condition o fthe loan.

     What is the safeguard screening category of theproject? (SI, S2, S3, SF). S2
     What is the environmental screening category of theproject? (A, B, C,FI) B
      In concurrence with ECCSD Safeguards Unit, the project has been assigned environmental
      Category B (Partial Assessment). The basis for this rating i s that the main environmental issues
      associated with the project related to the physical closure o f the mines. They include: (i)
      possible failure to decommission the mines or parts o f mines in an environmentally acceptable
      manner; (ii) possible failure to deal with subsidence issues ina satisfactory and timely manner,
      and (iii) demolition and removal o f old structures and equipment. Impacts associated with
      these issues are modest, and of short duration. Mitigating measures to address these impacts are
      well known and routinely practiced inthe sector. Environmental Management Plans have been
      prepared for Katowice Kleofas and Bytom I1and are available to the public. An Environmental
      Framework has been prepared and i s available to the public. Additional mine closures, as well
       as completion of mines already being closed by SRK and BSRK will be governed by the
      Framework.

     Assessment
 (d) If applicable,  what are the main results of any safeguard policy related studies, and how have
     they been incorporated into the project?               The safeguard related studies are (a) the
     Environmental Management Plans for Katowice Kleofas and Bytom I1which will govern their
     closure; and (b) the EnvironmentalFramework which will govern other closure activities.
       What is the borrower j. capacity to implement the safeguard policies recommendations, and,              if
       the capacity is insuficient, how will this capacity be brought to the required level?
       Borrower capacity i s considered adequate. Closure of whole mines is expected to be carried out
       by SRK, which was responsible for mine closure under SECALl and SECAL2 and has a
       demonstrated, reliable capability inthis regard. Closure o fparts o f mines wouldbe undertaken

    by the mining companies who have also previously undertaken mine closure work in a
    satisfactory manner.



($ What type of consultations have been conducted related to safeguard issues? How did these
consultations influence project design?
       The project it i s rated S2 (limited impact) because, despite the social mitigation measures
    introduced by the Government (which are extensively described in the documentation o f the
    prior Hard Coal Social Mitigation Project), the implementation o f the program at a time o f
    high unemployment may result in trade union unrest which could delay program and project
    implementation. The risk i s mitigated by the consultation that has taken place not only between
    the mining companies and their workers but also between the Government, the Bank and the
    mining communities. The Bank has a long history o f working with the relevant stakeholders
    including a major stakeholder workshop inJune 2000 on completion o f SECALl. With regard
    to the present project, in early 2003 the Bank organized an initial consultative meeting with
    NGOs in Katowice and has held smaller follow up meetings since. The NGOs consulted
    include the Association o f Polish Women over 40, Polish Ecological Club, Silesia Forum o f
    Social Organizations, the Krakow Energy Agency, Polish Ecological Club, Silesian Forum o f
    Social Organizations, Association o f Silesian Women and their Families, and The Silesian
    Entrepreneurship Development Foundation. These groups had concems that related mostly to
    social impacts andpartly to environmental impacts.
        In June 2003, the Bank and the Government conducted a much larger joint public
    consultation process in Katowice (which is the largest urban center in Poland's coal mining
    region). Some o f the key issues raised with respect to the design o f the project included: the
    need for more active labor market interventions, inadequate funding for regional economic
    development activities, the need for better social monitoring to monitor the impact on reform o f
    local communities, concems over the planned mine closures and privatization (what type o f
    new owner would there be) and environmental concems particularly regarding site reclamation
    and subsidence repair.
        An effective Public Information Campaign (PIC) was subsequently developed by the MoEL
    communication unit to support program implementation, and in particular, to inform the
    workers and their families o f the need to reform the sector and the social mitigation measures
    and income support services available to workers leaving the industry.
        OnMay 7,2004, the Bank and the Voivodship conducted a consultation meeting to, mainly,
     prepare an innovative approach o f consultation related to "Women in Mining". Participants,
     (mostly women), o f the meeting were representatives o f (i)     mining companies (ii)   mining
     communities (iii) (iv) university (v) business and (vi) press. The conclusion o f the
                        NGOs
     meeting was that the region requires complex and well coordinated programs helping women
     working inthe mining sector and living inthe mining communities change their qualifications
     with regard to the market needs. Participants also emphasized the importance o f addressing
     youth issues from the mining communities and to strengthen regional NGOs, which would
     help buildcivil society inthe region. A follow-up full day Women inMiningConference will
     be heldJune 8,2004.

A      Sector Background

Industry Structure. Hard coal, which accounts for about 2 percent of Poland's GDP, represents
the backbone o f the Polish energy sector. Around 50 percent of electrical energy in Poland i s
generated using hard coal as fuel. In 2002, the sector consisted o f seven coal mining holding
companies (see Table A1.l), established as joint stock companies, a Mine Restructuring Company
(SRK) and three individual mines, Jaworzno (partly owned with a power company), Bogdanka and
Budryk.

Industry Consolidation. As part of the 2003-2006 Program in February 2003 the mines of five
weaker companies (Bytomska S.W. (BSW), Rudzka S.W. (RuSW), Gliwicka S.W. (GSW),
Nadwislanska S.W. (NSW), and Rybnicka S.W. (RySW)) were consolidated into one new coal
holding company - Kompania Weglowa (KW). Thus, the sector today comprises three mining
holding companies - Kompania Weglowa (KW) with about 83,000 employees and 23 mines
producing about 57 million tpy coal; the Katowicki Holding Weglowy (KHW) with about 26,000
employees and 9 mines producing about 19 milliontpy coal; and the Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa
(JSW) with about 20,000 employees and 5 mines producing about 14 million tpy coal, plus the
three individual mines with about 8,500 employees producing about 11 million tpy coal as shown
above. Table A1.2 provides details of sales, prices, costs, profit/loss and employment for the
industry on aggregate for 1998-2003.

Employment. Employment has been reduced from 244,000 year end 1997 to 136,500 year end
2003 (Table A1.3). The decline was very rapid in 1998 and 1999, but slowed sharply in 2001 and
2002, largely due to a deterioration in the Upper Silesian employment market (where
unemployment has increased from about 6 percent at the start of the program to 20 percent in


                                                23

2003). Nevertheless, labor productivity remains very low averaging about 0.7 tons per manshift,
compared with about 2 tons per manshift in underground coal mines in the UK and 4 tons per
manshift inhighlymechanizedmines inthe USA and Australia.

Mine Production Capacity. From year end 1997 to year end 2003 production was terminated and
liquidation started at 14 mines with just over 12 million tons o f annual capacity. In addition,
significant reduction ofproduction capacity was implementedthrough closure ofparts of mines. By
the end of 2003 production capacity was reduced by about 34,52 million tpy intotal due to closures
since the year end of 1997 (Table Al.4).

Demand and Sales. Total coal sales have declined from about 200 million tpy inthe early 1980sto
98,5 million tpy in 2003. Domestic demand has declined over the past decade due to ongoing
changes in energy efficiency and energy substitution (e.g. gas for coal), which reflects in part the
restructuring away from heavy industries to lighter industries and services. Exports have also
declined over the past decade reflecting a combination of a depressed global coal market, low prices

 and lack o f competitiveness. In2003, domestic sales and exports were 78,5 milliontons and 20
million tons, respectively. Domestic prices averaged 153 PLNper ton but export prices averaged
 only 106PLNper ton compared with average direct costs per ton sold o f 142 PLNper ton.
 Currently the situation on the steam and cocking coal market changed dramatically. InDecember
 2003 the coal spot market registered increasingdemand. Strengthening freight charges andhigher
 FOBprices generated reboundingo f coal prices inNorth-Westem Europeanports. This change was
 due to the following factors:
       ---- tensions on the supply side;
            sea freight charges reaching record levels and continuously growing;
            increasing electrical energyprices;
            highgas price levels.

            This market situation might be illustrated bythe fact that relative to export price quotations
            o f February 2003 the coal prices were higherby 83% i.e. 29.9 USD/&

 A situation on the coking coal market is even more favorable (Fig. A1.2) and was caused by rapid
 steel price increase. Some analysis claim that this situation mightbe sustained for the next couple of
 years.

Bearing in mind the favorable situation on the coal market, there are clear evidences that demand
for polish steam coal will be systematically decreasing (Table Al.5) which requires further capacity
liquidation..

 Coal Imports In order to support stability and predictability in the domestic market, which aids
 implementation of reforms, the Government has had to resolve a problem related to imports o f coal
 from Russia. Transported from Siberia on rail, Russian coal imports are reportedly sold to Poland at
 well below estimated economic costs. Based on the Law on Market Protection, the Government
 imposed import quotas on coal imports from Russia in 1998 for a period o f three years. The


                                                                                               27

Government has decided to continue the quotas to support implementation o f the 2003-2006
reforms and, based on a new Law on Foreign Trade, the Government set new quotas for year 2003
for imports o f coal from Russia (1.72 milliontons), from the Czech Republic (0.5 million tons) and
from Kazakhstan (0.1 milliontons). The corrected restructuringprogramthat defines the policy for
the years 2004-2006, and the sector strategy until 2010 guarantees that import policy will be in line
with the EUregulations which restrict administrative limitations on coalimport.

Poland Energy Market. There has been considerable reform and liberalization of the Polish
energy market including privatization of part of the power sector. In the 1990's Poland made
extensive investments to improve its state owned power generators and substantial gas import
contracts, especially from Russia. In general, Poland currently faces excess capacity not only in
coal but also inpower generation and natural gas imports. Despite recent reductions, contracted gas
imports are likely to exceed domestic demandby about 20 percent for the next 3-5 years.

Polish Energy Prices. Coal remains a low price fuel compared to altemative fuels (Table A1.5).
From January 1998 to end 2000, Polish coal prices for households increased by 12 percent
comparedto 27 percent and 64 percent for natural gas and fuel oil, respectively. Electricity prices
also increased by about 40 percent over the period, indicating that coal fired power plants have
been benefiting from much higher sales whereas the cost o f the feedstock (coal) has only slightly
increased.

Unit Cost Reduction. Facedby difficult coal sales and low prices, the coal companies have made
considerable progress inreducing both labor and non-labor costs. From 1998 to 2003, the industry
has reduced unit labor by about 4 percent (from 76 P L N per ton to 73 PLN per ton) in nominal
terms (equivalent to about 25 percent inreal terms). Non-labor unit costs increased from 68 PLN
per ton to 69 PLN per ton in nominal terms over the same period which is an equivalent to 16
percent cost reduction inreal terms. Overall, total unit production costs (including both labor and
non-labor costs) were reduced by 1,5 percent innominal terms (or 23 percent inreal terms) for the
period 1998-2003.

Profit/Loss. The companies have tumed an overall net loss (due to highfinancial costs, non-coal
operational charges and charges for certain severance costs and mine closure costs which are paid
from the companies own funds and not from budgetary funds) into a small profit. Aggregate net
losses o f the sector have improved from PLN 4.2 billion (equivalent to about US$1.2 billion) in
 1998 to a positive net income o f 0.5 billion PLN (about US$O.l billion) in 2002. While KHW and
JSW have been profitable in 2003, KW has experienced significant losses in 2003 o f around
US$lOO million .



                                                  28

Cash Shortages and Liabilities. Because o f the highlosses, the companies have faced severe cash
shortages. They have been able to stay current on wage payments, but in doing so have had
difficulty in meeting their current obligations to the Government (taxes, social security,
environmental fees and fines) in recent years. The payment of current tax and fees has improved
considerably inyear 2001, 2002 an 2003. The shortfall to social security (ZUS), value added taxes
(VAT), workers' personal income taxes (PIT), other taxes, environmental fees and fines for current
operations has been reduced from about P L N 145 million per month in 2000 to about P L N 40
million per month in2002. KHW and JSW were current on their payments to government in2002
but the other five holding companies (GSW, NSW, RuSW, RySW and BSW - the predecessors to
KW) were not able to meet all of the payments incurredbytheir current operations. In2003 current
payments of the miningsector were regulated inabout 90 percent .

Financial Restructuring. While the 1998-2002 plan specified that about PLN 13.4 billion in
liabilities would be eligible for restructuring or forgiveness, the companies have had difficulty in
meeting the provisions for financial restructuring due to poorer than expected financial
performance. As o f December 31,2002, reschedulingand forgiveness o f debt amounted to about 3
billion PLNand 2 billion PLN, respectively, representing about 38 percent of the expected amounts
As the part of Program of restructuring o f hard coal sector 2003-2006 on December 31, 2004 total
accumulated liabilities o f about 19 billion P L N were forgiven and 4 billion PLN were rescheduled
following passage o f the new Coal Act. The structure o f liabilities under restructuring i s illustrated
under the Fig. A1.4.

Social Assets. The industry has made substantial progress in divesting itself o f social assets: (a)
hospitals and clinics have been merged into the general health care system and, under the
Government's new national health care insurance system that was introduced on January 1, 1999,
workers are able to select the services they need from different health care providers; (b) schools
and kindergartens have been tumed over to local administrations (Gminas), schools have been
rationalized where there i s duplication, and a mix o f Gmina funding and user fees has been
developed for kindergartens; (c) sports and cultural facilities have been turned over to Gminas or
leased to clubs; and (d) there are multiple approaches being used to divest housing, including
transferring housing to tenant cooperatives. All companies have non-coal commercial subsidiaries
which typically are used as vehicles to provide alternative employment for miners upon mine
closure. The remainingnon-coal commercial subsidiaries are also being progressively divested.

Environment. Miningoperations inPoland have been a significant source o f water pollution, land
degradation, and to a lesser extent air pollution problems. From 1998-2002, the industry reduced
the two most critical discharges identified by a 2000 Sector Environmental Analysis (SEA): (a) salt
water discharges into surface waters were reduced by 25 percent , and (b) waste disposal from
mining operations and coal preparation plants was reduced by 30 percent . Poland has a well
articulated environmental regulatory and institutional framework in place to manage these issues
based on user fees for environmental discharges. As part o f the hardbudget constraint, the mining
companies will be required to stay current on all payments to environmental authorities for current
production..

Saline Water Discharges. Rather than investing public funds inlarge desalination plants, the SEA
identified less costly but effective options for addressing the problems o f saline water discharge.
Such options, which have been effectively applied at other mines, include selective mining
techniques, shifting production away from mines with the highest saline water discharges, sealing
closed workings to prevent flow o f salt water from the mines, and salt water treatment by re-
injection or re-direction o f water into underground sedimentation reservoirs for chemical
precipitation o f salt.

Coal Privatization. The Government has prepared two individual mines for privatization -
Bogdanka and Budryk. Thus far, attempts to sell Bogdanka have proven quite difficult, despite the
fact that it is one o f the youngest, best equipped, lowest cost mines with little inthe way o f historic
environmental and health liabilities and less over-employment than other mines. A privatization
advisor was appointed and the mine offered for privatization. The first offering resulted in a
preferred bidder being selected but the sale was not completed because the preferred bidder could
not complete the financing package. A second offering resulted inthree bids beingreceived in late
2002. The Ministryo f State Treasury (MOST) has decided to withdraw Bogdanka from possible sale
due to the lack o f suitable bids. A privatization advisor was also appointed for the Budryk mine,
but the mine has not yet been offered for sale due to difficulties inverifying legal title to much o f
the mine's asset base. A privatization advisor was appointed for the KHW, and the report on
readiness for privatization will bepreparedby end September 2004. A privatization advisor for JSW

 B 2004-2006 Hard CoalSector RestructuringProgram Update of the 2003-2006 Hard Coal
                                                               -
 Sector Restructuring:Program


    0   Original Program. The original 1998 -2002 Program was drafted and finalized with the
        participation of the Trade Unions who were willing to support the Program partly due to the
        relatively generous severance packages included inthe Program. Initially, the Trade Unions
        opposed further industry restructuring and rejected the Government's proposal to prepare a
        new 2003-2006 Program. The 2003-2006 Program, as originally approvedby the Councilof
        Ministers on November 21, 2002 called for 7 mine closures and layoffs o f 30,000 workers,
        But this was strongly opposed by the workers and their trade unions because, unlike the
        1998-2002 Program, it involved involuntary layoffs and had no special income support
        measures for mining industry workers losing their jobs. This was at a time when
        unemployment has risen to around or 18 percent both in Silesia and nationally (from about
        6 percent when the reforms started in 1999). Inthe face o f strong protests, the Government
        made five substantial adjustments to the 2003-2006 Program, which were adopted by the
        Council of Ministers on January 28, 2003): (i) layoff are now voluntary (instead of
                                                           The
        involuntary); (ii) number of mine closures has been reduced to four (from seven); (iii)
                           the
        the size of the targeted labor force reduction has been reduced(from 30,000 to 27,200); (iv)
        income support measures were introduced for about 14,100 underground workers and job
        creation incentives were introduced to create 8,600 jobs outside the coal industry for surface
        workers leaving the coal industry. Implementation of the 2003-2006 Program turned out to
        bemore difficult than originally expected dueto the following facts:
    0   Strong social unrest accompanying announcement of minesto be liquidated;
    0   Late passageof the Coal Act;
    0   Turbulences on the coal market.

 All mentionedfacts causedthe original program assumptions outdatedandledto the amendmentof
 the Program. The substantial adjustment to the 2003-2006 Program was an introduction of 2
 scenarios to the Program, which assumedfollowing changes of the hardcoal sector:

IItem                                IBaseline Scenario          I Alternative Scenario
 Capacity liquidation                I 14milliontpy              I 7,8 milliontpy
 Employment downsizing Total:          25,500                      19,500
 UnderMiner's leave                    12,000                      8,000
 UnderActivation instruments           7.500                       4.000
 Others leaves                         7,500                       9,500
 Newrecruits                           1,500                       2,000

 The amended Program assumes that the altemative scenariowill be implementedif:
     0  coalmarket price will remain at the high level;
     0  companies are operating inthe economically effective manner;
     0  company's meet their hardbudget constraints onthe current payments.
                        Managements o fmining enterprises will change from altemative, while
                        market i s improving, to target model incase the individualmining enterprises
                        or the sector as awhole fail to comply with at least one ofthe following
                        criteria:



                                                   31

       Generating net loss inthe period o f three consecutive months or during the period of six not
       consecutive months within a single accounting period;
       Change o f the coal market situation involving a decline in coal sales revenue during three
       consecutive months in the total amount of, at least, 10% relative to the same period o f the
       previous year;
       Delay in execution o f payments due to public creditors within the period o f three
       consecutive months or six non-consecutive months within one accounting year. Delay in
       payment is defined as failure by the mining enterprise to pay, partially or in fill, o f amounts
       due to public creditors by the end o fthe month inwhich such amounts are due andpayable.

Amended Program. The Program was amended accordingly and the Amended Program was
approved by the Council o f Ministers on April 27, 2004 - Restructuring of the hard coal mining
sector 2004-2006 and Strategyfor the period 2007-2010. The Program envisages the following
main economic and social objectives:

          Maintenance of the energy security o f the country and co-operation in improving the
          standard of energy security o f the EuropeanUnion;

          Maintenance by mining enterprises o f sustainable profitability, economic effectiveness
          and competitive advantage on the uniformmarket of the EU;

           Securing satisfactory level o f financial liquidity and creditworthiness in order to ensure
           sustained operation and development o fmining enterprises;

          Balancing o f funds so as to enable current payment o f liabilities, inparticular those due
          to public sector creditors;

          Adjustment of production capacity to the local market demand and economically viable
          exports to the uniform EUmarket and elsewhere;

          Adjustment o f employment to the actual production needs, along with ensuring a greater
          productivity and efficiency;

          Actions towards a rational cost structure; and

          Privatization o fminingenterprises.

These objectives will be achieved through delivery o f the following tasks:

       0       Cost reduction inall business segments;

       0      Marketing policy that enables reduction o f sale costs, direct customer contacts, an
           effective competition with imported coal, along with blocking settlements by netting, or
           other barter practices, which reduce revenues and causepathology and irregularities;

       0      Reduction o f production capacity to approximately 88 million tones in2006, should
           the favorable market conditions deteriorate or in the event the mining enterprises are
           unable to becomeprofitable (target model);

       0      Reduction of production capacity o f miningenterprises as assumed inthe altemative,
          provided the bullishmarket continues, to the maximum o f 95.0 tones bythe end o f 2006;




                                                  32

       0        Reduction o f employment using the protective and adaptation and activization
           measures referred to inthe Law on Hard Coal Mining Sector Restructuring, to the level
           matching the actual requirements, between2004 and 2006;

       0        Streamlining the organization structure o fmining;

       0        Introduction o f innovative management practices and optimization o f company
            organization structures, along with pursuing o f a rational employment policy; and

       0        Maintenance o f supplies to the uniform EU market at between 20 million and 22
            million tones, assuming break-even operation o f the given production unit or group o f
            productionunits.
Government Support for the Program. To achieve these objectives, the Government is
committed to fund the Program, to provide strong support for affected workers and communities,
andto maintain effective monitoring and auditing arrangements. It is also committed to maintain a
hard budget constraint on the industry whereby there will be no non-Program subsidies or
guarantees andor repayments by Government o f commercial debts o fminingcompanies.

Employment Restructuringand Social Mitigation Program. The Government objective is to
reduce employment by 19,500 to 25,500 workers over the period 2004-2006, in a socially
responsible manner. The Program envisages that 12,000 to 19,500 workers will be severance
benefits to leave the sector and that another 7,500 to 9,500 workers will leave the sector through
natural attrition from 2004-2006.

Benefits and Assistance for Redundant Workers. Workers affected by the restructuring will be
offered a cash severance pay and unemployment benefit or pre-retirement allowance as per general
Polish labor law. Inaddition, a scholarship for retraining will be provided; and also a reemployment
incentive payments were established to encourage employment o f surface miners. Workers will
receivejob counseling services; training needs assessment and organization o f appropriate training;
small business support through business incubators and loans for self employment activities.
Regional development will be assisted under the,,The Programme o f Mitigation o f Effects o f
Employment Restructuring in the Hard Coal Mining sector in Silesia" through enterprise
development, infrastructure development, environmental improvement and redevelopment o f post-
industrial areas and tourism. The "Program of Alleviating Hard Coal Mining Employment
Restructuring Effects in the Region of Silesia" will target support from institutions supporting Small
and MediumEnterprise (SME) development and structural EUfunds.

Capacity RestructuringCurrently there is highovercapacity inthe Polish hardcoal miningsector.
To balance the market there i s a strong need to reduce sector capacity o f 14 million tone. The
Programme o f Hard Coal Mining Sector Restructuring during the Period 2004 - 2006 assumes
reduction ofproduction capacity, due to complete andpartial liquidation o f mines, at the level o f 14
to 8 million tones. The effects o f capacity downsizing and closure o f inefficient mines should bring
the sector financial stability.

Financial Restructuring. The process o f financial restructuring under the 2003-2006 Program
took place on December 31,2003 under the Act o f November 28,2003 on restructuring o f hardcoal
sector for 2003-2006. Total accumulated liabilities of about 18 billion PLN were forgiven and 4
billion PLN were rescheduled. This helped partially rebuild the mining companies balance sheets
andwill prevent the bankruptcies based inthe negative equity o fthe companies.


                                                  33

EnvironmentalImprovements. The amended programnotes that environmental improvement is a
key objective for the program. As a consequence, the mining companies prepared Environmental
Protection Programs for 2003-2006, which were reviewed and approved by the Ministry o f
Environment. The mining companies Environmental Protection Programs for 2003-2006 look at
five aspects: (i)   water protection; (ii) management; (iii)gas emission; (iv) methane
                                           waste
management; and (v) mining area protection, including subsidence. Regarding subsidence,
measures were taken to minimize the effects (like changing the method o f exploitation or closing
mines and solving the problem during rehabilitation). An increase o f the expenditure for subsidence
(both removal andprotection) i s expected.

PrivatizationWhen the 1998-2002 Program was originally developed the Government had little
interest in privatization. Since that time, considerable work has been undertaken regarding the
benefits and feasibility o f privatization, such that Government is now firmly committed to
privatization as the outcome of the 2003-2006 Program. The 2004-2006 Program specifically states
that Program Implementation will include well-advanced privatization stage o f the whole sector by
2006. The program sets out the following objectives for privatization.

Consultation with Regional Authorities. The Government has addressed the social impacts o f
industrial restructuring and employment downsizing and the Program emphasizes the need for a
coordinated approach towards restructuring o f the hard coal sector in the context o f regional
development o f Upper Silesia. To ensure strong coordination with regional authorities,
representatives o f the Katowice Voivodship and the Malopolska Voivodship were members o f the
Committee that produced the "Program of Alleviating Hard Coal Mining Employment
Restructuring Effects in the Region of Silesia" which was accepted by the Council o f Ministers on
January28,2003.

LocalAuthorities. The Program also fosters cooperation between the mining companies and the
local administration (Gmina) in respect to dealing with past liabilities to the gmina as well as
opportunities arising from the closure o f mines and the reclamation o f abandoned mine sites. The
government has coordinated Program implementation with new powiats (county governments)
which were established effective January 1, 1999, as part o fthe regional administrative reform.

Dear Mr.Grawe,

In reference to the negotiations of the Hard Coal Mine Closure Loan, Iam pleased to send the
enclosed "Letter of Sector Development Policy", which i s applicable to both the Hard Coal Social
Mitigation Loan as well as the Hard Coal Mine Closure Loan. The assumptions included in the
LSDP are concurrent with the government program accepted on 27 April 2004 by the Council of
Ministers of Poland under the title "Restructuring of Hard Coal Mining in the Years 2004 - 2006
and Strategy for the Years 2007 - 2010." The document is an updated version of the document
accepted by the Council of Ministers of Poland on 28 January 2003: "Program for Restructuring
Hard Coal Mining inPoland inthe Years 2003 -2006 with the Application o fAnti-Crisis Laws and
Initiation o f Privatization of Certain Mines (with adjustments resulting from the Agreement o f the
government party with the trade union party of 11December 2002 and adjustments resulting from
the legal status of the sector as at 10 January 2003)." The hitherto existing program was
supplementedto include the strategy of operation of the sector in the years 2007-2010. The main
restructuring intentions (lowering production capacity and the employment level) included in the
new document are concurrent with the intentions expressed in the hitherto existing program for
restructuring. Inaddition, the document presents a variant of lower reduction ofproduction capacity
of the sector in the event o f a positive trend in the development of the hard coal market, on the
condition of attaining and sustainingprofitability bythe individualmining enterprises.


At the same time, Iwould like to reaffirmthat the proceeds from the HardCoal MineClosure Loan
(HCMCL), as well as the proceeds from the Hard Coal Social Mitigation Loan (HCSML) will be
used for the implementation of the government program for restructuring the hard coal mining
sector.


Sincerely yours,

    I.       INTRODUCTION

    The Government of the Republicof Poland has been continuing reforms of the hard coal
mining sector commenced in the beginningof the nineties.
       Implementationof the Government ,,I   998-2002 Hard Coal Mining Reform Program" adopted
by the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland on 30 June, 1998, including corrections
thereto, as adopted by the Council of Ministers on 21 December, 1999 has been completed.
Following completion of implementation of the said Program, the new "Program of Restructuringof
the Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 using Provisions of the Anti-Crisis Laws and Initiating
Privatization of Certain Mines" was developed and its implementation was commenced, following
adoption by the Council of Ministers on 20 November, 2002 (including corrections incorporated
following the Agreement concluded by the Government with the Trade Unions of 11 December,
2002 and corrections resulting from the legal status of the sector, as on 10 January, 2003.) The
Correctionsto the Programwere adopted by the Council of Ministers on 28 January, 2003.

       The current activities under the Hard Coal Sector Restructuring Process are based upon, as
follows:
       -   the aforementioned Government Program, as adopted by the Council of Ministers on 28

       -   January, 2003.;
           information on the Program implementation including also methods and ways to
           overcome barriers to the restructuring process, as approved, directionally, by the Council
       -   of Ministerson 17June, 2003;
           operational programs provided by individual mining enterprises.

Implementationof the Restructuring Program is supported by provisions of the Act of 28
November, 2003 on Restructuring of the Hard Coal Mining Sectorfor 2003-2006.
     Primary restructuring objectives, as defined under the Program of January, 2003 remain
unchanged. However, under new circumstances including, in particular, enactment of the Act on
Restructuring of the Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 new elements are brought into the
restructuring activities. It is also extremely important to prepare documents important for the
European Commission includingthe plan of access to coal resourcesand the mine liquidation plan
determining the level and purpose of the public finance assistance designated for the coal mining
sector. It is, therefore, necessary for the mining enterprises to develop their own individual action
plans determining basic principles and rules of operations of such enterprises and their production
units as well as actions necessary to be undertaken in the nearest future. The above documents
will facilitate development of a comprehensive "Strategy of Development and Restructuring of the
Hard Coal Mining Sector in Poland until 2010",

      II. EFFECTS OF IMPLEMENTATIONOF 1998-2002 HARD COAL MINING REFORM
PROGRAM

    The miningsectorwas undergoingrestructuringat that time on the basisof the Government"1998-
2002 Hard Coal Mining Reform Program"as adopted by the Councilof Ministerson 30 June, 1998as
well as, since the year 2000 - "The Corrected Government 1998-2002 Hard Coal Mining Reform
Program",as adopted by the Councilof Ministerson 21 December,1999.
         The process of Reform implementationwas supported by the Act of 26 November, 1998on
Adjustment of the Hard Coal Mining Sector to Operation under Conditions of the Market Economy
and Specific Rights and Objectives of the Mining Gminas, which entered into force on 14 January,
1999.
     1, Reform obiectives.



                                                  37

   The general objectives of the hard coal mining Reform Program and the corrected hard coal
mining reform have been defined as follows:
              1) adjustmentof businessentitiesoperatinginthe hard coal miningsectorto operation
                  under conditionsof market economy and retainingthe competitiveadvantageof the
                  Polishcoal on domestic markets;
              2) meeting, until the year 2010, of the domestic coal demand and economically
                  justified exports in compliance with requirements of environment protection and
                  competitiveness under conditions determined by the European Union assuming
                  opening of the markets of all energy carriers while maintaining the principle of
                  bilateraladvantage.
       Deterioration of the hard coal position on the market during the period 1998 - 1999, as
expressed by exceeding, significantly, the levels of hard coal sales, as assumed under the Reform
Programand decline of the coal prices, created the need to develop corrections to the Government
Program,as adopted by the Council of Ministerson 21 December, 1999.
       The Corrected Government Reform Program assumed the following goals to be
implemented to ensure achievement of general objectives, as determined under the Program:
                  mining companieswill ceaseto generate losson coalsales not laterthan by2001,
                  in 2002 mining companieswill achieve a positive financial result (net);
                  the hard coal mining sector production capacity will be reduced by 2002 by ca.
                  36 million in terms of annual output;
                  during the period 2000 - 2002 the employment in the mining sector will be
                  reduced by ca. 48 thousand persons Le. to reach the level of ca. 128thousand;
                  the impact of mining upon the natural environment will be reduced as well as the
                  level of damages to the environment thereby ensuring, by 2005, compliance with
                  the environmental requirements by the entire mining sector.
                  The corrected Reform Program provides for the following activities assisting the
                  mining sector to achieve profitabilityas of the beginning of 2001:
                  additional employment reductionin mines by ca. 10thousand;
                  accelerating termination of production in mines designated for liquidation in
                  order to complete their liquidationone year earlier than originally planned;
                  shortening of the mine liquidation periods - by 3 months on the average;
                  additional surplus capacity reduction by liquidation of ineffective and surplus -
                  given decline in output -fields, areas and productionlevels;
                   introductionof changes to the assumptions of the Miners' Social Package (MSP)
                  to reduce employment restructuring costs and increase attractiveness of social
                  allowances;
                  establishment of mine restructuring company-Spolka Restrukturyzacji Kopaln
                   S.A. (SRK)- to ensure more effective mine liquidation process and more
                  effective managementand disposalof assets of liquidatedmines;
                   undertaking various other remedial actions to ensure further reduction of costs
                  of operations of business entities operating in the hard coal mining sector.
       As a consequenceof the changes introducedto the Program the Act of 26 November, 1998
on Adjustment of the Hard Coal Mining Sector to Operation under Conditions of the Market
Economy and Specific Rights and Objectives of the Mining Gminas was amended by the
Parliament. The amendments were adopted by way of the Act of 15 December, 2000 that came
intoforce on 8 February, 2001.

    2. CaDacitv liquidation

     During the period 1998 - 2002 overall production capacity was reduced by 34.52 million
tonedyeat-. Complete liquidation of mines reduced overall capacity by 13.9 million tonedyear,
while partial liquidation contributed further 7.6 million tonedyear. Liquidation of areas, fields and
levels and reduction of the length of operational long walls contributed to capacity reduction by
further 7.39 milliontones/year and 5.63 million tones/year respectively.

      During the years 1998 - 2002, production was terminated in 13 totally liquidated mines and,
due to liquidationof movements, in 10 partially liquidatedmines.

      3. EmDlovmentrestructuring

      During the period 1998-2002 the level of employment in the hard coal mining sector was
reducedfrom 243,304 employeesto 140,717i.e. the employmentwas reduced during the five year
period of Program implementationby 102,587persons Le. 42.2%.

      The Miners' Social Package (MSP) constituted the main instrument of the employment
restructuring process, conducted without any social unrest. During the period 1998 - 2002 the
MSP was used by the 67.0 thousand mine employees Le. by ca. I.4 thousand more than originally
assumed under the Government Program. From the entire list of MSP measures, miner leaves
were the most popular, used by 36.9 thousand employees. One-time unconditional severance
payments were used by 29.7 thousand employees. Contribution of social allowances to
employment restructuringwas marginal-taken by 419 personsonly.
      4. Financialrestructurinq

      As at the end of 1997the total liabilitiesof the hard coal mining sector amounted to PLN 13.3
billion. In the course of 1998 liabilities increased by further PLN 3.2 billion to reach the total of PLN
16.5 billionat the end of the year.

      The Government Program assumed, for the period 1998 - 2002, restructuring of liabilities
due to the State Treasury, the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS), the Labor Fund, The Fund for
Guaranteed Employee Benefits and the National Fund for Rehabilitation of the Disabled (PFRON),
as well as Voivodship Fundsfor EnvironmentProtectionand Water Managementand Gminas.
      However, the effects of the debt restructuring process conducted in 1999 - 2000 under
provisions of the Act of 26 November, 1998 on Adjustment of the Hard Coal Mining Sector to
Operation under Conditions of the Market Economy and Specific Rights and Objectives of the
Mining Gminas were not satisfactory. Difficulties experienced by mines and mining companies in
remaining current, as of 1 January, 1999, in execution of payments due to ZUS, the Labor Fund
and the Fund for Guaranteed Employee benefits constituted a major obstacle to increase the
number of debt restructuring agreements concluded. The need to remain current in payment of
current liabilities constituted one of the pre-conditions of implementation of debt restructuring
proceedings.
      Amendments to the said law, introduced by the Act of 15 December, 2000, provided an
opportunityto regulate payment of accounts payable due to ZUS, the Labor Fund and the Fundfor
 Guaranteed Employee benefits, as of 1 January, 1999, by provisions of agreements concluded by
and betweendebtors and ZUS. Furthermore,amended law provided the mining enterpriseswith an
opportunityto correctthe results of the debt restructuringprocess by extending, by 2 years i.e. until
the end of 2002, the period during which the debt restructuringcould be conducted. In addition, the
deadline for deferral of payment of liabilities was also extended by 2 years i.e. until the end of
2002. Debt restructuring application could be submitted also by mining enterprises established


                                                    39

after 30 June, 1999 i.e. after the deadline for application submission provided for in the Act of 26
November, 1998 on Adjustment of the Hard Coal Mining Sector to Operation under Conditions of
the Market Economy and Specific Rights and Objectives of the Mining Gminas. The opportunity
was used by Spolka Restrukturyzacji Kopaln S.A. (SRK), Bytomska Spolka Restrukturyzacji
Kopaln Sp. z 0.0. (BSRK /limited liability company/) and four mining plants - subsidiaries of the
Bytomska SpolkaWeglowa SA. (BSW)
      Besides the solutions described above, the amendedAct provided also for debt forgiveness
relativeto liabilitiesof totally liquidated mines, upon transfer of such mines to a mine restructuring
company. Debtforgiven could include liabilities due to ZUS, the Labor fund and the Fundfor
Guaranteed Employee Benefits incurred prior to 1January, 1999 and liabilitiesdue to other
creditors incurred by the end of 1999.
      In effect of the financial restructuringprocess conducted during the period 1999- 2002 under
the Act of 26 November, 1998 the debt forgiveness covered the total of PLN 2.6 million of debt of
completely liquidated mines transferred to mine restructuring companies. In addition, liabilities in
the amount of PLN 442.0 million remained for restructuring, including PLN 385.3 to be repaid in
installments, remained for restructuring after 2002.
    The Act of 26 November, 1998 on adjustment has failed to achieve effective debt restructuring
by the end of 2002, since only PLN 3.0 billion Le. 18.9% of debt was restructured by the end of
2002 out of the total amount of debt offeredfor restructuringof PLN 15.9billion.

      5. Environmentprotection

        Activities undertaken by mining companies regarding reduction of their negative
environmental impact in the course of five years of reform implementationgenerated the following
results:
                         reduction,relativeto the levelsof 1997, of dischargeof chloride and sulphate
                         loads, in unused undergroundwaters, to surfacewaters, by ca. 406,900
    -                    tonedyear (ca. 90% of the total effect assumed for the Program);
        reclamation and re-use of 976 ha of post-industrial land (exceeding the effects assumed
    -   under the Program by ca. 33%);
        underground utilization, in 2002 by mines, of coal wastes generated by these mines in the
        total volume of 1,948thousand tones.

significantly reduced- in 2002 relativeto 1997-the volume of mining wastes stored on the
    In the course of the Government Reform Program implementationthe hard coal mining sector

surface by ca. 88%. At the same time, during the period 1998- 2002 the share of commercial
surface utilization of mining waste relativeto the total mining waste generated increasedfrom ca.
52% in 1997to ca. 88% in 2002. These wastes were primarily utilized in civil engineering and
hydro-technicalworks (including:land leveling and reclamation, constructionof roads and railways,
construction of flood protectingwalls on rivers and water flows in areas of mining operation).

6. Changes in organizationalstructure

 Inthe beginningof 1998the structureof the hard coal mining sector includedseven miningcompanies
operatingthe total of 53 mines.There were also 8 independentmineswith the legalstatus of joint stock
companiesand two state ownedenterprises.Overall,the hardcoal miningsectorwas made up of 63
mines including57 producers.
        Following amendment of the Act of 26 November, 1998the following entitieswere
established: Bytomska Spolka RestrukturyzcjiKopaln Sp. z 0.0. (BSRK) and Spolka
 Restrukturyzacji Kopln S.A. (SRK) to group liquidatedmines. Thus, the mine liquidationprocess
was separated from remedial and turnaround processescovering the remaining mines.




                                                     40

        As on 31 December,2002the hardcoal miningsector included7 mining companies,3 independent
mines (twointhe formofjoint stock companyand one limited liability company)and 2 minerestructuring
companies. Therewere41 active producers inthe sector.
        Withinthe framework of actions designatedto streamline the organizational structure of the sector,
consolidationprojectswere developed in2002to establish 3 miningconglomerates, butdueto strong
resistanceonthe partof union stakeholdersthe projectswas not carriedout.


7. Privatization

Privatizationrelatedactivities included actions undertaken relative to two independent mines
owned by the State treasury: LubelskiWegiel "Bodganka" S.A. and KWK "Budryk S.A. However,
relevant authoritiesfailed to select a potential investorfor LW "Bodganka" S.A. by the end of 2002,
while privatizationrelated activities involving KWK "Budryk" S.A.were suspended untilthe mine
regulates the legal status of all its assets.
In the area of capital alliances betweenthe mining sector and the power sector Nadwislanska
Spolka Weglowa (NSW) S.A. acting together with the Power Plant JAWORZNO Ill set up a
commercialcode company Zaklad Gorniczo-Energetyczny"Sobieski-Jaworzno III"Sp. z 0.0.
(mining and power generatingplant SOBIESKI-JAWORZNOIll Itd.).
No privatizationrelated activities were conducted relativeto any other hard coal mining sector
entities.

        8. Programfinancing

      During the Program implementation period relevant State Budget expenses amounted to the
total of PLN 6.5 billion. The highest amounts of resourceswere spent during the first three years of
implementation; in 1998- 2000 budgetary support amountedto PLN 4.3 billion (including66.7% of
total resourcesgranted by the State Budget).

The greatest share of funds was allocatedto employment restructuringcomponent of the Program
-PLN4,312.8millionLe.66.0%ofthetotalbudgetfunds,withhighestexpendituresmadein1999.
During the same period,funds allocatedto finance mine liquidationaccounted to 21.8% of the total
i.e. PLN 1,422.6 million.
        9. Restructuringresults

      In the course of 1998 - 2002 the level of domestic market demand for coal gradually
declined. The decline was deeper than originally assumed under the Government Reform
Program. Lower level of domestic coal sales forced mining companies to increase export sales
over and above the levels assumed under the Program throughout the entire period of 1998 -
2002, excluding the year 2000. Thus the export sale reduction rate was slower in 1998- 2002 than
assumed under the Government Reform Program.

      Lower domestic sales relativeto the Programassumptionscombined with higher export sales
resulted in reduction of sales revenue in 1998 - 2002 thereby deteriorating an already very
precarious financial situation of individual companies and the entire hard coal mining sector.
      Reductionof coal demand resulted in a significant decrease of the average coal price in 1998
-1999.
      In 1998 the average coal price was 121.55 PLN/tone and was higher than in 1997 only by a
factor of 1.7%, assuming average annual inflation rate at 11.8%. In 1999 average coal price
declined to 117.80 PLN/tone i.e. below the 1997 level. The year 2000 brought about an increase in



                                                   41

coal prices to the level of 131.91 PLN/tone and subsequently in 2001 - to 144.16 PLN/tone. In
2002, again the price declinewas registered to the level of 142.55PLN/tone.
      Systematic reduction of unit sales costs from the level of 144.16 PLN/tone in 1998 to 129.54
PLN/tone in 2000 helped the hard coal mining sector to generate a positive unit result on coal
sales at 2.37 PLN/tone. Thus, the positive result was achieved one year earlier than originally
assumed under the Program.
      In spite of improvement in terms of financial results and commencement of the debt
restructuring and forgiveness procedures, the sector failed to achieve one of the Program
objectives i.e. achievement of the positive net financial result in 2002. The mining sector
registered, for the year 2002, a loss in the amount of PLN (-)608.7 million, against the profit, as
expected under the Program,of PLN 568.5 million.
      In general, it is clear that in spite of doubtless progress in restructuring process achieved in
certain areas, specifically in capacity and employment reduction - the overall objectives of the
Program have not been achieved. Partial objectives achieved failed to resolve major problems of
the hard coal mining sector including, in particular, the high level of outstanding debt and lack of
financial liquidity.

    II.     THE NEW PROGRAM OF RESTRUCTURING OF THE HARD COAL MINING
            SECTOR FOR 2003-2006.

            1. Enerw policy

        In keeping with provisions of the "Assumptions of the Poland's energy policy for the period
until the year 2020" hard coal is and will remain in the near future the primary energy carrier in
Poland.
During the coming more than ten years, there will be no significant changes in the structure of fuel
consumptionby the utility power sector; coal will remain its primaryfuel. Increase in consumption
of gas as a primaryfuel can be achieved only after the results of the analysis of multi-year liabilities
and the levelof evening up of the balance of payment are fully confirmed. Thus, the investment
efforts undertakenduring the recent years (and continued to be undertaken) to expand the existing
potential and environment protectioninstallationsin power plants and coal handling plants can be
properly discounted.
        Consideringthe importance of hard coal in the energy balance of Poland (ca. 50% of
electrical energy is generated using hard coal as fuel), it is necessary to continue the process of
hard coal mining reformto achieve full financial stability of the sector's operations by adjusting
productioncapacity to market needs.

            2. Program objectives

      On 28 January, 2003 the Council of Ministersadopted ,,Programof Restructuringof the Hard
Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 using Provisions of the Anti-Crisis Laws and Initiating
Privatization of Certain Mines (including corrections resulting from Agreement concluded with the
Trade Unions of 11 December, 2002 and corrections required by the legal status of the sector, as
on 10January, 2003)", with the following objectives:
      - economic-financial objective: achievement of profitability and systematic reduction of
          overdue liabilities of the entire sector and ensuring that the sector remains current in
          paymentof all accounts payable, includingenvironmental charges;
      -   social objectives: mitigation of effects of employment restructuring,carried out to-date and
          in future, by creationof newjobs implemented,inter alia, under regional programs,

The list of basictasks to be performed includes,as follows:


                                                    42

      --- implementationof organizationaland structuralchanges;
          carrying out financial restructuringand improvement of sector'sfinancial liquidity;
          adjustmentof productioncapacityto marketneedsand adjustmentof employmentto suchadjusted
          capacity.
      With respect to structural and organizational changes the following are considered the most
important: establishment, during the ISt  quarter of 2003, of KompaniaWeglowa S.A. (KW S.A.) by
way of contribution of 23 mines and 9 mining plants previously operating within structures of:
Gliwicka Spolka Weglowa, Nadwislanska Spolka Weglowa, Rudzka Spolka Weglowa, Rybnicka
Spolka Weglowa and 4 mining plants of the Bytomska Grupa Kapitalowa, as required to conduct
production operations.
      With respect to financial restructuringand improvementof financial liquidity,the generally
applicable laws and regulations are assumed to be applied including, in particular,as follows:
      - theActof30August,2002onrestructuringofcertainliabilitiesduetopublicentitiesfrom
          businesses;
      - theActof30October,2002onpublicassistanceto businessesof particularimportance
          for the labor market;
      - theActof28February,2003-the LawonBankruptcyandRemedialProcesses.
      The Program assumed re-capitalization of KW S.A. by injection of funds in the amount of
PLN 3,500 million to be used, inter alia, for repayment of liabilities of mining companies, including
debt not subject to restructuring under the law on restructuring of certain liabilities due to public
entitiesfrom businesses.
      In the area of adjustment of production capacity to market needs as well as adjustment of
employment level to such adjusted capacity,the following has been assumed:
      - reduction of production capacity by complete liquidation of mines during the period 2003 -
      -     2006 will amount to 12.7 milliontones;
          during the period 2003 - 2006 employment is estimated to be reduced by 27.2 thousand
          employees including reduction in KW S.A. by 18.8 thousand employees; the results
          should be achieved primarily though natural attrition and termination of employment for
          reasons on the part of the employee, assuming that all underground employees and
          employees of mechanical coal processingwill find jobs in active mines.

Overall progresstowards meetingthe targets will be reviewed in early 2005.

The sector restructuring process will be supported by companion "Program of Alleviating Hard

mobilize ca. PLN 700 million in investment outlays in Silesian region during the period 2004 -
Coal Mining Employment Restructuring Effects in the Region of Silesia" which expects to

2006.

            3. The Act on Restructurinqof Hard Coal Minim Sector

      On 28 November, 2003 the Parliament adopted the Act on Restructuring of Hard Coal Mining
Sectorfor 2003 - 2006. The Act entered intoforce on 29 December, 2003.
         The Act providesfor measures requiredto achieve the hard coal mining reform and
restructuringobjectives, including as follows:
      -   opportunity to achieve a comprehensive debt forgiveness and restructuring by offering
          repayment in installments (until 2010) of liabilities with respect to retirement premiums,
          social insurance premiums payable by the insured person and social insurance
      -   premiums;
          mitigation as well as activization and adaptation package for employees of mining
          enterprises;



                                                   43

      -   guaranteesof employmentof to undergroundand mechanical coal processing employees

      -   in active mines in case they decide not to take up the said package
          undertaking, by the State Budget, and continuous coverage, until expiry, of costs of
          previouslyintroduced MSP, borne to date by mining companies;
      -   financing, by the State Budget, of costs of capacity reduction and related costs (mining
          damages land reclamation,protecting against flooding etc.).
      The Law also provides for the KW S.A. to take up not forgiven debt of mining companies,
which contributed their mines and mining plants to KW S.A. Thus, KW S.A. will become a party to
further financial restructuring proceedings. Under the circumstances described above there is no
longer any justification for operation of these mining companies within the hard coal mining sector
structures.

            4. Capacity reduction
      At present, production capacity of the hard coal mining sector in Poland is estimated at the
total of 103 million tonedyeat-,including power coal at around 88 million tones and coking coal at
15 million tones/year, This breakdown based on current production plans is relatively artificial in
view of certain flexibility of the mines in selection of deposits developed and various ways the coal
type 34 (gas-coking coal) is used. Certain types of this coal may be used both as a fuel for power
sector and as coking coal.
      The hard coal mining sector capacity reductionis planned to match supply and demand.
      The Program of Restructuring of Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 assumes reduction
of productioncapacity,due to complete liquidation of mines, at the levelof 12.7million tones.
      In view of favorable trends on the hard coal marketand social situation in Silesia the capacity
reduction processwill be spread over the period of 2004 - 2006.
      The capacity reduction schedules are included in business plans developed by individual
mining companies with 4.3 million tpy of capacity closing in 2004.

            5. Employment restructuring

      At present, the hard coal mining sector employs 137.4 thousand persons, including 76.8%
employed undergroundand 23.2% of surface employees.
      In spite of a significant employment reduction achieved during the previous years there is a
need of further employment reduction in order to cut costs, improve productivity and, thereby,
ensure profitabilityof the sector's operations.
      The Program of Restructuring of Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 assumes
employment reductionin the hard coal mining sector by 27.2 thousand employees.
      The mitigation as well as activization and adaptation measures provided for in the Act on
Restructuringof Hard Coal Mining Sector well respond to the current social situation in Silesia. The
Government recognizes that further employment restructuring is taking place at a time of much
higher unemployment that at the start of the 1998-2002 Reform Program. Accordingly and
following discussions with social partners, the Act provides for voluntary take up of these
measures. Variety of measures and relevant provision levels should ensure achievement of the
Program'sobjectives in the area of employment restructuring.
      Effectiveness of individual mitigation and activization measures will be subject to ongoing
monitoringefforts and relevant conclusions regarding effectivenesswill be developed by the end of
the 3rdquarter of 2004.
        As in the case of capacity reduction, the employment reduction schedules have been
included in business plans developed by individual mining companies with an employment
reduction, based on present expectations, of nearly 11,000 in 2004 of which about two thirds are
expected to leave using severance instruments under the Act on Restructuring of Hard Coal Mining
Sector.


                                                    44

            6. Organizational and structural changes

      At present, there are 6 coal-producing entities within the hard coal mining sector. Three
companies group in total 37 operational mines, including:
                      0   KompaniaWeglowa S.A. - 23 mines,
                      0   KatowickaGrupa Kapitalowa (KGK)- 9 mines (including 1 mine having the
                          limited liabilitycompany status),
                      0  JSW S.A. - 5 mines.
      Three mines: KWK ,,Budryk S.A., KWK Lubelski Wegiel ,,Bogdanka" S.A., Zaklad Gorniczo
Energetyczny ,,Sobieski-Jaworzno 111"      Sp. z 0.0. operate outside of the structures of the above
mentioned mining companies.
      Furthermore,there are two restructuring companies in the sector: SRK S.A. and BSRK Sp. z
0.0. grouping mines under liquidation.
      KW S.A. was established on 1 February, 2003 by way of contribution by: RSW, GSW, NSW
and Rybnicka SW and four mining limited liability companies wholly held by BSK SA (ZG Bytom Ill,
ZG Centrum, ZG Piekary, ZG Bytom ll), of enterprises under provisions of art. 55' of the Civil Code.
In return for contributionof enterprises,the KW S.A. undertookto provide all benefits under liabilities
relating to operations of such enterprise (indemnificationcommitment)to the amount 5% higher than
the value of respectiveenterprise.
Furthermore,activities relative to:

          incorporation to KW S.A. or liquidation of mining companies that contributed their mines
          to KW S.A.
will be continued.

            7. Financial restructuring

      The process of financial restructuring continued to date failed to achieve significant reduction
of debt of mining enterprises.As at the end of the period of 11 months of 2003 the Profit and Loss
Accounts have shown forgiveness of debt in the amount of only PLN 844.7 million. The said debt
was forgiven exclusivelyon the basis of the previous mining sector restructuring law.
      The Act on hard coal mining sector restructuring during the period 2003 - 2006 provides for
extension, relative to the previous applicable laws and regulations, of the scope of forgiveness of
debt outstanding to public entities, including interest, and the relevant debt is forgiven by the ex
officio, upon entry of the Act intoforce.
      The Act provides also for deferral of payment, until 31 December, 2004 and, subsequently
repayment by 31 December, 2010, of liabilities of mining enterprises regarding retirement pension
premiums, social insurance premiums in part payable by the insured person and premiums to health
insurance.
      The restructuring conducted on the basis of the Act of 28 November, 2003 is estimated to
include the debt in the total amount of PLN 20.1 billion including debt to be forgiven in the amount of
PLN 18.0 billionwhile deferred repayment is expected to apply to the amount of PLN 2.1 billion.The
above amounts include also amounts of debt subject to debt restructuring process under the
packageof the Anti-Crisis Laws.
      Debtforgiveness, in the amount of PLN 18.0 billion,will ensure reduction of total debt of the
hard coal mining sector to the level of ca. PLN 3.6 billion.This debt, following conclusion of
conciliation agreementswith creditors, will be subject to deferred repayment in installments. Debt

restructuringand forgiveness proceedingsconducted under the Act of 30 August, 2002 and the Act
of 26 November, 1998with respect to liabilities subject to financial restructuringunderthe Act of 28
November,2003 on Restructuringof Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003 - 2006 are subject to
discontinuation by the virtue of the law. Uponforgiveness of debt of mining enterprises security
against such debt repayment, as established upon the assets or rights of such mining enterprises
will also expire.
       In effect of conclusionof the financial restructuring process, the sector will establish proper
basisfor profitableoperations. Positive results of the financial restructuringprocesswill be secured
by improvement of corporate governance, including:
     0  maintainingstrict budgetary discipline by mining enterprises;
     0  public releaseof audited accounts and notes;
     0  improvement of the internal audit and control systems;
     0  introductionof effective managementmechanisms.
Appropriate audit and monitoring of financial standings of mining enterprises will be ensured by
high quality auditors.
        The Government is committed to the mining companies adhering to a hard budget
constraint and pay all liabilities due to Government for current production while improving their
overaII balance sheet.

             8. Environment protection

       Pursuant to the Program Restructuring of Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003 - 2006 four
mining companies Le. KW S.A., KHW S.A., JSW S.A., and SRK S.A. have a duty to develop, in
collaboration and agreement with the Ministry of Environment, appropriate ecological and
environment protection program and have prepared draft environment protection program for the
mines and plants for the period 2004-2006 which are presently beingfinalized.

       KW S.A. developed a working document entitled ,,Environment Protection Program for the
Mines and Plants Operating in the Structures of KW S.A. for the Period 2003 - 2006". Currently,
the document is under verification in view of updating of feasibility studies of KW S.A. mines and
plants. KW S.A. expects the following environmental effects to be achieved:

             0   reduction of general volume of sewage discharged to surface waters including
                 general sewage and saline underground waters;
             0   maximum re-use, for commercial purposes, of mining wastes (civil engineering
                 works, land reclamation);
             0   gradual implementationof land reclamationprojectsand re-useof degraded land;
             0   monitoringof environmental impact of coal heaps;
             0   liquidationof unnecessary emissions;
             0   elimination of self-ignitiondanger regarding mining waste dumps;
                 boiler equipment modernization;
             0   reduction of excessive noise emissions.
        The KW S.A. environment protection program includes minimizing negative impact on
surface objects and landscape by conducting mining operations in a manner limiting land surface
deformation and provides for introduction of preventive measures in constructionworks to reduce
mining damages.


document KHW S.A. will implement, in the course of 2003 - 2006, environmental projects in the
       KHW S.A. has developed an ecology and environment protection program. According to this

following areas: protectionof surface waters, reductionof gaseous emissions, waste management,



                                                    46

protectionagainst noise emissions and reclamation of post-mining land. Simultaneously, KHW S.A.
mines are introducingthe EnvironmentManagementSystem in keepingwith IS0 14001standard.

        JSW S.A. expects the following environmental effects to be achieved:
             0  reductionof the impact of undergroundwater discharge upon surface waters;
             0  reduction in volumes of mining waste generated underground and increase in waste
                utilization;
             0  reductionof fly ash and gaseous emission levels;
             0  reductionof methaneemissions by utilizingmethanefor energy generation;
                reclamationand re-use of mining waste dumps;
             0   remedying mining damages.

     SRK S.A. is currently in the process of developing its program.The Company has conductedstock
taking exercise regarding land of liquidated mines requiring reclamationworks, including lands available
for future investments(so-calledindustrialparks).

             9. Privatization

       The conceptualdocument regarding privatization of the hard coal mining sector, as
developed by the Minister of State Treasury, expects the change of ownership structure to ensure
maintainingappropriatelevel of competitiveness by mining enterprises and ensure effectiveness of
their operations on domestic marketsas well as ensure competitive advantage on the export
markets.According to the assumptions, privatizationactivities regarding all mining sector
companies: KHW S.A., JSW S.A., KW S.A., LW "Bogdanka" S.A., and KWK "Budryk" will
commencefor each of these companies or their successorcompanies in 2006. At present,the
Polish Government has entered the stage of preparation of the sector's privatization strategyto
determine possible privatization scenarios for the above-mentioned entities.
       The KHW S.A. privatization process is already underway with the first stage involving hiring
of the privatizationadvisor. Decision on KHW S.A. privatizationpath will be madefollowing
submissionof the advisor's report by end of the 3rdquarter of 2004.
       The next step for JSW will be to hire the privatizationadvisor and on the basis of the
advisor's report, the detailed privatizationpathwill be determined in 2005.
       KW S.A., due to the scale of restructuringprogram and the size of the entity, will require more
time and preparationsbefore privatizationprocess commencement. Inview of the above, the year
2005 seems to be an optimumtime scale to select privatizationadvisor for KW S.A. Hence, the
privatizationpathwould be determined before the end of 2006 on the basis of the advisor's report.
       Detailed actions regarding the organizational and ownership structuresof LubelskiWegiel
BogdankaS.A. and KWK Budryk will be defined before the end of the 3rd quarter of 2004.

             10. Programintroductionand implementationmonitoring

ANNEX 2: Maior Related ProiectsFinanced by the Bank and/or other Agencies


The project directly addresses one o f the four key issues identified in Section A.1- namely excess
capacity. As excess capacity i s reduced, the project will help restore the supply demand balance
which is a key step ifthe industryi s to be successfully privatized.

Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
The project design builds on the following lessons learned from SECAL 2 in that it directly
supports further restructuring o f the industry. The project design also reflects the broader lessons
learned from SECAL 2, inthat it supports implementation o f a comprehensive reform program that
will lead to privatization. The project design also reflects the outcome o f a consultation with
miningcommunity representatives, workers, companies andGovernment officials.

The project design also reflects the experience with the Russia and Ukraine Coal SECAL
operations, as well as the Romanian Government's experience with mining industry restructuring
and severance payments. The Bank's experience with coal SECALs in the ECA Region has been
that implementing coal sector reform i s highly dependent on overall macroeconomic conditions and
that a high level of commitment i s required over several years to achieve sustained change in an
industrysuch as coal.

The OED review o f the ICRs for the two SECALs concluded the following:


                                SECAL 1                         SECAL 2

Borrower Performance            Satisfactory                    Satisfactory


The OED review o f SECAL 2 noted that the reduction in employment and costs were significant
outcomes o f the project that slow progress on privatization and modest institutional development
impacts were shortcomings o f the two projects..

OED also commented (in Volume I1Extractive Industries and Sustainable Development) that "A
notable feature of Poland's Hard Coal SECALs I and 11 was that succeeded in reducing
uneconomical production levels and excess employment without much social stress. However,
.............attemptsat generating alternative employmentfor laid-off workers in other sectors and
through encouraging small industries fell far short of expectations. This implies that the complexity
of large rehabilitation/closure projects does notpermit adequate attention to the demanding task of
generating alternative employment, which should be thefocus of projects outside of the extractive
industries sectors.

The assistance provided by Bank staff and consultants in supporting implementation o f the
Government's Coal Sector Reform Programshas been financially supported by a number o fbilateral
agencies including those of EU Phare, Canada, the UK, and the US. The Bank has maintained

                                                  52

regular contact with representatives from the EU and bilateral institutions to keep them informed
about progress in Program preparation. The Council o f Europe Development Bank is helping
finance regional development/job creation initiatives through an E25 million loan to SRK. The EU
has undertaken operations to assist local committees affected by support coal sector reform; and
following EUmembership, further EU support o f the sector as well as for regional development in
Upper Silesia i s envisaged through the CohesionFund. Inaddition, EBRDhas expressed an interest
inconsidering financingor equitycontributions as mines and/or miningcompanies areprivatized.

ANNEX 4: DetailedProject Description



The Project will support SRK's and BSRK's mine closure activities for the period 2004-2006.

The mine closure activities consist o f the following five components:

   A. Liquidation o f underground workings and shafts including removal o f equipment and
       securing underground areas.
This activity will consists of:
           0   Underground roadways are closed through dams
           0   When possible, galleries are closed by filling them with fly ashes, which in contact
               with water get the constitutiono f cement
           0   If feasible, underground equipment is recover from underground (inmost cases it
               remain underground )
            0  Safety equipment and works (such as ventilation and methane monitoring) will be
               maintain duringliquidation works
            0  Insome cases, dewatering is necessary to prevent water hazards to the neighboring
               operatingmines andparts o f undergroundwill be kept functional.

   B. Post liquidation, including demolishing and clearing surface structure, buildings, plant and
       equipment and, ifnecessary, stabilization o f any work dumps.
This activity consists of:
            0  Shafts liquidation through filling them with different materials, including isolating
               material such as clay. Thenthey are capped with a cement cap.
            0  Demolish o f existing buildingsthat can not been reused. The ones that can be reused
               are offered for sale.
            0  Dismantling o f installations and surface structure and equipment
            0  Stabilizationand extinguish o f waste dumps, closure o f tailings ponds

   C. Preparation of: (a) a comprehensive Dewatering Master Plan; (b) Environmental
       Management Plans; and (c) Mine Closure Plans and Engineering Design Studies and
       Documentation review to obtain for necessary approvals.

   (a) The study would identify and examine options (hydrogeological, legal and institutional) and
   recommend necessary steps to minimize the costs o f dewatering for the period 2005 - 2025 and
   beyond.

    (b) Such plans were preparedfor the first two mines identified for being transferredto SRK for
    fillliquidation.Additionalminesliquidation, aswellascompletionof minesalreadyunder
    liquidation by SRK and BSRK will be governed by the Environmental Framework, which is
    part o fthe Operational Manual.


   (c) Such studies will include, but not be limitedto:
            0  Coal mine liquidation program
            0  annual coal mine liquidation plan

The landreclamationis usually carried out intwo phases:
           Phase 1 - prepare the land for industrial area, which will include clean up and
           ground leveling ;
           Phase 2 - prepare the land for recreational area, which will include also more
           remediation actions, as well as recultivation

E. Post mine closure monitoring andmaintenance, with particular regard for any post-closure
   de-watering requirements ifneeded.

This activity will mainly consists o f carry over dewatering, ifnecessary.

ANNEX 6: ImplementationArrangements


Management Arrangements The Reform Program will be largely implemented by the mining
companies. The mining companies operate as autonomous, independent companies supervised by
independent Supervisory Boards (Board o f Directors) appointed by the shareholder. As part o f the
Program, annual operating plans are prepared for each mining company covering planned
production, production costs, sales, capacity closures, employment and employment reduction
plans, investments, productivity, projected environmental improvements, etc. and providing pro
forma income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements for the period.

Ministry of Economy and Labor (MoEL).           Underthe Program and enabling law, the ownership
functions o f the Government for the mining companies have been transferred from MoST
(previously the owner) to the Ministry o f Economy, Labor and Social Policy (MoEL). Therefore,
M o E L i s responsible for producing the Program and coordinated inputs from other interested parties
(ministries, regional authorities, agencies and NGOs). However, MoST retained the responsibility
for privatization o f mining companies.      The Ministry o f Finance (MoF) was responsible for
providing finance for the Program. The labor and social policy staff o f M o E L are heavily involved
in ensuring that there are adequate employment services available to support miners leaving the
industry. Inaddition, they are responsible for overseeing a Public Information Campaign, and for
social monitoring andprovision o f employment services for miners.

Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEN).            The Ministry o f Environmental Protection
(MoEN) was responsible for managing preparation o f the Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA).
The National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management (National Fund) and
Voivodship Environmental Departments will provide advice to the MoEN, as well as the Mining
Companies on environmental matters. Furthermore, MoEN, in conjunction with the Voivodship
Environmental Department, will monitor implementation of the environmental aspects o f mining
company business plans.

Inter-MinisterialCoalMonitoringCommittee(IMCMC) . An Inter Ministerial Coal Monitoring
Committee (IMCMC) appointed by the Prime Minister and reporting to the Council o f Ministers is
overseeing Program implementation. The I M C M C consists o f Deputy Ministers from four
ministries (namely Ministries o f Finance; Economy and Labor; Environment; and State Treasury).

Mine RestructuringCompany (SRK) and BytomMine RestructuringCompany (BSRK) .A
Mine Restructuring Company (SRK) was established in August 2000 as a separate entity, together
with a subsidiaryBytom Mine Restructuring Company (BSRK (which is responsible for the closure
o f mines inthe Bytom area -which has a large concentration o f older mines ina heavily urban area
that need to be closed. The joint objectives o f the SRK and BSRK are: (i)       liquidation o f mines
assets more effectively through reducing closure costs and shortening closure time, (ii)more
transparent and effective use o f closure funds, and (iii)
                                                        management a and disposal o f mines assets.
The SRK i s also undertaking employment creation initiatives. The SRK and BSRK will not produce
any coal. Costs for closure o f entire mines by S R K and BSRK will be financed from the state
budget, but the mining companies must finance partial mine closure from their own resources. The
SRK will take over from the existing mining companies the assets and liabilities o f mines where
production has been terminated. Liabilities to Government entities will be written off in the SRK
and BSRK.

Agency for IndustrialRestructuring(ARP). The Agency for Industrial Restructuring (ARP) is
effectively the implementing and monitoring agency for the project.     ARP is responsible for
processing (a) mining companies applications for funding support for severance payments for new
miners leaves, carry-over o f previously approved miners leaves and the schemes for surface
workers and (b) SRK and BSRK and mining companies applications for funding support for mine
closure and liquidation including environmental reclamation and subsidence repair. ARP will also
undertake field control visits o f mining companies, SRK and BSRK use o f funding for capacity
restructuring (including environmental reclamation and subsidence repair) and employment
restructuring.  ARP is also responsible for monitoring industry performance under the Program.
This monitoring will cover both company performance, as well as the aggregate sector performance
and, will be based on the performance targets included as part o f company business plans and
associated employment contracts. Monitoring was previously been undertaken by the State Hard
Coal Restructuring Agency (PARG) which was transformed into KW at the start o f the 2003-2006
Program.

ANNEX 7: FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements


Financial ManagementArrangements

The project utilizes MOEL financial management system and reports with supporting systems and
information being maintained and provided by the ARP based on the data supplied by SRK and
BSRK as implementing entities.        The financial management arrangements o f the project are
acceptable to the Bank with exception o f the Project Operational Manual which i s not yet
completed. The financial section o f Operational Manual shall be finalized and approved by Loan
Effectiveness (Section 6.2).

Countiy Issues The country financial management issues identified in the Bank's Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) o f Poland o f 1999, particularly with respect to the
need to modernize accounting and reporting functions, have been addressed through the use o f the
program-specific financial management arrangements at the ARP. In September 2003 the Bank
initiated a new CFAA for Poland to provide updated information on public sector financial
accountability arrangements and help to develop a program for reforms and capacity building to
improve transparency and accountability with respect to the use o f public funds. The report is
expected to be issued by end o f June 2004.

In 2002, the Bank conducted a ROSC Accounting & Auditing review. The ROSC report on
Accounting & Auditing provides a description and overview o f standards and practices in Poland.
While there is no regulatory obligation inPoland to apply Intemational Accounting Standards, the
amended Polish Accounting Regulations (PAR) in force commencing 2002 have moved to be more
in line with International Accounting Standards (IAS).    However there are still some differences.
The application and enforcement o f accounting standards in some public entities should be
improved and so that the entities can present reliable financial results for investors and other users.
The implementation o f amended Accounting Act          effective January 1, 2002 introducing new
requirements more in line with International Accounting Standards should be carefully monitored.
Past experience shows that the proper application o f the accounting regulations has not always been
fully achieved. The quality o f the audits is unequal and in some cases unsatisfactory. These risks
will be taken into account while designing the auditing arrangement for the loan funds as they move
to and are disbursed by the mining companies and reach the worker who is the final recipient. In
addition, the Bank will, uponthe request o f the coal companies' Supervisory Boards, provide advice
on best-practice procedures to select appropriate independent auditors.

Strengths and Weaknesses. The strengths that provide a basis o f reliance on the project financial
management system include: (i)     the experience o f M o E L and the coal companies since 1998 in
implementing the Coal Reform Programs and o f ARP since 2003 inmonitoring government support
for hard coal sector; (ii)overall strong organizational and financial capacity of ARP as monitoring
and reporting entity, (iii)existing accounting and reporting systems in SRK and BSRK providing
detail and aggregate periodic reports on liquidation expenditures.

The weakness o f the system is in the quality o f the external statutory auditors o f the SRK and
BSRK annual financial statements. However, this will be mitigated for the project by requiring the
audit of the project to be performed by an auditor acceptable to the World Bank. With regard to the
coal companies' financial statements, it has been agreed that the S R K and BSRK would prepare


                                                  62

entity-level financial statements in accordance with relevant Polish accounting regulations. It was
further agreed that these entity-level financial statements would be audited in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing issued by the Intemational Auditing and Assurance Standards
Board o f the Intemational Federation o f Accountants or in accordance with Polish Auditing
Standards issued by the National Board o f Certified Auditors in Poland and that the said audited
financial statements and audit opinion would be made publicly available, in full, by use of the
intemet and possibly also local newspapers. Finally, the Bank will, upon the request o f SRK's and
BSRK's Supervisory Boards, provide advice on best-practice procedures to select appropriate
independent auditors.

Implementing Entities

The Ministry of Economy and Labor (MoEL) has overall responsibility for program
implementation. M o E L and Ministry of Finance (MoF) will work closely together to ensure that
the Program is adequately funded throughout its life with transparency and clear accountability and
that the necessary arrangements are put in place to ensure satisfactory coordination,
implementation, monitoring and auditing for a Program.

The Agency for Industrial Restructuring ( A m ) is effectively the monitoring agency for the
project. ARP the joint stock company owned in 100% by the state was created in 1990 by the
Parliament on the basis o f liquidated special funds. The overall objective o f the Agency's activity i s
to support the process o f transformation o f the Polish enterprises into efficient entities capable o f
functioning in free market economy conditions. In March 2003 ARP created anew branch in
Katowice to undertake the restructuring role previously undertaken by the now liquidated PARG
(State Agency for Restructuring of Coal Mining). On the basis o f the law and agreement with
MoEL, ARP acts as monitoring body o f the coal sector. ARP is responsible for processing and
initial verifications SRK and BSRK applications for budget support for payments o f costs related to
physical mines liquidation, post liquidation including dewatering and subsidence removal. ARP
will also undertake program audits o f      use o f these subsidies.    ARP is also responsible for
monitoring industry performance under the Program. This monitoring will cover both company
performance, as well as the aggregate sector performance and, will be based on the performance
targets included as part o f company business plans.

Mine Restructuring Company (Spo'ka Restrukturyzacji Kopalri - SRK) i s one o f ultimate
implementing entities for the project. SRK is a joint stock company created in 2000 as a result o f
merging o f four hard coal mines companies (Jan Kanty, Porqbka-Klimont6wYSosnowiec, Satum).
Creation o f SRK was included inthe Government Hard Coal Mining Restructuring Program 1998-
2002. State Treasury i s 100% shareholder o f SRK. Bytom Mine Restructuring Company
(Bytomska SpdIka Restrukturyzacji Kopalri -BSRK) i s the other implementing entity. BSRK is a
limited liability company created in 2001 as a result o f merging o f 10 coal mine companies. BSRK
is wholly owned by SRK. The business activities o f SRK and BSRK include: performing o f coal
mine liquidation process, management of the real estates and other fixed assets o fliquidated mines,
andjob creation inparticular for liquidated mines' employees. Bothcompanies operate on the basis
o f legal acts including inter alia Commercial Code, Geological and MiningAct, Hard Coal Mining
Restructuring 2003-2006 Act. On the basis o f the M o E L Decree dated January 28, 2004 on
subsidies for financing of mines liquidation SRK and BSRK receives subsidies for the tasks
included inthe Decree and approvedby Minister o f Economy inannual liquidation plans,


                                                   63

Funds Flow. Funds will flow from the World Bank to MoF where they will be pooled with
budgetary funds, to the MoEL, to the SRK and BSRK, to their respective branches (mines) and
finally to contractors to cover the eligible project costs. ARP will receive application for funds from
SRK and BSRK on monthly basis, and after the verification will forward applications to M o E L for
approval and transfer o f funds directly to SRK and BSRK. MoEL will receive loan funds from the
Special Account heldby M o F through regular budgetary channels. The S R K and BSRK will record
the funds received from government as subsidy and the benefit related payments as costs in their
accounts inline with accounting regulations.

Staffing. The project will utilize the existing staff inMoEL, MoF, ARP, SRK and BSRK. Staff in
Katowice ARP branch will be responsible for collection o f individual reports from S R K and BSRK
and its verification and consolidation. ARP assigned 7 staff to perform monitoring o f the mines
liquidation and subsidence costs. The MOEL, ARP, SRK and BSRK staff have proven experience
to carry out their functions under this project.

Accounting Policies and Procedures. The project accounting and reporting will be based on cash
basis inline with the budgetary reporting requirements. MoEL presents the payments o f subsidies
to the SRK, BSRK and other coal companies as expenditures for hard coal sector in monthly
budgetary expenditure reports RB-28. Eventual small refunds o f unused subsidies (less than 0.1 -
0.2% per annum which is level acceptable by the World Bank) are refunded by entities by end of
budgetary year. Therefore transfers o f subsidies (as included in FMRs) from M o E L to SRK and
BSRK for eligible expenditures will be treated as documented use o f the loan funds. M o E L and
ARP already had in place set o f reporting procedures and internal controls relating to ex-post
verification o f expenditures directly incoal companies. There is strong program audit department in
the ARP which performs audits in coal mines in respect o f their receipts o f these program
subsidies. On the basis o f an agreement signed with the MoEL to perform such audits as well as
work plan prepared and approved by the Director o f the Katowice Branch o f the ARP, the program
audit department visits each coal mine unit receiving subsidies twice a year including also annual
verification o f expenditures.

Internal Audit. The Internal Audit Departments operating in the SRK and BSRK performs the
thematic audits according to the annual audit plan agreed with management and supervisory board.
These departments constitute part o f the internal control system o f the entities but are not directly
focused to the project. However, and as described above, the ARP has a strong program audit
department o f the project which performs on-site audits o f the in coal mines in respect o f their
receipt o f program subsidies.

External Audit. The Polish supreme Audit Institution (Najwyzsza Izba Kontroli - NIK), performs
an annual audit o f the state budget. The subsidies provided to the coal sector are included in the
budget o f M o E L and as such are audited by NIK. SRK and BSRK , being state owned entities
directly and indirectly, are also subject to inspections and audits by the tax authorities, Treasury
Control and Regional Control Chambers. The financial statements o f coal companies are also
audited by the private auditors for statutory audit purposes in accordance with Polish accounting
and auditing regulations. It has been agreed that the coal companies would prepare entity-level and
consolidated financial statements in accordance with relevant Polish accounting regulations .It was
further agreed that these entity-level and consolidated financial statements would be audited in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Auditing and
Assurance Standards Board o f the International Federation o f Accountants or in accordance with

                                                    64

Polish Auditing Standards issuedby the National Board o f Certified Auditors inPoland and that the
said audited financial statements and audit opinion would be made publicly available, inhll,by use
o f the internet and possibly also local newspapers. Finally, the Bank will, upon the request o f the
coal companies' Supervisory Boards, provide advice on best-practice procedures to select
appropriate independent auditors.

The project will be auditedby independent auditors, inaccordance with auditing standards, andon
terms o freference, all o f which acceptable to the World Bank. Itwas agreed duringnegotiations
that NIKwould be an auditor acceptable to the Bank.

The following table identifies the audit reports that will be required to be submitted by the project
implementation agency together with the due date for submission.

Reporting and Monitoring. Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) will be used for project
monitoring and supervision and the formats o f these are included in the draft Operational Manual.
The MoEL trough ARP will produce a full set o f FMRs every three months throughout the life o f
the project within 45 days after the end of the quarter.          FMRs will also serve as a tool for
disbursement purposes. Inaddition the World Bank will monitor the liquidation process on monthly
basis.

Information systems: M o E L uses accounting system to record and monitor the payments made for
subsidies in line with the budgetary classification and in breakdown by entity and tasks. M o E L
prepares monthly budgetary expenditures reports RB-28 including the payments o f subsidies to the
SRK, BSRK and other coal companies as a support to the hard coal sector. Additionally M o E L
maintains additional excel based system to monitor the realization o f the liquidation tasks by coal
miningunits. The ARP uses an excel based system to monitor ofthe government subsidies for coal
mines liquidation and subsidence costs. The coal companies, branches o f SRK and BSRK, send
paper reports, which are verified by ARP. The ARP prepares the aggregate report and sends to
M o E L (in paper and electronic form). The reports provide detailed and aggregate information on
the physical and financial progress o f the liquidation tasks as approved in the annual liquidation
plan. SRK and BSRK uses accounting system based on unified chart o f accounts which enables to
trace the subsidies received and corresponding incurred costs in a breakdown as included in the
reports sent to MoEL and ARP.

Impact of Procurement Arrangements.
Procurement capacity o f SRK and BSRK was assessedand found it to be satisfactory with regard to
use o f the Polish Public Procurement Law. However, with regard to selection o f consultants
following the Bank's Guidelines, SRK and BSRK procurement staff shall need to be trained.


                                                    65

Additionally, Operational Manual shall include necessary steps and deadlines in preceding year in
order to secure the funds and enable the biddingprocedure be commended to ensure sufficient time
for entire process and carrying out the contract in the budgetary year. The detailed description and
conclusions with regard to the procurement arrangements and the procurement capacity assessment
are included inAnnex 8.

Disbursement Arrangements. Bank funds will be disbursed using report based disbursement on the
basis o f transfers from MoEL to SRWBSRK. The loan funds will be disbursed for one main
project category "Hard Coal Mine Closure Transfers"       covering all subsidies provided for mine
liquidation to SRK and BSRK. The loan will finance 56% o f such defined program. Supporting
documentation for report based disbursement will be retainedby the MoEL, SRK and BSRK which
ultimately receive the government subsidies and make payments to contractors. MoF will open a
Special Account at the National Bank o f Poland or at a commercial Bank acceptable to the World
Bank. Loan funds will be transferred to the MoEL and to coal companies on the basis o f application
for funds processed in accordance with existing government procedures. Withdrawal applications
(together with FMRs and Special Account bank statement) for the replenishments o f the SA will be
sent to the World Bank every three months (or inother intervals as agreed with the World Bank).
The first disbursement would be based on actual transfers o f subsidies from M o E L to SRK and
BSRK for the eligible expenditures executed inthe period January 1, 2004 through to loan signing
up to aggregate amount o f  8.4 million. Subsequent disbursements will be based on projectedcash
forecast to fund expected transfers o f subsidies for mine closure activities. Actual transfers o f
subsidies (as included inFMRs) from M o E L to S R K and BSRK for mine closure activities will be
basis for documentation o f use o f the loan funds inthe World Bank systems. Since the operation
is supporting the 2004-2006 program, disbursement o f the funds would also be conditioned on
satisfactory progress regarding adherence to a hard budget constraint by the companies and
implementation o f next steps towards industry privatization.

Action Plan. As agreed during appraisal, the financial management arrangements o fthe project will
be strengthened prior to LoanEffectiveness (Section c.6.3).

Supervision Plan. During project implementation, the World Bank will review the project's
financial management arrangements in two main ways: (i)      review the project's quarterly financial
management reports, periodic financial information o f the coal companies including information on
meeting hard budget constrains, as well as the entity's annual audited financial statements and
auditor's management letter, and the annual audit report o fNIK on the government funds utilized in
the coal sector;    and (ii)during the World Bank's missions, review the project's financial
management and disbursement arrangements to ensure compliance with the World Bank's
requirements. As required, a Bank-accredited Financial Management Specialist will assist in the
supervision process.

restricted tendering can be used only for Specialized Technical Services for which there i s a limited
number o f firms and for contracts estimated not to exceedUS$500,000 (eq. EUR400,000).


Selection of Consultants: The Implementing Agencies shall hire consultants, firms and
individuals, to prepare the complete mine closure documentation. For the post-liquidation activities
consultants shall be hiredto prepare the design. For selection of firms QCBS Method and Selection
Method Based on Consultants' Qualifications shall be used. Short lists o f consultants for services
estimated to cost less than US$ 200,000 (eq. EUR 160,000) equivalent per contract may be
composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance with the provisions o fparagraph 2.7 of the
Consultant Guidelines.

Operational Costs: which would be financed by the project, would be procured using the
implementingagencies' administrative procedures which were reviewed and found acceptable to
the Bank.

B.Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by two Implementing Agencies: Mine Restructuring
Company (Sp6lka Restrukturyzacji Kopaln - SRK) and Bytom Mine Restructuring Company
(Bytomska Sp6lka Restrukturyzacji Kopaln - BSRK). SRK agency i s staffed by 739 employees
and BSRK by 134 employees. Each Agency has its own Procurement Unit staffed by 2-3
procurement officers. In addition, 1-2 employees o f the concerned mine under closure are also part
of the procurement team and are responsible for preparation o f the Technical Specifications. Each
Agency has a general Evaluation Committee established by the decision o f the Board of Directors.
For each specific procedure, a specific committee is established comprising members o f the general
Evaluation Committee. Each committee includes always a procurement office, lawyer,
representative o fthe ownership department andof the concerned mine.

An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for
the project has been carried out by Elzbieta Sieminska inApril 2004. The assessment reviewed the
organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the project's staff
responsible for procurement and the Ministry's relevant central unit for administration and finance.

                                                  68

The Ministry o f Economy and Labor shall supervise the procurement performance o f the
Implementing Agencies through ARP.

Most o f the issues/ risks conceming the procurement component for implementation o f the project
have been identified and include:
            0   Availability o f funds for contract financing early enough to enable the bidding
                procedure be commenced to ensure sufficient time for the entire process and carrying
                out the contract.
            0   Both SRK and BSRK do not know the Bank's Guidelines and procedures for
                selection o f consultants.
            0   New Public Procurement Law came into force on March 2, 2004 and the
                ImplementingAgencies only recently beganto follow it.
        The corrective measures which have been agreed are:
            0    SRK and BSRK will update the procurement plan and prepare the application for
                 finds and submit to the Ministry o f Economy and Labor not later than by October 31
                 o f the preceding year. M o E L would (a) provide a planned annual budget to S R K and
                BSRK by December 15 each year for the following year; (b) provide SRK and
                 BSRK with their approved budget without any delay after the Government budget
                 was approved by Parliament; and (c) transfer the funds to SRK and BSRK on a
                 timely basis throughout the year.
             0   SRK and BSRK will revise the their Procedure Charts to include the time schedule
                 o f actions to obtain funds and will agree such revised Chart with the Ministry o f
                 Economy and Labor.
             0   Procurement staff o f SRK and BSRK shall attend training on the new Public
                 Procurement Law and the Bank's training offered inthe beginning o f June 2004.
             0   Audit o f procurement shall be included inthe annual plano f intemal control bothof
                 SRK and BSRK.
             0   The Bank and the Borrower shall conduct the Project Launch Workshop.
The overall project risk for procurement i s average.

C.           Procurement Plan

The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation which
provides the basis for the procurement methods. This planhas been agreed between the Borrower
and the Project Team on May 20, 2004 and is available at SRK and BSRK at Katowice. It will also
be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan
will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual
project implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

D. Frequencyof Procurement Supervision

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
 assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended annual supervision missions to visit the
 field to carry out post review o fprocurement actions.

ANNEX 9: Economic andFinancialAnalysis

Since this i s a capacity closure and environmental improvement project there i s no calculation of
financial or economic rates of return for the project. However, it i s expected that the project will
achieve the planned capacity closures and environmental improvements on a least cost basis.
Competitive bidding process and time bound completion schedules will help ensure that mines are
closed ina least cost basis.

ANNEX 10: Safeguard Policy Issues


In concurrence with ECCSD Safeguards Unit, the project has been assigned environmental
Category B (Partial Assessment). The basis for this rating is that the main environmental issues
associated with the project relate to the physical closure o f the mines. They include: (i)
                                                                                          possible
failure to decommission the mines or parts o f mines in an environmentally acceptable manner; (ii)
possible failure to deal with subsidence issues in a satisfactory and timely manner, and (iii)
demolition and removal o f old structures and equipment. Impacts associated with these issues are
modest, and o f short duration. Mitigating measures to address these impacts are well known and
routinely practiced in the sector. Decommissioning and rehabilitation o f mines in the project area
are expected to lead to improvements in the natural environment. Future land use i s uncertain but
could include new business and light industrial development and any land use planning activity
would require due attention to environmental aspects. The Government o f Poland is fully cognizant
o f these aspects.


In accordance with procedures for an environmental B category project, specific Category B
environmental assessments (EAs) were prepared and reviewed by the Bank for two mines
identified for closure at the time o f project appraisal. These two EAs were prepared in a manner
that is fully consistent with EA policies and procedures o f both the World Bank and the
Government o f Poland. For the additional mines to be closed which are not identified at project
appraisal, an environmental assessment framework was required to be prepared prior to appraisal
and this framework will be incorporated into the Operations Manual. The framework describe in
detail the EA procedures to be followed for the additional mines to be included in the project but
not identified at the time of project appraisal. The procedures to be addressed shall include:
screening, document preparation, document content, consultation, disclosure, review and approval
In addition, these procedures are to describe in detail institutions involved and institutional
arrangements to implement the EA process both prior to and during project implementation in a
manner that is fully consistent with both the Polish Government and World Bank EA policies and
procedures. In summary then, prior to appraisal the Bank received three documents: two mine
specific EAs, and an environmental framework document representing the environmental chapter o f
the operations manual. All three documents were displayed publicly in Poland (in Polish) and
delivered to the World Bank (inEnglish) prior to appraisal.


The Borrower has addressed safeguard issues and taken actions to minimize and mitigate potentially
adverse impacts, not only o f the project, but also o f the overall industry through environmental
management programs developed for 2004-2006. The borrower will adhere to full implementation
o f the above mentioned programs under this project.
