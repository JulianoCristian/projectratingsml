Under this component, infection control\n            procedures will be strengthened to improve occupational\n            health conditions and reduce disease transmission.\n            Environmentally sound treatment and disposal of health care\n            waste will be instituted in key facilities.  This will be\n            done through establishing appropriate institutions,\n            training, procurement and monitoring and evaluation.  As\n            part of addressing staff health, post-exposure prophylaxis\n            against HIV should be considered once the national ART\n            programme is established.  Staff vaccination against HBV is\n            not within this plan but is an important part of\n            occupational health and will be addressed within the\n            national programme.  Currently government policy is to\n            procure disposable needles. syringes and gloves, but within\n            budget constraints. The national programme will address\n            additional procurement of disposable equipment.  Good\n            infection control in health care facilities requires clear\n            national guidelines, staff trained in their implementation,\n            supported by adequate supplies and coordinated with waste\n            management.  Healthcare waste management requires the\n            establishment of a system of segregation, safe collection\n            and transportation, treatment and disposal of all waste\n            starting at the source of generation. The system should\n            minimize contact with patients, the general public and the\n            environment. In particular, there is need to establish clear\n            protocols for safe and secure collection, treatment and\n            disposal of sharps (e.g., needles, syringes, blades, and\n            other instruments capable of inflicting a wound or a\n            puncture) to minimize the risks associated with disease\n            transmission. There may be need to transport some critical\n            waste over short distances. Therefore the system to be put\n            in place needs to ensure safe and secure transportation to\n            treatment and final disposal sites. The Plan will also\n            recommend the selection of environmentally sound and\n            cost-effective treatment technologies to render special\n            waste streams harmless, either on-site, or off-site. A\n            quality assurance system (appropriate to the scale of the\n            activities) to ensure that waste handling and disposal\n            requirements are met. Segregation is the most important\n            step, which should be done at the source of generation e.g.\n            all patient activity areas, diagnostic service areas,\n            operation theatres, labor rooms, treatment rooms etc.  All\n            the bags/container must be labeled according to a designated\n            color-coding system. Certain categories of waste which may\n            need pretreatment (decontamination /disinfection) at the\n            site of generation such as plastic and sharp material etc,\n            should be removed from the site of generation only after treatment."}, "docdt": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
