A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The proposed project aims to reduce the risk of HIV and STI transmission among the 
general population, in particular groups whose sexual behaviors put them at high risk.    
  
 
A.3. Project Description 
The proposed project has the following four components: 
Component 1 – Prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs will support: (i) improving access to and use of 
condoms through condom social marketing and strengthening logistics and information systems to ensure 
timely distribution of condoms in public health facilities, and to all implementing agencies, including 
NGOs; (ii) elevating political and societal leadership and commitment to HIV/AIDS and STI prevention 
and control through advocacy targeted at high-level political and socially influential individuals and 
organizations (iii) increasing knowledge about HIV/AIDS and STIs and positive attitudes toward 
prevention and safer sexual behaviors among the general public through mass media and targeted 
interventions specifically designed to reach the local populations in addition to training of village health 
workers, traditional healers, and public health staff, and innovative initiatives to be undertaken by other 
sectors (iv) promoting behaviors that reduce the risk for HIV infection among priority groups through peer 
education, innovative outreach and communications strategies, and provision of voluntary counseling and 
testing, and STI treatment.  In addition to priority subpopulations including the armed forces, mobile 
populations (such as truck drivers), sex workers, and out-of-school youth, priority areas (“hotspots”) where 
high risk behavior occurs among general population groups will be targeted.  
Component 2 – Institutional Strengthening and Building Capacity will support: (i) strengthening laboratory 
services by instituting a national quality assurance for all laboratories, establishing an information system, 
ensuring adequate equipment and reagents, and training technicians to ensure improvement in HIV and STI 
diagnostics and treatment; (ii) improving blood transfusion services through policy development, training 
of technicians and health workers, and campaigns to increase clinical and safe use of blood and blood 
products and voluntary donation; (iii) enhancing management, technical, and implementation capacity of 
the National AIDS Control Program, and implementing agencies  and strategic planning through 
formulation of a National Policy on HIV/AIDS, local and foreign training, and technical assistance. 
Page  3
 
 
Component 3 – Care, Support and Treatment of AIDS and STIs will support: (i) increasing access and use 
of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services through establishment of five VCT centers (in a phased 
manner) in key areas and facilities, training of counselors, outreach services for difficult to reach 
populations, and demand generation for VCT services.(ii) strengthening management of AIDS and 
Opportunistic Infections and establishing care and support for PLWHA through development of national 
treatment guidelines for a comprehensive care and support approach, including anti-retroviral treatment as 
indicated; establishing and training district level clinical teams; improving laboratory support; instituting a 
drug information systems; and innovative grants or subprojects to involve PLWHA.  (iii) improving 
management of STIs through routine screening of ANC syphilis at district and army hospitals, updating 
existing STI syndromic management guidelines, improving syndromic treatment of STIs including 
antibiotic susceptibility studies, widespread dissemination of updated treatment guidelines to pharmacies 
and health facilities, and training of health care providers. (iv) reinforcing waste management and infection 
control through training of health personnel, monitoring, and procurement of equipment and supplies (a 
national waste management plan was developed during project preparation).  
Component 4:  Strategic Information for HIV/AIDS and STI will support: (i) enhancing management 
information systems and use of information technology to promote evidence based decision making and 
strategic planning through development of IT infrastructure and training on management and use of data. 
(ii) strengthening operational research capacity, especially to carry out social and behavioral research 
through training and TA.  (iii) establishing second generation surveillance and monitoring and evaluation 
systems, which include conducting assessments, population survey and special studies, obtaining technical 
assistance, and providing foreign training. 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
All of Bhutan will be covered under the project; however, interventions will be focused 
on priority subpopulations including the armed forces, mobile populations (such as truck 
drivers), sex workers, and out-of-school youth, and high transmission areas (“hotspots”) 
where high risk behaviors occur.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Provision of preventative and treatment services under the HIV AIDS project will 
generate hazardous medical wastes which, if not managed and disposed properly, can 
have direct environmental and public health implications. However, the negative impacts 
are reversible and easily mitigated through systematic management of such clinical waste 
from source to disposal. The wastes of highest concern expected to be generated by 
project activities are sharps (infected needles and syringes, surgical equipment, IV sets) 
infected blood, HIV test kits used in VCT centers, blood banks and laboratories and 
pharmaceutical wastes. There is no construction waste envisaged, as there are no major 
civil works, other than the establishment of a small-scale waste management system and 
refurbishment of VCT centers. 
 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The project envisages the establishment of proper management system for the treatment 
and disposal of the waste related to the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS and STI.  
Once these systems are put in place and efficiently implemented,  the negative 
environmental and environmental health impacts will be controlled.  Proper training of 
healthcare workers is also planned under the project to ensure that good infection control 
and waste management practices are sustained over time.  
  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
An assessment, which was carried out in 2002 with support from DANIDA, had 
recommended small incinerators as the most effective method of waste disposal 
especially in rural and non-accessible parts of the country.  Based on consultations with 
all the relevant stakeholders, DANIDA and the RGOB during project preparation, it was 
agreed that this option could generate adverse secondary environmental impacts, such as 
air and ground pollution, and that the HCWM plan would treat and dispose of clinical 
waste in the most cost-effective environmentally acceptable manner. 
  
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
While there is no national legislation on healthcare waste management in Bhutan, the 
RGOB has taken different initiatives for enforcing good practices and measures for 
handling general biomedical waste. There are Infection Control Guidelines and 
Environmental Codes of Practices for Hazardous Waste Mana
g
ement which 
p
rovides 
Page  6
 
 
some basic guidelines for segregation and disposal of biomedical waste. Waste 
management and infection control is also a part of the curricula offered by the Royal 
Institute of Health Services.  Additionally there are new guidelines with regard to solid 
waste management including biomedical waste generated from healthcare facilities. An 
assessment completed in 2002 noted that health workers have a reasonably good 
knowledge of occupational safety and good practices but these are not always practiced 
often because of lack of resources and proper equipment.  
 
With support from DANIDA, RGOB has prepared a draft Health Care Waste Management Plan.  The 
proposed project would finance two components of this plan: (i) waste that is a direct result of project 
financed activities; and (ii) establish a system to treat and dispose of clinical waste produced by the 
National Referral Hospital in Thimpu in an environmentally acceptable manner.  The components include 
sharps management, technical assistance for training and awareness raising on HCWM for health care 
personnel, and procurement of supplies and equipment. 
MOH is currently undertaking extensive consultations with various key stakeholders, such as the Thimpu 
City Corporation and National Environmental Commission, as well as incorporating the comments from 
IDA team into the Plan.  Upon the completion of the revisions, RGOB intends to disclose the Plan to the 
general public. 
As stated in the Special Procedures for Compliance with Safeguards to support accelerated implementation 
of HIV/AIDS projects, the Bank will accept the receipt of an acceptable HCWMP as a condition prior to 
commencing implementation of the project, rather than prior
 to appraisal of the overall project, and 
disclosure of HCWMP will not be required before
 appraisal.  The project appraisal will begin on April 1.  It 
was agreed that public disclosure of the Plan will take place prior to negotiations.    
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Workshops and/or discussion groups with key stakeholders (Ministry of Health 
personnel, including the National Referral Hospital, and other facilities, Ministry of 
Environment, and City Corporation)  have been organized in preparation of the 
Healthcare waste management plan.  Additional ones have been held to review the draft 
Healthcare Waste Management Plan. These workshops have been attended by 
government officials from Health, Environment, Infrastructure Services and City 
Corporation and other relevant agencies, health providers and personnel from various 
health facilities.  Electronic and print media will also be used for disclosure of the Plan.
