      Transmitted Infections (STI) Prevention and Control Project\n            for Bhutan were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in\n            the absence of any kind of strategic plan for HIV/AIDS, as\n            was the case in Bhutan, project preparation should include\n            support for the development of such a plan prior to\n            appraisal. The plan will then form the basis for project\n            design and reinforce the 'Three Ones' principles\n            in HIV/AIDS response. It will also help engage all\n            stakeholders and build stronger commitment. In a low\n            prevalence setting with severe human resources constraints,\n            such as Bhutan, the best use of resources (human and\n            financial) is to focus on HIV/AIDS interventions for\n            most-at-risk populations (MARPs). It is critical to\n            undertake behavioral surveillance and socio-geographical\n            mapping of MARPs prior to designing policies and program\n            interventions. This will also provide baseline data for the\n            Results Framework and helps set realistic targets. In\n            addition, STI patients should be viewed as a MARP and\n            benefit from Behavioral Change Communications (BCC) and\n            Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) other than STI\n            treatment. Public actors are less effective and motivated to\n            conduct outreach for marginalized MARPS such as Commercial\n            Sex Worker (CSW), injecting drug use (IDU) and sex with men\n            (MSM). Peer groups should be mobilized for this purpose.\n            While the multi-sectoral approach can be relevant for a low\n            prevalence country; activities should be restricted to the\n            most critical sectors given severe human resource\n            constraints, such as in Bhutan. Such a streamlined\n            multi-sectoral design will facilitate implementation.\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) should be tailored to\n            the country's limited capacity and characteristics of\n            the epidemic. Information should be used to improve the\n            evidence base for local decision making."}, "docdt": "2011-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
