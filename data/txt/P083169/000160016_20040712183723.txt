Introduction
The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) ha
s sought the assistance of the World Bank in 
developing and implementing a HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control project to support 
development of the national HIV/AIDS policy and interventions that will have the highest 
impact in reducing the spread of HIV. 
T
he risk of transmission of HIV, HBV and HCV in health care facilities owing to inadequate 
infection control is of particular concern. The waste generated from healthcare facilities, if 
inadequately handled and managed, can have adverse impact on the enviro
nment and on public 
health through air, land and water pollution.
However, the potential negative impacts can be 
mitigated through good practices of infection control and systematic management of infectious 
wastes from source to disposal. 
RGOB, with the 
cooperation and support of DANIDA, is in process of developing a National 
Infection Control and Healthcare Waste Management Programme, based on an assessment of 
representative sample of healthcare facilities and stakeholder consultations. This document 
pre
sents the plan, which will be a component of the National Programme and which focuses on 
improvement of infection control and healthcare waste management within the scope of the 
HIV/AIDS project.
2.
Current situation
The assessment done by DANIDA revea
led that, while most healthcare staff was aware of good 
practices for infection control and waste disposal, implementing these practices can be 
improved. Basic level of segregation of waste is done in all facilities, although options for 
treatment and disp
osal are limited and insufficient. Poorly managed incinerators have become a 
serious source of air pollution while open burial pits are dump sites for all infectious waste, 
posing a threat to public health and the pristine environment of Bhutan. Most healt
hcare 
facilities have no regulated disposal sites, except JDW National Referral Hospital in Thimpu, 
which has both an environmentally sound deep
-
burial pit and has access to the municipal 
landfill operated by the City Corporation.
A serious cause of con
cern is the inadequate management and poor practices when handling 
and disposing of sharps (needles, scalpels, blades etc). Disposable needles are routinely re
-
capped before disposal, while used sharps are collected in plastic boxes or tin cans, which are 
often r
e
used without cleaning or sterilization.    
There are 29 hospitals (including Referral and District) and 160 BHUs (Basic Health Units) in 
Bhutan. While there has been no assessment of volumes of waste generated, it can be estimated 
that 73 tons o
f infectious waste and sharps are generated annually in Bhutan. Of this, 
approximately 54 tons/year are generated at the hospitals and the rest from the BHUs. The table 
in Annex 1 provides more details on the healthcare facilities and their volumes of wast
e 
generated. 
The Ministry of Health has developed and disseminated Guidelines for Infection Control in 
Health Care Settings since 1996. Most healthcare workers are trained according to these 
guid
e
lines.  However there is no regular health screening and i
mmunization program for 
healthcare workers. So far there are no precise guidelines for good practices related to 
healthcare waste management.

Policy Framework
Currently there is no specific waste legislation in force in Bhutan. The Nation
al E
n
vironment 
Commission (NEC) passed an Environmental Assessment Act in July 2000 and issued a 
number of guidelines to support the Act. Handling of solid waste is addressed in 
‘Environmental Codes of Practice for Solid Waste Management in Urban Areas’, p
repared in 
October 2000 and in the ‘Environmental Code of Practice for Hazardous Waste Management’ 
issued in November 2001.  
In the above Codes of Practices, healthcare waste management is addressed, as defined below:

 
Training, education and awareness bu
ilding among those being responsible for waste 
management at all levels is important.

 
Secure hygienic storage and collection of waste in order to avoid scavenging by dogs and 
subsequent spillage and spread of waste to the surroundings.

 
Appropriate containe
rs and dustbins (colour
-
coded) must be used for collection, storage and 
transportation of infectious waste, equipped with proper lids and clearly l
a
belled in both 
English and Dzongkha.  

 
Adequate treatment of infectious waste prior to final disposal is imp
ortant, b
e
cause this will 
render the waste non
-
infective.

 
Infectious waste from hospitals and BHUs shall be excluded from the main disposal area at 
landfills and special precautions taken (e.g. deep
-
buried).

 
If incineration is chosen as the final solution 
for treatment of infectious waste, the 
incinerator shall be properly designed, sited, operated, maintained and monitored. Also the 
incinerator shall be equipped with emission control d
e
vices, which meet standards set by 
NEC.  

 
Infectious waste shall be seg
regated at source.

 
If infectious waste is transported off site a Chain of Custody system must be established in 
order to make it possible to track infectious waste back to the source of generation.
Infection control policy is established in the Guidelines
 for Infection Control in Health Care 
Settings, revised in 1998 and which will be further revised under this project.  Waste 
management will be included in the revised guidelines.
4.
Infection Control and Waste Management Plan
This Plan supports the HIV/
AIDS prevention and control project by ensuring that the 
transmission of HIV, and other nosocomial infections, in health care facilities is minimized.  It 
is a component of Bhutan’s national IC and HCWM Programme, which is currently under 
development. 
Un
der this component, infection control procedures will be strengthened to improve 
occupational health conditions and reduce disease transmission.  Environmentally sound 
treatment and disposal of health care waste will be instituted in key facilities.  This 
will be done 
through establishing appropriate institutions, training, procurement and monitoring and 
evaluation.  As part of addressing staff health, post
-
exposure prophylaxis against HIV should 
be considered once the national ART programme is established.
  Staff vaccination against HBV 
is not within this plan but is an important part of occupational health and will be addressed 
within the national programme.  Currently government policy is to procure disposable needles, 
Page  4
3
syringes and gloves, but within budg
et constraints. The national programme will address 
additional procurement of disposable equipment.
Good infection control in health care facilities requires clear national guidelines, staff trained in 
their implementation, supported by adequate supplies 
and coordinated with waste management.
Healthcare waste management requires the establishment of a system of segregation, safe 
collection and transportation, treatment and disposal of all waste starting at the source of 
generation. The system should minim
ise contact with patients, the general public and the 
environment. In particular, there is need to establish clear protocols for safe and secure 
collection, treatment and disposal of sharps (e.g., needles, syringes, blades, and other 
instruments capable of
 inflicting a wound or a puncture) to minimize the risks associated with 
disease transmission.
There may be need to transport some critical waste over short distances within Thimpu. 
Therefore the system to be put in place needs to ensure safe and secure t
ransportation to 
treatment and final disposal sites. The Plan will also recommend the selection of 
environmentally sound and cost
-
effective treatment technologies to render special waste 
streams harmless, either on
-
site, or off
-
site. A quality assurance sy
stem (appropriate to the scale 
of the activities) to ensure that waste handling and disposal requirements are met. 
Segregation is the most important step, which should be done at the source of generation e.g. 
all patient activity areas, diagnostic servic
e areas, operation theatres, labour rooms, treatment 
rooms etc.  All the bags/container must be labelled according to the following colour
-
coding 
system, as detailed in Table 1 below. Certain categories of waste that may need pretreatment 
(decontamination 
/disinfection) at the site of generation such as plastic and sharp material, etc., 
should be removed from the site of generation only after treatment.

Institutional Framework
The National Infection Control Committee (NICC) will be established in the Ministry of Health 
(MOH), Department
 of Medical Services for implementation and monitoring & evaluation of 
the national programme.   
The NICC will have the Director of Department of Medical Services as chairman and will 
include senior officers from MOH (Public Health, Health Care, Drugs Va
ccines Equipment 
Division, Quality Assurance & Standard Division, Health Engineering, Institute of Traditional 
Medicine Service, Royal Institute of Health Services, senior medical and nursing staff), 
National Environment Commission, and City Corporation. 
The NICC will meet monthly during the start
-
up of the project activities, to ensure that the 
system is being put into place effectively. After the initial set
-
up, the NICC will meet on a six
-
monthly basis or earlier, if an emergency arises. The NICC will 
set up working groups to work 
on specific tasks as needed.
At each of the referral hospitals there will be Infection Control Teams (ICT), comprising two 
link nurses and a doctor.  The ICTs will be responsible for programme implementation and 
reporting to 
the District Medical Officer and the NICC. At the BHU level, the Health Assistant 
will be responsible for infection control and waste management activities and reporting to the 
district ICT. 
6.
Training 
Training for IC and HCWM is essential, both init
ial and ongoing. The responsibility for 
pla
n
ning training programme will be Department of Medical Services. Imparting of the initial 
training will be undertaken by a contracted technical expert, while ongoing refresher training 
will be u
n
dertaken by the me
mbers of the ICTs. Training of equipment will  be done by 
equipment suppliers.  

 
Training requirements for the members of the NICC should f
o
cus on the following:
o
General introduction to hospital acquired infections and means of transmission.
o
Occupational 
health hazards.
o
Universal precautions as means to reduce nosocomial infections and risk of 
occupational exposure.
o
Segregation, treatment and disposal methods for waste management.
o
Monitoring and evaluation of IC and HWCM.
o
Protective equipment and the impor
tance of adequate supply.
o
Monitoring of facility stock reporting.

7.
Awareness and IEC
IEC material on the correct handling and disposal of health care waste will be devel
oped, 
building upon sources available regionally and internationally.  Awareness of correct disposal 
of waste will be promoted amongst health care workers and the general population by 
displaying IEC materials.
8. 
Monitoring and evaluation
The 
NICC and 
the ICTs
 at the respective healthcare facilities will unde
r
take monitoring of 
infection control and health care waste management.  Standardized reporting formats will be 
developed centrally and staff at district and central levels will be trained in undert
aking 
monitoring and reporting for the programme.  Reporting will cover the following points:

 
Implementation of programme (hospital IC & waste management checklists)

 
Trainings held in facility

 
Nosocomial infections (wound infections, intravenous cannula si
te infections, UTIs, 
other suspected infections)

 
Occupational exposures (needlestick injuries, blood & body fluid splash)

 
Stock adequacy/needs (IC and waste management equipment)
Reporting will initially be on a three monthly basis, frequency to be review
ed at mid
-
term 
evaluation.
Page  7

9.
Procurement
The main equipment required for IC will be protective attire (gloves, masks, aprons, boots).  
The main equipment for waste management will be disposal material (colour
-
coded bags, bins, 
buckets), autoclaves 
and needle destroyers/cutters (manual or electric) for some healthcare 
facilities.  Disposal of healthcare waste (treated and non
-
treated, biodegradable and non
-
degradable) will be either in the municipal landfill (where available) or in the specially 
desi
gned deep burial pits.
