ProjectDev. Objective:

The proposed project aims to reduce the risk o f HIV and STI transmission among the
general population, in particular among groups with high risk sexual behaviors. Key
outcome indicators include:
    0   Percentage o f persons reporting condom use with last non regular sex partner
        increased from <20% at project start to 60% among priority groups and 30%
        among the general population at project end.
    0   Percentage o f patients with selected STIs at health care facilities who are
        appropriately treated accordingly to the updatednational guidelines increased from
        <20% inbaseline (Yr2) to 60% at project end.

PROJECTDESCRIPTION

Component 1 - Prevention o f HIV/AIDS and STIs will promote political and societal
leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS, improve community knowledge and attitudes
about HIV prevention, promote risk-reducing behaviours amongst priority groups, and
increase access to condoms.

Component 2 - Institutional strengthening and building capacity will enhance the ability
o f national institutions to lead the fight against HIV through training and technical
assistance, andwill strengthen laboratory andbloodtransfusion services.

Component 3 - Care, support and treatment o f AIDS and STIs will establish VCT
services, strengthen management o f STIs and HIV/AIDS (comprehensive care and
treatment approach, including introduction o f ART), and improve infection control and
waste management inhealth facilities.

Component 4 - Strategic information for HIV/AIDS and STIs will promote evidence
based decision making by improving health information management, strengthening
operation research capacity, institutingM&E and second generation surveillance systems.

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE
1. Countryandsector issues
Though isolated geographically, increasing cross-border migration and international travel is
creating a situation where the Himalayan Kingdom o f Bhutan i s no longer impervious to
HIV/AIDS. Bhutan appears to be at the early stages o f a low-grade HIV epidemic. UNAIDS
estimates that about 100 Bhutanese were living with HIV/AIDS at the end o f 2001, which
amounts to a prevalence rate o f less than 0.01%. Only 45 cases have been detected through a
combination o f sentinel surveillance, contact tracing, and clinical screening, since 1993 when the
first case was reported.          However, there are mounting concerns because the number o f new
infections reported each year appears to be rising. The majority of these infections were acquired
through unprotectedsex.

Bhutanhas several risk factors and conditions that could fuel the spread o f the virus: neighboring
countries experiencing generalized or concentrated epidemics, high mobility across borders and
within the country, high levels of STIs, relaxed sexual norms, existence of sex work, limited
access to condoms, and an emerging problem o f substance abuse. It is important to note that
Bhutan does not appear to conform to the typical pattern o f the HIV epidemic inAsia where the
spread o f HIV is initially driven by commercial sex and injecting drug use (IDU).Commercial
sex work in Bhutan appears limited and i s focused in border towns. Injecting drug use i s also
believed to be limited. However, non-paid casual sex i s common among long distance drivers,
armed forces, migrant workers and drug users.' These behaviors tend to occur in specific
locations (e.g. bars, restaurants, vegetable markets) and events (e.g. festivals). The nature o f
casual sex behaviors in Bhutan requires more extensive examination to provide critical
information for improving HIV and STIprevention interventions.

National Response. In 1988, five years before the first HIV infection was detected, RGOB
established a National STD/AIDS Control Program (NACP).                            The program is situated in the
Ministry o f Health (MOH), under the Department o f Public Health, and has two fbll time staff
members. Information, Communications Bureau (ICB), which i s responsible for IEC, and the
Royal Institute o f Health Sciences (RIHS), which provides basic training to mid-level health
workers, also provide input into the national program.                       In 2002, multisectoral task forces
(MSTFs), composed o f government officials and individuals from the private sector and civil
society, were established in all Dzongkhags with the mandate to carry out health promotion and
HIV/AIDS awareness. They serve as an important mechanism to ensure involvement of key
sectors beyond health and the public sector inHIV/AIDS prevention efforts.

The donors, including DANIDA andUNagencies such as WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, andUNFPA,
have worked closely with the government over the past decade insupporting the health sector in
general, including HIV/AIDS prevention and control efforts. DANIDA has strengthened the
health infrastructure and information systems, and WHO has provided both technical and
'Ariskand     vulnerability study using qualitative methods was carried out inthe project preparationphase among
five priority groups identified prior to the data collection as follows: long distance drivers, migrant workers,
commercial sex workers, drug users and armed forces. The study also identified other groups that are potentially at
highrisk for HIV, suchas marketvendors, young women working inrestaurants andbars, andcivil servants who
receive training abroad.

financial assistance to the country's HIV/AIDS prevention program that included short-term
consultants in the areas o f sentinel surveillance and health education as well as financing travel
to conferences and to global and regional events.       UNFPA has supported development and
distribution o f national guidelines for contraceptive services to field staff, and condom
procurement. UNDP provided US$200,000 to strengthen the capacity o f the MSTFs inplanning
and managingDzongkhag-based HIV prevention and advocacy activities.

RGOB recognizes that at this epidemiological juncture, the country has a unique opportunity to
act vigorously, tackling the abovementioned challenges, and effectively scaling up and
accelerating the national response to ensure that the level o f infection inthe country remains low.

Key Challenges. The national response o f RGOB has been commendable, especially given the
low level o f HIV prevalence. However, Bhutan faces several issues and challenges inscaling up
the HIV/AIDS response: (i) to date have been hampered by lack o f a national HIV/AIDS
                                efforts
strategy; (ii) there i s inadequate information on the nature o f the epidemic and risk factors; (iii)
NACP has staffing shortages and weak capacity; (iv) the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS,
especially people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is widespread; (v) the response lies solely
within MOH. The following areas wouldneedto be addressed and supported:

(i)   Instituting a strategic response and focused prevention.          The project would support
development o f a national HIV/AIDS policy, strengthening o f existing institutions for
sustainability, and interventions that will have the highest impact inreducing the spread o f HIV.
In a low prevalence setting, such as Bhutan, this entails HIV/AIDS prevention interventions
reaching subpopulations that have higher rates o f sexual partner exchange or needle sharing, in
addition to targeting geographicalhot spots.

(ii) Gaining better understanding of the epidemic through improved strategic information
systems. There are little or no systematic data to accurately describe risk behaviors in the
Bhutanese population or assess the potential for HIV spread inthe country. A strong behavioral
and sero-surveillance system and monitoring and evaluation strategy will be financed by the
proposedproject.

(iii) Strengthening institutions. The proposed project would strengthen NACP in its technical
capacity (a program manager has been recruited), andput inplace a project management team to
facilitate NACP and other implementing agencies, which include divisions and programs within
MOH, NGOs/CBOs, dzongkhag authorities, and other line ministries.                Considering human
resource constraints in Bhutan, the project would institutionalize a well-planned and sustained
technical assistance andtrainingprogram.

(iv)   Reducing stigma. PLWHA in Bhutan report a high degree o f stigma associated with
HIV/AIDS and fear o f disclosure of their status. Care and support is limited with little or no
medical treatment available for HIV/AIDS related diagnoses. The project would support efforts
to reduce stigma and discrimination by: (i)     advocacy by opinion leaders to promote positive
attitudes towards PLWHA; (ii)      providing care and treatment for PLWHA, including ART; and
(iii)involvingPLWHA inpreventionprograms.




                                                  2

(v) Engaging in a multisectoral approach through involvement of key line ministries other
than health and civil society. The project would promote multisectoral involvement, among key
sectors, such as education, labor, and the armed forces, NGOs and community based
organizations, by setting aside funds for the multisectoral agencies to implement prevention
programs. In addition, the project would support and strengthen technical and implementation
capacity and increase advocacy to heighten high-level political commitment in other sectors as
well as at central andDzongkhag levels.

2. Rationalefor Bank involvement
The Bank is presently financing HIV/AIDS programs in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and
Pakistan through both IDA credit and grant. As one o f the largest financiers o f HIV/AIDS
control programs in the world, the Bank brings to the fore global and regional expertise and
experience in assisting Bhutan. In addition, the Bank's unique experience in Bhutan, from
analytical work and previous and ongoing investments inmany sectors (i.e. education), enriches
the project design and implementation strategy.        The Bank's involvement creates a higher
visibility politically and socially to the issue o f HIV/AIDS and underscores the cross-sectoral
development dimension o f HIV/AIDS. Moreover, the Bank emphasizes improving the national
program to produce the greatest impact, strengthening the capacity o f local institutions in the
public and private sectors, and providing regular and sustained implementation support required
for scaling up, enhancing, and accelerating Bhutan's fight against HIV/AIDS and STIs. Bank
assistance would represent the largest source o f funds for HIV/AIDS and STI prevention and
control inBhutan, complementing the financial and technical support from other donors.

3. Higherlevel objectivesto which the projectcontributes
The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Bhutan reflects the importance o f tackling
HIV at an early stage andnotes that the issue is highon the agenda ofthe government. Investing
inHIV andSTIpreventionnow inBhutanwill not only save lives andimprove the health status
o f the population, but also mitigate the potentially devastating impact o f AIDS on the economy
and the social fabric which would reverse any gains made in poverty alleviation and human
development. Recognizing this potential threat, RGOB has identified inits NinthFive Year Plan
preventing HIV/AIDS and STIs as a key health sector priority.         Inline with this Plan, the
proposed project's development objective of reduction in risk o f HIV and STI transmission
would contribute to an overall goal o f maintaining Bhutan's low level HIV/AIDS epidemic
status, as defined by HIV prevalence o f less than 5% among the highly vulnerable populations
andless than 1%amongthe general population.

3. Projectdevelopmentobjective andkey indicators
The project aims to reduce the risk o f HIV and STI transmission among the general population,
inparticular among groups engaginginHIV risk behaviors, such as unsafe sex. Key outcome
indicators include:
    0    Percentage o f persons reporting condom use with last non regular sex partner increased
         from <20% at project start to 60% among priority groups and 30% among the general
         population at project end.
    0    Percentage o f patients with selected STIs (Le. urethral discharge in men and genital
         ulcers) at health care facilities who are appropriately treated accordingly to the updated
         national guidelines increased from <20% inbaseline (Yr2) to 60% at project end.

4.   Projectcomponents
The project has four components. Component 1 - Prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs will
promote political and societal leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS, improve community
knowledge and attitudes about HIV prevention, promote risk-reducing behaviors amongst
priority groups, and increase access to condoms. Component 2 - Institutionalstrengthening
and buildingcapacity will enhance the ability o f national institutions to lead the fight against
HIV through training and technical assistance, and will strengthen laboratory and blood
transfusion services. Component 3 - Care, support and treatment of AIDS and STIs will
establish VCT services, strengthen management o f STIs and HIV/AIDS (comprehensive care
and treatment approach, including introduction of ART), and improve infection control and
waste management in health facilities. Component 4 - Strategic information for HIV/AIDS
and STIs will promote evidence based decision making by improving health information
management, strengthening operations research capacity, and instituting M&E and second
generation surveillance systems. Details are described inAnnex 4.

5. Lessonslearnedand reflectedinthe projectdesign
This project builds on key lessons learned in designing and implementing HIV/AIDS projects in
theregion and around the world:
    Key stakeholders from the public and private sectors, civil society, and donor agencies, have
    been involved in project preparation and will continue their involvement throughout
    implementationto ensure the country's ownership and reduce political and social risks.
    Emphasis i s placed on improving strategic information systems for planning and policy
    decisions, given the lack o f data on risk behaviors andconditions.
    Prevention o f HIV and STIs remains the core o f the response, inparticular at this early stage
    o f the epidemic. However, the increasing numbers o f PLWHA make the development and
    implementationo f a comprehensive care andtreatment package essential.
    Prevention and treatment are synergistic, both biologically (by reducing infectivity) and
    socially (by encouraging use of VCT services and increasing involvement o f PLWHA in
    advocacy). The BCC strategy will address the potential increase in risk behaviors due to a
   perceivedmitigation o f the effects of HIV infection as a result o f ART availability.
   Respecting rights, specifically in HIV/AIDS testing and treatment o f PLWHA and highly
   vulnerable populations, is a critical aspect o f prevention and control. This effort would
   prevent the epidemic from goingunderground, and thereby, hrther fueling the HIV spread.

6. Alternatives consideredand reasonsfor rejection
Instrument. Integrate HIV/AIDS into ongoing projects in Bhutan (e.g. education), rather than a
self-standing HIV/AIDSproject. HIV/AIDS is an emerging issue for Bhutan, bringingto the fore
new challenges-novel    approaches to behavioral change, addressing taboo topics, working with
marginalized communities, creating strategic partnerships with NGOs and the private sector-
which are best tackled by a self standing operation that would enable a quicker response, greater
attention, andhgher visibility.

Implementation Strategy. Rely exclusively on the government and the health ministry to
implement HIV prevention. Tackling HIV/AIDS requires a multisectoral approach and
involvement o f the private sector. Other ministries, such as armed forces and education, along
with civil society organizations (such as women's groups and the monk body), and the private
sector are better positioned to reach vulnerable populations. MOH would continue to play a
central role in coordinating and providing technical and management support, as well as
implementing components such as surveillance.

Create an independent agency tofight HIVAIDS. To ensure sustainability, the proposedproject
aims to bolster and strengthen existing institutions to scale up effective interventions. However,
the proposed project would put inplace an institutional arrangement that raises the visibility of
the program to ensure better coordination and management o f multisectoral agencies, increases
human resources interms o f staffing and capacity o f the national program, and strengthens MOH
planning,procurement and financial management capacity.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnershiparrangements:n/a

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements
Estimated Period o f Implementation: 5 years

Institutionalarrangement. The brief description o f roles and responsibilities o f the MOH and
other key implementing agencies are as follows (see Annex 6 for detailed description):

National HIV/AIDS Commission. The NHAC, chaired by the Minister o f Health, includes high
level policy makers from key ministries, representatives o f MSTFs and civil society (i.e.
National Women's Association o f Bhutan, Bhutanese national newspaper).                  N H A C i s
responsible for overseeing the overall national effort on HIV/AIDS and STI prevention, care and
treatment, formulating HIV/AIDS policies (Le. treatment and blood safety), coordinating the
response across the many sectors, and mobilizing resources, commitment and collaboration from
the public andprivate sectors, andcivil society.

Ministry of Health. MOH would continue to assume the technical leadership and management
of NACP and the proposed project. The Policy and PlanningDivision, Departments o f Public
Health, and Medical Services, through central andDzongkhag level medical staff, healthworkers
andtechnicians, would be responsible for implementingmany o f the activities across the project
components, in particular laboratory support, HIV/AIDS care and STI management. MOH
would provide technical support to other agencies-other line ministries and Dzongkhags-in
implementing HIV/AIDS and STIprevention.



                                                 5

National STD/AIDS Control Program (NACP), situated in the Ministry o f Health under the
Directorate o f Public Health, i s headedby a ProgramManager. NACP will (i)      provide technical
leadership on HIV/AIDS and support to all implementing agencies consistent with national
policy directives; (ii)monitor and ensure technical quality o f interventions; (iii)identify
HIV/AIDStraining needs and coordinate with Master Plan for HRD; and (iv) in collaboration
with PPD, manage HIV/AIDS information generated from surveillance and M&E system.
NACP will collaborate with and receive management and administrative support from the
Project Management Team.

Other Line Ministries. Reaching at risk populations with HIV and STIpreventionwould also be
achieved through involvement o f line ministries other than health. Each selected line ministry,
with a designated individual/team responsible for initiating and coordinating HIV/AIDS
activities, would prepare an annual workplan to be reviewed and approved by the PMT and
Technical Committee. Each Ministry would implement HIV/AIDS related activities consistent
with the components of the national program appropriate to their constituencies and target
populations. The workplan exercise would be incorporated into the existing RGOBplanningand
budgeting process. The first year would focus on developing the workplans with technical input
on best practices from MOH. Annex 6 and OM detail the annual workplan process, including
eligible expenditures, results monitoring, andreporting.

Dzongkhags.       The support at the Dzongkhag level would be two-fold: (i)facilitating the
implementation o f centrally managed activities (i.e. surveillance, training) and (ii) Dzongkhag
initiated and managed activities. Dzongkhags would be responsible for developing an annual
workplan for Dzongkhag-managed activities, which would be submitted to and approved by
PMT and the Technical Committee, to ensure that proposed activities are in line with national
objectives, are o f sound quality, and follow procedures and eligible expenditures that are detailed
inthe OM. The Dzongkhagworkplan wouldconsist oftwo parts-oneto beimplementedbythe
Dzongkhaghealth authorities and the other by MSTF. The Dzongkhag Medical Officer (DMO),
who presently is the leading health official at the dzongkhag level, would be responsible for
managing and coordinating prevention activities through a network of outreach workerdpeer
educators andhealth workers.

Multisectoral Task Force. MSTFs, chaired by the Dzongdag (Governor), are set up to (i)
oversee prevention activities at the Dzongkhag level; and (ii)    undertake advocacy to mobilize
local authorities and civil society to increase support for HIV/AIDS prevention and to reduce
stigma. The task forces include Dzongkhag health authorities and representatives from other
ministries, such as education, and armed forces, as well as opinion leaders and key NGOs/CBOs
within the Dzongkhags. MSTFwouldreceive funds through the Dzongkhag.

NGOdCBOs andprivate sector. InBhutan, emerging local NGOs and CBOs, although limited
at the present time, provide an opportunity for the program to expand access to prevention
services to the grassroots level, including highly vulnerable populations.       The role o f both
NGOs/CBOs and the private sector in the project would be two-fold: (i)     undertaking prevention
activities for priority populations; and (ii)
                                            engaging in advocacy among target groups, including
civil society, the private firms andbusiness leaders.




                                                  6

Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers: Consultants, contractors, and suppliers, including
NGOs/CBOs and private organizations, operating across the country and the region may be
contracted to support program activities.

Project Management. With an objective of building in-house capacity o f MOH, a Project
Management Team will be established to provide management and administrative support to
implementing agencies. Situated in the Secretariat and under the overall responsibility o f the
Secretary MOH, the PMT would have the following role and responsibilities: (i)      coordinate and
manage implementation o f project activities with IAs (e.g., MOH departments and divisions,
other sectors, Dzongkags, MSTFs, and NGOs); (ii)        regularly supervise, monitor, evaluate, and
report on project activities to relevant government agencies and the Bank; (iii)  oversee financial
management and overall procurement o f goods, civil works, and consultancies; and (iv) liaise
with the Bank on a regular basis regarding all project-related activities, including planning and
preparation of missions.

Technical Committee: The Technical Committee would ensure that preparation and
implementationbyNACP, PMT staff, and consultants i s inconformity with the objectives o f the
project and is carried out according to the terms o f reference for specific components/activities.
The Technical Committee will be chaired by the Director o f the Department o f Public Health and
would comprise staff from PMT, PPD, andNACP, and invitees from representatives o f relevant
institutions andprograms, including donors andUNagencies.

Implementation mechanisms. The project would employ three types o f implementation
mechanisms: workplans, subprojects, and contracts. The type o f implementing agency and type
o f intervention would determine the mechanisms (see Annex 6 for further details).

Workplan. MOH divisions and programs, other line ministries, Dzongkhag-level health
authorities, and MSTFs would prepare an annual workplan for project activities, following the
existing annual planning and budgeting mechanism (determined by MOF) and according to the
cycle and criteria established in the OM. Funds would be disbursed in tranches, based on
utilization certificates andthe results achieved.

Subprojects. NGOs/CBOs andprivate organizations would be eligible for small grants, awarded
as subprojects, primarily to undertake HIV/AIDS prevention activities. Interested organizations
would develop a proposal and financing plan for a subproject and, upon approval by PMT and
the Technical Committee according to selection criteria detailed in the OM, would sign a
innovative grant agreement (IGA) with the Ministry o f Health. Funds would be disbursed in
tranches, based on utilization certificates and reporting on progress andresults.

Contracting. I A s (e.g., suppliers, contractors, private firms) would be recruited and hiredbased
on IDA Guidelines and Standard Bidding Documents and, upon selection, I A s would sign a
contract with the Ministry o f Health.      Payment would then be released upon meeting the
specified indicators and deliverables.

Operational Manual. The OM consists o f project implementation plan (activities, indicators,
costs, time frame for implementation, and responsible agency), implementation strategies for
each subcomponent, financial management and procurement guidelines, monitoring and


                                                  7

evaluation strategy, TORS for implementing agencies and PMT, and training plan. It will
increase transparency and reduce implementation delays, as roles and responsibilities,
mechanisms, schedules, and reporting arrangements are clearly described. In addition, it will
facilitate review/supervision o f the project by the Bank. The OM was reviewed and revised at
appraisal and found to be in satisfactory condition. The OM will be updated as needed with
approval from MOH and clearance from IDA.

3.      Monitoring and evaluationof outcomedresults
The fourth component o f the project would support establishing a Monitoring and Evaluation
System for the national program for the measurement of national level indicators described inthe
Results Framework and M&E o f subcomponents o f the project (Annex 3).                   PMT, in
collaboration with PPD, with technical inputs from Technical Committee, including NACP, will
be responsible for managingthe overall M&Eo f the project. M&E strategies are as follows:

(i)   General population surveys: Three national surveys of the general population will be
undertaken to provide data on key project indicators and to provide information on knowledge o f
HN/AIDS/STIs and risk behaviors for use in the development and assessment o f program
activities. The first survey, in Year 1 o f the project, will also provide information required for
designing behavioral surveillance and will include transport workers and armed forces personnel
to provide a baseline for project evaluation. A midline survey will be conducted in Year 3 for
measurement of progress and revision o f program strategies. Finally, an endline survey (Year 5)
will measure overall progress in achieving key project indicators. Wherever possible, these
surveys would be coordinatedwith other national level surveys (e.g. Annual Health Surveys).

(ii) Second Generation Surveillance: The national HIV and STI surveillance will be upgraded
to adopt the second generation surveillance approach. This will provide both behavioral and
serological (HN and STI) data for the general population and priority groups. The Behavioral
Sentinel Surveillance (BSS) will provide national level data on key indicators inpriority groups.

(iii) Health Facility Surveys: Two health facility surveys will be carried out to measure health
care provider knowledge and practice o f STI and HIV/AIDS clinical management. The first
survey will be carried out in Year 2 after training health care providers in the newly developed
HIV management guidelines and the revised STI management guidelines. The health facility
survey will be repeated in Year 4 after continuing supervision and training o f additional
providers. The final survey should be nationally representative to measure overall impact o f the
project. Other aspects o f the project such as STI drug supply and pharmacists' STI knowledge
may be assessedduringthe health facility surveys.

wouldTargeted
(iv)             assessments: Evaluation o f the effectiveness o f specific intervention activities
        be carried out in targeted assessments using qualitative and quantitative techniques. The
activities to be evaluated and the timeframe will be determined during detailed project planning
and ongoing project monitoring. Evaluation may be indicated to assess innovative approaches,
when routine monitoring shows unexpected results, or when evaluating the appropriateness of
scaling up projects.

(v) Information systems: Enhancement of the BhutanHealth Management Information System
(BHMIS) and introduction of the Laboratory Information System (LIS) through the Public


                                                  8

Health Laboratory will provide data for measurement o f key project indicators. In addition,
information from the BHMIS will include case reporting o f STIs by facility and the LIS will
provide information on HIV and syphilis screening o f blood donors, antenatal syphilis screening,
andHIVrates at VCT centers.

(vi) PBM tool andprogress reports: The Planning, Budgeting and Monitoring (PBM) tool has
been developed by M O H (i)        to facilitate planning, budgeting and monitoring by M o H officers;
(ii) aidincompilationofwork-plansandbudgetsforPPDandAFD,respectively; (iii)link
    to                                                                                                 to
the budget to each individual activity that appears inthe work-plan; and (iv) to link financial and
physical monitoring activities.        The proposed project would strengthen this system. Output
indicators and progress o f program activities would be monitored by PBM tool and by project
progress reports on an annual and semi-annual basis.

RGOBSustainabilitystrong commitment to fightingHIV/AIDS. It responded to the HIV/AIDS
4.
          has indicated
threat early, recognizing the dangers o f inaction that frequently accompany a low prevalence
setting. The National Assembly has addressed HIV/AIDS issues during each of the past four
sessions. The Ninth Five-Year Plan has also identified HIV/AIDS and STD prevention and
control as one o f the country's most important programs, inthe context o f addressing emerging
health issues for the Bhutanese population and promoting the health o f women and adolescents.
In addition, Her Majesty Queen Ashi Sangay Choden Wangchuck is the UNFPA Goodwill
Ambassador and an outspoken advocate for HIV/AIDS and STI prevention.                             A National
HIV/AIDS Commission, with expanded membership to include civil society and the private
sector, has been reconstituted to strengthen multisectoral involvement. Although commitment
from sectors other than health and at the Dzongkhag level varies, the project would support
advocacy andtraining to increase awareness o f HIV/AIDS as a multisectoral, development issue.

To ensure implementation sustainability, the project design and strategy utilizes and builds the
capacity o f existing institutions to manage and implement the project and relies on leadership
andchampions withinMOH. Although MOHis expected to take leadership inHIV/AIDS, given
that the epidemic remains invisible to many other sectors, the project would strengthen
engagement o f other line ministries and civil society, cultivating leadership from all sectors.

5.       Critical risks and possible controversialaspects
Many key agencies and organizations participated during project preparation, including the
media, religious body, youth groups, and women's associations. Unlike many of other countries,
Bhutan appears to be more open to discussing sexual behaviors and sexuality.                      To mitigate
possible resistance to the efforts o f the National AIDS program, the project would continue to
involve key stakeholders inimplementation and review of project activities and progress. Risks
relatedto political, social, and implementation factors are highlighted below.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1.      Economic and financial analyses
The economic analysis addressed (i)whether the HIV/AIDS prevention project would be a
worthwhile investment, as shown by a positive Net Present Value (NPV), (ii) economic        the
justification for government financing (subsidization) o f the project, and (iii)        poverty aspects.
Despite limited data, information from the Risk & Vulnerability study and from key informants
was used to builda three-scenario model (base case, medium & worst case) to predict the rate o f
new infections for the economic analysis. RGOB counterparts considered the medium case
scenario to be the most appropriate for Bhutan. Details o f the model are inAnnex 9.

(i)TheestimatedNPVoftheprojectwaspositive($20.2million)forthemediumcasescenario,
usinga 10%discount rate and extending project benefits and costs until2022 (to allow 15 years
of ART) as benefits will continue to accrue after the end o f Bank funding. Under the medium
case scenario, the project was estimated to prevent about 13,700 infections until 2022, which
represents a 60% reduction in infections estimated without the project. The NPV for the base
case scenario was negative (-$3.1 million), but represented a conservative analysis based only on
the number o f seropositive people identified in2004 as index cases and a low estimate o f sexual
activity. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken using the medium case scenario and varying the
condom coverage assumptions. The NPV was robust, turning negative at a 68% reduction inthe
project's target condom use prevalence. ART was addressed by adding the cost o f the ART
component, projecteduntil2022, to total costs without including the benefits from ART. This is
a conservative analysis. Based on these analyses (further details in Annex 9), it was concluded
that the NPV for the project was likely to be positive.

(ii)The economicjustification for government financing ofthe HIVproject depends upon
whether the.project would be financed by the private sector in the absence o f government
financing. As the private sector in Bhutan is small and lacks the incentives and capacity to
address HIV o f its own accord, there i s no alternative to government leadership in financing and
controlling the epidemic. It i s possible that some private financing may become available inthe
future for prevention activities from firms concerned about protecting employees against HIV.
However, the government will always have the critical role in addressing most priority groups
(CSWs, youth) andinproviding treatment through the national health system.

(iii)WhilethereisnoevidencetosuggestthatHIV/AIDSinfectionratesaredisproportionately
higher for the poor, clearly poor households are least able to bear the costs o f care and treatment
or the loss o fincome resulting from sickness and death.

2.       Technical
The proposed project adheres to internationally accepted best practices for HIV/AIDS response
in low prevalence settings, as advanced by UNAIDS, WHO, and other technical and research
experts. The main thrust o f the project lies with interventions that have been proven cost
effective inpreventing the spread o f HIV, providing care and support for PLWHA, and reducing
stigma and discrimination against PLWHA. The project would support interventions that include
behavioral change communications, condom social marketing, targeted advocacy for opinion
leaders, voluntary counseling and testing, improvement o f STI management (inaccordance with
WHO guidelines), prevention o f mother-to-child transmission, and promotion of safe blood
through expansion o f voluntary donor recruitment and rational use o f blood and blood products.
Since the risk o f HIV transmission in Bhutan i s largely attributable to casual sex encounters,
prevention activities will focus largely on populations with highrates o f casual sex (e.g. mobile
populations, armed forces) and specific geographical locations (e.g. bars, restaurants, vegetable
markets, festivals) identified as "hotspots" where casual sex is most likely to occur.

The project also places great emphasis on improving the information base upon which
HIV/AIDS policy andprogrammatic decisions are made. Second generation surveillance systems
- which entail upgradingof sero-surveillance and introduction of behavioral surveillance -
would be developed. In addition, general population surveys, health facility surveys, routine
monitoring ofproject activities (inputs and outputs) through M I S (modification o f existing health
M I S and addition o f laboratory information system), and targeted assessments would assess the
impact o f interventions. While prevention is the crux o f the project, it strengthens the
institutional capacity to provide AIDS care through better screening and diagnostic services,
improving counseling infrastructure, and training o f medical and health personnel in managing
HIVIAIDS cases, including provision o f ART.

3.       Fiduciary
Financial Management. The project will have a satisfactory financial management system.
Financial management and disbursement arrangements have been streamlined, to the extent
possible, to use the existing government system. The Administration and Finance Division
(AFD) in MOH, has experience in implementing Bank financed projects when Health and
Education were under the same ministry. The PMT inMOH will have the overall responsibility
for execution and financial management o f the project.

All project disbursements will follow the traditional transaction based system. Project grant
hnds will be deposited into the special accounts to be opened inthe Royal Monetary Authority
and will be operated according to terms and conditions acceptable to the IDA by DADM.
Disbursements from the special accounts will be following the normal government procedure for
making payments, as described in the Financial and Accounting Manual. Project accounts will
be kept on a cash basis o f accounting. Annual external auditing of project accounts will be
carried out by the Royal Audit Authority, which i s the supreme audit institution in Bhutan.
Annex 13 details the TORS,which have been agreed to RAA and Internal Audit.

Staffing. To manage the Financial Management o f the project, RGOB has approved the
positions of Finance Officer (FO) and Accountant for PMT. The Accountant will be identified
by negotiations and appointed in May 2004. FO will be identified by December 2004 upon
return o f a batch o f Finance officers from overseas training and posted in January 2005. As an
interimmeasure, AFD DCFO would assume the responsibilities of the project FO. RGOB has
agreed that an adequately qualified and experienced Finance Officer will be available on a full-
time basis, throughout the entire implementation period o f the project. Prior to any transfer o f
such dedicated personnel, RGoB will ensure that there i s sufficient transitional time for the
succeeding candidate to be trained on-the-job. The training plan for FO and accountant, as well
as other accounting staff involved inimplementation o f the project, has been incorporated inthe
Project Implementation Plan and will be included in the NFS Annual Human Resource
Development Plan, following RGOB's policy.

Fund Flow. Project funds will be deposited by IDA into a Special Account inDollars (SA), to
be opened at the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA). SA will be used for all expenditures of the
project and managed by Department of Aid and Debt Management (DADM) in the Ministryo f
Finance. On authorization from DADM, the RMA will convert the requested dollar amount to
local currency and transfer the same into a Government Budget Fund Account (GBFA) in the
Bank o f Bhutan (BOB)for Department o f Budget and Accounts (DBA). With clearance from
DADM, DBA will issue a Project Letter of Credit (PLC) in favor of Accounting and Finance
Department (AFD) o f MOH. A PLC is DBA's authorization to the bank to honor payment
instructions from AFD up to the specified limit. PLC will serve the implementing agencies with
MOH and other line Ministries, as well as NGOs, whereas General Letter o f Credit (the existing
Dzongkhag Account) will be used for funds released to the Dzongkhags. Annex 7 includes fund
flowheporting chart, as well as fund flowh-eportingmechanisms for each implementing agency.

Financial Monitoring Reports. Consolidated financial and physical progress reports will be
generated by PMT on a quarterly basis, with input from DBA (actual expenditure data), from
PPD (for physical progress o f activities implemented by MOH and regrouping o f expenditures
into categories defined in the DGA), and from Dzongkhags and other line ministries (physical
progress data). FMRs are attached inAnnex 14.

Retroactive Financing. Payments made for expenditure before the date o f the Grant Agreement
but after January 1, 2004, inrespect o f categories 1through 6, can be claimed under the grant
subject to an aggregate maximumo f US$500,000.

Procurement. The Grant will finance goods, civil works, consultant services, and training.
Procurement will be in accordance with IDA guidelines for "Procurement under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits", January 1995 (revised in January and August 1996, September 1997, and
January 1999); as well as those for "Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers ", January 1997 (revised September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002).

The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents have been used as a basis for preparation o f the
package specific biddingand Request for Proposal documents. The project procurement plan for
the project, a detailed 18 monthprocurement plan, andthe majority o f the biddingdocuments are
complete.    IDA has provided no objection to the procurement plans, the TORS for major
consultancies, and technical specifications for goods. The MOH will submit the two remaining


                                                 13

bidding documents, for procurement o f ARV drugs and equipment and goods for infection
control andhealth care waste management.

Procurement will be carried out by existing staff o f Drugs, Vaccines, Equipment Division
(DVED) for goods, Health Infiastructure Development Project (HIDP) for works, and PPD for
consultancies. The Ministry will designate a focal person within each division who would be
responsible for carrying out the procurement. Duringthe first year, the Project Coordinator will
assume the responsibility o f the procurement officer, and assist in coordinating all the
procurement activities andcommunicatingwith the Bank. The effectiveness o f this arrangement
will be reviewed and assessedafter the first year ofproject implementation.

A capacity assessment ofMOHto implementprocurementactions for the project was carried out
during project preparation.    The issues/ risks concerning the procurement component for
implementation o f the project indicate the need for training o f the staff o f DVED, PPD, HIDP,
andAFD to apprise them about the procedures o fprocurements underIDA-financedProjects.

Social. The social assessment included (1) a study o f risk behaviors and vulnerability and (2)
stigma, discrimination and needs of PLWHA. In addition, political and social risks associated
with this project were identified during consultations with key stakeholders during project
preparation-MOH,      line ministries, MSTFs, and civil society.      Assessment of the current
situation of HIV risk and vulnerability of priority groups and needs of PLWHA:Five population
subgroups previously identified as being vulnerable to HIV were investigated: commercial sex
workers (CSW), long distance drivers, migrant workers, armed forces, and drugusers. The study
found that commercial sex i s not yet an organized industry inBhutan. However, almost all male
respondents inthe study reported multiple non-commercial sexual partners. Identified "hotspots"
for casual sex include vegetable markets, labor camps, bars and restaurants intown and along the
highway, and festivals.    Drug users reported sharing needles and syringes but fewer sexual
partners than other priority groups. The number o f injecting drug users in Bhutan i s believed to
be low, although drug use offences in Thimphu are increasing steadily. Several factors were
identified as constraining HIV/AIDS prevention among vulnerable groups. These are (1)
inadequate knowledge and misconceptions regarding HIV/AIDS, (2) lack of personal risk
perception and interest inpracticing safer sex owing to low public visibility o f AIDS cases, (3)
lack o f knowledge about importance/use o f condoms, (4) low coverage o f STI/HIV/AIDS
prevention programs. The project would tackle these obstacles through the national prevention
strategy.   Participatory Approach:    To foster a sense o f ownership and commitment, key
stakeholder representatives from public and private sector, civil society, and donor agencies
actively participated in project preparation workshops. Results from a study o f PLWHA
contributed directly to designing interventions for PLWHA. The participatory approach will be
adopted throughout project implementation.

4. Environment
The RGOB, with the cooperation and support o f DANIDA, i s in process o f developing a
National Infection Control and Healthcare Waste Management Program, based on an assessment
o f a representative sample o f health facilities and stakeholder consultations. Under the
HIV/AIDS project, an Infection Control and Healthcare Waste Management Plan has been
developed, which will be a component o f the national program when finalized. This Plan
supports the HIV/AIDS prevention and control project by ensuringthat the transmission o f HIV,


                                                 14

and other nosocomial infections, inhealth facilities is minimized. The objective is to support two
main activities o f the overall program: (i)           establish an Infection Control and waste management
system for infectious waste that is a direct result o f project financed activities; (ii)                     establish a
system to treat and dispose o f healthcare waste from key facilities in an environmentally
acceptable manner.

Infection control procedures will be strengthened to improve occupational health conditions and
reduce disease transmission. Environmentally sound treatment and disposal o f health care waste
will be instituted in key facilities, along with good practices for management o f waste from
source of generation. The Planwill support the establishment o f appropriate institutions, training
of healthcare staff, procurement o f protective supplies and equipment and monitoring and
evaluation, IEC material on the correct handling and disposal o f health care waste will be
developed and disseminated in appropriate places to enhance awareness and knowledge o f
hazards of inadequate waste management and infection control practices. A National Infection
Control Committee (NICC) will be established inthe Ministryo f Health (MOH), Department of
Medical Services for implementation and monitoring & evaluation o f the national program. The
NICC will have the Director of Department of Medical Services as chairman and will include
senior officers from MOH (Public Health, Health Care, Drugs Vaccines Equipment Division,
Quality Assurance & Standard Division, Health Engineering, Institute of Traditional Medicine
Service, Royal Institute o f Health Services, senior medical and nursing staff), National
Environment Commission, and City Corporation. The NICC will set up working groups to work
on specific tasks as needed. At each o f the referral hospitals there will be Infection Control
Teams (ICT), comprising two link nurses and a doctor. At the BHUlevel, the Health Assistant
will be responsible for infection control and waste management activities and reporting to the
Dzongkhag ICT. The NICC and the ICTs at the respective health facilities will undertake
monitoring o f infection control and health care waste management.                           Standardized reporting
formats will be developed centrally and staff at Dzongkhag and central levels will be trained in
undertaking monitoring and reporting for the program.

Descriptionof HIV/AIDS and STIs SituationinBhutan

       HIV/AIDS has undoubtedly taken root inthe South Asia region and, as has been well
documented in many countries around the world, denial o f the epidemic can lead to
devastating economic and social consequences. It is critical, therefore, that countries act
vigorously to halt further HIV spread while the problem remains largely invisible.           In
Bhutan,HIV prevalence is currently low, withUNAIDS estimatingthat about 100Bhutanese
lived with HIV/AIDS at the end o f 2001, which amounts to a prevalence rate o f less than
0.01%. However, there are mounting concerns, because of an increasing rate in detection o f
HIVcases. Themajority oftheseinfectionswere acquired throughunprotectedsex.

       The estimated low prevalence and small number of reported cases indicate that
Bhutan is at an early stage o f the epidemic. However, there are several risk factors and
conditions in the country that could help fuel further spread o f the virus. Bhutan i s a
landlocked country, situated in the Himalayas bordering the Northeast states o f India, West
Bengal, and China.       The country's borders are porous, increasingly so, with thriving
commerce and trade.        Neighboring northeastern Indian states and Nepal are already
experiencing generalized or concentrated epidemics.            InManipur, 56% of injecting drug
users, 10.5% o f STD clinic attendees, and already 1.8% o f women attending antenatal clinics
are infected with HIV. In Nepal, 50% o f injecting drug users and 36% o f sex workers are
infected with HIV. Other states nearby, such as Sikkim and Meghalaya, however, maintain a
relatively low prevalence. A high level o f mobility across these borders indicates an urgent
need for sharinginformationand collaboration on HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.

          Inaddition, Bhutan has a significant level of sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
which increase the likelihood o f acquiring and transmitting HIV. Although the existing
sentinel surveillance system has problems with irregularities in sampling procedures and
reporting leading to inconsistency in findings, it serves as the best available data source for
tracking the progression o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Authoritative and consistent anecdotal
reports from clinicians also suggest that both gonorrhea and chlamydia are very common,
with cases frequently being reportedinthe southern regions as well as the central and eastern
regions. The presence of antibiotic resistant strains has beenreported, but not investigated.

         Furthermore, unpublished results from the national blood bank in Thimphu provide
evidence o f an elevated rate o f syphilis inBhutan.Among 4,206 replacement donors in2002,
2.4% tested positive for syphilis.              A small number o f observational studies have been
conducted with high-risk subpopulations in Bhutan but unfortunately this body o f research
suffers from incomplete reporting, making an assessment o f the data quality problematic.
One o f these studies (frequently cited inthe existent literature) reported an astonishingly high
72% prevalence o f syphilis among of 60 commercial sex workers tested positive for syphilis.
Results from the 2000 sentinel surveillance system reported that 17.7% o f the 79 members of
a high-risk subpopulation (primarily commercial sex workers) were positive for syphilis,
suggesting a more reasonable yet still elevated prevalence rate for this risk group.


Other FactorsThat CouldInfluenceEpidemicGrowth

         It is important to note that Bhutandoes not appear to conform to the typical pattern o f
the HNepidemic inAsia where the spread o fHIV i s driven by commercial sex and injecting
druguse, at least inits initial stages. Commercial sex work appears to be limitedinscale and
primarilyfocused inborder towns andinjecting druguse is also believedto be limited.

         Less rigid sexual norms and relations.                Bhutanese society i s perceived to have less
stringent norms and views about sexuality for both men and women; multiple concurrent
relationships and casual sexual encounters are presumed to be common among the general
population, as well as premarital sex as virginity i s not overly emphasized. Casual sex is
reported to be prevalent among both males and females, suggesting that a large-scale
epidemic i s possible, depending on the frequency and degree o f sexual mixing inthe country.
Results from a risk and vulnerability stud? carried out during project preparation suggest
that non-paid casual sex with strangers and other non-regular partners i s common among
long distance drivers, armed forces, migrantworkers and drug users. These behaviors tend to
occur inspecific geographical locations (e.g. bars, restaurants, vegetable markets) and events
(e.g. festivals).     Respondents in the study also identified several additional risk groups,
including businessmen and civil servants who travel frequently; village girls who live near
highways, engage in seasonal work or travel to sell farm produce; girldwomen employed as


 The riskand vulnerability studyusedqualitative methods and interviewed key informants and member o f five
priority groups identified prior to the data collection as follows: long distance drivers, migrant workers,
commercial sex workers, drug users and armed forces.

temporary help in offices, singers inbars, or maids; and schoolgirls and unemployed youth.
Although this initial study begins to define risk groups, the nature of casual sex behaviors
requires more extensive examination (Le., who i s more likely to engage in casual sex, where
i s this prevalent (geographical variation-urbdrural,       westedeastern regions; and what
conditions and situations promote these behaviors (e.g, festivals, events, and travel).
Understanding the overlapping o f sexual behaviors andnetworks-i.e.,       buyingsex inBhutan
or elsewhere and engaging in multiple partners, in casual and primary partnerships-would
provide critical information for improving HIV and STI prevention interventions.

        Low condom use. N o information i s available on the use o f condoms among high-
risk subpopulations, such as sex workers and clients, or on the demand for condoms among
youth and the adult population.       As seen elsewhere, family planning data indicate low
condom use among contraceptive users. The contraceptive prevalence rate inBhutan in2000
is 30.7%; fertility level i s high, with an average o f 4.7 children per woman. The Annual
Health Bulletin 2000 indicates that the 13% o f contraceptive users are currently using
condoms. To date no studies have been carried out on people's attitudes towards condoms
and it can be assumed that generally there is a big gap between knowledge and use. With
regard to condom use, accessibility i s a factor since they are available only at health facilities
andsome extent with village healthworkers.

        HighMobilitv. Mobility associated withwork oftenresults inanunbalancedratio of
women to men, leading to sharing o f sex partners, engaging in sex work, and conditions o f
lesser social control and stronger peer influences.         There are four groups o f mobile
populations that have captured the attention o f HIV prevention efforts: (i)those traveling
abroad for studies or business; (ii) armed forces-army,     Royal Body Guard, and Police; (iii)
migrant workers from neighboring countries; and (iv) mobile professionals, such as truck
drivers and traders.

        Youthful population. Global attention has increased markedly on youth, with a rise in
HIV infection and AIDS among those under the age of 25, and in documentation of their
heightened vulnerability.      Young people in the world often lack information about
HIV/AIDSandharbor a great number o f misconceptions, particularly among girls. It is also
at this age when experimentation with drugs and alcohol begins. The vulnerability o f girls
also i s increased, because of sexual mixing (when older men have sex with young girls),
prostitution andtrafficking.

        About 45% o f Bhutan's population i s under 15 years o f age and about 79.2% is under
45 years (2000 national health survey).     A survey o f Punakha HighSchool students, which
was carried out by RIHS in 2002, found that, although awareness o f HIV was high,
misconceptions abound. Ninety six percent o f them knew that HIV is sexually transmitted
and 88.4% believed that condoms prevent HIV/AIDS. However, misconceptions persisted.
48% believed that HIV could be transmitted by mosquitoes, 69% believed that HIV/AIDS is
curable iftreated early, and 76% opined that people livingwith HIV/AIDS should be isolated
to the prevent spread of infection. Increasing knowledge and access to information through
youth friendly and youth driven services are necessary.

NationalResponse to HIV/AIDS

        RGOB acted early to initiate HIV/AIDS prevention activities inthe country. In1988,
five years before the first HIV infection was detected RGOB established a National
HIV/AIDS and STD Control Program (NAP). The program i s situated in the Ministry o f
Health, under the Department o f Public Health. Its responsibilities include development o f
strategies, planning, providing technical assistance, and monitoring o f implementation, which
takes place largely at the Dzongkhag level through the Dzongkhag medical officers and
health workers.     The program has two full time staff members, one overseeing infection
control and the other HIV/AIDS and STI prevention activities. Information, Education, and
Communications Health Division (IECH) and the Royal Institute o f Health Services (RIHS)
are key institutions inthe Ministrythat also are involved inHIV/AIDS prevention. IECHhas
developed education materials and planned communications activities for the program, and
RIHS has provided training to mid-level health workers, nurses, and lab technicians prior to
beginning their services. Recently, after a successful pilot inPhuntsoling, multisectoral task
forces have been established in all Dzongkhags with the mandate to carry out HIV/AIDS
awareness and prevention activities. With the establishment o f MSTFs, HIV/AIDS
prevention activities will be well decentralized with backup support from the national
program.

        External Support. Unlike many other aid-dependent countries, Bhutanhas a strong
sense o f development priorities and of the comparative advantage o f various donors. The
donors, including DANIDA and UNagencies such as WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, and UNFPA,
have worked closely with the government over the past decade insupporting the health sector
ingeneral, including HIVIAIDSpreventionandcontrol efforts.

        DANIDA was the one o f the largest financial supporter for Bhutan's National
HIV/AIDS program. Total budget for 2001-2002 was about US$290,000, o f which 60% (or
US$180,500) came from DANIDA. The funding level is expected to be about the same for
each year o f the 9thFive Year Plan, which totals about US$1.45 million for 2002 to 2007.
        WHOhasprovidedbothtechnicalandfinancialassistancetothecountry's HN/AIDS
prevention program that included short-term consultants in the areas o f sentinel surveillance
andhealth educationand finances to travel to conferences andto global andregional events.
        UNFPA-support     commenced in 1981. Total UNFPA contribution for the Third
Country Program (CP) (1988-2002) was US$4.9 million. Previous UNFPA support included
the development and distribution o f national standards and guidelines for contraceptive
services (counseling & prevention o f STIs) to field staff, while proposed UNFPA assistance

for its fourth five-year program (2002-2006) i s US$ 5.0 million and will focus on
reproductive health and among other things, prevention of STIs andHIV/AIDS.
       In2002, UNDP fimded a project of about US$200,000 to strengthen the capacity of
the Multisectoral Task Force (MSTF) in planning and managing Dzongkhag-based HIV
prevention and advocacy activities.

Component1:PreventionofHIV/AIDS and STIs ($2.00 million)

1.1Increasing access to and use of condoms. Responsible agency: Information and
    Communications Bureau. The feasibility o f condom social marketing will be assessed by
    consultancy firm in the first year o f the project and if recommended, a national condom
    social marketing program will be launched by a social marketing organization. Condom
    distribution through the public sector would be strengthened by procurement o f condoms to
    increase the available supply and improvement o f logistics and information systems and
   purchase o f vehicles to improve distribution to MOH facilities and all other implementing
    agencies, including NGOs. Condom demand generation will be generated through social
   marketing and the BCC strategy (see 1.2).

1.2 Increasing knowledge and commitment.               Responsible agency: Information and
    Communications Bureau. A comprehensive BCC strategy will be developed with
    international technical assistance and support (four months TA spread over the first 18
   months). The strategy will focus on boththe general population and identified priority groups
    and hotspots and will support interventions by MOH, other line ministries (see priority
   ministries listed in 1.3), private sector and NGOdCBOs with an aim to increase knowledge
    andpositive attitudes towards HIV/AIDS and STIprevention, promote safer sexual behaviors
    and VCT, and reduce stigma and discrimination for PLWHA. In addition, a high level
    advocacy component will be promoted through publicized statements and media events by
    government officials andthe royal family.

   Planned activities include media campaigns; advocacy events at national, Dzongkhag and
    geog levels; study tours for key leaders and implementers; training o f health workers,
   voluntary health workers, community leaders and peer educators; production o f provider
   reference and patient education materials for STI management; and production o f IEC
   materials and dissemination o f information through other channels such as festivals, sporting
    events, debates, etc.

1.3 Changingattitudes and behaviorsamongprioritygroups. Responsible agencies: Project
   Management Team andNational AIDS Control Program. This component will work through
   both the public sector (MOH including Dzongkhag hospital staff, other line ministries, and
   Dzongkhag administration) and the non-governmental sector (NGOs, CBOs, and private
   sector) to promote prevention activities at Dzongkhag level with identified priority groups
   (including sex workers, long distance drivers, migrant workers, armed forces, drugusers and
   out-of-school youth) and at "hotspots" where high risk sexual behavior frequently occurs
    (such as vegetable markets, bars and teashops along the highway, hotels and pool halls,
    festivals, etc).

   Eight priority ministries have been identified: (i) Ministry o f Education to work with youth
   in and out o f school; (ii)   Ministry o f Information and Communications (Road Safety &
   Transport Authority) to work with transport workers (including truck drivers); (iii) Ministry


                                                 29

o f Labor and Human Resources to work with formal and informal employees, including
migrant workers; (iv) Ministry o f Home and Cultural Affairs (Religion and Cultural Affairs
Department) to work with the religious community; (v) Ministryo f Trade and Industry (in
collaboration with Tourism Authority o f Bhutan and Bhutan Chamber o f Commerce) with
business communities including, among others, hotel and bar owners and pharmacies; (vi)
Ministryo f Works andHumanSettlement (Department of Roads) with nationalroadworker
labor force; (vii) Royal Civil Service Commission to work with civil servants; (viii) Armed
Forces with the personneland families o f the Army, Police, and Royal Body Guard as well as
health care workers for Armed Forces facilities. Each selected line ministry will designate a
focal person for HIV/AIDS activities.

Within MOH, implementing this strategy will rely on leadership at the Dzongkhag level.
Health authorities, presently led by the Dzongkhag Medical Officer, will be responsible for
managing and coordinating prevention activities by establishing a network o f outreach
workerdpeer educators to provide core prevention services, including condom distribution,
referral for VCT and STI treatment, and increased knowledge about HIV transmission and
prevention. The health authorities will also establish and manage an HIV care team to
provide treatment andmedical support to HIV positive individuals.

Multisectoral Task Force (MSTF) members will provide advocacy (e.g., reducing stigma),
political and social support for prevention activities, and community mobilization. Although
all twenty Dzongkhags will be involved in implementation, those with higher level o f risk
(Le. greater number o f "hotspots" and high risk populations), will receive greater resources
and management and technical input. In addition, monitoring by PMT and NACP will
ensure that Dzongkhags which can demonstrate results as plannedwill receive more funds.

NGOs and CBOs, such as women's and youth groups, would be encouraged to undertake
prevention activities for priority populations, to increase knowledge about prevention and
access to condoms and information about services on VCT and STI treatment. Mobilizing
PLWHAs and other priority groups to form CBOs would also be supported.

Innovative grants would be provided to line ministries, Dzongkhags, andNGOs/CBOs. Line
Ministries and Dzongkhags would prepare an annual workplan, and NGOs/CBOs a
subproject proposal, which would be reviewed and submitted to the Technical Committee by
PMT. Technical Committee will provide recommendations for approval by Ministry o f
Health. Support will be provided by NACP through orientation workshops and staff training,
as well as provision o f IEC materials and strategies as part o f the overall BCC strategy (see
1.2).

Component2: InstitutionalStrengtheningandBuildingCapacity($1.66 million)

2.1.Strengtheningand expandinglaboratoryservices and bloodbank. Responsible agency:
    Public Health Laboratory and Blood Bank, Jigme Dorji Wangchuk National Refierral
   Hospital. Laboratory services will be strengthened through staff training, procurement o f
    equipment and reagents, development and implementation o f a national quality assurance
   program, and development o f an information system. International training o f laboratory
   technicians will include three undergraduate degrees in medical technology (one per region)
   to upgrade capacity at regional and Dzongkhag hospital laboratories and four additional
    laboratory technicians will be trained in intemational short courses (3-6 months duration) in
   HIV/STI diagnostics, quality assurance, and therapeutic drug monitoring for ART. The
   HIV/STI testing capacity o f the PHL, two regional STI reference laboratories, and all
   Dzongkhag hospitals will be upgraded to improve performance o f existing diagnostic tests
   and expand the range o f tests available (e.g. CD4 counts, dark-field microscopy, HIV tests at
   VCT centers). Equipment and reagents will be procured and all laboratory technicians will be
   trained in newly introduced diagnostic tests, including a review o f procedures for existing
   STI andHIVtests. A national quality assurance program will be developed and implemented
   in all laboratories and VCT centers. A laboratory information system will be developed for
   collection o f laboratory data and monitoring o f quality assurance and implemented at the
   central and Dzongkhag levels (including training o f laboratory technicians and procurement
   o f computers) with assistance from an IT firm.

   The national blood bank will be strengthened through development o f a National Blood
    Safety Policy and standard operating procedures for blood transfusion services with technical
   assistance from WHO, purchase o f equipment and reagents, in-country training o f laboratory
   technicians and health care providers on safe blood transfusion and the rational use of blood
   and blood products, out-of-country training in quality management of blood transfusion
   services (diploma courses for 6-10 persons) and media campaigns and camps for voluntary
   blood donation.

2.2.Enhancing technical, management, and implementation capacity, strategic planning
   and policy development. Responsible agencies: Project Management Team and National
   AIDS Control Program. A National HIV/AIDS Policy will be developed and widely
   disseminated through a participatory process involving the National HIV/AIDS Commission,
   NACP, key ministries and stakeholders with technical assistance o f an international
   consultant. N H A C meetings and annual meetings of Dzongkhag level and central health
   authorities will be supported bythe project.

   The RGOB and NACP capacity for managing STI and HIV/AIDS control activities will be
   strengthened through study tours, regional and intemational workshops and conferences,
   procurement o f office equipment, computers and vehicles.

2.3.Establishmentof Project Management Team. Responsible agency: Project Management
   Team. The establishment o f a Project Management Team (PMT) will support the activities o f
   the NACP, other sections of MOH, other line ministries, and non-governmental partners in



                                                 31

    implementation, coordination and reporting of the project. Project financial support will
    include office rental, recurrent costs, vehicle, and office equipment.

Component3: Care, SupportandTreatment of AIDS and STIs ($1.0 million)

3.1 Increaseaccess to and use ofVCT. Responsible agency: National AIDS Control Program.
    The Ministryof Health will work inpartnership with institutions inthe region to strengthen
    VCT services, particularly indevelopment o f VCT implementation guidelines and intraining
    counselors. A VCT team, composed o f one medical doctor and two allied health personnel,
   will attend a six-month counselingtraining course inThailand and a regional consultant will
   visit Bhutan to work with the team in developing training curriculum and materials for
   Bhutanese counselors. The consultant and the VCT team will train 58 counselors in-country
    (two per hospital) who will provide counseling for VCT and PLWHA care and support. The
   VCT team will retum to the regional institution for a two month refresher course after
    gaining field experience inBhutan.

   Five VCT centers will be established in a phased manner. Initially, two freestanding centers
   will be constructed        (in Thimphu and Phuntsoling),          primarily targeting priority
    groups/hotspots. They will be conveniently located with late evening hours and offer a range
    o f services in addition to VCT including STI management, STb'HIV prevention education,
    counseling, condom distribution, and general medical services. Three additional centers will
   be developed (may include minor construction) within Dzongkhag hospitals. VCT will be
    available at the remaining Dzongkhag hospitals but no construction or refurbishing is
   planned at these sites. Demand for VCT will be generated though the BCC strategy and
    interventions with priority groups. Laboratory support and quality assurance will be provided
   through PHL.

3.2 Strengtheningmanagementof AIDS and opportunistic infections. Responsible agency:
   National AIDS Control Program. National guidelines will be developed for the management
    of HIV/AIDS and opportunistic infections, and will include guidelines for ART,
    opportunistic   infection prophylaxis       and treatment, prevention o f mother-to-child
   transmission, and a comprehensive care and support approach. The guidelines will be
    developed incollaboration with institutions inThailand and will be peer reviewed by a WHO
    3x5 team. A clinical team will be established in each dzongkhag based at the Dzongkhag
   hospital to provide comprehensive care and treatment. A regional consultant will be recruited
   to prepare training materials and provide the training for Dzongkhag-level clinical teams, in
   collaboration with MOH. CD4 cell count monitoring will be available in Thimphu at the
   Public Health Laboratory. Three pharmacists will attend a diploma course in Drug
   Information Systems and a drug information system for ART and 01drugs will be developed
    andimplemented.

3.3 Strengthening management of STIs. Responsible agencies: National AIDS Control
   Program and Quality Assurance and Standardization Division. The National Essential Drug
   Committee will review and guide the NACP in the planning and implementation o f the STI
   prevention and management program. The existing STI syndromic management guidelines
   will be revised in the first year to bring antibiotic treatments in line with international best

    Transmitted Infections and all first line drugs will be made readily available at all levels o f
    the health care system. Training manuals for health care providers, ANC staff and
    pharmacists will be developed, training will be conducted, and the RIHS curriculum on STI
    management will be reflect the new national guidelines. Inaddition, 20 clinicians will attend
    diploma courses inSTI management outside the country.

    Antibiotic susceptibility monitoring for N. gonorrhea will be undertaken at three regional
    sites every 1-2 years and Bhutanwill participate in the regional Gonococcal Antimicrobial
    Susceptibility Programme (GASP) coordinated by WHOBEAR. Antenatal syphilis screening
    will be implemented to the level o f Dzongkhag hospitals. At project mid-term, after
    experience with Dzongkhag level syphilis screening activities and availability o f additional
    prevalence data, the feasibility and cost-effectiveness o f extending the ANC syphilis
    screening to BHUlevel will be assessedand appropriate interventionsundertaken.

    The Quality Assurance and Standardization Division will be strengthened for regulation and
    testing o f HIV and STI drugs through a study tour to Ministry o f Public Health drug testing
    laboratory in Thailand, short-term trainings (3 persons) outside the country on registration
    andregulation o fHIVETIdrugs and QA for STI and infection control.

3.4 Universal precautions and Health Care Waste Management. Responsible agency:
    Department o f Medical Services. An Infection Control and Waste Management Plan has

    reporting, monitoring and evaluation. A strategy for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) will be
    considered at mid-term review once the national HIV/AIDS treatment policy and guidelines
    have been developed and antiretroviral procurement has been established.

    A National Infection Control Committee will be established in the Ministry o f Health
    (Department o f Medical Services) for implementation and monitoring & evaluation o f the
    National Infection Control and Healthcare Waste Management program and Infection
    Control Teams will be established for Dzongkhag-level implementation.


Component4: Strategic informationfor HIV/AIDS and STIs ($1.1million)

4.1 Enhancingmanagement informationsystems and use of IT. Responsible agency: Policy
    and PlanningDivision. IDA and RGOB agreed to utilize the existing Planning, Budgeting,
    and Monitoring (PBM) Tool, which has been initiated and developed by MOH, to provide
   physical and financial progress reports for the project. The P B M tool will be adjusted and
   updated to fulfill IDA requirements, and the link between the Ministry o f Finance BAS and
   the PBM tool will be strengthened. Training manuals will be developed and relevant staff

   will be trained in the use o f the PBM tool. To strength the IT infrastructure o f MOH,
   computers and software will be procured and LAN's will be installed.

   The existing BhutanHealth Management Information System (BHMIS) will be adjusted to
   improve its capacity to provide monitoring information required by the project and the
   changes will be reflected in updated software, reporting forms, user manuals and reports.
   Training materials will be developed for improving evidence-based decision-making and
   policy review at all levels o f the healthcare system, and key planners will be trained.

4.2 Strengthened operational research capacity and use of research data. Responsible
   agencies: Policy and Planning Department (Health Research Section) and Indigenous and
   Traditional Medicine Service. To strengthen the research capacity o f MOH, a ten-day course
   on health services research methodology for 4 key MOH research staff will be conducted
   with technical assistance from WHO to design and deliver the course. Four M O H staff will
   attend a short course in advanced methods of research in health outside the country.

                           Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements
               BHUTAN: HIV/AIDS and STI Preventionand ControlProject

Institutional arrangement. The main institution involved in overseeing and implementing
HIV/AIDS and STI prevention and care and its relatedpolicies i s the Ministryo f Health (Project
Management Team (PMT), the National AIDS Control Program, various divisions and programs
o f MOH, such as Public Health Laboratory, Research & Epidemiology Division, Information &
Communication Bureau, Medical Services Department), other line ministries, civil society
including NGOs and CBOs, and private for-profit sector.       Their roles and responsibilities are
described below:

National HZV/AZDS Commission. In February 2004, the Council o f Ministers called for
revitalization o f the National HIV/AIDS Commission (formerly Committee).           The NHAC,
chaired by the Minister o f Health, includes members from various key ministries, representing
Labor, Home Affairs, Finance, Civil Service, Armed Forces, Education, as well as
representatives from MSTFs and civil society (i.e. National Women's Association o f Bhutan,
and Kuensel (Bhutanese newspaper). The project would buildthe capacity o f NHAC to oversee
the overall national effort on HIV/AIDS and STI prevention, care and treatment, formulate
policies, coordinating the national response, and mobilizing resources, commitment and
collaboration from the public andprivate sectors, and civil society.

Ministry of Health. M O H would continue to assume the technical leadership and management
of NACP and the proposed project. The Policy and Planning Division, the Departments o f
Public Health, and Medical Services, through central and Dzongkhag level medical staff, health
workers and technicians, would be responsible for implementingmany o f the activities across the
project components, inparticular laboratory support, HIV/AIDS care and STImanagement.

National STD/AIDSControl Program, situated inthe Ministryo fHealth under the Directorate o f
Public Health, is headed by a Program Manager. NACP will (i)      provide technical leadership on
HIV/AIDS and support to all implementing agencies consistent with national policy directives;
(ii) andensuretechnicalqualityofinterventions;(iii) HIV/AIDStrainingneeds
    monitor                                                     identify
and coordinate with Master Plan for HRD; and (iv) in collaboration with PPD, manage
HIV/AIDS information generated from surveillance and M&E system. NACP will collaborate
with andreceivemanagement and administrative support from the Project Management Team.

Other Line Ministries. Reaching at riskpopulations with HIV and STI preventionwould also be
achieved through involvement o f line ministries other than health. Eight priority ministries have
been identified: (i) Ministryo f Education to work with youth inandout o f school; (ii)  Ministry
of Information and Communications (Road Safety & Transport Authority) to work with transport
workers (including truck drivers); (iii)Ministry of Labor and Human Resources to work with
formal and informal employees, including migrant workers; (iv) Ministry o f Home and Cultural
Affairs (Religion and Cultural Affairs Department) to work with the religious community; (v)
Ministry o f Trade and Industry (in collaboration with Tourism Authority o f Bhutan and Bhutan
Chamber o f Commerce) with business communities including, among others, hotel and bar
owners and pharmacies; (vi) Ministry o f Works and Human Settlement (Department o f Roads)
with national road worker labor force; (vii) Royal Civil Service Commission to work with civil



                                               36

servants; (viii) Armed Forces with the personnel and families o f the Army, Police, and Royal
Body Guard as well as health care workers for Armed Forces facilities.

Each selected line ministry, with a designated individualheam responsible for initiating and
coordinating HIV/AIDS activities, would prepare an annual workplan to be reviewed and
approved by the PMT and Technical Committee. Each Ministry would implement HIV/AIDS
related activities consistent with the components o f the national program appropriate to their
constituencies and target populations. The workplan exercise would be incorporated into the
existing RGOB planning and budgeting process. The first year would focus on developing the
workplans with technical input on best practices from MOH. The OM and Annex 6 detail the
annual workplan process, includingeligible expenditures, results monitoring, and reporting.

Dzongkhags. The support at the Dzongkhag level would be two-fold: (i)facilitating the
implementation of centrally managed activities (e.g. surveillance, training); and (ii) Dzongkhag
initiated and managed activities. Dzongkhags would be responsible for developing an annual
workplan for Dzongkhag managed activities, which would be submitted to and approved by
PMT and the Technical Committee, including NACP, to ensure that proposed activities are in
line with national objectives, are o f sound quality, and follow procedures and eligible
expenditures that are detailed inthe OM.

The Dzongkhag workplan would consist o f two parts-oneto be implemented by the Dzongkhag
health authorities and the other by MSTF. The Dzongkhag Medical Officer (DMO), who
presently i s the leadinghealth official at the dzongkhag level, would be responsible for managing
andcoordinating prevention activities through anetwork o f outreach workerdpeer educators and
healthworkers.

Multisectoral Task Force. MSTFs, chaired by the Dzongdag (Governor), are set up to (i)
oversee prevention activities at the Dzongkhag level; and (ii)    undertake advocacy to mobilize
local authorities and civil society to increase support for HIV/AIDS prevention and to reduce
stigma. The task forces include Dzongkhag health authorities and representatives from other
ministries, such as education, and armed forces, as well as opinion leaders and key NGOs/CBOs
withinthe Dzongkhags. MSTF would receive funds through the Dzongkhag.

Although all twenty Dzongkhags would be involvedinimplementation, those with a higher level
o f risk would require greater resources, management and technical input. Monitoring of results
by PMT and NACP would ensure that the Dzongkhags which demonstrate results as planned
would receive more funds inthe future.

NGOs/CBOsandprivate sector. InBhutan, emerginglocal NGOs and CBOs, although limited
at the present time, provide an opportunity for the program to expand access to prevention
services to the grassroots level, including highly vulnerable populations. The role o f both
NGOdCBOs and the private sector in the project would be two-fold: (i)undertaking prevention
activities for priority populations; and (ii) engaging in advocacy among target groups, including
civil society, the private firms andbusiness leaders.

              Annex 7: FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements
               BHUTAN: HIV/AIDS andSTI PreventionandControlProject

CountryIssues

Overall, Bhutan has a record o f satisfactory financial management system in Bank financed
projects. Financial management system o f the government is prescribed in the Financial
Management Manual, dated 2001. RGOB plans to computerize the entire public sector
accounting and reporting system, using the Budget and Accounting System (BAS).
Implementation o f BAS has been initiated inall the ministries since July 1, 2003.

A country level issue that could have an impact on the project is the accounting and reporting
relationships between the dzongkhags and the central line ministries. The RGoB encourages
greater decentralization and increased ownership by the dzongkhags, and prefers that for
activities to be carried out by them, budget appropriations and expenditures are shown in the
records of the dzongkhags, rather than in the records o f central line ministries. Ln several donor
fimded programs, although dzongkhags had executed a part of the program, budgeting and
recording o f such expenditure were in the books o f the central line ministries. This approach
diminished the ownership and motivation o f the dzongkhags as such programs were seen to be
driven by central line ministries. However, with funds directed to the dzongkhags has raised an
issue with respect to reporting. The dzongkhags are not accountable to the line ministries, and as
such, line ministries have had difficulties inreceiving accounts and reports on time.


StrengthsandWeaknesses

The project has the following strengths: (i) key implementingagency, i.e. Ministryof Health
                                             the
(MOH) Administration andFinance Division (AFD), has experience inmanaging Bank financed
projects while Health and Education were under one ministry; and (ii)    the use o f existing RGoB
system for accounting, reporting, and disbursing funds.

ImplementingAgency. MOHwill be the key implementing agency for the project. All project
activities, including expenditure undertaken by the MOH divisions and program, other line
ministries, and dzongkhags, will be coordinated by the PMT. Financial management and
disbursements for the project activities will be the responsibility o f the PMT inthe MOH.

Fund FZow. Project funds will be deposited by IDA into Special Account inDollars (SA), to be
opened at the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA). SA will be used for all expenditures o f the
project andmanaged by Dept o f Aid andDebt Management (DADM) inthe Ministry o f Finance.
On authorization from DADM, the RMA will convert the requested dollar amount to local
currency and transfer the same into a Government Budget FundAccount (GBFA) inthe Bank o f
Bhutan (BOB)for Department o f Budget and Accounts (DBA). With clearance from DADM,
DBA will issue a Project Letter o f Credit (PLC) in favor of AFD of MOH. A PLC is DBA's
authorization to the bank to honor payment instructions from AFD up to the specified limit. PLC
will serve the implementing agencies with MOH and other line Ministries, as well as NGOs,
whereas General Letter of Credit (the existing Dzongkhag Account) will be used for funds
released to the Dzongkhags.

The following details the funds flow mechanisms for each implementing agency:

Ministn, of Health (Divisions, departments and Droarams): PMT, through AFD, will request
DBA for release o f funds. DBA disburses the required fimd along with the counterpart funds
into the PLC account. Thereafier, the AFD will issue payment requests against the PLC for
meeting eligible project expenditure. Periodically, PMT through AFD will advise the DADMo f
the IDA share o f eligible project expenditure incurred for the period, for which PMT will prepare
withdrawal claims and submit applications to IDA through DADMfor replenishments.

Other Line Ministries: For expenditures to be incurred by other line ministries, PMT, through
AFD, will request DBA for release o f funds to PLC, based on the approved annual workplan.



                                                  46

Funds for Innovation Grant will be disbursed intranches by PMT to the line ministries. The line
ministries will provide utilization certificate to PMT on the use o f funds, as well as progress on
achieving the indicators defined inthe approved workplan.

Releases made to other Line Ministries under the Innovation Grant will be treated as final
expenditures for the purpose of replenishment from IDA. The next tranche o f fund release will
be made on receipt o f utilization certificate o fthe previous tranche.

NGOs/CBOs. A separate fund has been set aside to provide small grants to NGOdCBOs. PMT,
through AFD, will request DBA for release o f funds to PLC, based on approved proposals (IGA
will be signed between MOH and the NGO/CBOs).                Funds will be disbursed in tranches by
PMT. NGOs and CBOs will provide utilization certification to PMT on the use o f funds, as well
as progress on achieving the results defined inthe proposal.

Releases made to NGOs/CBOs under the Innovation Grant will be treated as final expenditures
for the purpose o f replenishment from IDA. The next tranche o f fund release will be made on
receipt o f utilization certificate o f the previous tranche.

Dzonnkhans: For expenditures to be incurred by the Dzongkhags (including MSTFs and
            -
Dzongkhag health authorities), DBA will make the budget release following the normal
government procedure, based on the request from the PMT through AFD. (The fbnd request
from PMT to DBA, rather than from Dzongkhag to DBA, would facilitate reportingo f financial
and physical progress o f HIV/AIDS prevention activities by the Dzongkhag to PMT). Funds
will be released to the general L C account maintained by the Dzongkhags. A separate budget
head and expenditure financing item code will be created for tracking expenditure under the sub-
component to be managed by Dzongkhags and funds will be released against these (DBA will
provide PMT a copy o f budget releases made to the Dzongkhags). In addition to reporting to
DBA following the normal RGoB reporting procedures, Dzongkhags will provide a utilization
certificate to PMT on the use o f these funds according to the approved annual workplan, as well
as progress on achieving the indicators identified inthe workplan.

Releases made to Dzongkhags implementing units under the Innovation Grant will be treated as
final expenditures for the purpose o f replenishment from IDA. For the withdrawal application,
the letter o f advance to the implementing units will be used as a supporting document for
replenishment. The next tranche o f fund release will be made on receipt o f utilization certificate
o f the previous tranche.

PMT will (i)    consolidate the expenditure inthe accounts o f the project and produce consolidated
FMRs; and (ii)     advise the DADM to get IDA share replenished to the SA for the reported
expenditure.

Staffing. To manage the Financial Management o f the project, RGOB has approved the
positions o f Finance Officer (FO) and Accountant. The Accountant will be in place by May
2004. FO will be identified by December 2004 upon return o f a batch o f Finance officers from
overseas training and posted in January 2005. In the interim, MOH DCFO will assume the
responsibility o f the project FO. RGOBhas agreed that an adequately qualified and experienced



                                                     47

Finance Officer will be available on a full-time basis, throughout the entire implementation
period o f the project. Prior to any transfer o f such dedicated personnel, RGoB will ensure that
there is sufficient transitional time for the succeeding candidate to be trained on-the-job.

The training plan for FO and accountant, as well as other accounting staff involved in
implementation o fthe project, has been incorporatedinthe Project ImplementationPlanand will
be included in the NFS Annual Human Resource Development Plan, following by RGOB's
policy.

AccountingPoliciesandProcedures. Project accounts andbooks o frecords will be maintained
according to the prevailing rules o f the RGoB, i.e. Financial Rules and Regulations (July 2001).
The cash basis o f accounting will be followed. In order to facilitate reporting by project
components, PMT, in consultation with AFD, will ensure that at the time o f budget requisition,
budget activity and sub-activity codes (which are decided at the time o f budget preparation)
coincide with the component and sub-component classifications in the PAD. Funds to
Dzongkhags will be budgeted and released under "Current Grant" object code, and activity will
be identified as "Innovation Grant."

PMT will provide DBA with Dzongkhag-wise budget allocation for the Innovation Grant, based
on the annual approved workplans.

Reportingand Accountability. Information flow duringthe project implementation phase will
be from bottom-up and in principle, the reverse o f fund flow apply to flow o f
informationheporting o f financial transactions, financial positions, and physical progress. Each
implementing agency will have reporting obligations--the details, content and frequency o f
which will be fully described in the Project Implementation Plan. In addition to self reporting,
monitoring andreporting will also take place at two levels, byDzongkags and by PMT staff.

Consolidated financial and physical progress reports will be generated by PMT on a quarterly
basis (in the agreed FMR formats), with input from DBA (actual expenditure data), from PPD
(for physical progress o f activities implemented by MOH and regrouping o f expenditures into
categories defined in the DGA), and from Dzongkhags and other line ministries (physical
progress data).

PMT will submitthe consolidatedFMRs to the Bank on a quarterly basis. Contents o fFMRs has
been discussed and will be confirmed at negotiation. It will consist of (i)      sources and uses of
funds for quarter and cumulative, by source and by category o f disbursement; (ii)          financial
progress by component; and (iii)    physical vs. financial progress.


Formatof FinancialStatements

FMR formats have been finalized and will be agreed at negotiations. The formats will be in
accordance with the guidelines issued by the Bank on November 30, 2002. The formats are
attached inAnnex 14.




                                                   48

InformationSystems

M O F has developed the Budget and Accounting System (BAS), which i s being implemented in
all ministries and Dzongkhags. MOH has developed a tool (PBM tool) allowing linkage o f
financial andphysical monitoring o f activities. The two systems are complementary. At present,
data from PBMtool has been transferred to BAS (e.g. MOH budget proposal 2004-2005), and a
working group has been set up to reinforce the linkage between the two systems. At this stage,
PBM tool is only used within the MOH. As other implementing agencies are involved in the
project, PMT will be responsible for compilation o f data from these other entities-Dzongkhags,
other line ministries, and CBOs.

InternalAudit. The Internal Audit Unitinthe M O Hwill also review activities o ftheproject. In
order to enable the Internal Audit Unit to carryout this function, the MOH will provide all
relevant and necessary documentation so that activities o f the project can be included in the
annual internal audit work plan. InternalAudit Unitreports directly to the Minister o f the MOH.

ExternalAudit. Audit Reports: Consolidated project accounts will be audited each year by the
Royal Audit Authority, which is the supreme audit institution inBhutan andis acceptable to IDA
for auditing Bank financed projects. The format of the financial statements to be audited will be
confirmed at negotiations. This will consist o f the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) o f the
project along with a statement reconciling credit disbursements, as per IDA records, and IDA
share o f expenditure and balances available inthe SAs, as reported inthe FMRs. The PMT will
be responsible for preparing the consolidated project financial statements and forwarding them
for DADM's review and submission to RAA by September 1 o f each financial year. The
certified audited financial statement will be sent to IDA within 6 months o f the FY end
(December 31o f each year).

To ensure reliability o f information, monitoring and regular audit are crucial for this type o f
project. Inparticular, a quarterly review and audit o f a sample o f sub-projects and work-plans
will be required in order to obtain reasonable assurance o f reliability o f expenditures and
compliance o f the communities and civil society with the terms of agreements. These reviews
and audits would be carried out in collaboration between the PMT and internal and external
auditors. TORSfor RAA and internal auditors are attached in Annex 13 and have been agreed
upon. RAA audit should cover one Dzongkhag and one line ministry at least once, and one third
of subprojects implemented byNGOs/CBOs duringthe implementation period.

               BHUTAN: HIV/AIDS andSTI PreventionandControlProject


Procurement. The Grant will finance goods, civil works, consultant services, and training.
Procurement will be in accordance with IDA guidelines for "Procurement under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits", January 1995 (revised in January and August 1996, September 1997, and
January 1999); as well as those for "Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers", January 1997 (revised September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002). The Bank's
Standard Bidding and Request for Proposals documents will be used as a basis for preparation o f
the package specific bidding andRequest for Proposal documents.

Procurement will be carried out by existing staff o f Drugs, Vaccines, Equipment Division
(DVED) for goods, Health Infrastructure Development Project (HIDP) for works, and PPD for
consultancies. The Ministry will designate a focal person within each division who would be
responsible for canying out the procurement. Duringthe first year, the Project Coordinator will
assume the responsibility o f the procurement officer, and assist in coordinating all the
procurement activities and communicating with the Bank. The effectiveness o fthis arrangement
will be reviewed and assessedafter the first year o fproject implementation.

A capacity assessment o fMOHto implement procurement actions for the project was carried out
during project preparation.     The issues/ risks concerning the procurement component for
implementation o f the project include need for training o f the staff o f DVED and PPD to apprise
them about the procedures o f procurements under the World Bank financed Projects. One staff
from DVED and one from PPD have recently received training in NIFM, Faridabad and this
training will also be imparted to other staff members in DVED, PPD, and HIDP who will be
handling procurement for this project. AFD staff will also be trained to facilitate efficient
implementationo fprocurement procedures.


Procurementmethods (TableA)

Procurement arrangements are described below and summarized in Table A. A detailed
procurement plan for the first eighteen months has been prepared. A consolidated procurement
planfor the complete life o fthe project indicating the package name, estimated value, method o f
procurement and the year in which procurement will be carried out has also been prepared.
However, after effectiveness, this procurement plan will be updated to reflect eventual changes
to the plan, The Procurement plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the
actualproject implementation needs.

I.EstimatingnumberofHIVincidenceandprevalence

At thisjuncture, data on HIVprevalence and sexual behaviors are very limitedinBhutanposing
a significant challenge to the estimation o f number o f HIV cases and the economic and financial
analysis o f the project. Inorder to facilitate an accurate estimation o f the number o f PLWHA in
2004 andprojected HIV incidence, data on sexual behavior are very important for the modeling.
Inparticular, the number of sex partners (both regular and casual among males and females),
condom use rates, estimated number o f commercial sex workers, seasonality o f CSW services,
number of infected sex workers, number o f clients o f sex workers, number of annual sex acts
among clients o f CSW, andprevalence o f STIs inthe populationwould improve the accuracy o f
the model. Due to the lack o f such information, the estimates were generated based on
discussions with several key informants.

Despite the lack o f data, there is still a need to estimate the number o f new HIV infections. The
estimates for number o f new HIV infections and HIV prevalence were generated based on the
followingthree major routes o fheterosexual transmission:
        4       Infected male to uninfected female spouse and casual partners
        4       Infectedfemale to uninfected male spouse and casual partners
        4       Infectedfemale CSW to uninfectedmale

Data are limited to facilitate the modeling o f other routes o f transmission such as vertical
transmission (two vertical transmission cases have been reported to date), intravenous drugusers,
blood transfusion, and homosexual transmission. Inthe future, when more data from behavioral
andsero-sentinel surveillance are available, a more sophisticated modeling o fthe number o fnew
HIVinfections can bemade.

Based on the profile of 36 identified PLWHA who are living at the beginning o f 2004 (22 male,
8 female, 6 CSW), three projections were made for 2004-22 -- the base case, the medium case
andBaseworst case.

females i s 5 times the base case and the number o f infected CSWs i s 5 times the base case and a
medium number of casual partners.
    Worst case assumes a higher o f number o f index cases with the number o f infected males is
set at 5 times the base case, infected females at 10 times the base case and infected CSWs at 10
times the base case andthe highest number o f casual partners.

1.Scenariowithout preventionprogram
The cohort model was applied based on infection probability and no condom protection. O f the
36 PLWA who were living at the beginning o f 2004, 22 infected males would transmit HIV to
their spouse and casual partners, 8 infected females would transmit to their male spouse and
casual partners, 6 CSW would transmit to their clients served. The number o f new infections
estimatedby the end of 2004 was calculated andthis cohort was assumed to start transmitting the
virus in 2005. Similarly, the cohort o f new cases infected in 2005 would start transmitting the
virus in 2006. Based on the cohort model, 19 worksheets were constructed for the period of
2004-22.

For CSW, an annual 5% increase in the number o f infected CSWs was assumed to take into
account transmission from infected male clients to nai've female CSWs.

It was assumedthat each cohort would transmit the virus for a full five year period during their
asymptomatic phase and stop transmitting the virus from year six onwards, when they become
symptomatic.

A survival probability among PLWHA was applied for each cohort of new infection, assuming
everyonewould survive for five full years and start to die due to 01from year six onward and all
would dieby year 10. This survival probability was appliedto each cohort ofnew infection.

2. Scenario with preventionurogram
The model covers the period from 2005 to 2022 -- the World Bank project would be in place
from 2005 to 2009 and prevention and treatment activities are expected to be continued by the
RGOB from 2010-22. One important input parameter for the model is the percentage of condom
use with casual sex partners and CSW. Condom use with casual sex partner is assumed to be
lower than with CSW in the model. By the end o f the World Bank funded project in 2009,
condom coverage i s assumed to be 40% with casual sex partners and 60% with CSW.

Based on condom coverage in each year, a similar cohort modeling to estimate the number of
new HIV infections for 2005-22 was conducted. Assumptions were similar to those made inthe
first model for no prevention program and were applied for all three scenarios (base case,



                                            64

medium and worst case). Similar survival probability was applied. The result is the number o f
surviving PLWHA in2004-2022.

The prevalence o f HIV infections is the sum o fthe number o fHIV infections at the beginningof
the year and the total number o f new infections generated fkom each cohort in that year divided
by the total population. The adult prevalence is number o f living HIV cases divided by the adult
population age 15-49 (assumed to be 60% o f 650,000 total population, census data not
available).


11.Resultsof modeling


1.Scenario withoutpreventionprogram
Figure 1depicts the evolution over time o f the number o fHIV cases when adjusted for survival
(01deaths) and no condom protection. Discussion with Key Informants indicates that the
medium case produces the most realistic model for Bhutan. The number o f living PLWHA
would be approximately 1900 when the epidemic becomes mature in 2019. Throughout this
analysis, the medium case scenario is taken as a benchmark o f analysis.

Figure 3 demonstrates HIV prevalence comparing with and without condom intervention, using
the medium case scenario. With a preventionprogram, the epidemic peaks seven years earlier (in
2012 with a preventionprogram and in2019 without a program), as indicated inthe gap between
the two lines.

4. Adult HIVprevalence comparisons
Figure 4 depicts adult HIV prevalence (age 15-49) for the medium case scenario. It would be
0.17% at its peak in 2019 if no prevention program i s in place. In the setting o f a successful
prevention program, the adult prevalence peaks at a lower prevalence o f 0.06% in 2012. If the
condom coverage were increased higher than the levels assumed in the model, the adult HIV
prevalence would be further reduced and even more HIV infections would be averted. This
model suggests that Bhutan will maintain a low level epidemic (adult general population
prevalence less than 0.5%) even without a prevention program.

111.Preventionprogramcost andoutcome

Several assumptions were made for program costs as follows: (i)                             discount rate o f lo%, (ii)
RGOB continues to finance the prevention program during the period of 2010 to 2022 at the
annual recurrent cost o f 30% of that o f during the World Bank project3, (iii)                         annual cost o f 01
treatment i s 390 USD (60% that 650 USD quoted inan Indianstudy), (iv) 01treatment continues
for two years prior to death; first year at 70% o f 390 USD and the second year at 100% o f 390
USD. The total 01treatment cost was multiplied by the total number o f deaths from 01that
would be averted due to the program. Cost savings from 01 averted were deducted from the
program cost to calculate a net program cost.

The total gross program cost would be 9.7 million USD over 18 years, giving a net present value
o f 6.13 million USD. The present value of 01savings are 0.95 million USD resulting in a net

 The reduction inrecurrent costs is assumed since the programstart-up costs, including capital investment, training
o f health workers and other capacity building were covered bythe World Bank project.

program cost 5.2 million USD. The program outcome yields 13,769 infections averted, 5,431
deaths averted, and 190,092 life years gained. The net program cost per infection averted is 377
USD and per life year gained is 27 USD. The gross program cost per infection averted and life
year gained i s 445 USDand 32 USDrespectively.

The prevention program averted HIV infections and consequently averted deaths from 01. The
total deaths averted in the medium case scenario (5,431) over 18 years would significantly
contribute to economic activity. Based on a per capita income of 540 USD, several assumptions
were made regarding the proportion o f national income paid out to labor, the proportion o f the
population inthe labor force, the employment chance for PLWHA hadthey not become infected.
The average daily earning per worker was estimated at 1.94 USD.A 3% annual increase indaily
wage over the 18 years was assumed. Based on a retirement age of 65 years, an average age at
HIV infection of 20 years, five years of asymptomatic infection and adjustment for 65% full
employment, 23 years o f lost earnings were estimated due to pre-mature deaths from 01.

Based on these assumptions, the total present value o f lost eamings avoided as a result o f the
prevention program was estimated in three scenarios. When 01cost savings and lifetime lost
income avoided were deducted from the program cost, the net benefit is negative (minus 3.1
million USD) for base case with an unfavorable Benefit Cost (B/C) Ratio o f 0.49.

In the two other scenarios, the net benefits are positive and B/C ratio is greater than 1. The
medium case yields a positive net benefit o f 20.2 million USD and 4.29 B/C ratio. An even
higher gain i s observed for the worst case scenario with a net benefit o f 109.4 million and 17.85
B/C ratio. More benefits would be gained from the program if the condom coverage is higher
than input parameters in the model (Table 3). Life years accrued from infections averted were
also not valued but would increase the estimated NPVs inall scenarios.




IV. Anti-retroviral Therapy program cost

Not all PLWHA will require ART immediately after seroconversion. UNAIDS recommends
starting ART inthe later stages o f the disease as s measured by CD4 count less than 200. Based
on the new infection cohorts produced over the 18 year period o f the Medium Case Scenario,
several assumptions were made: (i)   ART would be indicated six years after seroconversion, (ii)
only 85% o f those eligible would enroll in ART treatment due to social stigmatization and
adverse drug effects, and (iii)the retention rate, taking into account drop out from the program
owing to non-compliance and treatment failure, and deaths due to 01, i s shown in Table 7. All
ART enrollees are assumed to die inyear 11.

When adjusted by the retention ratio, by 2005, there would be 6 PLWA eligible for ART
(CD4<200) and willing (0.85) to enroll in ART. The number o f PLWA under in ART slowly
increased to under 100 by 2011, rapidly increased to its peak o f 410 cases in 2017, then fell to
141by2028.

Figure 5 depicts the total net number o f PLWA adjusted for drop outs, treatment failure and
deaths during 2005 to 2028. It is likely that the first group o f patients, having been infected in
1999, would start ART in2005.

Cost o f ART was assumed as followed. Annual cost per patient year for the first line regimen
was 350 USD and second line was 4 times the first line at 1400USD. It was assumed that 0.85 o f
PLWA would tolerate the first line regimen and 0.15 would be enrolled inthe second line. The
weighted cost o f ART was estimated at 508 USD per patient year. Recurrent cost for CD4 count
monitoring was estimated at 10 USD per test, twice a year, 20 USDper patient year. The overall
average cost o f ART was estimated at 528 USD per patient year. Drug costs were a significant
part o f ART program cost, representing 96% of 528 USD. Changes in drug cost (either up or
down) would have a major impact on government's operating costs when the program becomes
mature.

The average cost o f ART per patient year was multiplied by the net number o f PLWA on ART.
This results in total resource requirement for ART both in the project (2005-09) and in the
portion to be financed by the RGOB (2010-28). Table 10 indicates an annual cost of less than
100,000 USD during the period o f 2005-12, which is less than the annual cost o f 200,000 USD
per annum duringthe period o f 2013-2015. The budget peak o f 220,000 USD would be observed
in2017 andthenwould leveloffsteadily, similar to the netnumber ofPLWAonART.




 This excludes other laboratory tests e.g. routine kidney and liver function tests. This is expected to be absorbed by
the routine services by the RGOB.

                BHUTAN: HIV/AIDS and STI PreventionandControlProject


Background

Provision o f preventative and treatment services under the HIV AIDS project will generate
hazardous medical wastes which, if not managed and disposed properly, can have direct
environmental and public health implications. However, the negative impacts are reversible and
easily mitigated through systematic management o f such clinical waste from source to disposal.
The wastes o f highest concern expected to be generated by project activities are sharps (infected
needles and syringes, surgical equipment, IV sets) infected blood, HIV test kits used in VCT
centers, blood banks and laboratories and pharmaceuticalwastes. There i s no construction waste
envisaged, as there are no major civil works, other than the establishment o f a small-scale waste
management system andrefurbishment and minor works relatedto VCT.

While there is no national legislationon healthcare waste management inBhutan, the RGOB has
taken different initiatives for enforcing good practices and measures for handling general
biomedical waste. There are Infection Control Guidelines and Environmental Codes o f Practices
for Hazardous Waste Management which provides some basic guidelines for segregation and
disposal o f biomedical waste. Waste management and infection control is also a part o f the
curricula offered by the Royal Institute o f Health Services.        Additionally there are new
guidelines with regard to solid waste management includingbiomedical waste generated from
healthcare facilities. An assessment o f waste management and infection control in the country
carried out in2002 noted that health workers have a reasonably good knowledge o f occupational
safety and good practices but these are not always practiced often because o f lack o f resources
andproper equipment.

The project envisages the establishment o f proper management system for the treatment and
disposal o f the waste related to the treatment and prevention of HIVIAIDS and STI. Once these
systems are put in place and efficiently implemented,           the negative environmental and
environmental health impacts will be controlled. Proper training o f healthcare workers i s also
planned under the project to ensure that good infection control and waste management practices
are sustained over time.

The above will be implemented as defined in an Infection Control and Healthcare Waste
Management Plan, which has been developed by the RGOB. The detailed Plan has been
disclosed and a copy is inthe Documents File.

I. INTRODUCTION

1. The Royal Government o f Bhutan has received the World Bank grant financing to scale up
the national response to fight HIV/AIDS. The project i s expected to start from about August
2004 for about 5 years. The main implementing and coordinating agency for the project would
be the Ministry of Health (MOH). MOH intends to appoint Royal Audit Authority to carry out
the financial audit o f the project.

2 ProjectDescription:

The project supports the Kingdom o f Bhutanto help finance the national HIV/AIDS and STI
Preventionand Control Project proposed. The total project cost inthe amount o f SDR 8.60
million (USD 5.77 million equivalent) is given to RGoB as an IDA Grant. This project will
assist the Royal Government o fBhutanto reduce the spread o f HIV infection by strengthening
political and societal commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention, by improving the national capacity
to plan, implement andmonitor a response to the epidemic, by establishing prevention
programmes for priority groups and the general populationusing a multisectoralapproach, and
by supporting efforts to improve infection control andhealthcare waste management inhealth
facilities. The project will also builduponexistingcapacity to establish a system of care and
treatment for HIVpositive individuals and will reinforce national behavioral and serological
surveillance o f the epidemic.

The project has four components. Component 1 - Prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs will
promote political and societal leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS, improve community
knowledge and attitudes about HIV prevention, promote risk-reducing behaviors amongst
priority groups, and increase access to condoms. Component 2 - Institutionalstrengthening
and building capacity will enhance the ability o f national institutions to lead the fight against
HIV through training and technical assistance, and will strengthen laboratory and blood
transfusion services. Component 3 - Care, support and treatment of AIDS and STIs will
establish VCT services, strengthen management o f STIs and HIV/AIDS (comprehensive care
and treatment approach, including introduction o f ART, and improve infection control and
waste management in health facilities. Component 4 - Strategic information for HIV/AIDS
and STIs will promote evidence based decision making by improving health information
management, strengthening operation research capacity, and instituting M&E and second
generation surveillance systems.

opinion on the project financial statements5, o f HIV/Aids project as at the end of each fiscal year
i.e fiscal years starting from August 2004 upto the project closing date. (ii)           the operation o f the
overall financial management system including internal controls, and compliance with financing
agreements; (iii)    financial Statements fairly present the financial transactions associated with the
implementation o f the project. (iv) whether the expenditures financed by the grant were incurred
for the purpose o f the project and are eligible for bank financing.

4. Coverage of the Audit: The audit would cover the entire project Le., covering all sources
and applicationo f funds by all implementing agencies. The auditor would visit the various field
offices o f project and other agencies as considered necessary for the audit. The audit would also

provided to the implementingagencies6.

5. Period:The audit would be for each fiscal year from commencement o f the project (expected
to be August 2003) upto the project closing date. The audit for the first year would also cover
transactions, which occurred before the commencement o f the project (if any financed as
retroactive).

111.     Scope

6. The audit should be carried out inaccordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards,

         a true and fair view o f the operations of the project during the year and the financial
         position o f the project at the close o f the fiscal year. Any material deviations from IAS,
         and the impact o f such departures on the project financial statements as presented would
         be stated;



5        The ProjectFinancial Statements are expected to include the following:

                                 Annex 15: SupervisionStrategy


        The project will require intensive supervisioninthe first two years, given the range o f
implementing agencies with different capacities and the large procurementwhich will take place
inthe first 18months. Despitegoodcapacity inplanningat the centrallevelandacommitment
to fightingHIV/AIDS, MOH andPMT will require assistanceinimplementingthe project's
workplan mechanism at the Dzongkhag levels. Inparticular, support will be necessary inthe
first year prior to the MOH's plannedroll out o f the PBMtool to the Dzongkhags. NGOs/CBOs
andthe private sector are very small inBhutanandthe PMTwill benefit from guidance from
Bankteams inestablishing thenon-government sector's participationinthe project inthe first
two years. This period i s also the critical time for establishing a multisectoralresponse to
HIV/AIDS through supporting line ministries other than Health inthe development and
implementation o fworkplans for advocacy andprevention activities. Procurement inthe first
two years is large andthe PMT will benefit from Bank supervisioninensuring that the
preparations for procurementunder way at appraisal are followed through on time to avoid
project implementationdelays.

        To the extent possible, supervisionmissions will beplannedto coincide with the MOH's
budget preparation cycle (February-March). This will maximize the impact of Bank support,
since mission findings will be able to link directly into the MOH's annual planning. Supervision
missions will also be heldclose to the health sector review to leverage work undertakenas part
o fthe broader review process. Areas o f overlap betweenthe health sector review andBank
supervision ofthe project include planningmechanisms (workplans/PBM tool/BAS), human
resources development, and monitoring & evaluation (HMIS, LIS) as well as progress in
implementation inI C & HCWM, laboratory services (including quality assurance), andblood
supply. Additional supervision missions will be undertaken as required. It was agreed with UN
agencies and donors ina meeting convened by MOHthat mission planning o f all groups would
be shared through MOHto minimize the impact o funcoordinated supervision from multiple
agencies on M O Hwork. The Bank supervision teams will participate inmeetings with donors.

        The core supervisionteam inBank missions will include: (i)      Task Team Leader, with
experience inHIV/AIDS operations; (ii)Jinancial management specialist who will review the
project's adherence to fiduciary requirements; (iii)  procurement specialist who will review and
advise on issues relatedto procurement; (iv) implementation specialist who will focus on smooth
implementationby other sectors, NGOs and contractors; and (v) environmental specialist to
review implementationo f the I C & H C W Mplan. The team will also rely uponselected experts,
including WHO staff, for technical assistance on monitoring & evaluation, surveillance, strategic
communications, andthe medical care and support component.

        Supervisionmissions inthe first year will focus on progress on (i)    establishment o f the
planned institutional structure, (ii)
                                    progressindevelopingpolicies and guidelines specified inthe
project (ART & 01treatment, syndromic management o f STIs, BCC, I C & HCWM), (iii)
trainings; (iv) monitoring & evaluation arrangements; (v) initiation o fprocurement o f goods and
works; (vi) financial management capacity development; (vii) readiness to initiate workplans and
subprojects for MOH, other line ministries, NGOdCBOs andthe private sector; and (vii)
development o f the second-generation surveillance system so that first round o f surveys will be

done duringthe first year o f the project. Fieldtrips will be undertaken to three Dzongkhags,
