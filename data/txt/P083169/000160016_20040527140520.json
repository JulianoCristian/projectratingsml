Key outcome indicators include\n            increases in the percentage of persons reporting condom use\n            with last non-regular sex partner  and percentage of\n            patients with selected STIs at health care facilities who\n            are appropriately treated accordingly to the updated\n            national guidelines. The Project has four components.\n            Component 1 - Prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs will promote\n            political and societal leadership in the fight against\n            HIV/AIDS, improve community knowledge and attitudes about\n            HIV prevention, promote risk-reducing behaviors amongst\n            priority groups, and increase access to condoms. Component 2\n            - Institutional strengthening and building capacity will\n            enhance the ability of national institutions to lead the\n            fight against HIV through training and technical assistance,\n            and will strengthen laboratory and blood transfusion\n            services. Component 3 - Care, support and treatment of AIDS\n            and STIs will establish voluntary counseling and testing\n            (VCT) services, strengthen management of STIs and HIV/AIDS\n            (comprehensive care and treatment approach, including\n            introduction of anti-retroviral therapy), and improve\n            infection control and waste management in health facilities.\n            Component 4 - Strategic information for HIV/AIDS and STIs\n            will promote evidence based decision making by improving\n            health information management, strengthening operation\n            research capacity, instituting monitoring and evaluation and\n            second generation surveillance systems."}, "docdt": "2004-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
