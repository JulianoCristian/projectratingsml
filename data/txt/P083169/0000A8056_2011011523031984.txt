                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's objectives are to reduce the risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) amongst the general population, and in particular, amongst groups with high risk sexual
                         behaviors. The two key outcome indicators include: (a) the percentage of persons reporting condom use with last non regular sex partner increased from less than 20 percent at
                         project start to 30 percent among the general population and 60 percent amongst priority groups at project end; and (b) an increase in the percentage of patients with selected STIs at
                         health care facilities who are appropriately treated according to the updated national guidelines from less than 20 percent at baseline to 60 percent at project end. The baseline

                         values for the first indicator were estimates based on discussions with experts as no data were available on condom use at the time. The baseline for the second outcome indicator
                         was zero as the new drugs were previously unavailable.

                         The project has met the first part of the first indicator as surveys have noted condom use with non regular partner was as high as 74 percent amongst the general population. Data on
                         priority/risk groups of five male subpopulations and one female subpopulation focus on the most risky relationships, i.e. commercial sex, show an uneven situation. Consistent
                         condom use ranges from 17 percent to 70 percent with half of all priority groups being under the 60 percent target. Thus, it has only partially met the second part of the first indicator.

                         With respect to the second objective (STI treatment), the proportion of STI patients appropriately treated falls well below the target of 60 percent. This assessment is based on results
                         of the Health Facility Survey of 2009 which found that only 25 percent of district hospitals were treating urethral discharge correctly.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Achievement of project objectives was downgraded from Satisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory (MS) because of delays in contracting the technical assistance to establish targeted
                         interventions and delays in strengthening supervision of project outputs, particularly on STI management. Given the limited amount of time left under the project to implement
                         targeted interventions and to strengthen STI treatment to ensure project outcome indicator is met, the team acknowledges rating it as MS rather than MU is a close call. However,
                         the team believes sufficient progress will be made under STI treatment to maintain an MS rating at project closing.
                         Better progress could be made on reaching project objectives if more focused efforts are made to reach priority groups, if data collected are utilized to improve program outcomes
                         and if supervision and corrective follow-up of activities is strengthened, particularly with respect to STI treatment.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
