                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project is closing on June 30, 2011. The project development objectives (PDO) are measured by two key outcome indicators: (a) the percentage of persons reporting condom
                         use with last non regular sex partner increased from less than 20 percent at project start to 30 percent among the general population and 60 percent amongst priority groups at
                         project end; and (b) an increase in the percentage of patients with selected STIs at health care facilities who are appropriately treated according to the updated national guidelines

                                                                                                                                                                                                            Page 1 of 6

                         from less than 20 percent at baseline to 60 percent at project end. The second indicator was included as evidence suggests presence of STIs increases vulnerability to HIV. The
                         baseline figure included in the PAD is facility-based and refers to the proportion of family planning users using condoms and is thus not indicative of the proportion of the population

                         using condoms to reduce risk of HIV transmission. The baseline for the second outcome indicator was an estimate as there were no data on the proportion appropriately treated.

                         The project has met the first part of the first indicator as surveys have noted condom use with non regular partner was as high as 74 percent amongst the general population. Data on
                         priority/risk groups of five male subpopulations and one female subpopulation focus on the most risky relationships, i.e. commercial sex, show an uneven situation. Consistent
                         condom use ranges from 17 percent to 70 percent with half of all priority groups being under the 60 percent target. Moreover, 11 and 14 percent of respondents from two risk groups
                         claiming 70 percent consistent condom use had had at least one STI symptom in the last year suggesting condom use is not as consistent as claimed. Given that most groups
                         interviewed reported having limited or no contact with MOH HIV prevention efforts, and that minimal progress was made on implementing targeted interventions for high risk groups,
                         achievement of the second part of the first indicator is not met. On balance, since emphasis on high-risk groups is the most effective approach to prevention, the overall achievement
                         against the 1st PDO indicator is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

                         With respect to the second PDO indicator (STI treatment), the proportion of STI patients appropriately treated was measured twice. The Health Facility Survey (HFS) of 2009 found
                         that only 25 percent of district hospitals were treating urethral discharge correctly. The response was a combination of direct observation of practice and reported knowledge. A
                         subset of the HFS was carried out in May 2011 to assess change with regards to STI treatment. It found 70 percent of those interviewed knew how to treat urethral discharge.
                         Practice was not observed. Other data from the same survey note not only that reported practice significantly overstates observed practice, but that other aspects of STI treatment
                         linked to HIV prevention are not being adhered to. For instance, the survey indicated that while 93 percent of respondents (health care workers) said they always gave STI patients
                         condoms but a review of documentation at the same facilities noted only one third of patients received them. And although 68 percent of health workers said they referred STI
                         patients for HIV testing, only 19 percent did in 2010, and 26 percent from January to April. Most importantly, identifying the correct treatment of male and female genital ulcers, the
                         other two STI syndromes addressed through the new guidelines, continued to be low (23 percent for male patients and 28 percent for females). Thus, taking the second PDO
                         indicator on face value, achievement of this PDO could be rated as Moderately Satisfactory. However, given the difficulties in comparing the two surveys, and triangulation with other
                         indicators related to STI treatment, it is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

                         On balance, given that achievement against the two PDO indicators is Moderately Unsatisfactory, the overall rating for the PDO is also Moderately Unsatisfactory. This estimation is
                         also based on the limited progress on efforts to increase among the high risk groups which was the crux of the project.
