INTERNATIONAL RANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPN=-TT
REPORT AND RECO1NUENDATION OF THE PRESIDET,
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADCIR
FOR A VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Ecuador for the equivalent of US$1 million to
help finance a vocational training project.   The loan would have a term
of 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 86é percent per
annuir
PART I - THE ECONOM(Y
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ecuador" (No. 507-EC) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
September 26, 197h. A mission visited Ecuador in February 1975 to update
our information. Annex I summarizes the main economic and social
indicators.
3.        Ecuador's medium-term development prospects have substantially
improved during the last two years, ow-ng to the emergence of oil as a
major component of the country's exports and to the 1973-7L increases in
world oil prices. In spite of some production and marketing difficul.ties
faced by the petroleum sector since mid-197L, the earnings from oil
exports have overcome, at least temporarily, the scarcity of foreign
exchange and savings that had severely impeded Ecuador's growth up to now,
and have offered Ecuador an exceptional opportunity to foster economic
and social development. Ecuador, however, continues to be one of the
poorest countries in Latin America, with a per capita income of US$390
in 197 and a large proportion of the population living on the margin of
existence. Moreover, given Ecuador's structural and institutional
problems, it may well be difficult for the country tc take full advantage
of the new opportunities provided by petroleum exports.
k .       From late 1972, when oil exports began, until mid-1,7T, most
economic indicators have shown a marked improvement. During 1973, real
GDP is estimated to have increased by 13.1 percent, in contrast with the
5.7 percent annual growth rate achieved in 1969-72. The Government wa.s
able to double its investment expenditures in 1973 while reducing the
public sector indebtedness to the banking system. In the same year the
country moved from chronic budgetary and balance of payments deficits to
a position of surplus0 With an 80 percent increase in the dollar value
of merchandise exports in 1973, Ecuador achieved the first surplus in the



current account of its balance of payments in recent years. In spite
of rapidly growing imports, net foreign exchange reserves increased by
almost US$100 million, reaching US$225 million at the end of the year.
It was then expected that a further substantial increase in reserves
would be achieved in 1974. The overall economic performance in 197T
was good, with an overall real growth rate of 10 percent. However, oil
exports, Government revenues and foreign exchange reserves did not
increase as much as had been expected.
50        Revenues from petroleum in fact fell sharply after mid-197L.
Oil exports in 1974 were some 25 percent less than in 1973 and the
volume of production (approximately 186,000 barrels per day) was well
below the 250,000 barrels per day capacity of the Trans-Andean pipe-
line.  Some of this decline stemmed from a voluntary cut in oil produc-
tion on conservation grounds. Second, there was a temporary disruption
in the operation of the Trans-Andean pipeline, as a result of an
accident in July. Third, there were problems in marketing all the
petroleum available for export during 197L. These resulted from a
disagreement between the Government and the foreign oil companies about
the reference price used for tax purposes, a problem that has now been
resolved, and from difficulties in exporting by the Government company.
6.        In 197a, public expenditures increased by approximately 50 per-
cent over the 1973 level, a real increase of 22 percent, while petroleum
revenues did not increase at the expected rate and, at the same time, the
real value of non-petroleum revenues declined slightly. As a res-ult, the
Central Government budget showed a small deficit in 1∞7L instead of the
expected surplus. Foreign exchange reserves at the end of 1974 were
close to the US$3L0 million level - up only US$115 million from 1973 and
equivalent to about four months of expected imports in 1975. This much
smaller than expected reserve accumulation resulted in part from a con-
tinued rapid rise of merchandise imports (from $h6L million in 1973 to
$826 million in 197L) reflecting the increase in world market prices as
well as higher import volumes in all categories of imported goods.
7.        It is expected that petroleum exports in 1975 will not substan-
tially exceed 197L levels, because of a new accident in the pipeline in
March 1975, the continuation of conservation measures, and technical
difficulties in petroleum extraction which limit the level of production.
Because of continued expected increases in domestic investments and
imports, it is unlikely that the fiscal and balance of payments position
will improve in 1975. Hence, balance of payments prospects for 1975 are
less favorable than anticipated in the last economic report and the
Government expects no increase in foreign reserves this year. This sudden
tightening of the balance of payments and fiscal situation points to the
continued vulnerability of the economy.
8.        The difficulties of managing economic policy in this period of
change are highlighted by the recent behavior of domestic prices. In



-3-
contrast -with the conditions of relative stability in the 1962-72 period"
there has been a rapid increase in domestic prices reflected in the
acceleration in the average annual rate of change in the cost of living
index from 8 percent in 1972 to 12 percent in 1973 and to 23 percent in
1974. The principal factors in the inflationary process have been the
rapid rise in public expenditures and import prices, and the stagnation
of domestic food production in the face of rapidly increa&ing demand.
9.        Even if there is no recurrence of difficulties with oil exports
in the future, the acceleration of petroleum revenues will not resolve
Ecuador's deep-seated development problems in the short runp although
increased revenues from petroleum will provide financial resources to
step up Government development efforts. The economy remains heavily
dependent on agriculture, and much needs to be done to improve the living
standards of the estimated 50 percent of the population at the margin of
subsistence. Educations productivity and income in the agricultural
sector remain very inadequate, encouraging migration to the cities.
Attempts to solve these problems are handicapped by the high rate of
population growth of over 3 percent,
10.       The Government appreciates the opportunity afforded and the
challenge posed by the country's petroleum resources, as well as the need
to ensure that these make a substantial contribution to Ecuador's develop-
ment. To this aad, it has designed an ambitious development strategy
which focuses on (a) promoting diversification of the economy by fostering
agricultural and industrial development; (b) alleviating poverty in the
countryside through a massive rural development program; (c) upgrading
social services; (d) expanding infrastructure; and (e) improving absorp-
tive capacity by overcoming major bottlenecks to development, notably the
shortage of qualified manpower and the administrative weakness of the
public sector.
11.       The guidelines of the Government strategy are reflected in a
development plan adopted by the Government in 19720 Physical infra-
structure - particularly electric power, irrigation and transportation -
continues to absorb a high proportion of total public investment, but
there is a growing emphasis on investments in agriculture and on rural
social services. It is recognized in the plan that the immediate need is
to improve the ability of public sector agencies to prepare economically
sound projects of high priority, As the process takes time and local
capabilities are limited, increased use of foreign experts is expected.
12.       Several measures have been taken to improve the public sector's
absorptive capacity for investment. Concrete content is being given to
the development plan by accelerating the process of project preparation.
To this end, an inventory of specific projects has been compiled by the
Planning Agency in collaboration with the different ministries and rele-
vant public sector agenciese In addition, a preinveetzent fund has been
set up to finance prefeasibility and feasibility etudies for investment
projects.

13        Com,plementing t.hese efferts at strengthening prcvect prepara-
tion and in. order to ensure the availability of funds for investment
and dampen the inlationary effects of the petroelum earnings, the
Govcr'ien't has segregated from the budget the excess rev'entues aecru:iLng
to the (. zgJ. Government resulting from the increase in the petrolerm
referenri,e rJice above the level in effect in November l973, Ths.se
resorr!es, which accumulated in the National Development Fund. were
originWy allocated to finance investment projects over and above those
alrer.dw, Irnclkded in the 197i4 budget.
114       Another maior thrust of the Government's develolment strategy
is to ezpa:±d domestic output, particularly in agriculture. In ana attempt
to break the virtual stagnation of recent years, the authorities have tried
to stimulate agricultural production through more adequate price and tax
incentives and improved marketing. Import duties and ths sales tax on
agricultur.eJ. iaeahinery and inputs were eliminated and there was a
substantial increase in credit to agriculture through the National Develop-
ment i3auc and expanded operations of the Central Bank's Financial Fund.
15e       There is still considerable uncertainty about Ecuador's long-
term econoric prospects. The statistics on Ecuador's petroleum reserves
suggest that unless new discoveries are made soon,, petroleum production
and exports may decline toward the end of the decade. An amnual rate of
economic growth of about 11 percent seems attainable over t1he next five
or six years, but may not prove to be sustainable over a longer period.
Even if Ecuador attained the projected growth over the next few years, it
would stil1 remain a relatively low income country, with a per cepita
income ix ':1'diO of approximately US$640,
16.       Aside from the need for expanding capital investment, the
demands of t,he growing population for higher levels of consumption and
social s.ees are also Irising0    Hence, while an increase in foreign
exchange e<rvos should be possible in the next few years, Ecuador
would be J+stified in continuing to plan on net capital inflows0  At
the same time, Ecuador's capacity to prepare and carry out technically
and econouiai_lly sound investment projects remains very limited as
public sector agencies, uith few exceptions, remain rather weak. It
follows that, while Ecuador's creditworthiness has improved substen-
tially over the past two years, the uncertainties regarding its exnort
potenTiP-!, and Ecuador's development needs justify continued external
assistancze While IDA credita are no longer warranted, tnere is a
stroIlg ase for continuing Bank assistance in support of the Govern-
menti-   c'    to oring about structural and insti-tutional change4

from 9 percent of exports of goods and services in 1973 to under 7 per-
cent in 1977. The Bank/IDA share of debt outstanding and service is
small (about 15 and 9 percent respectively). The country is credit-
worthy for farther Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ECUADOR
18.       Since the first loan in 1954, the Bank and IDA have made twelve
loans and six credits to Ecuador totalling US$150Oh million, net of
cancellations. At the end of February 1975, the Bank and IDA held about
US$115 million, including about US$57-3 million not yet disbursed. The
most recent loan, to finance the improvement of the water supply system
of the port city of Guayaquil and the Province of Guayaa, was signed in
July 1974.
19.       IFC has made five investment commitments in Ecuador, two in a
large textile company and three in a development finance ccmpany, amount-
ing to US$4.3 million of which, as of February 28, 1975, US$2.5 million
had been sold, terminated or cancelled. Execution of Bank Group financed
projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of
February 28, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       Bank and IDA lending were originally concentrated in transpor-
tation and power, where there were substantial deficiencies to be over-
come. These sectors still account for 32 percent and 10 percent of total
Bank and IDA lending. Most of our lending for transportation has been to
improve the road network of the country, although one loan was made to
help finance a new port in Guayaquil. Lending for power has been concen-
trated in improving generation and distribution facilities in Quito. The
first livestock development credit approved in 1967 marked the beginning
of a diversification of lending toward the productive and social sectors.
Since then, the Bank and IDA have made five loans for agriculture and
fisheries; two loans to support industrial development through two
development finance companies; one loan for education and one loan for
water supply. Bank/IDA assistance for the productive and social sectors
account for about 58 percent of total lending.
210       External development financing is also provided by IDB and
USAID. External financing by sector and by source through 1974 is
summarized belowt

IDB is the largest single lender having extended most of its loans to Ecuador
fron. t-he Fund for Special Operations, which has normally carried a 2 percent
interest rate, a ten-year grace period, and repayment terms of up to forty
years. USAID loanis generally have had amortization and grace periods similar
to those of IDBE, with interest at 2-3 percent. It is likely that IDE will
remain the major development lender in the immediate future, although the
terms will probably be le88 concessionary than in the past. New loan comuit-
mente by USAID are unlikely in the near future. Education, health and other
social-oriented activities as well as agricultural developmant, have been
receiving increasing attention from the external lending agencies in recent
years. IDE, USAID and the Bank/IDA have coordinated their efforts to assure
the most effective use of resources.
22.       Bank lending in Ecuador is aimed at supporting the Gcvernnent's
prioritI.?t, outlined in Part I above. This objective will be met by pro-
viding aRssistance in planning and in project preparation and implementation,
and by amphasizing projects that support the productive sectors, as well as
redress the human resource bottlenecks. We will also continue to provide
assistance in the infrastructure where deficiencies could handicap the
Government's objectives in the agricultural and industrial sectors.
23.       In agriculture, we are working closely with the Government in
helping it elaborate the rural development program which it is cowwrdtted
to undertake. We are at the same time preparing several rural development
projects. whtch we hope to submit for your consideration,  In industry,
we are -oricing with the Govert ent in the preparation of a project for
the expoi. t,ation of Ecuador's extensive forest resources, In transport,
we will continue to aid the Government in completing major highway lrinks,
but we willl place greater emphasis on assistance in the construction of
feeder roads to support the Government's agricultural program, as well as
on techrnical assistance, A highway project that includes several agricul-
tural roads and which is now under preparation will be submitted for your
con.sideration early in FY76. We will also assist in the e:qoansion of



- 7 -
Ecuador's main port - Guayaquil - where most industry is located. In the
field of human resources, special attention is being placed on education,
where serious deficiencies contribute to urban/rural unemployment and
poverty. The project before you today serves the double purpose of
addressing the problems resulting from the absence of adequate training
to meet the needs of the rapidly growing agricultural and industrial
sectors, as well as supporting the Government's objective of providing
skills for the subsistence-level population.
PART III - TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN ECUADOR
24.       Ecuador's formal and non-formal education and training systems
are not presently geared to meet the projected skill requirements of the
economy, especially for middle-level manpower. Despite past efforts to
remedy deficiencies, the formal system retains a strong academic
orientation and is generally characterized by inappropriate curricula,
shortages of trained teachers and physical facilities,and an overly
centralized administrative structure. The Government did not accord
high priority to non-formal vocational training until the early 1970s,
and most official programs are still in need of strengthening.
25       TInadequate training opportunities in both the formal and non-
formal systems have contributed to producing a work force with a low
skill profile, which adversely affects productivity. Improvement and
expansion of technical education and vocational training are now of
critical importance, if the growth potential of the economy, spurred by
the petroleum boom, is to be realized. The constraint posed by the
present limited supply of trained workers is easily illustrated: by
1977, the average annual demand for middle-level personnel, including
skilled and semi-skilled workers, will be about 25,000-30,OOO, compared
with a projected annual supply of only some 20,000.
Government Objectives in Technical Education and Vocational Training
26.       The Government's educational strategy emphasizes the rapid
expansion of non-formal vocational training programs as the most effi-
cient means of meeting urgent manpower requirements. Formal technical
education, on the other hand, is not likely to be expanded substantially
in the near future, although efforts will be made to improve quality and
to encourage a larger proportion of secondary school graduates to enter
the labor market directly rather than proceed to higher education.
27.       The main vehicle for expansion of non-formal vocational pro-
grams will be a semi-autonomous training authority, the Servicio
Ecuatoriano de Capacitacion Profesional (SECAP), which is recognized
as the most effective institution in its field in Ecuador, Principally
through SECAP, the Government plans to: (a) provide training opportu-
nities to unemployed youths and adults in the marginal subsistence areas



- 8 -
of Quito and Guayaquil; (b) increase access to training in rural areas
and smaller tons through the use of mobile units where fixed centers
are not econ:oically viable; (c) ezpand upgrading activities and
apprenticeship training; (d) establish national training standards and
testing procedures; (e) intensify training advisory services to industry;
(f) provide training opportunities for the graduates of secondary tech-
nical schools; and (g) conduct surveys to identify the manpower needs of
the ecmcq and training requirments of selected target populations.
Technical Education
28.       In Ecuador formal technical education, administered by the
Ministry of Edacation, is offered in the senior secondary diversified
cycle (Grades 10-12), following nine years of general education. Students
may specialize in the industrial, commercial, agricultural, arts or home
economics fields, and in 1971 more than one-third of all senior secondary
students were enrolled in one of the technical courses. However, 80 per-
cent of these specialized in caerce, which is considered an easy route
for gaining entrance to the faculties of law and economics at the univer-
sity. Consequently, although the output of secondary technical graduates
was substantial, it failed to alleviate labor market shortages for
middle-level manpower, because of the high proportion of students who
went on to higher education.
29.       Besides an uneven distribution of students among specializations,
formal technical education suffers from a fragmentation of resources among
too large a number of schools (at present, 282 of the 589 secondary schools
offer some technical courses) and unclear objectives regarding the level
of qualifications which graduating students should attain. These factors
have contributed to the poor quality of technical education, which is
reflected in the fact that most graduates require further extensive on-the-
job instruction.
30.       A camponent of the first Bank Group education project aimed at
addressing some of the aforementioned problems by introducing a revised
diversified curriculum into a small number of secondary schools. However,
the Bank project was delayed owing to initial difficulties in appointing
the project director and recruiting specialists and subsequently because
of shortages of counterpart funds. These problems have now been resolved,
and the project is proceeding satisfactorily, but the effects of the pro-
ject have not yet been felt as none of the schools is fully operational.
Vocational Training
31.       To remedy the deficiencies of the formal system in responding to
the needs of the ecunomy, non-formal training programs have been developed
on an ad haoc basis by governmental agencies and the private sector.
Besides SEWAP (.see paras 31-32 below), the Government sponsors training
schemes in rural end urban areas, including literacy programs with a skill
training component5 eveaning courses in artisan trades, and farmer and



agricultural staff training0 Unfortunately, these programs have only a
limited impact on the target populations because of the lack of organi-
zation, monitoring and follow-up. Courses in management skills are
organized by various associations, such as the National Association of
Employers and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Specific skill-
oriented training is provided in one-year courses for skilled mechanics
by the Ministry of Defense, both to meet military needs and to train
soldiers who are about to be discharged. Also, to provide skilled
personnel at all levels for the power industry, the National Franco-
Ecuadorean Center (CENAFE) was established in 1966 as an in-plant scheme
under the joint auspices of the Ecuadoran Electricity Institute and the
private electricity supply company,
Servicio Ecuatoriano de Capacitacion Profesional (SECAP)
32.       Since 1966, training for skilled and semi-skilled workers,
supervisors and technicians has been organized by SECAP, a semi-
autonomous training authority governed by a Board of Directors repre-
senting the Government, organized labor and private enterprise. The
Minister of Labor is Chairman of SECAP's Board. In addition to its
normal activities, SECAP has conducted surveys of the manufacturing and
mining sectors to identify priority training requirements and has pro-
vided extensive advisory services to enterprises in developing their
in-plant training programs. Training is organised by SECAP on a
regional basis from offices in Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca, but has been
confined to upgrading and in-plant training because of SECAP's inade-
quate physical facilities. Temporary use has been made of the workshop
facilities of secondary diversified schools, private enterprises and,
more extensively, of the Instituto Tecnico Ecuatoriano Aleman (ITEA) in
Quito. Due to limited resources, SECAP trained only about 7,000 workers
in the 1968-72 period. To eliminate financial constraints, a special
levy of 0.5 percent has been imposed on wages, and this has resulted in
a rapid increase in the number of persons trained annually (from 971 in
1971 to 6,332 in 1973). About two-thirds of all trainees were workers,
and the rest were supervisors, instructors and managers. Because of
limited facilities the bulk of the expansion was in on-the-job training
programs.
330       An important step toward expanding SECAP's own installed
capacity took place in January 1974, when the latter assumed adminis-
trative responsibility for ITEA. Established in 1965 with assistance
from the Federal Republic of Germany, ITEA has 390 trainee places and
enrolls about 200 full-time apprentices in a three-year program in the
mechanical trades. Germany is still providing assistance in course
organization and teaching. The quality of training is excellent, but
output is only about 60 graduates per year and costs per student are
high because of the small enrollment. Limited facilities preclude
training in other then the mechanical trades.

Project Description
38.       The proposed project would increase the capacity of
the Servicio Ecuatoriano de Capacitacion Profesional (SECAP) by about
sixfold and help to diversify and strengthen its vocational training
programs, in response to the projected demand for middle-level manpower
needed to implement Ecuador's economic development program. Through the
proposed project, the Bank would assist SECAP in expanding training
opportunities for unemployed adults and youths, workers in need of pro-
fessional upgrading and graduates of secondary technical schools, in
both urban and rural areas of the country. In addition, SECAP's training
advisory services to enterprises would be greatly expanded and national
training standards and testing procedures would be developed. Finally,
the Bank would assist SECAP in the organization and rationalization of
technical assistance to be provided by other external agencies. Speci-
fically, the project comprises:
(a) construction, furnishing and equipping of two vocational
training centers, including:
(i)   one new center at Guayaquil with a capacity of 1,245
student places to provide opportunities for about
2,895 trainees annually;
(ii) extension of the vocational training center at
Quito to increase its capacity from 390 to 1,110
student places and thereby provide opportunities
for about 2,745 trainees annually; and
(b)  provision of two mobile units to provide training oppor-
tunities for about 500 trainees annually in rural com-
munities and small townships.
39.       The proposed project, which is expected to be completed in
three years, would enable SECAP to undertake vocational training in its
owi facilities on a large scale for the first time, as a complement to
its existing on-the-job training programs. The SECAP centers would
operate on a double shift, with apprenticeship training in the mornings
and adult worker training and upgrading in the afternoons. In total,
the project would permit SECAP to introduce progrgms in 25 occupations
in the mechanical, electrical and construction fields.
40.       Apprenticeship training would be organized in three-year courses,
and all trainees would be at least 15 years of age and have a minimum of
six years of primary education. A selection procedure for the recruitment
of apprentices would be developed, and the Government has agreed to submit
draft proposals to the Bank for review no later than one year prior to
completion of construction of the centers (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 4.o5(i)). The accelerated training courses would be offered to
unemployed adults and dropouts from the education system who are at least
18 years old and require training for specific occupations. The number of



- 12 -
upgrading scnhemes for employed workers would be expanded, with programs
varying in duration from 40 to 180 hours. Finally, short supplementary
courses would be organized to prepare graduates from secondary technical
schools for specific middle-level technician occupations.
41.       Training in the SECAP centers would be based on careful occu-
pational analysis, with flexibility ensured through the use of short
self-containad courses (modules) arranged so that workers could obtain
further training by taking a series of related modules at subsequent
periods in their careers. SECAP is developing new trade standards,
training programs, and skill tests, which the Government has agreed to
submit to the Bank for review (draft Loan Agreement, Section 40O5(ii)).
42.       To strengthen SECAP's efficiency, a placement service and
tracer system will be established to promote and follow the career
development of trainees, and evaluation procedures will be designed to
assess the suitability of all trainee programs. These activities will
be established on a permanent basis with the assistance of specialists
employed under the auspices of the ongoing multilateral and bilateral
technical cooperation programs. The Government has agreed to submit
to the Bank for review its plans with respect to the above-mentioned
placement service and tracer system and evaluation procedures no later
than one year prior to completion of construction of the centers (draft
Loan Agreement, Section 4.05(iii)).
43.       Tne mobile units to be provided under the project would permit
the expansion and diversification of a successful, small-scale training
program in equipment maintenance, which was originally supported by the
UNDP/ILO and the Swiss Government. Through mobile action, SECAP will be
able to offer training in numerous rural areas and small townships
adjacent to the Pan American Highway, where it is not economically viable
to establish fixed centers. The units would be administered from SECAP's
regional offices, and their duration of stay at each individual location
would vary up to six weeks. Courses would be offered in agricultural
equipment maintenance, welding and auto-mechanics.
44.       At full development, about 10 supervisors and 200 instructors
would be needed to operate SECAP's regional centers and the mobile units.
Technical assistance specialists already assigned to the Quito center
would train the required 160 new staff who would be recruited from among
secondary technical school graduates who have acquired industrial
experience. A plan for instructor and supervisor training is being
developed by SECAP and the Government has agreed to submit it to the
Bank for review (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.05(iv)).
45.       SECAP will be supported in its expansion efforts by technical
assistance from several multilateral and bilateral sources which have
cooperated in the past, namely the Federal Republic of Germany, Spain,
the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the UNDP/ILO. Through the proposed



- 13 -
project, this external assistance would be organized and coordinated to
concentrate on strengthening the technical and administrative infra-
structure of SECAP, expanding the programs of the new centers and the
mobile units, reinforcing in-plant training and the advisory service to
enterprises and staff development.
Cost and Financing
46.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$709 million,
of which US$4.0 million or 51 percent represents foreign exchange costs.
Construction costs make up 46 percent of the total cost; furniture and
equipment 26 percent; project administration 2 percent; and physical and
price contingencies 26 percent0 The proposed loan of US$4-0 million
equivalent would finance the estimated foreign exchange oomponent of
project works. The balance would be financed by the Government.
Project Administration
47.       Responsibility for project implementation would be vested in
SECAP. The National Director of SECAP will be responsible for coor-
dinating activities related to carrying out the project and he would
allocate the necessary staff from SECAP's pool of resources to carry out
design work, civil works supervision, procurement of furniture and equip-
ment and program development. The National Director will be assisted by
the Deputy Director for Technical Matters who would be responsible for
the design and construction aspects of the project, and by the Deputy
Director for Administration who would be responsible for procurement of
the goods included in the project and for keeping project accounts. If
required, SECAP will appoint additional staff to carry out the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
48.       Contracts for civil works would be awarded on the basis of com-
petitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local proce-
dures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Since the amount of civil
works is small, foreign contractors are not expected to be interested.
The above procedures do not preclude bidding by foreign firms. Con-
tractors for civil works will be required to prequalify.
49.       Contracts for furniture and equipment would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. Items would be grouped to the extent practicable to form sizable
bid packages and to permit bulk procurement. Items that cannot be
grouped into packages of at least Us$40,000 would be purchased in accord-
ance with the Government's regular procurement procedures which are
satisfactory to the Bank. The total value of items purchased in this
manner would not exceed US$200,000, corresponding to about 10 percent of
the total value of the furniture and equipment component. Local manu-
facturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a margin of
preference equal to the prevailing tariff, or 15 percent of the C.I.F.
prices, whichever is lower.



- 14 -
50.       The loan would be disbursed over a four-year period against
the estimated foreign exchange component of the project. Disbursements
would be made against 40 percent of total costs of civil works; 100 per-
cent of foreign expenditure costs of mobile units and equipment including
equipmont for project administration, and 45 percent of the cost oxf
furni turo
51.       Up to US$120,000 would be financed retroactively from the
proposed loan for expenditures with respect to construction, site develop-
ment and project administration expenses incurred between June 1974 and
the date of loan signing. Annex III includes the disbursement schedule
for the ls..vx.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUHENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Ecuador and
the Bank, the Report of the COomittee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the draft
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. Besides the specific features mentioned
elsewhere in this report, the draft Loan Agreement conforms to the normal
pattern for loans for education projects.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 124-EC - Education Project; US45.1 million Credit of June 27, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The project is about three years behind schedule because of initial
difficulties in appointing the project director and recruiting experts, and
later because of shortages of counterpart funds. As a result of the recent
reorganization of the Ministry of Education which also affected the Project
Unit, project administration has improved and the Project is now progressing
satisfactorily. The Government has authorized the use of bond issues to
finance the local component of the project cost and no major difficulty is
now anticipated in obtaining the counterpart funds required to complete the
project before the Closing Date.
Loan No. 555-EC - Fisheries Project; US$5.3 million Loan of September 5, 1968;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1976.
Execution of this project also had a slow start due mainly to insti-
tutional problems and less than anticipated demand for the fishing vessels
included in the project. At the request of the Borrower, a portion of the funds
which were to be used to purchase tuna purse seiners was allocated for addi-
tional training for fishing crews and studies for improved harbor facilities
for the fishing industry. US$710,000 which will not be required for the
project have been cancelled.

Credit No. 222 - EC - Third Livestock Development Project; US$10.0 million Credit
of December 10, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The Project is progressing satisfactorily. There was a slowdown in
lending from May 1973, when negotiations regarding changes in interest rates
for subloans were begun, until the issue was settled in May 197L. Hlowever, the
loan is now fully committed and is expected to be fully disbursed by the
Closing Date. The objectives of the project are being met, and demand for
investments for subloans for beef and dairy development is good.
Loan No. 721 - EC - Development Finance Companies Project; US$8.0 million Loan of
February 5, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Disbursements are running slightly behind the original schedule, but
the loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the new Closing Date of June 1975.
Credit No. 286 - EC - Third Pbwer Project; US$6.8 million Credit of February 15,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The generation components of the project were completed with exception
of the Cumbaya by-pass which had to be redesigned by the consultants due to
geological difficulties found while building the tunnel for the Nayon power
plant. The transmission and distribution components of the Project should be
completed by end of 1975, 18 months behind schedule. The delay was caused
partly by lack of experience of the beneficiary, Enpresa Electrica de Quito (EEQ),
with procurement procedures. The beneficiary has not yet revaluated its assets,
made arrangements to collect Goverment debts or amended its 'Estatutos" as
agreed. These problems have been drawn to the Government's attention,and it is
expected that EEQ will take action on these matters.
Credit 425 - EC - Milagro Irrigation Project; US4:5.5 million Credit of August 17,
1973; Closing Date: August 31. 1979.
Civil works are proceeding on schedule although there has been some
delay in awarding bids for some project equipment. The arrival of a construction
consultant has been postponed to better fit the expected arrival of the equip-
ment. Consultants have been retained to carry out the feasibility studies for a
possible second project.
Loan 930 - EC - Second Development Finance Companies Project; US$20.0 million
Loan of August 17, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project is proceeding according to schedule, and is expected to
be fully comuitted by June 30, 1975.

Loan 1030-SC - Guayaquil and _uayas Province Water Sup&ly Project; US$23 million
Loan of July 23, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
This loan became effective on January 29, 1975. Work on the project
is proceeding satisfactorily.

Arrarnement:   Contract's for civil works would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance
with local procedures wvhich are satisfactory to the Bank.
Since the amount of civil works are small, foreign contractors
are not expected to be interested.   The above procedi:2res do
not preclude bidding by local firms.   Contractors will be
required to prequalify.   Contracts for funliture and eq-ip-

would be grouped to the extent practicable to form sizable
