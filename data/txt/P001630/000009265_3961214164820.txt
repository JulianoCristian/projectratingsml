PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
WOOD ENERGY II PROJECT
1.    This is a Project Completion Note for the Wood Energy H project (Loan 2670-
MAI). The Loan Agreement for an amount of US$ 16.7 million was signed on July 10,
1986, and the unutilized balance of US$ 15,922,942.48 was canceled on March 13, 1989.
2.    Background. The Project was developed following the recommendations of the
1984 Forestry sub-sector study and drew lessons from the ongoing Wood Energy NRDP
1I (National Rural Development Program) project. In July 1984, the Govermnent of
Malawi requested that the Bank consider financing a second phase wood energy project as
part of a long term wood energy programn. Accordingly, the Government with the
assistance of the Food and Agriculture Organization and the conceptual guidance of the
Bank carried out project preparation activity. The Bank appraised the proposed project in
July 1985, and the Board approved an IBRD loan of US$ 16.7 million on March 25,
1986.
3.    Objectives. The Wood Energy H project was designed to reduce the gap between
sustainable fuelwood supply and demand through support for institutional development,
wood production and conservation, research and training and through a policy package
designed to encourage private fuelwood production.
4.    Description. The project was to have included the following main features: (i)
developing policy instruments and incentives to encourage tree planting on a national
basis; (ii) increasing fuelwood production through tree planting by small farmers and
through establishing a limited number of Government plantations in ecologically fragile
areas; and (iii) reducing fuelwood consumption by introducing more efficient charcoal
kilns and household stoves. The project was also to have included components to support
institutional development, and research and training. Its significant policy orientations
were: increases in fuelwood prices, expanded forestry extension and revenue collection
activities, provision of incentives for tree planting, and a redefinition of the Government's
role in fuelwood production to emphasize the encouragement of private tree planting.
5.    The project was estimated to cost US$19.6 nillion, of which US$16.7 million was
an IBRD loan, approved by the Board on March 25, 1986. The Loan Agreement was
signed on July 10, 1986, and was declared effective on December 23, 1986.
6..   Expected Benerits and Risks. Smallholder woodlots (17,000 ha) and
Government plantations (6,000 ha) to be established under the Project were to have
produced 230,000 cubic meters of wood annually, thereby reducing the current fuelwood
supply/demand deficit. Substantial savings in annual fuelwood consumption were also
anticipated from the introduction of more efficient charcoal production technologies and

charcoal cooking stoves. The principal risk envisaged was associated with the
implementation of a comprehensive and new policy packages given the limited human
resources and institutional constraints. To minimize this risk, the Project was to have
provided institutional strengthening of the Forestry Department and training coupled with
close monitoring and evaluation of the various components. Annual review of
implementation, and mid-term review after three years of Project implementation with a
view to taking corrective action were incorporated in the design of the Project.
7.    Lessons Learned. Both the Bank and the Borrower strongly supported the
objectives of the project. However, Malawi's external debt situation had deteriorated such
that neither the Bank nor the Government considered it prudent to continue financing
Wood Energy II under IBRD terms and conditions. Advantage was therefore taken of the
appraisal of the Energy I project in 1988, towards which IDA resources were earmarked.
The Wood Energy II components were reappraised by a Bank mission, some changes
were made where appropriate, costs updated, and its revised version with no change in the
objectives of the project was included as an important component (under the heading
Wood Energy) of the Energy I project. The Board approved Energy I on March 14, 1989.
8.   In anticipation of the approval of the Energy I Credit, the Government requested
cancellation of the Wood Energy II Loan by telex dated February 9, 1989. By then only
US$777,057.52 equivalent of the loan was disbursed, of which 13.7% was used for civil
works, 23.8% for vehicles and office equipment, and 44.8% for salaries, wages and
allowance. The balance of US$15,922,942.48 equivalent was canceled on March 13,
1989. None of the major objectives of the Wood Energy HI Project have been achieved.
However an ICR is under preparation for the successor Energy I project which closed on
February 28, 1996. The achievements of the objectives of the Wood Energy II will thus
be dealt with in the ICR of the Wood Energy component of the Energy I project.
