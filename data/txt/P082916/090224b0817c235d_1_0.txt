                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to be at high risk of not achieving its development objectives. There are considerable improvements in budget preparation process, MTEF, internal audit. At the
                         same time, the ultimate objective of strengthening public financial management cannot be fully achieved without FMIS. The Ministry of Finance remains concerned about the pace
                         and quality of implementation of financial management information system (FMIS) which is the biggest project component and also the main activity remaining to be completed.
