                         The project has accomplished many of its intended results as reflected in the achievement of the intermediate outcome indicators that are not related to the Financial Management
                         Information System (FMIS) implementation. Under Component 1 (sub-components 1a and 1b on budget execution and preparation), the project supported the introduction of the
                         single treasury account. This contributed to increased transparency and efficiency of budget management through consolidation of all national public budget balances. New
                         methodological guidelines for budget preparation developed under the project integrate medium-term budget planning into the overall budget cycle and enable stronger links between

                         budget allocations and government policy priorities. Alignment of the newly developed budget classification and chart of accounts with international standards has laid a solid
                         foundation for improved transparency of budget and financial reporting. Status of component 1c is described in detail in the paragraph below. Component 2 has helped strengthen
                         the internal audit function following the EU type decentralized Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) model. Component 3 on training capacity and training component has been
                         partially completed. The Academy of Public Administration has been established and is operational with training being delivered to civil servants related to organizational and FM. The
                         training activities under the project are closely linked to the launch of Financial Management Information System (FMIS) and new methodologies under component (i) have been
                         delayed due to delays in implementing the FMIS. Due to the partial acceptance of FMIS modules, the training strategy, originally prepared for the whole integrated FMIS platform, is
                         being scaled down to BPS, and basic ICT support and reporting needs.

                         Under component 1c, the development of a fully functional FMIS, to support the PFM reforms initiated by the Government, is the largest project activity. There has been a substantial
                         delay during the execution of FMIS contract which was signed with the Supplier (HP) on March 27, 2009. After significant delays in reaching an agreement on the last contract
                         amendment, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Supplier (HP) signed the amendment # 6 on December 4, 2013 to reduce the contract scope and price, for the delivery of a
                         partially acceptable FMIS solution before the closing date of December 31, 2013. The proposed changes included reductions in scope, services, and prices, as well as the revisions
                         in the implementation schedule, payment conditions, and other related clauses comprising 44 % of the FMIS application software functionality. The ICT infrastructure (main and
                         backup data centers, workstations, and network equipment) has also been accepted. The reduced total contract price is 67.2% of the total initial price, including the payments already
                         made for the ICT infrastructure and FMIS detailed system design. Operational Acceptance testing is ongoing and is expected to be completed by December 20, 2013.
