1      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

At the time of project approval in 2005, after twelve years of transition, Moldova remained one
of the poorest countries of the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region with a fragile economy,
partially implemented market reforms, a high level of debt and growing inflation. Entrenched
corruption had become a serious obstacle to economic growth and economic restructuring. Little
progress had been made in modernizing the public administration or improving transparency and
accountability. Notwithstanding the efforts of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to maintain sound
fiscal position, a collapse of government revenues between 1997 and 2001 resulted in ad hoc
expenditure adjustments with a severe impact on the social sectors.

The 2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) update argued that public expenditure reforms
were essential for poverty reduction, growth and stability. In spite of ambitious budget
management reforms promoted by the MOF the efficiency of public budget management
remained low, with particular concerns related to the Government’s ability to allocate resources
based on strategic priorities and to ensure that public spending was efficient and cost-effective

During 2002-2003, the Bank completed a comprehensive analysis of Moldova’s public financial
management and fiduciary practices. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)
concluded that the financial accountability framework was weak, particularly in the audit and
controls systems across the government. The Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)
highlighted the impact of poor procurement on the quality of public services.

In 2003 the MOF developed a “Strategy for Strengthening the Management of Public Finances”.
This aimed to improve the process of budget preparation and execution, increase budget
transparency and strengthen the financial control framework. The strategy built on the successes
of the earlier reforms that included the establishment of the State Treasury, introduction of
elements of computerized budget execution system, gradual introduction of a Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and piloting of program budgeting in social protection, health
and education sectors.

In May 2004 Moldova adopted the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGPRSP)1
which laid out three basic priorities: sustained and inclusive economic growth; reduction of
poverty and inequality; and human resource development. To achieve stable conditions for
continuing sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction, the Government planned to
stabilize public debt (through improved debt management), tighten fiscal policies and ensure
balanced budgeting. In the area of public financial management, the stated goal was “an
efficient and sustainable financial management system, based on effective instruments and
mechanisms, designed and operating to European standards”.

Moldova already had the basic elements of a public financial management system in place: the
institutional structure, including distinct Treasury and financial control functions; legislation;
some automation of budget execution, and hardworking, reform minded personnel at the MOF.

Reforms undertaken by the MOF laid the foundation for more strategic resource planning
through a medium term expenditure framework. However, the budget preparation and execution
methodologies needed improvement to better guide ministries. The budget classification did not
meet the needs of program budgeting. The chart of accounts differed from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) GFS 2001 standards, and accounting and reporting needed streamlining to
provide meaningful information on the state of the public finances. The Treasury was not able to
resolve cash rationing issues, creating uncertainty for budget managers. The automation of
management of public finance information was incomplete, difficulties in consolidation of
financial statements for the whole of the government and a lot of manual work leading to errors
and delays in information flows. The Government and the Parliament did not receive regular,
timely information on budget management since the system could not automatically generate
information on request. The internal control and internal audit systems did not meet international
standards specified in International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.
The national system of in-service training was not capable of providing relevant training in
organizational and financial management, auditing, and strategic management. This constrained
the possibilities to implement and sustain reforms leading to more effective and strategic
management of public resources. The Public Financial Management project, financed by the
International Development Association (IDA) and development partners, was designed to
address these shortcomings.

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project’s development objective was to achieve effective and transparent management of
public finances, as an enabler of poverty-reducing programs and economic growth.

The project had four major components and six sub-components:

      1. Budget planning and execution (methodologies and information systems)
             a. Budget formulation methodology
             b. Budget execution methodology
             c. Financial management information system
      2. Internal control and audit
             a. Normative and legal framework for internal control and audit
             b. Transformation of financial control (compliance) into internal audit
             c. Extending the internal audit system to line ministries
      3. Financial management training capacity and training
      4. Project management, monitoring and evaluation

1.5     Revised Components

There were no changes to the scope of the project until the final project restructuring in
December 2013 when the scope of the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) and
related training activities was reduced.

1.6     Other Significant Changes

The project underwent four restructurings (the first two carried out as extensions, with no formal
restructuring). In March 2009 the closing date was extended from June 2010 to December 2011.
In December 2011 the project was extended by a further year to December 2012, and finally in
December 2012 the project was extended to December 31, 2013. The third project extension
applied only to FMIS-related activities as all efforts were to be focused on the completion of


                                                    5
FMIS implementation and only the IDA credit was extended. As a result of the eventual
reduction in scope of the FMIS, MOF requested a partial cancellation of the IDA credit,
cancelling US$ 3,300,000 equivalent as of December 11, 2013.
Other grants (trust funded [TF]) co-financing the project, TF055170 and TF054017, were closed
on December 31, 2012. Most of the activities under these grants were successfully completed,
delivering improved budget methodology, MTEF and internal audit improvements. Unused
funds were returned to the donors (US$ 236,000 under TF055170 and US$ 354,000 under
TF054017).
The bidding process for the FMIS resulted in the selection of a solution costing substantially
more than the estimated cost. In 2009, additional grant financing of around US$ 2 million was
mobilized to fill the financing gap for the FMIS. Swedish International Cooperation (Sida)
allocated additional grant funds to cover the shortfall through a successor TF (94801). These
funds financed initial payments under FMIS contract. A new trust fund was established for this
purpose because it was not possible to add funds to the TF054017 due to changes in TF rules.

1.7   Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

Due to weak governance capacity and a difficult political environment, the proposed project
focused on interventions that did not require sensitive policy actions. Instead the project focused
on improving technical capacities of the public administration in public resource management. In
the course of project implementation it was hoped that improvements in the budget planning
process could stimulate an interest in developing capacity for strategic policy making at the
center of government and in sector ministries.

1.8   Revised Policy Areas

The policy areas were not revised during the life of the project.

1.9   Main Beneficiaries

The project focused on the management of public financial resources. It did not directly address
public services. Accordingly, the direct beneficiaries of the project were public officials
responsible for budgeting and financial management, who were to benefit from improved
information and streamlined processes, and decision-makers within the Government and
Parliament who were to benefit from improvements in the quality and timeliness of financial
information. Indirect beneficiaries included the non-governmental entities that take an interest in
public finances and, more broadly, citizens who would benefit from greater transparency, better
targeting of public programs and reduced corruption.

2     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project development objective was linked to goals of poverty reduction, following the trend
at that time. The outcome indicator of improved overall fiscal discipline was beyond the ability
of the project to deliver. Nevertheless, during the design phase, the Quality Enhancement Review
(QER) and Peer Reviewers warned of excessive ambition and the team took this advice into
account in formulating other indicators. The project design had a solid analytical foundation in
the form of up-to-date diagnostic work, including a CFAA and a CPAR carried out in 2002-03,
as well as European Union (EU) and IMF diagnostic reports. The project also benefited from
preparatory work for a public sector reform adjustment operation that was later dropped. At the
Country Director’s request the team carried out a QER and a political economy analysis which
sought to identify implementation risks and develop appropriate mitigation measures.

Authorities’ project preparation was supported by technical assistance financed from a recipient
executed Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant and a parallel grant
provided by the Dutch directly to the MOF. These grants were used to fund diagnostics,
equipment of the MOF training class and Project Implementation Unit (PIU) capacity building.
An extension of the project effectiveness deadline, agreed prior to project negotiations, allowed
the authorities to finalize preparation and fully use the PHRD grant.

The design focused on addressing existing capacity constraints and took into account the MOF’s
lack of experience in managing large complex Information Technology (IT) projects. Following
the recommendations of a study of IT project management arrangements, the authorities created
a PIU that was integrated within the MOF as a Project Office (PO) and supported with technical
expertise.

One design weakness was the formulation of the PDO. While the essence of the PDO was to
support the improvement of public financial management in Moldova, which was realistic and
attainable, the PDO was formulated in much broader terms. This was partly due to the then
prevailing approach in the Bank to link back to "higher level” objectives – in this case reducing
poverty and increasing economic growth – which a project of this type could not hope to
influence.

The project would have benefitted from more advance work on the definition of FMIS
requirements and architecture during projection preparation. Much of the work of business
process re-engineering design, preparation of functional requirement specifications,
interoperability strategies, development of information architecture blueprints and application
architecture blueprints was undertaken during implementation. Lack of clarify and agreement on
FMIS requirements and specifications led to clarification requests, extensions of bid submission
deadlines and change requests during contract implementation and increased cost for suppliers
during contract implementation.

2.2   Implementation

Implementation of the Moldova Public Financial Management Project (PFMP) began well
notwithstanding some delays: indeed until 2009 the project was seen as a model to be emulated
by others. There was strong government ownership, effective consultation and commitment on
the part of the project team. Implementation of the TA components was slower than expected.
Multiple changes of the counterparts affected the pace of implementation and there was some
resistance to change, for example to the introduction of internal audit. Nevertheless, many of the
changes required for the improvement of public finance management were eventually delivered,
notably the MTEF, modernization of budget classification, reform of internal audit and the
establishment of PFM training programs.

The Government was initially well prepared for the FMIS procurement both technically and
from the perspective of procurement. Arrangements included the establishment of a Project
Office (PO) in charge of procurement and financial management (FM) issues, recruitment and
training of a procurement specialist and appointment of an international Contract Management
Specialist to support design and implementation. Implementation challenges were related to the
complexity of the procurement process and the limited capacity and experience of MOF staff to
manage contract implementation. The Bank staff strongly recommended further strengthening of
the technical advisory team for the FMIS, including advisory support for the development of the
software and accelerated recruitment of the Contract Management Consultant.

The FMIS procurement process was launched in March 2007 as a two-stage bidding process for
"Supply and Installation of Information Systems". The final bid submission deadline for the
second stage bids was June 2008 and the Bid Evaluation Report was cleared in October 2008.
However, the contract was only signed in March 2009 and became effective in July 2009.

In 2009-10 the project took a negative turn, following a political crisis and a change of
Government. During 2010-11 the Government became dissatisfied with the performance of the
main supplier and its sub-contractors leading to a breakdown of trust. The budget execution
module of the FMIS was the most problematic area. The suppliers initially developed a poor
quality blueprint which undermined the Ministry’s confidence. The new Minister expressed
initial skepticism regarding the purpose and benefits of the project and was dissatisfied with the
Bank’s support.

Thereafter, successive attempts to put the FMIS component of the project back on track failed.
There was a substantial failure on the part of the supplier to deliver an acceptable technical
solution for the budget execution module, despite multiple contract extensions.


The project was extended for a total of three years given the delay in implementing the FMIS. In
the fall of 2013 the Government, in consultation with the World Bank, concluded that the full
FMIS could not be delivered within the scope of project. After evaluating different options,
including termination of the contract, the MOF and HP management, the main contractor of the
FMIS, reached an agreement on reductions in the contract scope and price for the delivery of a
partially acceptable FMIS solution before the closing date of December 31, 2013. Partial
delivery covered the Budget Preparation System (BPS), BES Master Data Management (MDM),


                                                8
Collection of Non-Financial Data (CNFD), Cash Liquidity Forecasting (CLF), and some of the
Business Warehouse (BW) modules. The Budget Execution System (BES) (except MDM),
Accounting (ACC), related BW reporting tools, and Web Services were removed from the
contract scope. The ICT infrastructure (main and backup data centers, workstations, and network
equipment) was also accepted.

A number of factors adversely affected implementation:

   i.   Although Government maintained strong commitment to the project, poor supplier
        performance and discontinuities in leadership resulted in strained relationships between
        the Ministry of Finance, the main supplier, and subsequently the Bank team. Key staff
        changed on all sides, resulting in loss of institutional memory and the need to invest time
        and effort in rebuilding relationships. These were not fully successful.

  ii.   Poor performance on the part of the main contractor, HP, was an important factor
        contributing to the failure to fully implement the FMIS. The quality of the HP team was
        variable over the lifetime of the project and at times their presence on the ground was
        also weak. HP managers changed frequently during the project lifetime, with some long
        gaps between appointments. The MOF viewed HP as bureaucratic, with the project
        manager not empowered to take decisions. With the benefit of hindsight it would have
        been better to terminate the contract with HP when it was clear that the MOF had lost
        trust in its supplier.
 iii.   The complex nature of the consortium that HP put together to implement the project
        contributed to the contractor’s poor performance. Communication between HP and sub-
        contractors was poor. Sub-contractors were sometimes unaware of agreements that had
        been reached between the MOF and HP management while HP repudiated agreements
        reached directly between the MOF and sub-contractors. The detailed FMIS system design
        (Blueprint) was of poor quality and showed lack of understanding of the core business
        processes.

Loss of critical project management staff, including those with expertise in contract management
and IT, undermined project management on the Government side. This proved to be a critical
weakness, contributing to problems in managing contract implementation and the relationship
with the main supplier. Attempts to rebuild a strong team with the necessary contract skills were
only partially successful and for long periods of time the PIU lacked a procurement specialist
and IT project management expert. At the same time, the presence of an international consultant
did not result in a significant improvement of the contract management.

 iv.    Project extensions were granted for relatively short periods of time. While these
        extensions were intended to encourage the authorities and the contractor to follow up
        quickly, the extensions proved insufficient to reach agreement on contract amendments,
        resolve design issues and develop adequate software solutions.




                                                 9
Adequacy of Government’s Commitment

Strong government commitment was identified from the outset as being a key to success. This
commitment was strongly evident in the early years of implementation. The first Minister of
Finance who initiated the project later became the first Deputy Prime Minister and then Prime
Minister, which allowed the project to benefit from the highest level political support till the
radical political change in 2009.

The new Government, which took office in 2009, viewed the project with a more critical eye and
did not immediately assume ownership. Those within the Ministry who were comfortable with
the existing Treasury system exerted some influence on decision making and were able to point
to the poor quality blueprint for the core budget execution module. Despite their reservations, the
MOF decided to support the project and advocated the later extensions, recognizing the critical
role of the FMIS in delivering the expected benefits of the project as a whole.

Soundness of Background Analysis

The design and implementation of the PFMP was built on a strong foundation of analytical
work: the Bank’s Public Economic Management Review, the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment, and the Country Procurement Assessment Review; an EU-funded
Treasury Diagnostic Review; IMF reports; and a summary of the stakeholder analysis for the
Moldova. The experience that the World Bank has gathered in comprehensive improvement of
public financial management was also used to guide the design and implementation of the
program. The UK Department for International Development (DFID), SIDA and the Dutch
Government also supported analytical work on reforming and restructuring public financial
management. The analytical work was used to inform project design, in particular the
strengthened implementation arrangements. This analytical work focused on the institutional and
technical dimensions of reform. There was no explicit political economy analysis. A better
understanding of stakeholders’ interests, identifying winners and losers and potential sources of
resistance to change might have led to a more realistic appreciation of implementation risks and
helped identify more effective change management strategies.

Assessment of the Operation’s Design

The design of the operation was assessed as satisfactory by the Quality Assessment of the
Lending Portfolio (QALP-2). The project focused on addressing existing capacity constraints.
The Minister and the Director of the State Treasury Department assumed leading roles in
project governance and management. Recognizing that public financial management engaged
all line ministries, agencies and local authorities, these entities were represented in the Steering
Committee and were engaged in operations by a project Task Force comprising the key
departments of the Ministry and the Academy of Public Administration (APA). Grant co-
financing was mobilized so that the IDA credit would be used for investment in the FMIS
component, as requested by the MOF. The MOF, and specifically the Project Office, were
responsible for the management of the credit, grants and counterpart funds and for financial
reporting. The project funds were kept in Treasury’s Special Accounts, with different accounts
for each funding source, opened in a competitively selected commercial bank.



                                                 10
Despite the complexity of the comprehensive PFM reform program and the number of entities
involved, the reform areas addressed by the project were well identified and focused through
the four project components. The Government of Moldova repeatedly indicated its appreciation
of the Bank’s assistance, using the operation to improve program design and to enhance
discipline in reform implementation. The fact that the Bank remained engaged in the reform
effort despite the deterioration in project performance helped dialogue and made the Bank a
privileged partner.
Other development partners were successfully brought within the program. Assistance for the
development of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework was provided by DFID. SIDA
assisted the MOF on debt management and training and helped build capacity of the Court of
Accounts. The Government of the Netherlands supported training on managing large
information systems for key IT staff of the MOF.
The presence of many development partners posed a challenge and led the project to put in place
special coordination arrangements to avoid overlap and address key issues on a timely and
priority basis. The Task Force, chaired by the Head of Treasury, and comprising heads of
departments of the MOF directly responsible for implementing project components/sub-
components, was formed to coordinate efforts related to both technical and financial support
provided to the government.

With the benefit of hindsight the project might have benefited from several modifications to the
design. Project implementation might have gone more smoothly had agreement been reached on
FMIS requirements and the redesign of business processes during project preparation. The
project would have been able to realize the benefits of PFM reforms if these had been supported
by interim upgrades to the existing system, in parallel with the development of the new system.
Furthermore, investments in communications and change management might have reduced the
level of internal resistance to the project.

Relevance of Risks Identified

The risks identified during project design were relevant but not all the important risks were
identified.

Loss of political commitment resulting from the changes in government was identified as one of
the risks and was highly relevant. To minimize the likelihood that the government would revert
to the old system of public finance management, the project attempted to build broad-based
support for improvement of public financial management emphasizing benefits for stakeholders
and its significance for achieving EGPRSP objectives. The project and Bank teams briefed new
Ministers soon after they were appointed in order to inform them about the project and advocate
for continuity in implementation. Despite this proactive approach political commitment wavered,
particularly towards the end of the project. The importance of the views of internal stakeholders
below the ministerial level was not sufficiently appreciated or understood. Not all stakeholders
were supportive of the project in practice and their resistance impacted on project
implementation.

Weak central policy coordination capacity was identified as a risk that might reduce the
effectiveness of resource allocation within the MTEF process. The project included


                                               11
representatives of the Council of Ministers (COM) and the Presidency in the coordination
framework to strengthen coordination. Policy coordination capacity did not turn out to be a
significant risk factor.

The risk of political pressures to approve over-optimistic revenue forecasts that may undermine
fiscal discipline was correctly identified and was managed to some extent. The MOF was able to
review revenue forecasts and compare them with the projections of International Financial
Institutions to improve realism of macroeconomic framework.

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) argued that poor management of the procurement
process could potentially delay the timely installation of equipment and system testing. This was
addressed by ensuring that the procurement specialists of the Project Office were trained in
procurement management and project planning so that relevant infrastructure and manpower
would be put in place prior to the implementation of the corresponding project component.
Despite these mitigation measures substantial delays did occur in the procurement process. The
borrower opted for an ambitious and complex solution for the FMIS contract and the main
supplier struggled to manage the performance of its sub-contractors. This complex contract
structure contributed to project failure.

The project correctly identified risks to the introduction of internal audit arising from the
culture of strong central control and weak internal management controls. This was successfully
managed through study tours to learn more about IA practices; management training and
awareness building for managers; and a successful transition was made to IA.

The risk that the APA would fail to re-orient its mandate to provide in-service training using
external trainers was not realized. A mitigating measure was provided in the form of
establishment of a Department for Civil Service Training in the APA with adequate autonomy
from the departments providing higher education programs.

Finally, the risk related to the Project Executive Officer (PEO) failing to establish and maintain
proper coordination of project implementation was addressed by relieving the PEO from some of
the time-consuming tasks through shifting some responsibilities to other Deputy Ministers and
ensuring the sustainability of the PEO position during project implementation regardless of any
structural changes in the Government of Moldova.

A significant risk that the initial risk assessment did not identify was related to lack of experience
in the Ministry of managing a complex IT project with an international supplier. Ministry
officials had no previous experience of this scale of contract and were reluctant to make use of
experienced professionals with international experience, preferring to rely on less experienced
local advisers. The project design relied on a strong PIU that was established at the start of the
project. Technical advisors and IT specialists were hired but most of the key PIU staff and
technical specialists left the project team for other positions and outside posts. Capacity issues
emerged starting from 2010 and the Bank teams suggested hiring international advisors to
compensate for the loss in capacity. During 2010-2012, the MOF had considerable difficulty
dealing with project and contract management but it was only in 2012 that MOF agreed to hire
an international advisor to support these activities.

2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation

M&E Design

The design of the M&E arrangements was satisfactory. A set of qualitative and quantitative
intermediate outcome indicators were defined to monitor progress towards the achievement of
the Program Development Objective (PDO). There were clear output measures in terms of
training delivered and legislation developed and approved. The project design provided that key
performance indicators would be tracked on an annual basis, through project-financed surveys
and analyses.

M&E Implementation

Performance indicators were presented by the Project Office to the Steering Committee and the
Task Force as part of regular progress reports. These were presented to the Steering Committee,
the Task Force, and the development partners on a semi-annual basis and were used to track the
progress in project implementation against the baselines. Later in the life of the project there
was little reporting on results, since most of the project activities had been completed and the
project was focused almost exclusively on FMIS implementation.

The main shortcoming in evaluation was that the Government was unable to prepare an
evaluation report at the project completion stage, notwithstanding reminders from the World
Bank, citing the dissolution of the Project Office and lack of financing as the reasons for non-
compliance with this requirement.

M&E Utilization

Some use was made of the M&E framework. The project team and MOF used the monitoring
system to track progress in implementation of the PFM reforms. Specific indicators focused on
progress in fiscal discipline of the national public budget, implementation of the budget
execution methodology, establishment of FMIS, and independent audit mechanisms and
reforming training system for civil servants.

Monitoring information helped identify adjustments in technical design, such as alignment of
budget preparation and execution methodology, the warrants system, the Chart of Accounts and
Budget Classification implementation with the FMIS preparation and implementation schedule.
Furthermore, the development of the PFM legal framework benefited from the project’s
extension so that legal drafting better reflected what is happening on the ground. This also
allowed for discussion and debate as well as analysis of the practices/lessons learned from other
countries that have had a similar recent experience.

The project staff also monitored progress in implementing the training component. Based on
monitoring, activities related to IA training and IA function decentralization were prioritized and
reevaluated. Training activities needs were also redirected to ensure the sustainability of
specialist training.

3     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial
The project’s development objective was to achieve effective and transparent management of
public finances, as an enabler of poverty-reducing programs and economic growth. This
objective was and continues to be highly relevant to Moldova’s development strategy, its PFM
reforms and current Bank priorities. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, and resulting
downward pressure on state revenues, support for public financial management systems remains
a high priority for both Bank and national authorities. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for FY2014-17 continues to identify public finance management as an important enabling theme
and the country program is supporting other projects to strengthen PFM in tax administration,
auditing and public investment management.

3.2    Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The project closed on December 31, 2013. The project accomplished those results that were not
directly dependent on the successful implementation of the FMIS.
Component 1: Budget Planning and Execution System
Starting with the draft budget for 2014 the new budget classification developed under the PFM
Project will become effective. In addition a Law on Public Finances and Budgetary-fiscal
Responsibility is at the final reading stage and is expected to be adopted in 2014.

The project supported the introduction of the single treasury account from March 2007. This
contributed to increased transparency and efficiency of budget management by consolidating
cash management. The PEFA 2011 report concluded that the data demonstrated very strong
linkages (minimal variance) between MTEFs annual Budget appropriations demonstrating
credibility in the process and that the MTEF and annual budget process are properly integrated
and part of one unified cycle. The 2011 PEFA report showed the budget classification score
improving from C to B. Alignment of the newly developed budget classification and chart of
accounts with international standards has laid a solid foundation for improved transparency of
budget and financial reporting. Status of component 1c (FMIS) is described in detail in the
paragraph below.

Under component 1c, the development of a fully functional FMIS, to support the PFM reforms
initiated by the Government, was the largest project activity. There were significant delays in the
execution of FMIS contract originally signed with the Supplier on March 27, 2009. The Supplier
failed to deliver a fully functioning FMIS. Instead, MOF and the Supplier signed a contract
amendment on December 4, 2013 to reduce the contract scope and price, for the delivery of a
partially acceptable FMIS solution before the closing date of December 31, 2013. The approved
FMIS application software represents 44 percent of the functionality foreseen under the original
contract. The ICT infrastructure (main and backup data centers, workstations, and network
equipment) has also been accepted. The reduced total contract price is 67.2 percent of the total
initial price, including the payments already made for the ICT infrastructure and FMIS detailed
system design.


                                                14
As it is, the data center equipment and network infrastructure is currently being used by the MOF
and Tax Department to support existing information systems. However, the budget preparation
and budget reporting portions of FMIS cannot be used unless the MOF integrates them with
existing systems. A MOF decision is pending on this integration. MOF is currently looking into
options for completing the system through financing by its budget or from other sources

Component 2: Internal Audit
The project was successful in introducing an internal audit function following the European
Union’s decentralized Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) model. Legislation was passed. A
methodology developed by the Ministry of Finance provides overall direction of internal audit.
Internal auditors have been appointed and trained. All central government ministries now have
established IA units and around 130 IA repots are produced annually. IA is being extended to
district level with about 40 percent coverage. Staffing and recruitment remains a challenge.

Component 3: Training capacity and training

The training capacity and training component has been partially completed. The Academy of
Public Administration developed 12 training modules, plus another 6 developed jointly with the
Ministry of Finance. In total 217 courses were run, financed from the project, providing training
to more than 5000 people, with an additional 6,000 financed from the state budget. The project
also financed training materials and equipment including computers. However, some of the
training activities under the project that are closely linked to the launch of FMIS and new
methodologies to be introduced with the FMIS. Due to the partial acceptance of FMIS modules,
the training component was scaled down to cover budget preparation and basic ICT support and
reporting needs.

In addition to the APA training, between 2011 and 2013 the Ministry of Finance developed and
delivered two distinct training modules on budget classification and program-based budgeting.
40 trainers were trained for each module from the MOF and CPA and training was conducted
both for the relevant staff from the CPA (120 persons), as well as for the decision makers from
the Government and Parliament, as well as officials from the local public authorities (94 people).

3.3   Efficiency

This was an institutional development project and standard computations of economic and
financial rates of return were not assessed as part of project preparation. The project did
contribute to improvements in budget management and control of public expenditures, reduction
in arrears and borrowing and expenditure efficiency savings. The introduction of the single
Treasury Account supported by the project made an important contribution to the elimination of
arrears by 2009 (from 3 percent of GDP in 2005). However, these benefits are difficult to
attribute solely to the project and their economic and financial benefits difficult to quantify.
Furthermore, the FMIS component, which represented US$8.5 million (68 percent) of the total
project cost of $12.4 million, did not result in the expected improvements in control because the
budget execution module effectively non-functioning. This substantially reduced the economic
efficiency of the project.

3.4   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The Internal Control and Audit component was completed satisfactorily with the objectives fully
met. The Financial Management Training Capacity and Training is rated moderately satisfactory
since a sustainable training capacity was put in place and institutionalized but training activities
were not completed since training to support implementation of the FMIS was never undertaken.
The Budget Planning and Execution component is rated unsatisfactory owing to the project’s
failure to deliver a working financial management information system, notwithstanding three
project closing date extensions between 2011 and 2013 in order to provide time for completion
of this component. The partial acceptance of the FMIS system is unsatisfactory because the
modules that have been accepted are effectively non-functioning. Furthermore, the redesigned
core PFM business processes that were successfully completed, including those for budget
preparation and the new chart of accounts, cannot be put fully into effect unless and until the
MOF decides to integrate the new FMIS modules with the existing treasury system.

3.5   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project did not specifically target poverty impacts or social development, but the
modernization of the PFMS involved assistance to manage a revenue collection environment that
could allow for the effective and transparent management of public finances as an enabler of
poverty reducing programs and economic growth. No gender dimensions were identified at the
design stage or tracked by the project.

The ultimate result was expected to be a better management of expenditures. Indirectly, this was
expected to lead to improvements in social benefits available to the population; therefore, the
project, would instill more confidence in government, lead to greater social inclusion, and
increase equity and transparency.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project was successful in developing long terms institutional capacity in three important
areas. Modern concepts of internal audit, consistent with EU PIFC framework have been
established and functioning units set up across much of Government. Second, the APA has
established long term capacity to train civil servants in public finance management. Thirdly the
project helped to build substantial capacity in IT systems development and operational
management in Fintehinform. The project was also successful in bringing about changes in
processes. The medium term budget process delivered closer alignment of the budget with policy
priorities and largely eliminated extra budgetary funding. Despite the failure to implement
IFMIS the project brought about improvements is processes and controls that contributed to
better cash management, and reduction of idle balances in Government’s accounts..

4     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

Rating: High

The Risk to Development Outcomes is considered high. Most of the benefits of the project were
contingent on the successful implementation of the FMIS system. Although there has been
partial acceptance of the system it is effectively non-functioning because key components of the
integrated system are missing, most notably the budget execution and accounting modules.
Realization of the project development objective will now depend on the Government finding
alternative financing to complete development of the FMIS.

Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

4.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality of Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Bank performance was rated as satisfactory at entry by a QALP assessment. Sound preparatory
and analytical work, strong policy dialogue and good working relationships with government
counterparts, high level of consultation with participants, and Bank expertise led to the design of
an operation which took into account the need to build and strengthen public financial
management through institutional capacity building and modernization of budget formulation
and execution (including treasury operations), internal control and audit, and financial
management training capacity. Furthermore, the Bank established close coordination with the
development partners actively supporting PFM agenda, namely DFID and Sida, to help the
government build the necessary capacity to implement the program. However, the decision to
implement the project within five years was unrealistic. The task team had originally advised a
seven year implementation period, which was consistent with experience in similar projects but
this was rejected at the design stage.

Notwithstanding the positive QALP assessment there were deficiencies in project preparation.
The functional design of the FMIS was only finalized in 2007 well over a year after project
effectiveness. Even then the lack of clarity over FMIS specifications and the business process
reengineering requirements contributed to disagreements between the authorities and the
contractor. Furthermore project preparation failed to identify potential for resistance to change
from some staff within the Ministry. These factors contributed to the failure of the FMIS
component.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                                17
Bank supervision performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. Although there were several
changes in task team leadership, the task team made effective handover arrangements and
remained on top of emerging issues. The team has made good use of quarterly reports from the
Project Office and supported the Office’s efforts to improve the quality of reporting. The team
produced comprehensive and candid aide-memoires. Qualified, experienced consultants were
deployed to support the core task team. The task team also drew on diagnostic and analytical
work undertaken by the Bank, such as the PEFA Assessment and PFM Performance Report of
July 2008, to inform dialogue with the authorities on the reform priorities and technical issues in
project implementation.

The task team worked closely with the authorities to engage in dialogue with stakeholders to
help overcome resistance to reform. Under the internal audit component, the Inspectorate
initially resisted the elimination of its functions. The task team helped the authorities overcome
this resistance by introducing Inspectorate officials to "Best Practice” in the European Union and
demonstrating how the modernization of internal audit is a prerequisite for EU accession. This
proved a powerful incentive for reform.

The task team helped the Project Office and MOF manage four transitions between Ministers of
Finance during the lifetime of the project. Each time a new Minister of Finance was appointed,
the task team leader (TTL) mounted a mission as soon as feasible in order to explain the
objectives of the project, its components, the next steps and challenges in implementation. The
Bank's country office in Chisinau provided valuable back-up support and follow-up throughout.

Supervision intensified as project performance deteriorated. Implementation support visits
focused on the FMIS component, which accounted for the bulk of the IDA credit and was critical
for the achievement of the PDO. In addition to the regular monitoring of progress in the field, the
Bank team conducted monthly and later weekly monitoring meetings though video conferencing.
These meetings brought together the MOF, the supplier and subcontractors and focused on
problem solving and work planning. Sector (ECSP4) and the CMU (ECCU2) management paid
particular attention to the project when agreements had to be reached on extensions and when
solutions had to be found to accelerate implementation (October 2011 – December 2012). This
included: several trips to Chisinau by ECSP4 Sector Manager to discuss the situation directly
with the Minister, including an implementation support visit directly led by the Sector Manager
on the Minister’s request in February 2012. The CMU was closely involved and the Country
Manager and Country Director held multiple meetings with the Minister.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating of moderately satisfactory is based on the following considerations. The task team
was assiduous in monitoring and reporting on project progress. Key risks were flagged and
candidly discussed with the client. The Bank team and management made a considerable effort
to help MOF resolve disagreements with its FMIS contractors. The CMU was closely involved
and supportive of the project at critical stages even as performance deteriorated.




                                                18
Notwithstanding, the robust supervision that the team put in place the team failed to ensure that
the Ministry retained adequate capacity to effectively manage a complex IT project with an
international supplier. This contributed to the breakdown in the relationship with the supplier and
made it hard for the Government to enforce penalty clauses in the contract. This problem was
identified as a risk during implementation but was never adequately addressed by the team or by
management.

With the benefit of hindsight, the Bank could have been more decisive in cutting its losses and
closing the project when faced with irreconcilable disagreements between the MOF, the lead
contractors and sub-contractors and their persistent failure to meet agreed delivery schedules.
The task team and Bank management discussed alternative project restructuring options in
November – December 2011. At Bank management’s request, the task team prepared a paper for
discussion with the Minister which included options for scaling back project activities and early
closure. Regrettably, MOF management was not willing to discuss these options and asked for
further project extensions.

Again with the benefit of hindsight, project extensions were too short in duration to signal the
Bank’s full commitment to the successful conclusion of the project. One year extensions
provided insufficient time for the authorities to negotiate contract amendments, contractors to
commit the resources needed to accelerate project implementation and the project to demonstrate
progress in system development.

4.2   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

From the design to implementation stage, the government was actively seeking advice from the
Bank where needed to implement its strategic reform agenda. The high-level commitment shown
by the management of the MOF during the early years of the project led to the satisfactory
outcomes for components 1a, 1b and 2 of the project. The Government that initiated the project
sustained this leadership and consensus over several years through several changes of Ministers.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Following the change in Government in 2009, client commitment wavered at a critical point in
the development of the FMIS system. Contract performance issues and an alleged incident of
bribery contributed to a loss of trust between the Minister and the supplier. The Minister of
Finance also expressed the opinion that the project had been imposed by the World Bank and
questioned the Bank’s position vis–à–vis HP – the main contractor for the software. This resulted
in a loss of confidence between the Minister and the TTL.

The project never fully recovered from this loss of confidence. MOF senior management lost
trust in both the main supplier of the FMIS and the Bank team leader. The Bank TTL was



                                                19
changed. At the same time, the departure of experts with experience in managing development of
a complex IT project hindered efforts to bring project implementation back on track.

Once it was clear that the FMIS component was at risk of failure, the Ministry took steps to
strengthen management. The Deputy Minister of Finance was appointed as Project Manager.
Additional project staff were hired. The Project Office and the Deputy Minister began to provide
weekly monitoring reports. However, gaps persisted in technical project management and
procurement skills. By the time an experienced IT project management adviser was appointed in
2012 it proved too late. Communication between the MOF and the contractor had deteriorated.
MOF senior management no longer trusted the contractor’s ability or commitment to deliver an
operational FMIS system.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Based on the evaluation of the Government performance and the implementing agency
performance, the overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.


5   Lessons Learned

This section addresses why project substantially failed to deliver its objectives, and identifies
lessons learned that could potentially be applied to future PFM projects, especially those that
contain substantial FMIS components. Despite the focus on the failure of the FMIS system, it
should be noted that other project components that were not linked to FMIS implementation
were successful. Medium term budgeting was rolled out successfully and has contributed to
improved budget discipline and declining deficit. Improvements in internal controls, such as
registering all government contracts, have contributed to a reduction in payment arrears. The
project has laid the foundation for modern internal audit system which is now operating
successfully across government. Key PFM training programs have been developed and are being
delivered through a government institution financed from the State budget.

The FY14-17 Country Partnership Strategy presents preliminary lessons from the
implementation of ICT projects in Moldova. Many of these lessons are directly applicable to the
implementation of FMIS projects. Based on review of the project documentation and discussions
with stakeholders, including Government, Bank staff and suppliers, the main lessons learned
from the Public Financial Management Technical Assistance Project are as follows:

It is essential that Ministries of Finance implementing complex ICT projects retain advisers
with expertise in managing large and complex ICT systems implementation projects. It is
possible that the problems in communications and mismatched expectations could have been
avoided had the initially strong team been retained or replaced with equally effective experts.
Contract management capacity is particularly important when disputes arise. Better
documentation of supplier performance issues, for example, could have put the Government in a
stronger negotiating position when it came to negotiating the terms of the final contract
amendment. ICT projects should retain ICT experts to provide strategic advice on integration of
ICTs into the sector specific domain and examine the domain for business architecture and


                                               20
business process re-engineering needs. The resultant requirements need to be planned and
executed by a client PIU that possesses in-house expertise to prepare technical bidding
documents and ensure appropriate vendor and contract management

Projects can be more effective if PFM reforms are not linked to the implementation of the
FMIS system. For example, the new budget classification system could have been implemented
if the existing treasury system had been updated as an interim step. This was proposed by the
task team during implementation but rejected by the MOF on the grounds that they were not
prepared to test the new budget classification system through a parallel system in the middle of a
complex reform and did not have the means and time needed to run and test these interim
systems in parallel. Development of existing systems or interim stand-alone solutions could be
used to improve the quality of financial management and potentially increase the chances of a
successful transition to a full IFMIS.

A realistic time frame for the design and implementation of a complex FMIS project is
seven to eight years. Implementation time frames can be reduced by completing FMIS and
business process reengineering design work during project preparation. However, design
adjustments and resulting delays are not uncommon: Bank-wide, some 70 percent of technical
assistance/financial management operations have had to be extended at least once, sometimes
two or three times. A clear understanding of the nature of IT projects at their start, their
implementation challenges and unusual back-ended disbursement profile can help reduce the
frustrations and disagreements among key stakeholders.

Project extensions should be long enough to allow the stakeholders to bring about changes
in project performance. Both the Ministry of Finance and the main supplier commented that
the extension periods were too short for any major restructuring to take place. Several months of
each extension period was spent in negotiating the contract amendment, leaving little time for
development work.

The design of World Bank standard bidding documents for IT projects should be reviewed
to assess their suitability. Suppliers complained that the provisions on system testing and
acceptance in particular gave rise to problems during implementation. International competitive
bidding (ICB) documents are complex and not designed to support complex information system
implementation. Qualification requirements and lengthy procedures (which are difficult to
understand for many client countries without external advisory support) lead to delays in
procurement phase (the two-stage ICB took about 2 years in this project). The standard contract
does not provide for any penalties to be applied for delays due to the Purchaser.

Resistance to change should be anticipated and the project should retain consensus
building and communications arrangements throughout implementation. The project was
built on a consensus of major stakeholders, followed a careful process of consultation, and strong
leadership form the Minister of Finance. This consensus building process was not followed
through to project implementation. Consequently, the project was particularly vulnerable to
political changes and resistance to change on the part of Ministry officials. A better
understanding of the winners and losers and more active steps to manage potential resistance to
change could have helped in identifying and managing risks before and during implementation.

6   Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

When asked to comment on the Bank’s performance both the borrower and the supplier focused
on the dispute that lay at the heart of the project’s failure.

In the supplier’s view the Bank system is not well adapted to IT projects and is more geared
towards the delivery of goods and works. In particular the supplier felt that the right of
inspection, as interpreted by the MoF, contributed to delays, because the Ministry carried out
extensive testing of software prior to it being fully ready for normal acceptance testing.

In the view of the Government the standard contract should require a higher level of on-site
presence by the main supplier. The Government also criticized the contract provisions on
payment, which they saw as favoring the contractor and forcing the Government to pay out the
majority of the contract value in spite of its failure to deliver of a working FMIS system.
However, the payment conditions were defined by the MOF and later on revised by both parties
(MoF and supplier) through jointly accepted amendments, approved by the Bank.

Despite project closing MoF management has stated that they wish complete the development of
the budget execution system and other components so that they can have an integrated FMIS
solution. MOF has discussed options for financing this from ongoing World Bank-financed
projects. The Minister proposed two options: (i) using e-Moldova project funds to support the
development of the new Treasury (budget execution) system with; or (ii) initiating a new project
to complete the development of integrated FMIS. The team suggested the improvement of
existing treasury system as an interim solution to support new budget classification / chart of
accounts in 2014, since a new project, or reallocation of funds from other projects may not be
possible in the near future.
