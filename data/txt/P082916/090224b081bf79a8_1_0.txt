                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to be at high risk of not achieving its development objectives. The project was restructured in December 2012 to extend the closing date to December 31, 2013.
                         The Ministry of Finance and Supplier agreed to develop the remaining financial management information system (FMIS) functionality based on a revised implementation schedule,
                         which would be formalized through a new contract amendment in January 2013. The resolution of these issues, through a signed amendment expected by April 2013, has been

                         delayed once again. Discussions on the amendment continue to focus on defining the scope of remaining work, finalizing revised implementation schedule and contractual language
                         of clauses in the amendment. The milestones of initiating trial operations in April 2013 and completing the Operational Acceptance in September 2013, as agreed by the two parties
                         during the restructuring, have been delayed; and it is now unlikely that the FMIS, which is the biggest project component and the remaining project output to be delivered, may not be
                         completed before the project closes in December 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project closing date has been extended until December 31, 2013. Due to significant delays the World Bank has downgraded the rating of the project to Unsatisfactory. The World
                         Bank has communicated to the Ministry of finance that the project will not be extended beyond the December 2013 closing date, under any circumstances. The World Bank also
                         informed the Ministry of Finance that the Bank can only process withdrawal applications for IDA Credit 4082 received on or before December 31, 2013 and that the final withdrawal
                         applications should be accompanied by a completion and acceptance certificate for the FMIS solution from the Borrower.
