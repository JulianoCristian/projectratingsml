{"cdata!": "Soil bioengineering is a useful and\n            effective technology for slope stabilization and soil\n            conservation. Soil bioengineering is defined as 'the\n            use of living plant materials to construct structures that\n            perform an engineering function'. The technology is\n            simple, low cost, and effective, requires little to no\n            maintenance, is environmentally friendly, and sustainable.\n            Soil bioengineering structures used for slope stabilization\n            include retaining walls, check dams and mechanical barriers\n            for fixing loose soil on landslides and fill slopes. In\n            addition to slope stabilization, soil bioengineering\n            structures are also used to control gully and river bank\n            erosion. Gullies commonly occur on landslides and fill\n            slopes if treatment is not given in time and landslides are\n            also triggered by undercutting from river and channel\n            erosion. Soil bioengineering retaining walls are effective\n            in stabilizing slips and small landslides. Necessary\n            information about local tree and grass species suitable for\n            soil bioengineering was collected during the visit to\n            Timor?Leste, including establishing the most suitable season\n            for conducting soil bioengineering activities."}, "docdt": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
