similar to those of the ongoing Second Social Fund project\n            (see report number 14489), include improved access among the\n            poor to social and economic infrastructure; empowerment on a\n            pilot basis of poor rural communities and/or communes to\n            identify, organize, manage funds, and implement sub-projects\n            responsive to community needs in order to achieve\n            decentralized social and economic development; employment\n            creation; and improved capacity in the private sector. There\n            are three project components: 1) communal infrastructure\n            rehabilitation and construction; 2) capacity building for\n            communes, rural communities/local associations, and private\n            sector (small contractors, consultants, artisans, skilled\n            labor and nongovernmental organizations) --in very specific\n            cases study tours could be envisaged abroad; and 3)\n            equipment purchases, operating costs, staff training,\n            audits, and studies for the social development fund."}, "docdt": "1999-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
