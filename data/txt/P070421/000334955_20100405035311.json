The\n            resettlement policy addresses the direct and indirect\n            impacts of project construction and operation on affected\n            persons, families, households, communities, and groups. The\n            most direct and immediate impacts are those associated with\n            project construction, mainly land acquisition. Other losses\n            include loss of shelter, and other assets within the\n            project's corridor of impact as well as roadside\n            structure, business establishments, and public facilities.\n            Mitigation is provided through compensation and assistance\n            to project-affected persons. These social units are entitled\n            to compensation and assistance on the basis of this policy\n            framework adopted by the project. Mitigation is provided for\n            loss of assets, including land and house or workplace; loss\n            of livelihood or income opportunities and collective impacts\n            on groups, such as loss of community assets, common property\n            resources, and others. The people likely to be affected by\n            loss of assets and livelihood will be surveyed and\n            registered, and project monitoring and evaluation will\n            compare long-term impact against baseline socio-economic\n            data. Mitigation and support mechanisms for those affected\n            by collective impacts are collectively-oriented, and these\n            efforts will be monitored to examine the impacts and\n            benefits for the groups involved."}, "docdt": "2003-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
