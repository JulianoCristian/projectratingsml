development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: Decentralization of task leadership and\n            supervision of the project to the Bank country office\n            enables continuous project monitoring and timely addressing\n            of emerging implementation issues. Due to decentralized task\n            leadership and supervision of KSHIP, the Bank team was able\n            to provide continuous and rigorous monitoring of project\n            implementation and conduct frequent site visits. As a\n            result, many critical issues received timely and adequate\n            attention from the Bank side. Institutional and policy\n            reforms should be implemented incrementally and\n            sequentially. Implementation of reforms takes a lot of time,\n            because it takes time to get political consensus, build\n            ownership, change the mindset, and re-design some of the\n            reforms to adjust to new circumstances. Some of the reforms\n            (i.e., establishment of Road Fund (RF), moving from a\n            traditional works executing agency to a corporatized roads\n            managing agency) planned in KSHIP eventually spill over to a\n            follow-on project. When the project plans to have major,\n            sophisticated policy and institutional interventions, it\n            should take an incremental approach to - sector reforms,\n            with phased actions to modernize and strengthen a minimum\n            set of core management functions within the existing\n            context. Post-qualification allows more competition than\n            pre-qualification. The experience in procurement of works\n            contracts showed that post qualification is likely to get a\n            more competitive price."}, "docdt": "2008-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
