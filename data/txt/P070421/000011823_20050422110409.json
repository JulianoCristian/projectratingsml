Impacts from location\n            include changes in gravity flow irrigation, a rise in the\n            water table, extensive deforestation, and improper road\n            drainage systems. To mitigate these impacts, raise the\n            height of roads to prevent contamination, establish deep cut\n            drains, pave the shoulders to keep them free from vegetative\n            growth, and restrain truckers from overloading. Impacts due\n            to road design will be alleviated as follows: to arrest\n            traffic pollution, absorb noise, and provide an alternative\n            fuel source, trees will be replanted on roadsides. During\n            construction borrow pits will be restored and dressed to\n            create a slope consistent with the level of adjoining land.\n            Maintaining earthen drains and limiting construction\n            activities for bridges and culverts to the dry season will\n            help reduce soil quality deterioration and the resulting\n            water pollution. Disposing of solid and liquid wastes, and\n            stream courses and drainage will help maintain water\n            quality. To control dust, asphalt and hot mix plants will be\n            located away from inhabited areas; trucks will be covered;\n            and machinery and equipment will be maintained. During the\n            operational phase, emission checks will reduce pollution,\n            planting will help prevent surface run-off, and accidents\n            involving hazardous cargo will be offset by an emergency\n            response system."}, "docdt": "2005-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
