F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The project development objective (PDO) was to improve the core road network (CRN) in
Karnataka. To meet the PDO, the project was expected to generate the following outputs: (i)
enhancement of the capacity and quality of the core state highway network through road
upgrading and rehabilitation; (ii) safer transit on selected corridors through a pilot road safety
program; (iii) improved allocation and provision of adequate funding for the road sector; and (iv)
more efficient and effective network management and delivery of road infrastructure services.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 During the 1990s Karnataka State had one of the lowest road densities (at 654 km per
1000 sq. km) among Indian states. Except for village roads, there was negligible extension of the
total length of the network, and little capacity expansion of the primary network. The
government's investment in improving and expanding the core state road network was
inadequate compared to the transport demand, which was increasing rapidly. The capacity
constraints of the road network were exacerbated by inadequate attention to and funding for road
maintenance and the lack of a rational and strategic road maintenance management framework
for resource allocation. During the 1990s, funding for road maintenance was about 60 % of the
requirements based on the recommendation of Government of India's 10th Finance Commission,
which was itself based on rather low unit rates. The Karnataka Public Works Department (PWD)
was generally perceived as a traditional public road agency; it lacked adequate capacity to
manage and maintain the road network effectively and to meet the transport demand of a
modernizing economy. Private sector participation was limited in the development of road sector.
In addition, inadequate attention was paid to road safety although the fatality rate was very high -
18 deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles, compared with U.S.A 3.2 and Malaysia 5.5 deaths per
10,000 registered vehicles.

1.1.2 The Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP) was designed to contribute
to (i) increasing investment in state highways (SHs) and major district roads (MDRs) to meet the
requirements of a rapidly growing demand for road transport, by improving the flow of traffic on
highly congested corridors in the state's primary road network; (ii) developing an effective
maintenance management system in the PWD, and reducing the backlog of periodic maintenance
on high priority SHs; (iii) transforming PWD into an efficient modern road agency, and
developing a sustainable funding and management system for state roads; (iv) facilitating both
short and longer term interventions to improve road safety; and (v) supporting the participation
of private sector consulting firms and contractors in the design, construction and rehabilitation of
the state roads.

1.1.3 The Bank's involvement was expected to accelerate the institutional and policy reform in
the state, contribute to the achievement of Karnataka's ambitious investment program in the road
sector and encourage mobilization of additional financing from other sources, by bringing in its
extensive experience from other countries with institutional and maintenance challenges and
fostering improved practices in project management, engineering design and construction,
procurement, environment, land acquisition, resettlement, and construction supervision.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 The project development objective (PDO) was to improve the core road network (CRN)
in Karnataka. The CRN was defined here as SHs plus the most heavily trafficked major district
roads (MDRs).




                                                 1

1.2.2 To meet the PDO, the project was expected to produce the following outputs:

(i)     enhancement of the capacity and quality of the core state highway network through road
        upgrading and rehabilitation;
(ii)    safer transit on selected corridors through a pilot road safety program;
(iii)   improved allocation and provision of adequate funding for the road sector; and
(iv)    more efficient and effective network management and delivery of road infrastructures
        services.

1.2.3 The following key performance indicators were used to monitor the achievement of PDO:

(i)     the share of SHs in good condition (International Roughness Index (IRI)<4m/km
        increased from 5% to 15 % by mid-term review (MTR) and 30% by the end of project
        (EOP);
(ii)    reduction by 10% of SH links with volume to capacity ratio >1.0 by EOP;
(iii)   travel time between end points reduced by 20% on about 500 km of selected state
        highway corridors by MTR and a further 500 km by EOP;
(iv)    portion of SHs in bad condition (above 7m/km IRI) reduced from 90% to 80% by MTR
        and 70% by EOP;
(v)     number of fatal road accidents per 10,000 vehicles registered reduced from 18 to 16 by
        MTR and 14 by EOP; and
(vi)    living standards of more than 75% of project affected families (PAFs) improved after
        completion of resettlement action plan (RAP).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1 The PDO and Key Indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary beneficiaries of the project were the agricultural and manufacturing sectors
that rely on an effective transport system to enhance their productivity and hence contribute to
the growth of the state's economy. In addition, the project was expected to benefit some 725,000
villagers who live along and near the project corridors. They were expected to derive economic
and social benefits from better access and enhanced mobility. Of these villagers, 49% were
women, 16% were Scheduled Castes, and nearly 4% were Scheduled Tribes. The project was
expected to serve overall 272 villages and 67 taluks in 15 districts and provide better access to
791 schools, 161 health centers, and 48 trading markets. The 50 million people living in the state
of Karnataka would also benefit indirectly from the improvement in the state's economy and
better connectivity and integration of the state resulting from the project.

1.4.2 The secondary beneficiaries of the project were the staff of Karnataka PWD at the central
and field levels and the construction industry in the State and outside the State. The institutional
strengthening component included introduction and implementation of a computerized financial
management system, substantial procedural reform in PWD through the development of a new

Departmental Code with respect to environment and social safeguards, procurement reform
through development and application of improved standard civil works bidding documents.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1 The project had the following components:

Component 1: Upgrading and widening of SHs (US$315 million).This component was
expected to support an increase in the capacity and structural strength of part of the CRN through
the upgrading and widening of about 1,000 km of priority SHs and construction of about 50 km
of new bypasses.

Component 2: Rehabilitation of SHs & MDRs (US$107.2 million). This component aimed at
reducing the periodic maintenance backlog on the CRN by funding the overlaying, resealing, and
minor rehabilitation of about 1,300 km of SHs and MDRs.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening, Advisory Technical Assistance, Training,
Equipment, and Pre-investment Studies (US$17 million). This component aimed at financing
consultant services and Technical Assistance and Training programs to facilitate the
implementation of the Institutional Development Strengthening (IDS) action plan designed to
strengthen the overall institutional capacity of the PWD. It was also expected to fund the short-
and medium-term training activities of PWD managers and staff, office equipment for
implementing an e-governance program within the PWD, laboratory modernization,
development of road management systems, other logistical support including vehicles, and
techno-economic feasibility and detailed engineering studies for future road investment projects.

Component 4: Pilot Highway Safety Program (US$4 million). This component was expected
to finance civil works for the implementation of engineering and traffic management measures to
enhance road safety and mitigate traffic accidents at selected black spot locations along the
project corridor. The component supported Technical Assistance and consulting services for
safety audits and the development of a proposed safety management system and equipment for
safety management system.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The original components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 There were no significant changes in the scale or scope of the project. The unallocated
loan amount of US$29.4 million as well as some small unutilized loan proceeds were reallocated
to accommodate the increase in costs due to price escalation and variations.

1.7.2 The Credit closing date was extended by 10 months from December 31, 2006 to October
31, 2007 to accommodate delays in the civil works due to delays by some contractors, design
changes, slight increase in the scope of work, procurement delays and force majeure event of
extended monsoon season during 2005-06.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1. Preparation and design. The project design reflected lessons learned from previous Bank
road sector experience in India and other countries. In particular, they revolved around: (i)
sufficient implementation readiness at the time of project approval to ensure quality at entry, (ii)
adequate institutional capacities for project management and contract administration, (iii) client
ownership for implementing institutional development measures, (iv) experience with bank
procurement procedures and timely procurement decisions, (v) stronger capabilities and
capacities than many domestic contractors and consultants possess, and (vi) timely land
acquisition and implementation of a RAP to prevent delays in civil works progress.

2.1.2. Risk and mitigation measures. Most of the risks were properly identified and mitigation
measures developed. However, there was a risk that had impact on the project implementation,
and obviously needed different mitigation measures than determined at appraisal. This concerns
lack of effective collaboration between PWD, Forest Department and local governments. During
the course of project implementation, the Bank and project team developed new mitigation
measures, including a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between PWD and Forest
Department, to minimize the impact of this risk.

2.1.3. Government's commitment and participatory process. The GOK demonstrated a high
level of commitment to and ownership of the project and reform in the road sector through a
series of actions: (i) increased budgetary allocations for the primary road network from US$31
million in FY1998-99 to US$100 million in FY2000-01 with the promise to increase to about
$228 million in FY2004-05 under the MTFP, (ii) development of an Infrastructure Policy where
the GOK committed to substantially increase funding for maintenance to reduce the funding gap,
(iii) establishment of a Task Force on roads by the Chief Minister to identify road sector
institutional constraints and recommend solutions, (iv) an amendment to the State Highways Act
facilitating private sector financing of road infrastructure, (v) establishment of the Karnataka
Road Development Corporation Ltd. (KRDCL) with the aim of promoting private investment in
the road sector and accelerating road development in the state through corporatization of some
traditional functions of the PWD, (vi) adoption of a Karnataka Transparency in Public
Procurements Act, 2000, making tendering compulsory and aiming at streamlining the
procedures for inviting, processing and accepting tenders, (vii) adoption of measures to improve
the operational efficiency and transparency of road works, (viii) preparation of an information
technology strategy by the PWD in January 2001 to support the implementation of an e-
governance program in the PWD and development of a GIS-based road information system, and
(ix) establishment of a Karnataka State Road Safety Council and many District Safety Councils,
and initiation of other actions to address poor road safety in the state.

2.1.4. The participatory approach adopted during project preparation included formal and
informal consultations, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, meetings and workshops.
The key participants included affected persons, local villagers and Panchayat leaders, NGOs,
government departments, academics and the press. The views of stakeholders were incorporated




                                                  4

in the project design and led to improvements in the engineering design and safety measures
betterment in alignments, and extension of compensation to vulnerable squatters.

2.1.5. Quality at Entry. A Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) for the project carried out by the
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in August 2001 rated QEA as "Satisfactory" commending the
project for the focus on the much needed physical needs of the Karnataka State's road sector and
correct recognition that the physical improvements alone without reforms in the sector
governance and its capacity would not sustain project outcomes. It also cited the following
strengths: (i) development of a sound strategy to build external pressure for change within the
Karnataka PWD through the promotion of user surveys and stakeholder forums; (ii) coordination
of institutional development in the road sector with the broader state level public resource
management framework, (iii) the procurement strategy in terms of sizing of contracts and pre-
qualification to promote modernization of private construction industry; and (iv) the state's and
PWD's commitment to support e-governance and a financial management system to meet LACI
requirements. However, the QAG raised a concern regarding the success of the intended reforms
and implementation plan because the PWD was a first-time implementing agency for the Bank-
supported project while the loan size was large, client capacity was weak and the level of
commitment for completing the agreed reforms was difficult to ascertain in absence of any
conditionality or monitorable triggers. The ICR broadly concurs with the QAG Assessment, and
rates the quality at entry satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1. Implementation was satisfactory throughout the course of the project. The following were
the main factors that affected implementation in the project life:

Delays in implementation of safeguards and pre-construction activities. Slow and lengthy land
acquisition process, which on average took 28 months and was largely beyond the control of the
implementing agency, affected the progress of land acquisition (LA) for the project. The
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and removal of encumbrances were also implemented with
some delays. These were mainly due to (i) high turn-over of key staff dealing with LA and R&R,
and (ii) delays in filling key vacancies. Some changes made in the designs during project
implementation resulted in additional land acquisition and resettlement which in turn contributed
to delays in civil works. The GOK is now revising the Resettlement and Land Acquisition Policy
principles and provisions based on the experience of KSHIP and the provisions of the new
National R&R policy.

The repair and routine maintenance works under contract M32A for Road Corridor 10A, which
was part of the rehabilitation component, are not completed and were still pending at the time of
writing the ICR because of delay in environmental regulatory clearances. The PWD received
permission from the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Indian Board for Wildlife in
October 2007, but it was still waiting for permission from the Central Empowered Committee,
constituted by the Supreme Court of India. Since the project is closed, the works under this
contract will be funded by GOK after environmental regulatory clearances have been obtained.




                                                5

Poor contract management by contractors. The project was the first major externally funded
roads project in the state of Karnataka. Prior to this project, although most improvement
contracts were undertaken by private sector contractors there was no emphasis placed on their
management capacity and understanding of international standards for road contracts. Because of
this, most of the local contractors faced technical capacity constraints and lacked proper
construction management skills and experience in resources planning and execution. As a result,
some contractors fell behind schedule and required contract time extensions, which led to
significant cost increases in supervision contracts. During project implementation, extensive
training was delivered to PWD staff and contractors on modern contract management techniques,
which enhanced the technical capacity and organization of the local contractors.

Slow progress by an international contractor who won 5 NCB packages. The international
contractor that won 5 NCB rehabilitation contracts made about 4% of progress. The prices of the
contracts were 30% below the estimate, on average. To make some profit, the international
contractor tried to subcontract to local contractors at lower prices, but failed. Eventually, these
contracts were terminated and re-bid.

Lack of capacity of the PWD to manage the road safety component. Despite GOK's and
PWD's strong commitment to road safety improvement in the State, the road safety component
did not install a road accident analysis system and did not undertake a thorough road safety audit.
That was mainly due to the lack of capacity of the PWD whose staff are not trained in transport
and safety regulation. These are done by the Transport Department. Eventually, the PWD re-bid
the consultancy services for installation of the accident analysis system before the closure of the
project, which together with road safety audits will be supported in the proposed follow-on
project to be funded by the Bank.

Extended monsoon season during 2005-06. The unprecedented heavy monsoon rains that
affected Karnataka during 2005-06 caused flooding in project areas and delayed the completion
of some works and the start of some contracts that had been awarded just before the rains came.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1. Overall monitoring and evaluation was the responsibility of the PWD, the implementing
agency. The monitoring and evaluation system was well established for the project and was rated
satisfactory by supervision missions. It was primarily focused on a resettlement impact
assessment and road user satisfaction surveys, which included a baseline survey and two repeat
surveys during project implementation. In addition, the PWD also undertook monitoring and
evaluation of black spots improvement. The project had monitoring indicators for outputs and
inputs. While baseline data were not available for many of the indicators at appraisal, they were
collected during the first year of the project implementation. Since then, every supervision
mission reported on all key performance indicators, which built a consistent track record of
project achievements. The road user satisfaction surveys enabled the PWD to learn about road
users' perception of the PWD's performance and areas for its improvement.




                                                 6

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1. Safeguard compliance is rated satisfactory. The rating takes into account
implementation of both social and environmental safeguards as discussed below.

Social aspects. A Social Assessment was carried out as part of the project preparation with the
participation of stakeholders in analyzing the positive and adverse impacts of the project. The
interests and suggestions of local people for improving designs, modifications in the alignments,
compensation calculation, extending benefits to squatters were accommodated to the extent
possible in the final designs. The PWD also developed and adopted for the project an R&R
Policy to address the adverse impacts systematically, which was consistent with the Bank's OD
4.30 and relevant local laws and acts. A RAP was prepared and laid out measures for addressing
the identified social issues, and ways for extending support and assistance to the affected people.
The project also targeted social inclusion by making the affected squatters and encroachers
eligible for assistance and support under R&R program who otherwise would not have been
eligible for any assistance under local laws and procedures. High turn-over of the key LA and
R&R staff and consequent understaffing in Social Development and Resettlement Cell affected
progress in the implementation of LA and RAP during the first years of the project life.

The magnitude of land acquisition and resettlement in this project was 90 ha of private land
belonging to 1,260 landowners and impacted 2,520 non-title holders consisting of 265
households losing houses and another 404 households losing livelihoods. The compensation and
assistance were provided to all these affected people in compliance with R&R entitlements,
except for those few families (about 45) who migrated to nearby towns or adjoining villages and
were not available. At the beginning of the project the district level grievance redress committees
were set up under the Chairmanship of the Deputy Commissioner to deal with grievances related
to LA and R&R implementation in all project affected districts. About 25 families used a
grievance redress mechanism and received entitlements.

There was a delay in implementation of R&R policy in Athni, Nagamangala,
Chikkanayakanhalli and Siriguppa (none originally included in the project), where the local
authorities demolished properties of encroachers without offering compensation and assistance.
However, after this problem came to the attention of the Bank team, the PWD promptly carried
out an assessment of impacts, prepared an action plan suggesting the remedial measure in
accordance with policy provisions and accordingly extended the assistance to those affected
people.

The compensation and assistance were delivered to all eligible available affected people; the few
instances of eviction were resolved in a timely manner with appropriate remedial measures and
the impact assessment confirmed that the overall living standards of the project affected people
have improved compared to the baseline situation and the controlled population of similar living
conditions. The results of the resettlement impact assessment study are presented in Section 3.5.a.

Environmental aspects. The project was classified as environmental category A because of the
possible significant impacts from upgrading of about 1,000 km and rehabilitation of about 1,300



                                                7

km of SHs and MDRs. All roads were subject to Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) as
per Bank's OP 4.01 prior to appraisal. In addition, a more detailed Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) and a comprehensive Environment Management Plan (EMP) were prepared
and extensive public consultation and participation meetings were held by the PWD and its
consultants to seek inputs from the impacted public.

In Phase II, separate EAs were prepared for several roads to confirm the extent of adverse
impacts on sensitive environment habitats traversed by these roads. The clearances from GOI
were obtained for one of the two roads passing through the national park and sanctuary, with the
necessary safeguards for protection being included in the works contracts. With regard to
maintenance works (not upgrading or rehabilitation) on the other road (contract M32A for road
corridor 10a) going through the Rajiv Gandhi National Park, the regulatory clearance from the
Central Empowered Committee was still pending at the time of writing the ICR. A more rigorous
EA and a stand-alone bio-diversity assessment should have been conducted for this road to
strengthen the environmental control for maintenance works in the protected areas. Since the
project is closed, the works on this road are being funded by the GOK.

EMP was an integral part of the contracts and its implementation was monitored by the PWD
and its environmental consultants, although the enforcement of some environmental management
measures that were incidental to works such as proper storage, re-utilization and/or disposal of
debris, clearance of culverts, etc. was lacking in several contracts due to the understaffing of
PWD environmental team. Regulatory clearances under the Forest (Conservation) Act were
delayed due to differences in interpretation of ownership of land between the PWD and Forest
Department and late identification of the issue. There were delays in obtaining the required
permissions in a few of these rehabilitation packages in the Western Ghats, even after extensive
discussions with the Forest Department and Revenue officials. While the tree planting envisaged
in the project was behind the original schedule due to delayed completion of some contracts, the
Forest Department assured that the project target of 100,000 saplings along the roadside was
achieved.

Sensitization training programs were provided to the contractors on the implementation of EMP.
An environmental supervision manual was prepared which helped streamline an environmental
management function within the project management team at the PWD. Although this manual
was not streamlined as such into the entire PWD, the principles were incorporated into the
Departmental Code developed by the PWD outside the project. Continuity of staff was key to
satisfactory implementation of environmental management measures in the project. The same
EM officials at the PWD were in place for almost the entire project and World Bank staff team
also had only one change in its environmental safeguard specialist. This ensured that the same
message was delivered to the ground staff with the same degree of conviction and therefore,
importance of environmental management was clearly established.

2.4.2. Fiduciary compliance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Disbursement. There were some lags in disbursement, but eventually the project caught up and
disbursement was on target. Financial reporting suffered from frequent delays in submission of
reports and non-compliance of reports to the agreed format. For accounting and reporting on



                                                 8

project expenditures, a computerized project financial management system (PFMS) was
developed during project preparation. It was rolled out to the PWD HQ, 16 PWD Division
Offices, 5 Circle Offices and 3 Zonal Offices in September 2004. The quality of reporting was
good until 2005. Several glitches were discovered in the software and the roll out of the PFMS to
the rest of the PWD was delayed: (i) until upgrading and enhancement to the system was made,
and (ii) because its rolling-out was taken over by the E-governance Department of GOK which
undertook a separate exercise for implementing contract management and e-procurement across
GOK. The PFMS was finally dropped and the accounts were reconciled manually by the
consultant by December 2007.

During the ICR preparation, the e-Governance Department initiated the piloting of a unified e-
procurement platform for all government departments, including in the PWD. The platform has
six modules and one of them provides contract management and FM system. It was agreed that
the new software would be in line with the requirements of KSHIP FM system.

The loan was fully disbursed by EOP and the Bank recovered the Special Account advance
(US$25 million) by the deadline of the 4-month grace period which ended on February 29, 2008.

Procurement. Procurement of works, goods and services was carried out in accordance with
Bank guidelines, and the bidding processes were conducted in a fair and transparent manner. On
average, 5 bids were received when there was pre-qualification and 7 when there was post-
qualification (including both ICB and NCB packages). In case of the post-qualification prices
were found more competitive. Delays in the award of contracts resulted in one loan closing date
extension that could have been avoided with more efficient procurement. Both project authorities
and the Bank team undertook a more judicious follow up toward the end of the project, which
may have contributed to more expeditious management of contracts. In 2005 the supervision
mission noted the lack of improvement in the timeliness of procurement for service contracts and
requested the PWD to apply a more rigorous monitoring system of such procurement for the
remaining 2-3 pending cases. Procurement of all tasks was completed before project closure,
including some small services required for the ISO certification of the identified PWD divisions
valued in aggregate at less than US$500,000.

Based on lessons learnt from KSHIP, the PWD revised its standard bidding documents (SBDs)
and procurement procedures, which were approved by the State Cabinet. The PWD staff,
suppliers and contractors have been trained to use the revised procedures and SBDs. The PWD is
also participating in the state-wide pilot of the e-procurement platform which is expected to
expedite the entire process from estimate preparation to bill processing.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1. Operation & Maintenance. The PWD has decided to undertake the maintenance of 30
roads (with an aggregate length of 1,790 km) completed under KSHIP through long-term
performance-based contracts. These contract packages are planned to be awarded in the coming
months. For all other roads, a more comprehensive public-private partnership (PPP) program is
envisaged.




                                                9

2.5.2. Sustainability of reforms and institutional capacity. The project had a very ambitious
reform agenda, but it managed to make headways in most reforms targeted. A number of studies
and policy recommendations were developed under KSHIP. These efforts will be further
supported by the proposed follow-on project, which would provide more support to
operationalization of RF and institutional strengthening of KRDCL, that is becoming an
increasingly lead agency in managing the State's CRN.

2.5.3. Follow-on project. The GOK is developing another road project for external funding.
The sector reforms and process improvements achieved with the support of KSHIP would be
consolidated in the follow-on project. The PWD is currently finalizing a sector policy for road
development, a new LA and R&R policy, EA and EMP departmental code and an operational
manual. The sector policy will be within the framework of the central and state laws and
regulations. The PWD, with a grant from Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
(PPIAF) Sub-national Technical Assistance, is preparing a financing plan to promote PPP and
domestic borrowing in the road sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project's relevance is rated highly satisfactory.

3.1.1. The PDO remains highly relevant to both GOI's current Tenth Plan and the Bank's India
Country Strategy of September 2004. Both the Tenth Plan and Country Strategy emphasize
improvement and expansion of key infrastructure, including the road network, which underpin
accelerated growth and improved service delivery. Improvement of the public sector institutional
performance, which was at the core of the project design and implementation, is equally relevant
to both the Tenth Plan's and Bank's Country Strategy's priorities. Implementation of policy and
governance reforms in the project was important for addressing capacity and quality constraints
in the road sector.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1. The achievement of the PDO is rated satisfactory. The rating takes into account
achievement of the key associated outcome targets set at appraisal.

(i)     Enhancement of the capacity of and quality of the core state highway network through
        road upgrading and rehabilitation (Achieved). The project enhanced the capacity and
        improved the quality of 874 km of high priority state roads through upgrading and
        widening and of 1,250 km through rehabilitation. The share of the SHs in good condition
        (IRI<4m/km) increased from 5% at appraisal to 37%, while the share of SHs in bad
        condition (IRI> 7m/km) decreased from 90% to 52% by EOP. The travel time was
        reduced by 30-35% on the improved roads. The significant improvement in the road
        condition is also in part because of the substantial funding for road maintenance under
        government budget.




                                                 10

(ii)   Safer transit on selected corridors through a pilot road safety program. (Achieved).As
       per M&E, the road accident deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles declined from 16
       before the start of the project to 11.62 in the State by EOP. As per Road User Satisfaction
       Survey (RUSS), in 2002 53% of road users felt unsafe on NHs, 66% on SHs and 75% on
       MDRs, while in 2007 only 39% felt unsafe on NHs, 30% on SHs, and 42% on MDRs.
       The safety situation was improved through implementation of counter measures on the 25
       blackspots identified at appraisal. Nearly 30% of the blackspots did not have any
       accidents at all, and the rest had a decline in accidents in the range of 35%-88% by EOP.

(iii)  Improved allocation and provision of adequate funding for the road sector (Achieved).
       Allocation and provision of funding for the State's road sector was improved by EOP.
       There was only 1% variance between the MTFP budget and actual allocations reduced;
       there was no funding gap for the maintenance of PWD roads. The installation and use of
       the Road Information System in planning made a significant contribution to improvement
       in funding of the State's road network. Overall, during project implementation PWD
       experienced a substantial decline in variance between MTFP planned expenditures and
       actual allocation for O&M of the road network (Table 1).

      Table 1. MTFP planned expenditure and actual allocation for O&M of roads during 2001-2007
     FY     Planned Expenditures (MTFP), Rs. Billion     Actual Allocation, Rs. Billion Variance, %
  2001-02                      4.52                                  3.51                   22%
  2002-03                      4.52                                  2.11                   53%
  2003-04                      3.92                                  2.51                   36%
  2004-05                      4.01                                  3.33                   17%
  2005-06                      5.13                                  2.62                   49%
  2006-07                     10.18                                 10.11                    1%

(iv)   Efficient and effective network management and delivery of road infrastructure
       services. (Partially achieved). Efficient and effective network management and delivery
       of road infrastructure services were achieved through the following (i) the establishment
       of the Karnataka State Highway Traffic and Transport Authority as an advisory body for
       policy, planning, quality control and road safety; (ii) installation and use of Road
       Information System in planning and reporting; (iii) establishment of environmental unit
       in the PWD focused on the implementation of safeguards in PWD's road projects; and
       (iv) gaining experience in implementation of long-term performance-based road
       maintenance. The study on the establishment of a Road Fund (RF) was completed and the
       State Cabinet is considering its recommendations. The PPIAF grant has recently been
       obtained to set up the RF whose mandate will be to support maintenance and operation
       and service domestic debt. The follow-on project would continue providing support to the
       operation of the RF.

3.3 Efficiency

Efficiency in achieving the PDO in terms of EIRR is moderately satisfactory.




                                                 11

3.3.1. The ex-post economic analysis was carried out using the HDM-IV Version 1.3, and
followed the same methodology used at appraisal. More details on the ex-post analysis are given
in Annex 3.

3.3.2. The overall weighted-average EIRR for the upgrading and rehabilitation components are
35.7% and 18.45%, respectively, which are below estimations at appraisal: 50.4% and 28.5%,
respectively. However, there is a large variance with the EIRR on the sample roads, whereby
50% of the sample upgraded roads and 60% of the sample rehabilitated roads have higher EIRRs
than those estimated at appraisal. Despite escalation of unit prices, the final EIRRs are generally
robust because of (i) increase in traffic volume and (ii) increase in benefits from reduction of
vehicle operating costs (VOCs), especially savings from fuel costs. For some of the packages
that experienced lower traffic volumes, the economic returns are still higher due to lower capital
costs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1. The overall outcome is rated satisfactory given the high relevance and efficiency of the
project, and achievement of the project objective. The project remains highly relevant to the
GOK's and the India Country Strategy's development priorities for improving connectivity.
However, it is recognized that the sector reform agenda and the results from the extensive
analytical, procedural, and capacity building efforts carried out under the project need to be
developed further into more mature policy and institutional measures and embedded within the
concerned PWD. There is good indication that such development will continue.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1. Reinstatement of livelihoods of the project affected people. The resettlement impact
assessment study conducted at EOP reveals that 86 % of households have improved their
incomes and the proportion of families living below poverty line has reduced by 12 %. Housing
conditions of those displaced have improved in the resettlement colonies and they have access to
electricity and drinking water facility (albeit some pending road and drainage works). In these
colonies, post-resettlement, after an initial drop in the income levels in the initial days of
settlement, adult workers have been successful in finding alternative employment opportunities
and raising their income level. The impact assessment puts the quality of housing provided under
the project to the affected families as superior when compared with the housing offered under
Government programs for poorer families.

3.5.2. Changes in Living Standards. The resettlement had an impact on the income, occupation,
ownership of assets, housing, access to services and indebtness. Average annual household
income increased by 21% to Rs.56,256, which is 38% higher than for unaffected people. There is
an increase in people working in commerce/trade and services, an increase in ownership of two-
wheelers and televisions. Almost 31% of households availed debt as compared to 16% in 1999,



                                                 12

and average debt per household increased by 15% to over Rs.90,000, almost three times that of
unaffected households.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.3. The project made a substantial effort to strengthen institutional capacity of the PWD. The
key institutional developments include:

·       PWD's involvement in the state-wide e-governance reform to ensure transparent and
        expeditious procurement process;
·       establishment of two Traffic Cells in the PWD (North and South);
·       creation of a core management group focused on the implementation of Quality
        Assurance System and ISO 9001 certification of 21 Divisions;
·       development of a new Departmental Code, which includes substantial procedural reform
        in respect to environment and social safeguards;
·       carrying out of HR needs assessment, and development of HR policy and improvement
        plan;
·       setting up of GIS-based Road Information System (RIS) for the entire state road network
        which is used in maintenance planning and decision-making process, and implementation
        of a comprehensive Road User Satisfaction Surveys;
·       development and implementation of a Road Safety Action plan.

3.5.4. In addition, several studies and policy papers, including a new road policy, were drafted
but have not been approved because it takes time to hold consultations and build the political
consensus. Implementation of these policies will take up in the follow-on project.

3.5.5. In parallel with this project, the GOK created a separate agency ­ KRDCL, with the
mandate of managing the State's CRN through private sector involvement, including PPPs and
long-term output- and performance-based road contracts (OPRC). KSHIP's institutional
component had a spill over effect on KRDCL. It allowed KRDCL's staff to receive training in
and get exposed to best international practices (e.g., OPRC).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

None.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

4.1.    Risk to the conditions of the improved CRN in Karnataka is moderate. The operation and
maintenance of KSHIP roads were entrusted to KRDCL that manages the State's CRN.
Maintenance is planned to be implemented through long-term performance-based contracts and
concession contracts. The Government has started to provide sufficient funding in the budgetary
allocations to guarantee proper maintenance in the short-term. This funding, along with the new
long term OPRCs being implemented will greatly contribute to preservation of the assets created


                                                13

through this project. The follow-on project plans to ensure that the institutional framework
established under the project will receive sufficient support (financially and institutionally) to
modernize the road sector planning, management and financing in Karnataka.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1.    Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated satisfactory. The Bank's team
undertook rigorous project preparation, and supported what was, and still is a high priority
project for the state of Karnataka. The policy dialogue during project preparation focused on
agreeing on a shared framework for the project concept and on operational modalities for
developing an institutional framework and initial actions to deal with the most critical issues
related to road sector management and reform, complementing other actions and investments
underway to reduce the cost of maintaining the state road network. However, the institutional
reform component could have been simplified by focusing on a few critical areas rather than
attempting a comprehensive sector reform.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2. The Bank's team made a solid effort to ensure the project was implemented effectively,
and achieved its development objective. The task team focused on the identification of proactive
opportunities and the overcoming of problems that hindered implementation progress. As task
leadership of the project was decentralized to the field office, project supervision was undertaken
on a continuous basis and covered a wide range of activities and issues. In the last three years,
Bank's supervision efforts focused much more on ensuring that the project's institutional
strengthening activities went hand-in-hand with the progress on civil works. The Bank team
carried out with diligence fiduciary responsibilities. Nevertheless, greater emphasis should have
been given to periodic supervision of project's fiduciary aspects in order to implement
satisfactory financial management systems and arrangements. Safeguard requirements were also
adequately supervised.

5.1.3. The Bank continues to monitor implementation of the remaining contracts as part of the
preparation of the follow-on project. The Bank as part of its fiduciary responsibility also
continues to supervise the implementation of the safeguard issues related to environment and
social aspects, and will continue to do so until these contracts are completed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory



                                                  14

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1. During preparation the GOK demonstrated a high level of commitment and ownership to
the project through the support to and implementation of many reforms in the road sector (details
given in Section 2.1). During project implementation the GOK maintained the same level of
commitment to the project. The satisfactory rating is given because the RF was not established
and the State Cabinet was still considering the recommendations of the RF study during ICR
preparation. However, this does not indicate a decline in GOK's commitment to this reform,
because such a major policy reform takes substantial time to build political consensus and cannot
be implemented in a short period of time.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2. Implementation of the project by the PWD is rated satisfactory. More than 90% of works
are complete and a total of 874 km out of 884 km of roads have been upgraded and opened to
traffic. Similarly, more than 1400 km out of 1,575 km of rehabilitated roads have been
completed and opened to traffic. While in the first part of the project the supervision of contracts
by the PWD was not adequate, it later improved as the PWD built its capacity. Eventually, the
performance of the PWD staff in managing the maintenance contracts has been at par with that
of international supervision consultants. Therefore, in future projects the PWD should continue
supervising rehabilitation contracts. Should their performance remain satisfactory, the PWD
could consider a gradual enhancement of supervision responsibilities on a pilot basis by training
staff on how to supervise simple upgrading contracts. Extensive training in contract and project
management would be required, as well as procurement of services of consultants to provide
necessary advice.

5.2.3. The institutional strengthening and pilot road safety components, including black spot
improvement and road safety awareness campaign, progressed satisfactorily. The PWD also took
the initiative to modernize its business processing and improve maintenance management by
piloting long-term OPRCs. This suggests internalization of the knowledge and technical
assistance provided during the project. Unfortunately, the agency lacked the commitment to
implement successfully the Financial Management System, and as a result some entries in the
manual system were not reconciled.

5.2.4. Throughout the entire preparation and implementation of the project, the PWD provided
full cooperation and support to the Bank and the other agencies.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.    Decentralization of task leadership and supervision of the project to the Bank country
office enables continuous project monitoring and timely addressing of emerging implementation
issues. Due to decentralized task leadership and supervision of KSHIP, the Bank team was able to
provide continuous and rigorous monitoring of project implementation and conduct frequent site
visits. As a result, many critical issues (e.g., delay in implementation of R&R in the four above
mentioned towns) received timely and adequate attention from the Bank side.

6.2.    Institutional and policy reforms should be implemented incrementally and
sequentially. Implementation of reforms takes a lot of time, because it takes time to get political
consensus, build ownership, change the mindset, and re-design some of the reforms to adjust to
new circumstances. Some of the reforms (i.e., establishment of RF, moving from a traditional
works executing agency to a corporatized roads managing agency) planned in KSHIP eventually
spill over to a follow-on project. When the project plans to have major, sophisticated policy and
institutional interventions, it should take an incremental approach to the sector reforms, with
phased actions to modernize and strengthen a minimum set of core management functions within
the existing context.

6.3.    Inter-agency cooperation is important for timely and compliant (with the relevant
safeguards) project implementation. Lack of communication between the implementing agency
and local government authorities led to delays in the implementation of social safeguards in the
earlier mentioned four towns along roads under rehabilitation. In addition, lack of close
cooperation between the implementing agency and the Forest Department resulted in different
interpretation of ownership of land between these two agencies and unclear delineation of
responsibilities in several aspects, which also affected timely forest clearance process. While an
action plan was developed and implemented by the PWD to address this issue by applying
remedial measures in accordance with policy provisions and accordingly extending the
assistance to those affected people, that situation could have been prevented if the PWD had
closely collaborated with the local authorities and informed them of the compliance requirements
with the relevant social safeguards. An MOU with clear delineation of responsibilities between
the PWD and the Forest Department should have been recommended by the Bank's supervision
mission at the early, not last, stage of the project life.

6.4.    If rehabilitation of a road eventually requires re-alignment and, consequently, leads to
R&R, the same R&R policy designed for upgrading should be applied. The delay in
implementation of social safeguards in four towns occurred only on those stretches of roads
which were originally planned for rehabilitation only but eventually were widened to include
drainages in the built ­up areas.

6.5.    Post-qualification allows more competition than pre-qualification. The experience in
procurement of works contracts showed that post qualification is likely to get a more competitive
price.




                                                  16

6.6.   A biodiversity assessment should be mandatory for a road passing through protected
areas. It should be mandatory for any road traversing protected areas regardless whether the road
will be subject to major or minor (e.g., maintenance) works.

6.7.   The road safety component should be implemented by an agency that is closer to road
users. The PWD did not have the appropriate capacity as its staff are not trained transport and
safety regulation. As such, the road safety component involving vehicles and drivers (i.e. an
accident analysis database) should be implemented by another led agency such as the Transport
Department.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

7.1.   The Borrower received a draft of the ICR and did not raise any major issues. The
Borrower's ICR is enclosed in Annex 7.

                               Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The project had four components:

Component 1: Upgrading and widening of SHs (At appraisal: US$270.83 Million; actual:
US$356.2 Million).

1.     This component contributed to increase in the capacity and structural strength of part of
the core State road network through the upgrading and widening of 874 km (against the planned
880 km) of priority SHs and construction of new bypasses of about 50 km in length. The
component was divided into: (a) civil works, (b) supervision of civil works, and (c)
implementation of RAP and EMP for road widening.

2.     Civil Works. Contracts for the upgrading and widening of SHs were procured in two
phases. On average, 5 bids were received when there was pre-qualification and 7 when there was
post-qualification (including both ICB and NCB packages) (Table 2) In case of post-qualification,
prices were found more competitive.

3.     Phase I upgrading works were complete except for Bennethora Bridge (U3B) which was
dropped from the scope of the main contract. There was an overall average delay of 14 months
and aggregate cost increase of 12 % above appraisal due to price escalation and scope of work
change. All final payments have been made for all the contracts, including a settlement of about
Rs.2 crore awarded to the contractor of U1. The U3B bridge was expected to be completed in 4-6
months from the project closure.

4.     Phase II upgrading works comprised six road contracts and two bypasses, the latter
awarded in late 2006. The work was on-going in the bypasses and three contracts (U6, U9 and
U10) and there was an overall average delay of over 6 months at the time of project closure. The
bypasses showed an aggregate cost increase of 3 % due to some price escalation and scope
change to date. The detailed breakdown of the contract packages under this component planned
at appraisal and actually completed by EOP is shown in the table below (

5.      The PWD has decided to undertake the maintenance of 30 roads (with an aggregate
length of 1,790 km) through long-term performance-based contracts. They are planned to be
awarded in the coming months. For all other roads, a more comprehensive PPP program is
envisaged.

6.      Supervision of Civil Works and Project Management Support.                      Four supervision
consultancy contracts were procured under the project. Supervision consultants had full
responsibility as the "Engineer" of the contract as per International Federation of Consulting
Engineer requirements. The same supervision consultants supervised part of the contracts in the
rehabilitation component. This component included the Project Coordination Consultancy
services which were engaged for project preparation and detailed engineering designs and
continued supporting the PWD for project management through project implementation.

7.      Land Acquisition, Resettlement, EMP Implementation and Utility Relocation. The
progress on RAP activities is provided in Table 4. Construction of Phase I involved acquisition
of 13.78 hectares of land belonging to 121 land owners and impacts to 264 non- title holders.
Construction of Phase II roads subject to upgrading involved acquisition of 38.57 hectares of
land belonging to 969 land owners and impacts to 1,353 non- title holders). 23 out of 1,260
landowners (corresponding to 1.8%) filed cases for low compensation. Construction of bypasses
involved acquisition of 34.16 hectares of private land belonging to 168 land owners. The analysis
of private land acquisition process indicates that more than 50 % of the 59 proposals took more
than 2 years with an average time of about 26 months. Only 7 % of the proposals took less than
18 months. The minimum and maximum time spent on completion of land acquisition process is

14 and 42 months, respectively. About 19 hectares of additional land was acquired during the
implementation for upgrading works packages.

Notes: * 112 persons have not accepted compensation due to disputes in the title, pending with civil courts, appealed
for enhancement of compensation, etc.

8.      Land acquisition costs and cash compensations under the project were funded entirely by
GOK. Other costs associated with the R&R component included: (i) relocation assistance
programs, (ii) compensation paid in accordance with the land acquisition act, and (iii) the
replacement of assets, infrastructure facilities, and resettlement sites. R&R entitlements
including allowances, training, and monitoring and evaluation of project expenditures were
eligible for Bank financing. The total cost of implementation of land acquisition and resettlement
impacts was about Rs.180 million which is about 0.80% of the total project cost.

9.      The costs associated with EMP implementation included financing for training,
monitoring, and evaluation were partly funded by the Bank. A total of 45,753 trees were cut to
make way for upgrading works. Survival rates of replanted trees was high (average of 92%) due
to rigorous monitoring of existing plantation. Although there were changes to the replanting
numbers due required to adjustment in lengths of contracts, the survival rate exceeded the project
target for survival. Relocation of public utilities was implemented by direct contract and was
partly funded by the Bank.

Component 2: Rehabilitation of SHs & MDRs (At appraisal: US$91.15 Million; actual:
US$158.73 Million).

10.     This component contributed to reducing the periodic maintenance backlog of the state by
funding the overlaying, resealing, and minor rehabilitation of 1,250 km of SHs and MDRs. The
component was divided into: (a) civil works; and (b) technical audit.

11.     Civil Works. It supported 34 contract packages (ranging from about US$0.3 million to
US$7.9 million), which were procured in two phases. The 10 Phase I contracts were completed
(M2, M3, M4, M8, M12, M13, M17, M18, M19 and BR1). One contract (M4) went to



                                                     22

arbitration and decided in favor of the contractor. Although PWD went back to court against the
decision, it awarded a new contract to rectify the failed sections (M4R). The total
implementation period for the rehabilitation component was significantly delayed compared to
the four years anticipated at appraisal. The cost increase compared to appraisal amounts to 18%.
Four packages (M15, M25, M26 and M27) were completed for only 50% or less at the time of
project closure. The main reasons for time overruns were slow mobilization of some contractors,
termination of five contracts with the international contractor who made only 4 % progress and
re-bidding these contracts to other contractors, design changes in some of the contracts, delays in
obtaining forestry regulatory clearances, and delays in work execution due to excessive rain in
the north west of the state during the last monsoon. Status of the contract packages is given in
Table 5.

12.     Rehabilitation of these roads involved acquisition of 3.24 hectares of private land
belonging to 2 land owners and impacts to 1,011 non- title holders (see Table 4). A total of 2,747
trees were cut to make way for rehabilitation works.

13.     Technical Audit.         Out of 34 rehabilitation contracts, ten contracts and the bridge
rehabilitation contract were supervised by the PWD. The remaining contracts were supervised by
supervision consultants engaged in the upgrading and widening component of the project. Three
technical audit consultants (with one consultant taking up two consultancies) were procured to
assist the PWD in the supervision of works, overseeing project progress, quality control of all
contracts supervised by the PWD, and evaluating the cost effectiveness of the two supervision
arrangements. A review1 of performance of both PWD staff and independent consultants, in
terms of contract management and supervision, concluded that in most cases PWD staff had
performed better in terms of quantity and quality. Although some improvements could have been
made to the quality of the PWD supervision, at the time of the review contractors under PWD
supervision had completed 84% of works, whilst those under independent supervision had only
completed 53.5% (same time had elapsed).

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening, Advisory Technical Assistance, Training,
Equipment, and Pre-investment Studies (At appraisal: US$17.0 Million; actual: 19.23
Million).

14.     This component supported consultant services and Technical Assistance and Training
programs to facilitate the implementation of the IDS action plan designed to strengthen the
overall institutional capacity of the PWD. It also funded the short- and medium-term training

activities of PWD managers and staff, office equipment for implementing an e-governance
program within the PWD, development of PFMS, procurement reform (revision of standard
bidding documents), preparation of HR policy and implementation plan, preparation of a new
Departmental Code, certification of PWD's several business units to achieve an ISO 9001:2000
compliant Quality Assurance System, laboratory modernization, development of road
management systems, other logistical support including vehicles, road user satisfaction survey,
and techno-economic feasibility and detailed engineering studies for future road investment
projects. The GOK funded miscellaneous activities such as incremental operating costs and
applicable taxes for consultancy and goods.

15.     Procurement Reform and E-Procurement. Revised SBDs and procurement procedures
were prepared, disseminated and are being implemented in two pilot divisions of the PWD. Once
finalized, the documents will be used across the PWD. GOK has also initiated a pilot of e-
procurement platform through a software of six modules2 out of which one module provides
contract management and FM system related to the works contract only. The e-procurement
system is being piloted in six departments, including the PWD. Once the e-procurement pilot is
completed and successful, its use will be assessed for a follow-on road project.

16.     Road Information System and IT. The PWD initiated the training staff in web based
RIS. Although the implementation of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) software was
postponed, the e-governance system developed at the State level has most of the components of
ERP. The PWD has yet to initiate the process of preparing the annual maintenance plan by using
HDM-4 for their road network using the road condition and traffic data collected by them
annually. The PWD has acquired the software and the trained the engineers in network
development, maintenance planning and policy making using HDM-4.

17.     Human Resource (HR) Management. A needs assessment report and an HR policy and
improvement/learning plan were developed and are being cleared by the governing board for
further processing by the Cabinet. Training institutes were identified. The PWD already made
staffing changes including: (i) eliminating the vacant posts, and (ii) hiring/nominating
environment specialists at the division level.

18.     Quality Assurance System (QAS) and PWD Procredures. A new Departmental Code
was developed and includes substantial procedural reform in respect to environment and social
safeguards. The PWD is in the process to obtain ISO 9001 certification for a large number of its
units to start its first phase which includes 4 Circles and 17 SH Divisions (out of a total of 10
Circles and 34 SH Divisions).

19.     Road Maintenance Funding. The rolling 3-year MTFP for the PWD was updated and
published last in 2006. There was only 1% variance between MTFP budget and actual
expenditures in FY2006-07. While the recommendations of the Maintenance Tracking, Road
Fund and Road Policy Studies are being cleared, PWD is already developing long term

performance-based maintenance plans for about 2000 km of roads, and planning to maintain a
large portion of the core network through PPPs in the future.

20.    Road User Satisfaction Survey. The road user satisfaction surveys were conducted in
2002, 2004 and 2007. It enabled the PWD to learn about road users' perception of the PWD's
performance and areas for improvement.

21.    Follow on Project Preparation (Pre-investment studies). The planning for a follow-on
project was also undertaken and the feasibility studies for 4,900 km were completed in
November 2006. The detailed project reports for about 2,400 km of roads are currently under
preparation.

Component 4: Pilot Highway Safety Program (At appraisal: US$4.0 Million; actual:
US$0.63 Million).

22.    This component disbursed only 16% of the appraised amount. It financed civil works for
the implementation of (i) engineering and traffic management measures to enhance road safety
and (ii) mitigation traffic accidents measures at selected black spot locations along the project
corridor through Blackspot Improvement Program. All 25 identified black spots were improved.
Nearly 30% of the black spots did not have any accidents at all, and the rest had a decline in
accidents in the range of 35%-88% by EOP. The contract concerning engineering and traffic
management measures was terminated with the consulting firm, which was procured to develop
and deliver an accident analysis system due to lack of progress in this consultancy. Right before
the closure of the project, the contract for the installation of a road accident analysis system was
re-bid.

23.    The component also supported the development and implementation of a Road Safety
Action Plan. An NGO undertook a road safety awareness campaign in two districts where there
was substantial length of project roads ­ Belgaum and Raichur. The campaign was implemented
successfully using street plays, street singing and impromptu focus group discussions to
disseminate various messages. However, year-wise accident data collected on the completed
roads showed an increase from 4,596 accidents in 2004 to 7,755 in 2006 and 5,830 in the first
seven months of 2007. Similarly the number of fatal accidents also increased from 350 in 2004
to 615 in 2006 and 461 in the first seven months of 2007. Fatalities appear to increase during the
construction period and it is believed that they have started declining after the opening of the
road. Should a thorough road safety audit have been implemented, drivers and other road users
would have been informed about changes in the traffic pattern and road accidents would have
been prevented on the improved roads. The India Insurance Company, whose representative sits
on the Karnataka State Traffic and Transport Authority, has offered to finance road safety
programs in two other project districts.

                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Background

1.     At project preparation an economic analysis was undertaken for the two project
components which comprised of about 95% of the total cost of the project: the Upgrading and
Widening Component and the Rehabilitation Component. The economic analysis was conducted
using the Highway Design and Maintenance (HDM-III) Model, which simulates life cycle
conditions and costs and provides economic decision criteria for multiple road design and
maintenance alternatives, based on a survey of road characteristics, traffic, and agency and user
costs.

2.     At appraisal the overall EIRR of the project was estimated at 45.4 % and the NPV
discounted at 12% was Rs. 51.8 billion. For the upgrading component the overall weighted-
average EIRR was estimated at 50.4 % with an NPV of Rs. 49.8 billion, and for the rehabilitation
the overall weighted-average EIRR was estimated at 28.5 % with an NPV of Rs. 2.01 billion.

Ex-post Economic Evaluation

3.     The ex-post economic evaluation was carried out for the sample of 25% roads completed
under the Upgrading and Rehabilitation components.

4.     The following methodology and assumptions were used in the analysis:

·      HDM-IV version 1.3
·      The "without project" scenario represents the road when subjected to regular PWD
       maintenance regime (Schedule Type maintenance) after an overlay (of 25mm) at the
       beginning of first year. The route maintenance costs were assumed as Rs.70,000 per km
       per annum. Overlays of 25mm are assumed every five years.
·      The "with project" scenario represents the road with the intervention financed by this
       project and Responsive Type maintenance. Capital costs for the "with project" scenario
       represent Contract Agreement costs including variations. The route maintenance costs
       were assumed as Rs.25,000 per km per annum. Overlays of 50mm are assumed every
       five years.
·      IRI of 3.5 (equivalent unevenness Index of 2500mm) for upgraded roads and 4.0 (UI of
       2950mm) for rehabilitated roads is taken as the roughness values after the overlay is
       completed.
·      The period of analysis was 20 years, but the benefits for rehabilitation contracts were
       restricted to 7 years.
·      Seven day classified traffic counts were taken in August 2007 and in 2005. Traffic
       growth rates were the same as in the original economic analysis.
·      Discount rate: 12%.
·      Inflation rate of 5% per annum was used to estimate the net present value of construction
       costs as of 1999.
·      Road network data were the same as in the 1999 feasibility study.
·      Vehicle prices for 2007 were as per the feasibility report.


                                               26

·      The time value for passengers and freight vehicles was estimated using the wage rate
       approach as done in the feasibility study.
·      The ESLAV for a vehicle class for each link was taken from the 1999 feasibility study.
·      Cost conversion factor (from financial to economic costs) was 0.9. Construction costs
       have been phased out for each contract to represent actual expenditures that took place
       every year. A salvage value of 15% of capital costs has been included.
·      Sensitivity analysis (assuming a reduction of 25% in benefits) and switching values
       exercises for each were undertaken. The switching value identifies the threshold value
       for the percentage change in a variable for the EIRR to fall to the cut off rate of 12%.
       There was no data on accident costs, thus the benefits resulting from reduction in
       accident costs was not included in the analysis.

5.     The results of the economic analysis are given in table below. The overall weighted-
average EIRR for the Upgrading and Rehabilitation components are 35.7% and 18.45%,
respectively. These are below the EIRRs estimated at appraisal. However, 50% of the sample
upgraded roads and 60% of the sample rehabilitated roads have higher EIRRs than those
estimated at appraisal. Despite escalation of unit prices, the final EIRRs were higher than
expected because of (i) increase in traffic volume and (ii) increase in benefits from reduction of
vehicle operating costs (VOCs), especially savings from fuel costs. For some of the packages
that experienced lower traffic volumes, the economic returns are still higher due to lower capital
costs.

6.     The EIRR for the rehabilitation component is lower than that for the upgrading
component because (i) savings in VOCs accrued to the traffic under the component were only
from the improved riding quality, and (ii) since the majority of these roads are single lane, they
are expected to become congested after 8-10 years, thus the benefit-streams were calculated for
the period of 7 years, which is shorter than for the upgrading component.

                              Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      The project conducted an impact assessment of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
implementation in 2007 to assess the achievement of the objectives of resettlement and the
changes in the living standards of Project Affected Families (PAFs). The survey team discussed
with beneficiaries the socio-economic impacts of the RAP implementation. The survey compared
the baseline and control population data with the PAFs data related to changes in living standards,
housing, community assets, wages, labor, etc.

2.      A baseline socio-economic survey carried out in 2000 established baseline socio-
economic characteristics of the PAFs, recorded and later measured the impacts associated with
land acquisition and displacement of people in the corridor of impact. The baseline data available
was too sparse and the consultant who conducted the impacts assessment of the RAP
implementation had difficulties with some lacking baseline data. When baseline data was not
available for some indicators, it was collected on a recall basis.

3.      The sample size of the survey consisted of one third of households who had received
resettlement assistance (house or shop), 25% of land owners who had received cash
compensation under the Land Acquisition Act and about 25% of reconstructed community assets.
However, the sample was slightly modified because the actual number of PAFs had changed by
the completion of the project. The amended sample turned out to be larger than the envisaged
one, but still this sample size adequately covered all types of impacts. The community assets
were sampled proportionately by type and division. The survey covered a sample of 72
households forming the control population to compare their living standards with those of PAFs.

4.      Income and Indebtedness. The PAFs' average income level has increased by 21%
compared to the baseline income level and by 38% compared to the level of the control group.
Before the project there were 46% of families out of the total sample of 1,086 PAFs who were
below poverty line (BPL). By the end of the project (EOP) a significant proportion of households
­ about 27% - have moved above BPL. However, the average debt level of PAFs has increased
by 15% and 170% and the number of PAFs households having debt increased by 94% and 19%
compared to the levels of the baseline and control group, respectively. Increase in levels of debt
accounts for the fact that many PAFs have taken advantage of the improved road accessibility
and have renovated and expanded their existing businesses, launched new business, taken loans,
built or improved their houses with basic facilities and amenities. Overall, the credit worthiness
and borrowing capacity of the PAFs has increased.

5.      Occupation. The professional occupation of PAFs has dramatically changed by EOP.
Less proportion of PAFs are engaged in land cultivation and farming compared to the pre-project
situation: 23% against 40% and 14% against 28%, respectively. The proportion of PAFs engaged
in commerce or trade has more than doubled compared to the pre-project situation ­ 56% against
27%. However, still bigger proportion of PAFs is engaged in cultivation than that of the control

group ­ 23% against 16% - and slightly less in services than that of the control group ­ 7%
against 8%.

6.       Ownership of Assets. Some shifts have been noticed in asset ownership patterns. There
has been an increase in the share of PAFs owners of two wheelers (by 12%), of TV sets (by
10%), milch animals (by 6%) and gas (by 1%). The difference is even more striking when
compared to the control group.

Notes:
1 - "HH" stands for "Household".
2. BPL is considered as families with incomes below INR 18,000; Baseline survey used below INR 10,810 as BPL.
3. A pucca house is one, which has walls and roof made of the following material: burnt bricks, stones (packed with
lime or cement), cement concrete, timber, ekra etc.
4. A semi-pucca house is one, which has fixed walls made up of pucca material but roof is made up of the material
other than those used for pucca house.
5. A kutcha house is one, whose walls and/or roof are made of material other than those mentioned above, such as
un-burnt bricks, bamboos, mud, grass, reeds, thatch, loosely packed stones, etc.

7.      Housing and Infrastructure. The results of the survey indicate that the living conditions
of PAFs have improved significantly by EOP. 15% of PAFs more live in pucca houses, which
are built of stronger and better materials and 13% less live in kutcha houses than before the
project. Less PAF households (68%) live in semi-pucca houses than the control group (89%).
This accounts for the fact that the control group selected for the survey mostly included those
who were given houses under government schemes. The proportion of PAF households having
access to electricity and drinking water has increased by 7% and 2%, respectively. The
proportion of PAFs households with access to these services is even bigger than that of the
control group: by 23% and 8%, respectively.

8.      PAFs who lost their shops were also provided by the project with 314 commercial sites.
Out of these sites only 35% are used as commercial shops, while 18% have been converted into
residences, 28% are used as both shops and residences, and 19% are still vacant.

9.      Perceived Benefits. More than half of the respondents (1,086 PAFs) expect the new roads
to facilitate improvement in access to social and economic infrastructure. 80% of PAFs believe
that there will be increase or minor increase in business; around 85% expect increase or minor
increase in better transport facilities, and more than 50% and nearly 60% of PAFs believe that
access will improve to health care and education, respectively.
