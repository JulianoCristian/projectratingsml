As\n            such it will continue the process of channelling funds and\n            technical services to small groups of rural people, who will\n            provide labor and some cash for the development of several\n            types of productive activities. The project introduces\n            various producer groups to new technology and new activities\n            and reinforces the local capacity for identification and\n            preparation of small rural projects. Eight subprojects have\n            been appraised, covering cereal, vegetable, fruit and honey\n            production in different regions of the country. The project\n            will finance land development works, irrigation systems and\n            equipment, vehicles, inputs, training of farmer groups and\n            staff, and operating costs of subprojects and a management\n            unit. It also includes a provision for identifying and\n            financing new subprojects in the course of project\n            implementation. Beneficiaries are expected to make important\n            contributions in cash and kind to the investments, replace\n            all medium-term assets and bear all recurrent operating costs."}, "docdt": "1989-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
