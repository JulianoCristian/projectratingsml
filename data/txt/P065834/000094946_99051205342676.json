The project will provide\n            immediate, quick-disbursing support to finance a positive\n            list of imports needed for the recovery effort while\n            supporting macroeconomic objectives. Also, the project will\n            provide assistance for a broad range of imports by the\n            private sector, especially imported production inputs and\n            imported capital equipment. No disbursements will be made to\n            cover used or luxury goods, military equipment, or nuclear\n            reactors. The main benefit of the project is to provide\n            financing for necessary imports despite a sharp drop in\n            exports and a decline in private capital inflows and to\n            allow for necessary budgetary expenditures related to\n            refugees not covered by humanitarian relief agencies and\n            related to the sharp economic downturn induced by the\n            crisis. The major project risks are that the Kosovo conflict\n            may continue, imposing ongoing debilitating effects on the\n            region and requiring additional interventions by the\n            international donor community."}, "docdt": "1999-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
