were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            in general, the improvement of accessibility and mobility\n            should be measured by corridor traffic and travel time. At\n            appraisal, the project's development objectives (PDO)\n            monitoring was not well arranged. During implementation, the\n            Guiyang project management office (GPMO) monitored the\n            indicators inconsistently with some initial delays:\n            different approaches were used (variability in sampling\n            method) from one report to another and traffic counts were\n            not collected and processed professionally. Approval and\n            provision of additional funding for the project after\n            restructuring took time, which contributed to implementation\n            delays. Future engagements should place greater emphasis on\n            development and review of project feasibility studies,\n            investigation of any relevant government policies,\n            construction industry related market studies, and improved\n            coordination with resettlement document preparation and\n            activities. Related to the bus terminals, governments at\n            both municipal and county levels need to develop a proper\n            strategy and policy, apply adequate regulation and\n            management, and provide sufficient support to the operation\n            and maintenance."}, "docdt": "2014-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
