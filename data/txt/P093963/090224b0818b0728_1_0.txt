                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To increase the access and mobility of Guiyang Municipality's transport users through priority infrastructure investments while establishing more sustainable
                         mechanisms for rural road maintenance, as well as enhancing capacity for keeping municipal debt under control.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The progress of Component 1-Youxiao Road is satisfactory. The Road has been completed and opened to traffic on February 5, 2010. However, the progress of the Component 2-
                         Rural Transport was behind schedule. The progress of the TA studies and training under Component 3 is satisfactory though slightly lagging behind the schedule. Given that two
                         rural roads and an international study tour will not be completed before the original closing date, an extension of 12 months has been entitled through a project restructuring in
                         December 2012. With the restructuring, the project development objectives will remain to be achievable.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The overall implementation of the project is moderately satisfactory. A project restructuring was processed for an extension of loan closing by 12 months and reallocation of loan
                         proceeds. With the project restructuring, the project development objectives will remain to be achievable.
