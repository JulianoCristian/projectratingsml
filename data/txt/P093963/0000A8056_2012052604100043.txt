                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The progress of Component 1-Youxiao Road is satisfactory. The Road has been completed and opened to traffic on February 5, 2010. However, the progress of the Component 2-
                         Rural Transport was experiencing delay due to the pending land acquisition and resettlement. The progress of the TA studies and training under Component 3 is satisfactory though
                         slightly lagging behind the schedule. The project objectives are likely to be achieved.
