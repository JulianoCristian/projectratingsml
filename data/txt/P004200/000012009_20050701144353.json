Similarly, while the Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory, that of the Bank is rated unsatisfactory. In\n            addition to lessons reinforcing the need for a clear and\n            simple project design, and, both human and financial\n            resources should be integrated within the design,\n            particularly when those are constrained, through appropriate\n            mitigation measures. In view of the implementation delays\n            experienced during the initial stages of the Project, it is\n            clear that there is a need to maximize continuity within the\n            leadership of the Bank task team. Under the circumstances,\n            there is need to focus on developing Project management\n            skills of our borrowers. On the basis of the sheer volume of\n            indicators selected, it would be useful for both the Bank\n            and Borrower to select indicators which are strategic,\n            meaningful, and attainable. Finally, it is suggested that\n            linking sector support to other programs that address\n            systemic issues, could produce synergies that might increase\n            the chances for better results."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
