There is a need to reallocate eligible\n            expenditures between the different categories under the\n            original project. This has been caused by increase in unit\n            costs, implementing more schemes serving a larger population\n            than originally planned at preparation, thereby scope of\n            works being more than originally anticipated in the schemes.\n            The closing date of the project extended from the current\n            December 31, 2010 to August 30, 2011. This will allow\n            additional schemes to be completed and increase the number\n            of beneficiary households, while scaling up innovative\n            initiatives such as scheme insurance, social accountability\n            and improving income generating activities, particularly of\n            women. This will be the second extension of the closing\n            date, representing a cumulative extension of just less than\n            two years."}, "docdt": "2010-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
