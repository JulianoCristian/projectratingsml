                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
1.     This restructuring paper seeks approval to (i) extend the current closing date of
the Nepal: Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project - RWSSP II (P071285)
from December 31, 2010 to August 30, 2011, (ii) revise allocations across several
categories to reflect latest cost projections; and (iii) extend the date of an existing
covenant for operationalizing the sector M&E system to August 30, 2011.


PROJECT STATUS
2.      The Bank approved a credit of US$ 25.3 million towards a Second Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (total cost of US$ 41.5 million equivalent) on June 1, 2004
with an original closing date of August 31, 2009. The Project had targeted to complete
1,355 schemes to benefit 813,000 rural people. However, because of cost overruns due to
price increases, the project would have completed only 881 schemes to serve 683,000
people. Therefore, an Additional Financing grant of US$ 27.0 million (total AF cost US$
32.10 million) was approved on May 6, 2008 in order to fill the financing gap as well as
scale up the project scope. The closing date was extended by 1 year 4 months to
December 31, 2010, and cumulative targets (original + AF) were revised as follows:
completion of 1,643 schemes to benefit 1.1 million people. The project is managed by
the Rural Water and Sanitation Fund Development Board (the "Board"), and
implemented by communities at the local level.

3.      Overall, implementation performance and the likelihood of achieving project
development objectives are rated as moderately satisfactory. The Board currently has
completed 852 implementation (i.e. construction of water supply and environmental
sanitation) phase schemes and 1,141 development (i.e. community development activities
including detail design of scheme) phase schemes. In addition 298 implementation phase
and 90 development phase schemes are ongoing. The Board is in the process of
contracting about 350 implementation phase schemes which were held up because of the
delay in budget announcement as a result of which the Board did not have authority to
spend more than one third of the annual budget. Disbursements as of November 30, 2010
are: (a) US$ 36.32 million (69%), (b) actual and commitments amount to US$ 41.38
million (79%) and remaining by December 31, 2010 is expected to be US$17.96 million.

4.      Implementation delays have been caused by a number of factors, particularly: late
announcement of the budget last year as well as this year, weak management in the Board
- some staff turnover, including the resignation of the then Executive Director - and the
security situation in parts of the country. An important lesson emerging from the project
is that the assumed timeframe for delivering the scaled up targets agreed under the


                                           4
Additional Financing (AF) was very optimistic for a country in a post conflict
environment.

5.      There are no outstanding audit reports, and all legal covenants under the project
are in compliance, except for DCA 5.01(e) which is a dated covenant stating that the
RWSS sector M&E system would be operationalized by July 16, 2009.
Operationalization of the sector M&E system has been particularly difficult and time
taking because of the need to harmonize information from numerous agencies involved in
the sector and requirements for data validation. The Government of Nepal (GoN) has
established a dedicated M&E unit and the system is in place, but the system is not yet
well institutionalized and delivering regular reports. The GoN has formally requested
that the date of this covenant be extended to December 31, 2010. The Bank team
assesses that this is not realistic and recommends that this date be extended to August 30,
2011. The Thematic Working Group for the institutional aspects of the Water Supply
and Sanitation Sector Stakeholders met on December 13, 2010 and re-emphasized the
need to make it mandatory for all sector agencies to use the RWSS M&E system.


PROPOSED CHANGES
Reallocation of Financing

6.      There is a need to reallocate eligible expenditures between the different categories
under the original project. This has been caused by increase in unit costs, implementing
more schemes serving a larger population than originally planned at preparation, thereby
scope of works being more than originally anticipated in the schemes. The reallocations
are presented in Annex 1. Additional construction, goods, consultant and monitoring and
evaluation costs have been offset by reductions in development phase, training and
operational costs. These reductions have been achieved by lower development phase and
operating costs than estimated and reduction in international training funded from the
credit.

Closing Date

7.       It is proposed to extend the project closing date from the current December 31,
2010 to August 30, 2011. This would allow additional schemes to be completed and
increase the number of beneficiary households, while scaling up innovative initiatives
such as scheme insurance, social accountability and improving income generating
activities, particularly of women. At the institutional level, the additional time would
allow improvements in the internal management of the Board to become institutionalized
(such as application of a criteria based selection process for Board members), and for the
RWSS sector M&E system to become a functional tool for sector management. Lastly,
during this period a comparative study on the various approaches being implemented by
different agencies in the sector will be carried out to assess cost-effectiveness, timeliness,
and sustainability. This would be the second extension of the closing date, representing a
cumulative extension of just under two years (the original project closing date of August


                                              5
31, 2009 was extended to December 31, 2010 when the Additional Financing was
approved on May 6, 2008).




                                     6
Legal Covenant


8.    In response to the Government's request to extend the dated covenant 5.01(e) in
the Development Credit Agreement relating to operationalization of the RWSS sector
M&E system, it is proposed that the deadline for delivery be extended to August 30,
2011.



APPRAISAL SUMMARY

Technical

9.      No changes are proposed in the technical approach adopted under the project. The
current approach has been found to be satisfactory. By August 30, 2011, the project aims
to complete 1195 schemes which is about 81.6% of the end-project target agreed at the
time of AF approval. No changes in the project targets are planned.

Implementation Arrangements

10.     The Board has prepared a revised implementation plan, based on past
implementation trends, which indicates that it will be able to partly achieve project
development objectives by August 2011. The Board has also revised the Procurement
Plan in accordance with the revised closing date. The Bank team has assessed these
documents and believes that they provide a realistic estimate of project completion up to
the current proposed extension date of August 30, 2011.

Risks

11.     The principal risks facing project implementation are:

        (a) Political instability and civil unrest would adversely affect the project
            implementation schedule because the schemes are located throughout the
            country and in remote rural areas. Although construction will not be much
            affected once the non-local materials reach the sites, there could be delays in
            milestone monitoring visits and subsequent payments.

        (b) Poor contract administration by the Board could also delay implementation.
            This risk will be mitigated by periodic progress reviews by the Board and by
            providing training to relevant Board staff on contract administration and
            procurement by the Bank.

        (c) Inadequate time to complete the scaled up AF targets by the closing date
            could act as a de-motivating factor to the staff of the Board and lead to a
            hesitation to issue new contracts due to uncertainty regarding the availability
            of funding. This risk will be mitigated by Government assurances that

                                             7
domestic funds will be provided. The possibility of an additional IDA
extension will be revisited based on implementation progress and the results
of the comparative study of service delivery in the sector.
