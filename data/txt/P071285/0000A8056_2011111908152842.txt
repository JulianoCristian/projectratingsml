                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         An independent team of consultants, managed by UNICEF, submitted in May 2011 a draft WASH sector assessment report to the National Planning Commission (NPC). The limited
                         time and funding available to prepare the report meant that further analysis and data collection will be required but it does indicate that the services provided through the financing of
                         the Rural Water and Sanitation Development Board (the #Board#) is comparatively more cost effective. The overall progress of the Project and the overall performance of the Board
                         were reviewed in July 2011. Based on these and the commitment of the Government of Nepal towards the approach, the Bank extended the Project closing date to August 31, 2012.
                         The Bank will also initiate a comparative assessment of the different approaches in the rural water supply and sanitation sector in Nepal during this period.
