NEPAL: SECOND RURAL WATER SUPPLY & SANITATION PROJECT
(IDA CREDIT No. CR. 391 1-NEP AND IDA GRANT No. H 369-NEP)
Implementation Support Review No.15: January 31-February 6,2012
AIDE- MEMOIRE
I.     INTRODUCTION
1.   An IDA team- carried out the Fifteenth Implementation Support Review of the Nepal:
Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSP II), including the Additional
Financing, during the period January 31-February 6, 2012.
2.   The team had discussions with the Honorable Vice Chancellor and officials of the National
Planning Commission (NPC); the Secretary and the officials of the Ministry of Physical Planning
and Works (MPPW): officials of Ministry of Finance (MoF); and the Board Members and staff
of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board (the Board). The list of persons
met is provided in Attachment 1. The wrap-up meeting, chaired by Mr. Tulasi Sitaula, Secretary,
MPPW was held on February 6, 2012 at the Ministry and was attended by representatives from
MoF, MPPW and the Board Secretariat. The team also made field visits to Dhanusha, Siraha,
and Udaypur districts during January 24-27, 2012 and visited a scheme in Dhading on February
5, 2012. The observations from the field are attached as Attachment II. The Aide Memoire and
the actions agreed (Annex 1) were discussed and agreed at the wrap up meeting. Annex 2
presents the status of implementation of the actions agreed during the Fourteenth Implementation
Support Consultations and the technical review of September 2011. As agreed with GoN, this
aide-memoire will be classified as a public document under IDA's Access to Information policy.
3.   During the visit the team also discussed the proposed rural water supply and sanitation
sector study for the identification of options to increase sustainable access to services. The team
has received the go-ahead to issue the Request for Expression of Interest from the Secretary,
MPPW while revising the Terms of Reference (ToRs) to incorporate comments received from
the sector stakeholders. The revised ToRs was shared with the sector stakeholder group through
the Sector Efficiency Improvement Unit of MPPW on February 2, 2012 and discussed at a
meeting on February 6, 2012 at MPPW. The working committee comprising GoN officials,
UNICEF and the Bank formed to finalize the ToRs has discussed and revised the same. The
notice Request for Expression of Interest from the firms was published on February 21, 2012.

I.   ACHIEVEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES3:
4. Development Objectives (DO): The two Project Development Objectives are likely to be met
to a large extent by the project closing date (August 31, 2012). Annex 3 presents a summary of
the performance against the key performance indicators.
Development Objective 1: "to improve sector institutional performance and mainstream
"the Board" approach in the Government's system" is likely to be partially met by the current
project closing date when measured against the four key indicators. The Government has in
place a national rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector policy (2004) which has
established: (i) common minimum guidelines in the sector and (ii) a sector wide minimum
cost sharing norm of 20% which could be reduced to 10% for the poor and disadvantaged
groups. The third indicator, NPC and MPPW effectively monitor and evaluate the RWSSS
sector, is possible as the RWSS Sector M&E/MIS/DSS (Decision Support System) system,
which was developed in early December 2009 and formally launched in November 2010, is
picking up its operations. However, more and expeditious efforts are required by GoN to
ensure the use of the system by the key sector stakeholders. To that end, and to hully
operationalize the web-based system, the RWSS Sector M&E Unit has conducted regional
workshops for district level stakeholders. These people will be primarily responsible for
providing data into the system in all the five development regions. The Unit is assisting the
Department of Local Infrastructure and Agriculture Roads (DOLIDAR) to establish district
level databases in 37 districts. When the Government effectively monitors the RWSS sector
it will be able to implement the fourth indicator i.e. to link budget allocations among
competing approaches to evaluated outcomes. Unless GoN, particularly MPPW, commits to
make use of the RWSS sector M&E system this objective will not be met fully. In addition
the Bill to make the Board a regular sector institution has been under discussion with the
Parliamentary Legislative Committee for a final discussion before approval by Parliament.
The committee members have held several discussions on the Bill and the Board was also
invited to provide clarifications. Some of the Parliamentary Committee members also
undertook field visits. The review team understands from the Board that the Legislative
Committee members have reached consensus on all but one issue related to the
representation of Village Development Committee / District Development Committee
(VDC/DDC) associations. Given that the Parliament has bigger national issues to deal with at
this time, the approval of the Bill is likely to take more time unless MPPW accords this top
priority.
Development Objective 2: "to support communities to form inclusive local water supply
and sanitation user groups that can plan, implement, and operate drinking water and
sanitation infrastructure that delivers sustainable health, hygiene, and productivity benefits to
rural households" will be met substantially by the current closing date of August 31, 2012.
Current estimates show that both the targeted schemes and target population will be met and
is likely to be surpassed. The Board's revised implementation plan expects to meet and
surpass the project target of completing 1,463 schemes by the closing date. The key
3/  This Aide-memoire should be read in conjunction with the 1st Trimester Implementation Progress Report (July 16,2011 to
November 15, 2011) and its supplemental update up to January 25,2012. Further, to keep the main text of the Aide
memoire brief, the specific component/topic related issues will be reported in the Annexes.


﻿RWSSPP H- 15' ISMAM                   3                                  March 6, 2012
indicators for this objective show that where schemes have been implemented the impact on
access to improved water supply and sanitation services, health, inclusion, income generation
etc. are positive. Social capital is developed to a large extent - community empowerment,
inclusion and capacity building to plan, implement and operate and maintain their systems
are being achieved in the completed schemes. Further, the community managed schemes
have proven to exhibit a high degree of sustainability. However, there are concerns that
implementation delays may occur partly due to issues on internal management and partially
due to circumstances beyond the Board's control. For example, change in Government has
affected nomination of Board members which in turn has resulted in delays in decision
making at the Board. The replacement of members nominated by the previous government by
new members resulted in a court case and the reinstatement of two earlier members; while a
court decision on one member is still pending. Thus the Board currently has only six (out of
the seven) members and this has affected the election of its chairperson. Further, frequent
change at the Joint Secretaries in the Ministries result in changes to the Board membership
from the respective ministries- MPPW and MLD. Although the Board Secretariat informed
the Bank team that so far this has not been a cause for delays in implementation, it is very
unsettling and a need for lot of additional effort in bringing the new members up to speed.
III.   CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
5.   The Project: The Project will finance a total of 1,463 implementation phase schemes
covering a base year population of 1.038 million; 450 development phase schemes and 500 pre-
development phase schemes4. So far, 78% of the total revised project cost and 79% of the total
IDA funds have been spent. Community contribution is on an average 3% higher than planned.
The table below shows the revised financing plan and actual expenditure for the project.

* US$ 4 million out of AF of US$ 27 million
6.   Overall implementation    progress The   Board   currently  has completed  1,168
implementation phase schemes (i.e. construction of water supply and environmental sanitation
assets) and 1,542 development phase schemes (i.e. community development activities including
detail design of schemes in preparation for implementation). In addition, 338 implementation
4 In June 2011, the project was extended to August 31, 2012 and US$ 4 million was cancelled from the AF.


﻿RWSSPP II- 15"' ISMAM                 4                                  March 6, 2012
phase schemes are ongoing.5 The project has provided water supply to a population of 860,000
and 176,941 household latrines have been constructed thus far. By the Project closing date of
August 31, 2012, the Board expects to provide access to water supply and sanitation along with
health and hygiene education benefits to a population of 1.14 million through construction of
1,480 schemes.
7.     Environmental and Social Safeguards: the Project is in compliance with the
environmental and safeguard requirements and no major issues were found during the review.
8.   Environment Management and Water Ouality: The Board has commissioned the testing
of water quality for Batch VIII implementation phase schemes as well as that for completed
schemes under Batches V to VII to test the samples taken from the source, taps, reservoir (RVT)
and households as part of the regular periodic water quality testing. The draft report will be
available by April 2012. As tests for iron, manganese and arsenic had not been carried out for
quite some time in the completed groundwater schemes, it was agreed during the previous
review that such tests would be carried out for the completed schemes. However this action has
been delayed and the Board plans to combine this with the assessment of safe yield. The Board
has identified six schemes with high lime content and pipe encrustation problems that needs to
be rehabilitated using Lime Remedial Treatment Technology. Water Quality monitoring by
users, with help from the Support Organizations (SOs) during post-implementation phase is,
ongoing. Until now no risks have been reported - the main feedback from the users is related to
repairs & maintenance of the schemes rather than water quality risks. During the field visits
made in January 2012, it was found that the construction quality was good with provision of
necessary protection measures. The water quality test of the implementation phase in five of the
schemes visited, however, shows presence of E. Coli, although physical and chemical quality of
water is within WHO and Nepal government guidelines. In some places it was found that latrines
have been constructed in close vicinity of the shallow tube wells further exacerbating the
problem. The users were generally found to be unaware of this fact (Attachment II provides a
summary of field observations and measures agreed).
9.   Social Safeguards and Community Development Activities: The team noted satisfactory
progress on the overall implementation of social issues in the project (Details in Annex 5). The
Implementation Progress Report and others reveal the positive contribution that the project has
continued to make on the lives of women in terms of time saved and other socio-economic
opportunities. Similarly, the level of participation of disadvantaged caste and ethnic groups in the
project fold is also encouraging. The last review had made several recommendations to address
some of the post-implementation stage concerns that affect the sustainability of the project.
These suggestions have been taken into consideration and several strategies such as registering
Water Supply and Sanitation User Committees (WSUCs) as cooperatives, linking credit groups
with Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and assisting them in accessing the Rural Self-Reliance Fund
instituted by the NRB, have been initiated.
10. Formal documentation of land donation agreements from Batch VII onwards for structures
built on private land in prescribed formats is underway. However, several discrepancies such as
s Of these, 168 implementation phase schemes of Batch VI, VII and VIII covering a population of 180,206 are
substantially completed.


﻿RWSSPP II- 15' ISMAM                5                                March 6, 2012
incomplete information in the land donation forms, individuals opting for a signed letter instead
of using the form, and failure of SOs to secure such land donation agreement, were noted. A
number of remedial actions to address these discrepancies were discussed during the review and
it has been agreed that these suggestions will be tabled, and a decision will be made during the
Division Chiefs' Meeting and the Technical Appraisal Committee's meeting, both of which will
be held by the end of February 2012.
11. Since the last review, progress on the innovative activities undertaken by the Board to link
the Women's Technical Support Services (WTSS) groups with mico-credit organizations and
help them develop commercial business development opportunities (Jeevika Karyakram) and in
ensuring the sustainability of schemes (scheme insurance) has been limited. The Board has not
been able to sign the MOU with the IDA assisted livelihoods "JEEVIKA" project in Bihar, India,
for community professionals from Bihar to provide back-stopping support to the Jeevika groups
in Nepal because of bureaucratic hurdles. While there is a plan to insure 1000 water supply and
sanitation schemes against natural disasters the number of schemes insured has not increased
beyond 35.
12. Project Studies: Most of the long pending studies under the project have now been either
been finalized and submitted to the Bank, or are progressing towards completion. It has been
agreed that the "Technical, Operational and Environmental Audit Study for Batch VI and VII"
and "Short-term Sustainability Study of Batch V" will be initiated by end of March 2012 while a
draft report of the "Long-term Sustainability Study of Batch III and IV" and the published
version of the "Annual Report 2010-11" will be ready by end of March 2012. The team also
reviewed and provided recommendations on the ToRs prepared to conduct an independent study
on Gender and Social Inclusion, and the Indigenous Peoples' Development Plan. It has been
agreed that a revised ToR will be prepared and submitted to the IDA for review by the end of
February 2012.
13. The special study on water demand consumption and pattern, envisaged under the project,
is yet to be initiated. The Board is preparing the ToRs to do a limited study to ascertain the water
demand in the scheme areas.
14. RWSS Sector M&E/ MIS system and the Board's Management Information System
(MIS): The web centric RWSS sector M&E/MIS at MPPW and the web-based MIS at the Board
provide a strong foundation for management of the sector and the project. The team encouraged
MPPW to continue to develop the Sector M&E as its main tool for monitoring and planning in
the sector. The Bank team discussed with the RWSS sector M&E Unit staff to identify ways in
which the existing database can be used to help design the sampling frame for the planned study
on performance of different RWSS modalities.
15. The Board's MIS is proving its value with the last trimester report being prepared on time
and drawing extensively on the system. During the review the team agreed with the Board on
data to be provided to facilitate preparation of the ICRR (see Section IV).
16. Governance and Accountability Action Plan: The Project's GAAP implementation is
ongoing as agreed during the additional financing. Since the last review, the Board has posted

the following documents in its website: (i) Procurement Plan, (ii) Implementation Progress
Report of the second trimester of FY 2010/11; (iii) FY 2009/10 Audit Report, (iv) the Board
Manuals, (v) Approved list of schemes; (vi) List of selected SOs and SAs, and (vii) all
procurement related documents such as Eol, ToRs, Request For Proposal (RFP), information on
award of contracts etc. The Board has also published the Annual Report for 2010 which
included audited financial statements for FY 2009/10. At the community level the Board
continues to expand Social Accountability Committees in schemes and it is mandatory for
communities to have display boards showing physical and financial information.
Procurement and Financial Management
17. Procurement: The team reviewed the current procurement status against the procurement
plan and the progress as reported in the IPR of January 05, 2012 and the Supplementary IPR
updated January 25, 2012. From the report and discussions with the Procurement Official at the
Board, most of the planned procurement is in the implementation stage - albeit with delays.
However, the revised dates for each milestone and expected revised completion dates need to be
incorporated in an updated procurement plan. In addition there are eight (8) key activities for
which the procurement process is still ongoing. These activities, and their currently estimated
completion dates are: (the number relates to the activity number in the procurement plan)

18. While many of these pending activities are optimistically planned to be complete by project
closing, they may, in fact, extend beyond August 31, 2012. It is therefore necessary that the
Board management critically review all the ongoing as well as pending activities to assess which
of these can realistically be completed by project closing. For those that cannot be completed, the


﻿RWSSPP II- 15' ISMAM                 7                                  March 6, 2012
Board should identify those that are essential and take action to ensure timely completion. (The
Board submitted a revised procurement plan to IDA for approval on February 13, 2012).)
19. One issue brought out in the discussions was the delay in conducting the sustainability
study of -3 year old schemes of Batch VI - which now are 5 years old. Due to the delay, there
might be additional schemes that have been completed which also need to be included. The team
advised that the Board assess the numbers, revise the TOR, cost and time estimates accordingly
and incorporate it in the RFP that is to be developed.
20. Financial Management, Disbursement and Audit. Overall the Board has continued to
maintain a good financial management system. The team reviewed the system and also reviewed
the transactions and records based on the information provided in the first trimester Financial
Monitoring Report of FY2011/12, and they were found to be satisfactory. The FMIS system in
the Board is fully operational and is reliable. The internal control and checking of financial
information has worked well. During the review the team suggested some improvements in
terms of keeping the original documents with the vouchers. Based on current progress the team
estimates about US$2.50 million would remain undisbursed by the end of the current closing
date. These are savings due to exchange gain of US Dollar vis-A-vis Nepalese Rupees, and the
actual costs of the works and goods being lower than the estimated prices. (Details in Annex 6).
21. Commitments beyond the Project closing date: As discussed in the previous reviews,
the Bank team reiterated that any commitments made for expenditures beyond the closing date of
August 31, 2012 will be the government's responsibility. With the project closing at the end of
August, two particular issues were identified:
(i) Whether to proceed with implementation of Batch IX schemes, and
(ii) Whether to proceed with development phase work and predevelopment phase activities
of Batches X and XI respectively
22. In the case of Batch IX the Bank would be willing to consider allocation of identified
project savings towards those activities subject to the Board being able to confirm financing for
the remainder of the total estimated cost of $9.0m. The estimated savings of between $1.8 -
$2.5m would have to be disbursed before the end of the project.
23. Proceeding with Batch X and XI will raise expectations amongst beneficiary communities.
As such the Bank cautioned against starting such activities without having clarity on availability
of financing for the studies and the implementation costs that would arise after project closing.
24. The Bank team met with MoF, NPC and MPPW to urge that the future role and financing
of the Board is clarified as soon as possible.6 Failure to provide clarity will undermine the
operation of the Board.
6The team understands that MPPW has processed a request to MoF for financing for the Board to continue its
operations.

IV.   PREPARATION FOR IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION & RESULTS REPORT
25. The team discussed with the Board the data requirements, process and timeline for the
preparation of the Implementation Completion & Results Report (ICRR) for the project. Given
the significant advantages in earlier preparation of the ICRR it was agreed that the preparatory
work for the ICRR would start immediately with the objective of completing the ICRR by
December 31, 2012. It was agreed that the immediate first step for the preparation of the ICRR
is to carry out a review of the project's M&E system to identify possible data gaps (in particular
for completed projects) and initiate, if required, the data collection to fill the gaps. The following
immediate actions/next steps were agreed:
*  The Board will submit to IDA by February 15,2012 6 the following M&E data for all
Batch V-VIII schemes: (a) technical specification of the scheme; (b) geographic location
of the scheme (region, zone, district, ward); (c) number of beneficiaries (population and
HH) at pre-development, development and implementation phase, (d) total capital costs
(including variations) and cost breakdown by source (community, government and IDA's
contribution as applicable); (e) time savings and other benefits; (f) ERR; (g) O&M funds.
*  The Board will submit by February 15, 2012 to the IDA the Post-Implementation
Project (PIP) data collected at six months interval in the two years following the closure
of the schemes for all Batch V schemes, including a copy of the Post Implementation
Phase reporting format.
*  The ICRR Task Team will analyze the M&E data and communicate to the Board whether
additional data collection is required for the preparation of the ICRR and the updating of
Cost-Benefit Analysis, by February 28, 2012.
V.    KEY ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TEAM:
26.  Funding Activities Beyond the IDA project closing date: The team has assessed that by
the end of the current closing date the Board will have disbursed about US$ 46 million and about
US$ 2.5 million would remain undisbursed. The Board estimates that it would need about US$
9.0 million to complete the implementation phase of Batch IX schemes and requested the Bank if
it could use the saving under the project to part finance the implementation phase of Batch IX
schemes. The Bank has not yet received any formal request from MoF. In principle, the Bank
team was agreeable to the use of the undisbursed funds provided GoN confirms to the Bank by
March 15, 2012 that it would provide the Board the balance funds required to complete fully
Batch IX implementation phase schemes.
27. Clarity on the Future of the Board Beyond the IDA project closing: The Board is faced
with some uncertainty about its future; what will happen to it after the Bank project closes. The
team would like to flag this issue as it does affect the decision of the Board with regard to filling
current vacant positions in the Secretariat as well as whether it should process contracts for
future Batches of schemes like Batches X and XI etc.
6 The Board provided the details to IDA on Feb. 15, 2012

28. Internal Management issue: An immediate concern is related to having the full Board of
seven members in place. For smooth and timely completion of the Project activities this issue
needs to be resolved at the earliest so that there is stability in the Board.
29. Land donation agreement: From Batch VII onwards the Board requires that wherever
private land has been donated/acquired, it be recorded in a prescribed format. However, it is
found that this requirement is not fully followed as discussed above. The team requests that this
be resolved at the earliest.
30. Procurement Delays: The team is concerned that there has been delays in several
procurement activities. It appears that the Board's plan shifts with the closing date of the project.
The team strongly recommended that the Board review its procurement plan to come up with one
that is doable and then proceed to implement it. (The Board submitted the revised procurement
plan to IDA for approval on February 13, 2012)
31. Preparation of the ICRR: The team would like to alert the Government and the Board
that, to capture the many lessons that the Project could offer, it would be necessary to start the
preparation of the ICRR. Now, in this regard the Bank's ICCR team leader has had discussions
with the Board and will continue to do so. The Board is recommended to collect and consolidate
data for the ICRR.
32. RWSS Sector M&E/MIS System: The challenge ahead is to operationalize the web-
based system and have a good mechanism for maintaining and disseminating information.
VI. PROPOSED TIMING OF THE NEXT REVIEW
33. The next implementation support review is proposed for August 2012.

SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS
1.     This Annex summarizes the outcome of discussions held with the Board officials, findings from
the field visit undertaken from January 24-26, 2012, and review of the implementation progress report
and assessment reports on community development and social safeguards aspects of the project
implementation from social development and social safeguards perspective. Based on the discussions, a
set of future actions were agreed. (See Section V below).
.     Gender and Social Inclusion
2.     The Board has, and continues to pay significant attention to issues of gender and social inclusion,
and equity concerns in all program activities especially by adopting the Revised Livelihood and Social
Inclusion (LSI) methodology. This has resulted in visible improvements in the representation and
participation of the socially excluded groups in project activities as well as their implementation and
management. According to the Implementation Progress Report (I' Trimester, FY 2011/12), by
November 2011, 1,561 WSUGs comprising of 18,303 members were formed in which the representation
of marginalized groups like Dalits, Janajatis and other deprived caste/ethnic groups has been around 63
percent. Similarly, among the total beneficiary households, around 57 percent are from these excluded
groups. With mandatory requirement introduced for women's involvement in the decision making
positions, mostly as treasures, women's confidence in institutional representation has been made strong
and I1 percent of WSUCs have women as Chairpersons and 98.21 percent as Treasurers. Similarly, 29
percent of WSUC Chairpersons are Dalits and from other disadvantaged groups.
Besides improving representation, the schemes have also allowed women to save, on average,
almost three hours of their time in fetching water which has been effectively used in child care, income
generation activities, and other household responsibilities.8 Further, more than 45 thousand women have
graduated from Non-Formal Education (NFE) classes;9 around 1,900 females are currently working as
Village Health Promoters (VHPs);'o and more than 99 thousand female members have mobilized more
than NRs. 26 million in income generating activities." To ensure access of services to remote areas where
households from deprived communities primarily reside, more than 33 percent of the schemes selected
are located beyond 8 km from all weather roads. 1
8 According to the report, "Achievements of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects Implemented by the
RWSSFDB" submitted in July 2011, women have used around 30 percent of their saved time on economic activities
(e.g., farming, livestock raising and cottage industries) followed by 16 percent in household chores (child rearing,
cleaning, kitchen gardening), and the remaining 54 percent of their time to take rest and attend socio-cultural events.

4.     While the achievements made thus far are significant, the team has expressed concerns over: (i)
long-term sustainability of these gains especially after the post-implementation stage; (ii) variations in
the utilization of existing provisions13 to aid the poor and disadvantaged communities from scheme to
scheme; (iii) differences in representation of HH from disadvantaged groups especially in heterogeneous
communities4; (iv) linkages with other institutions, including local government; and (v) low
representation of females and those from other disadvantaged groups among the Village Maintenance
Workers, SOs staff and SA staffs.
II.    Social Safeguards
5.     On the issue of social safeguards, a standard format for land donation agreement in prescribed
formats was introduced from Batch VII onwards for structures built on private land that were voluntarily
donated. The Board has developed software for land donation agreement in web-MIS, and it has been
agreed that data entry of collected form in MIS will be initiated by March 2012.
6.     While the documentation process is underway, a review of Batch VII schemes reveals that the
procedures have not been followed through for a substantial number of cases even though during the last
review in June 2011 it had been agreed that the formal documentation of land procedures would be
completed by end-July 2011 (see Table below). Further, several discrepancies such as incomplete
information in the land donation forms, individuals opting for a signed letter instead of using the form,
and failure of SOs to secure such land donation agreement, were noted.
7.     So far, no formal complaints have been lodged over disputes regarding land issues in the project
and the schemes in batch VII have successfully reached post implementation stage. However, during the
field visit, it was observed that in some cases, tensions among community members are brewing
especially over issues of elite capture of the water points (scheme ???) (e.g., the problem of private land
owner barring access or providing only limited access to a particular dug wellto others, private land
owners single handedly deciding to change the location of the shallow tube well after a decision taken by
the beneficiaries, etc).
8.     The team alerted the Board about these problems and suggested that to avoid future disputes
among community members, immediate actions are required to formalize the private land donation. A
number of remedial actions to address these discrepancies were discussed during the review: (i) quick
collection of information from all schemes and analysis of land donation agreements of Batch VII for
further action; (ii) mandatory provision to include the standard land donation agreements from Batch
VIII for Post-implementation phase contracts that is also tied up with payments; (iii) inclusion of land
donation agreements in the training content of the remaining Team Leaders and Field Coordinators of
Batch IX schemes. It has been agreed that these suggestions will be tabled, and a decision will be made
during the Division Chiefs' Meeting and the Technical Appraisal Committee's meeting, both of which
will be held by the end of February 2012.

'4 While in total, the representation of households/members from disadvantaged groups like Dalits and Janajatis has
been significant, it is a relative proportion that depends to a large extent on the composition of beneficiary

III.   Project Studies
9.     Most of the long pending studies under the project have now been either finalized and submitted
to the Bank, or are progressing towards completion (See Table below). It has been agreed that the
"Technical, Operational and Environmental Audit Study for Batch VI and VII" and "Short-term
Sustainability Study of Batch V" will be initiated by end of March 2012 while a draft report of the "Long-
term Sustainability Study of Batch III and IV" and the published version of the "Annual Report 2010-11"
will be ready by end of March 2012. However, the special study on water demand consumption and
pattern, envisaged under the project, is yet to be initiated.
10.   The team also reviewed and provided recommendations on the ToRs prepared to conduct an
independent study on Gender and Social Inclusion, and the Indigenous Peoples' Development Plan. The
need for such an analysis was identified in the recommendations from the recently completed report,
"Impact of RWSS II Efforts for Social Inclusion and Gender Equity." It has been agreed that a revised
ToR will be prepared and submitted to the IDA for review by the end of February 2012.

IV.    Improving Project Sustainability
11.    The last review had made several recommendations to address some of the post-implementation
stage concerns that affect the sustainability of the project including: (i) ensuring that all essential
documents belonging to the community and WUSC is in their possession; (ii) conducting refresher
training on WSUC rules and charters, community roles and responsibilities in maintaining the
infrastructure, water quality monitoring, etc; (iii) linking credit groups with Banks and markets; (iv) up-
scaling of pilot insurance of WS schemes; e) strengthening participatory monitoring and evaluation by
communities.
These suggestions have been taken into consideration and several strategies such as registering WSUCs as
cooperatives, linking credit groups with Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and assisting them in accessing the
Rural Self-Reliance Fund instituted by the NRB, have been initiated. However, progress on the innovative
activities undertaken by the Board to link the women's (WTSS) groups with mico-credit organizations
and help them develop commercial business development opportunities (Jeevika Karyakram) have been
limited. The Board has not been able to sign the MOU with the IDA assisted livelihoods "JEEVIKA"
project in Bihar, India, for community professionals from Bihar to provide back-stopping support to the
Jeevika groups in Nepal.
12.    Similarly, to ensure the sustainability of schemes, a plan had been developed to insure 1,000
water supply and sanitation schemes against natural disasters (i.e., scheme insurance). A brochure on
insurance of schemes was ready by the time of the review. However, the number of schemes insured has
not increased beyond 35. Some of the reasons mentioned included: lack of adequate incentives for
insurance agents because of limited business volume, lack of interest among community members, etc. To
address this concern, the Board is revisiting its approach by seeking linkages with insurance companies,

making scheme insurance mandatory for schemes under the implementation phase, and sensitizing
community members on the values of having both life- and non-life insurances.

NEPAL: SECOND RURAL WATER SUPPLY & SANITATION PROJECT
(CR. 3911-NEP AND IDA GRANT NO. H 369-NEP)
Financial Manaaement
1.     Budget for FY2011/12 and Estimated Expenditures as of May 31, 2011:  The approved
budget for the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board for FY2011/12 is
NRs.1,060.94 million, which is about 7% less than the FY2010/11 allocation. IDA financing in
FY2011/12 has been reduced by 2%, and the government's share increased by about 10%. Of the total
proposed budget, NRs.1,011.48 million (95%) is to be funded by an IDA grant and NRs.49.46 million
(5%) by GON, as counterpart funding. ThePproposed counterpart fund allocation is to finance 85% of
incremental operating costs. The Board's budget is allocated under the new budget codes as follows:
Recurrent Budget 337173 and the Capital Budget 337134. The budget also includes the implementation
phase of Batch IX which is not covered under the project scope of the IDA Grant H369-NEP. The
category-wise allocation is as follows:

2.     The team noted that the counterpart fund allocation is adequate. The credit allocation (Cr.391 I-
NEP) of the Project has been fully utilized.
3.     Total expenditures as of January 25, 2012 are only NRs.38.9 million, which is about 3.7 % of the
approved budget. With this trend and based on implementation progress, by the end of fiscal year, only
about 60% of the approved budget is expected to be spent. In view of the fact that the project is closing
on August 31, 2012, the Board will have to place top priority to ensure that all committed contracts
complete the jobs by the end of the closing date so that the funds committed can be disbursed.
IDA Disbursements and Expected Scenario by the Current Closing Date:
4.     As of January 31, 2012, total disbursements from the IDA credit are about US$ 26.15 million.
This is 100% disbursement from the credit allocation which has been fully utilized and documented.
Total disbursements from the IDA grant are about US$17.25 million or about 79% of the grant allocation.
Excluding the outstanding advances in the Designated Accounts, the actual use of grant funds is only
about 41%. Combining credit and grant allocation, the total resources used is about 90%; but when
netted against the remaining advances in the Designated Accounts, the actual use of funds is about 72%.
Based on current progress, the team estimates about US$2.50 million would remain undisbursed by
the end of the current closing date of August 31, 2012. The savings are due to exchange gain of US

Dollar vis-i-vis Nepalese Rupees, actual costs of works and goods being lower than the estimated prices.
All physical targets of the Project are expected to be completed by the closing date.
5.     Financial Management:   Overall, the Board has continued to maintain a good financial
management system. The team reviewed the system as well as the transactions and records based on the
information provided in the first trimester Financial Monitoring Report of FY2011/12. They were found
to be satisfactory. The FMIS system in the Board is fully operational and is reliable. The internal control
and checking of financial information has worked well. During the review, the team suggested some
improvements in terms of keeping the original documents with the vouchers.
6.    In order to improve overall financial management, the Board discussed/agreed with the Bank
team the following:
* The Board has now amended the Operational and Financial Management Manual based on the
recommendations of the impact study. The Manual has also been translated into Nepali.
* The Board will carry out the training program more frequently tying it up with the contract
awards, and it was agreed that a training plan would be prepared and shared with IDA
7.     InternalAudit: The Board extended the contract of the existing Internal Auditor for FY2011/12.
The team reviewed the internal audit report of FY20 10/11.  The report has suggested the following
actions: (1) Improve the budget control system to ensure that expenditures do not exceed approved
budget, (2) Any deviation from adopted accounting policy should be disclosed in the accounting policies,
(3) Procurement of goods and services should be done from the suppliers registered with the Inland
Revenue Office, (4) Deduct tax at source as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act, and (5) Ensure
compliance with the Accounting Manual related to making payments through accounts payee checks, and
checking controls on advances to staff.  The Board management has committed to address these
shortcomings. The first internal audit report of FY2011/12 has not yet been completed, and is expected to
be completed in February.
8.     Implementation Progress Report: There are no outstanding progress reports. The review team
discussed the first trimester financial monitoring report of FY2011/12. The team made some comments
on the draft report, and the revised financial report will be submitted by February l O. The first trimester
report will not trigger any disbursement as there are sufficient fund balances in the Designated Accounts.
The review team reminded that the second trimester report for FY2011/12 is due on April 30, 2012.
9.     Audit Reports: The audit report of FY2010/11 is now overdue5. The review team was
informed that the audit has been completed and the report is expected by the end of February, 2012. The
team reviewed the preliminary observations and no significant issues have been raised. The review team
also reminded the Board that the unaudited accounts of FY2011/12 is due on October 15, 2012, and the
audited accounts on January 15, 2013.
15 A warning letter was issued on February 10, 2012.

FIELD VISIT
1.     A Bank team comprising Mmes./Messrs.: Silva Shrestha, Drona Ghimire, Bandita Sijapati and
Tashi Tenzing visited Batch VII and VIII schemes in Dhanusha, Siraha and Udaypur districts of Central
and Eastern Development Regions between January 24-27, 2012. The Bank team was accompanied by
Maheshwar Yadav, Executive Director, Harish Chandra Neupane, Regional Manager and the respective
portfolio managers of the Board Secretariat. Respective Support Organization Staff joined the team in the
field. Similarly, Messrs. William Kingdom and Tashi Tenzing visited a scheme in Dhading District on
February 5, 2012. Messrs/Mmes. Ramesh Bista, Joint Secretary, MPPW, Bhagwan Aryal, Under

The main observations of the team during the field are as follows:
2.     Yagyabhumi Water Supply and Sanitation Scheme -16 dug-wells fitted with hand pumps
have been constructed to cater to 265 Households (one dug-well typically serves about 15 households)
under this scheme. The quality of construction of all wells visited were found to be satisfactory - each
well has a raised apron around it and is covered to protect the water from being contaminated. However,
the system is not properly used. All the wells visited had the cover partially open to allow a rope and
bucket system or a submersible electric motors (more than one) installed to haul/pump water from some
of the wells. The users informed the team that as the water table in a few wells had gone down, the hand
pumps was found to be ineffective; thus they are using either the bucket and rope system to haul water or
motorized pumps. One issue reported was that the washer of the Mark III handpump wears out after 3 to 4


﻿RWSSPP I- 15l'ISMAM                    31                                   March 6, 2012
months and the community is unable to purchase the washer locally. The drawdown of the water table
could be an indication of the potential risk of the well drying up in the future. The team observed that
while the water from the dug-wells may not be inadequate for drinking it becomes inadequate as there is
demand for irrigation water. This is aggravated by in-migration to the community from other villages
which could lead to future conflict in the scheme area- The quality of water has been tested. Test results
show that arsenic, iron and manganese are within permissible limits, however, E. Coli is present in the
water from almost all wells. This has not been communicated to the users nor has measures, such as in-
home treatment or disinfection at the source (well), to deal with the bacteriological quality of water have
been considered in the community so far. The infrequent meeting of the WSUC and the fact that efforts to
collect regularly a fee from the households for O&M are of concern. The community had received NRs.
50,000 from the VDC for the scheme which was put in as part of community contribution.
3.     Bagaha water Supply and sanitation Scheme. The scheme consists of 29 Shallow Tube-Wells
(STWs with handpumps serving 279 households). Some houses in the community were using STWs
before this scheme by tapping the first aquifer at a depth ranging between 15 ft to 25 ft. Water from these
aquifers contain high level of iron. The handpump tube wells provided under the current scheme draws
water from deeper aquifers at 30 m to 40 m and until now the water from this depth has not been found to
contain iron. These handpump tube wells were constructed quite well with tidy looking platforms.
However, there were no drainage pipes to drain the wastewater away. Water quality tests shows that
physical and chemical quality is satisfactory (within WHO and Nepal government standard). However,
biological quality shows presence of E- Coli. The users were unaware of this and so are not taking any
measures, such as boiling, to deal with the quality issue. It was also observed that some of the toilets
constructed were too close to the existing tube wells. An institutional latrine has been provided for the
school (with separate provisions for girls and boys). One concern related to the school toilet is its cleaning
and maintenance. The team observed that the community also had many private handpumps and the
location of the tubewells constructed under the project may not be convenient for all beneficiary
households.
4.     Chaufal Water Supply and Sanitation Scheme. This is a lift scheme using a sump-well serving
121 households with 20 community taps. A 6 m deep sump well has been constructed by the Kali Khola.
The sump area is protected by barbed-wire fence. Removable wooden planks, with holes in it, are
provided as a cover for the sump well. From a hole made on the side of the sump well a pipe is fitted to
pump water to a school across the river. The holes on the side of the sump well and cover greatly
increases the possibility of external pollution of the sump well (source) water by elements such as dust,
leaves, insects as well as run-off water entering the sump well. Water quality tested in the implementation
phase shows that physical and chemical quality of water is satisfactory, but the bacteriological quality is
not satisfactory - there is E- Coli present. The consumers are unaware of the quality of water. It has also
been noted that the sump-well location is prone to possible river bank cutting by flood. The issue has been
discussed with the community. The community is pumping and distributing water only for I hour per day
primarily because of the high electricity cost for pumping. The team also observed that some tapstands
have been added in the system after the scheme completion. This raises a question of about the
participatory need assessment that should have been done in the Development Phase when the number
and location of tapstands should have been agreed. Indiscriminate addition of tapstands could affect the
equitable distribution of water and thereby the technical sustainability of the scheme.
5.     Chaudandi Water Supply and Sanitation Scheme. This is a gravity scheme in the hill with 23
community taps serving 100 households. The spring source is fenced to protect it from unauthorized entry
by human beings and animals. A gabion wall protects it against flood from the stream. The source has
excess water which is shared with a downstream community. The review team advised the community to
have a clear written agreement with the downstream community on the allocation of the water from this
source in order to avoid possible future disputes. The toilets tidily constructed under the schemes were

well maintained. The tapstands provided with platforms and drainage pipes were also found to be tidy.
The quality of water is yet to be tested after completion of the scheme. (The test during development
phase shows acceptable quality of water as per WHO guidelines and Nepal Government Standards). A
part of the transmission main passes through a spot with risk of landslide. Two WTSS groups have been
formed in the scheme- one with 24 members and the other with 31 members. The first group was re-
formed by adding members to an already existing group in the community. However, the new members to
this group had to pay the total amount already collected by the existing members. The team believes that
this stipulation could have limited the access of many households to the WTSS group. Also, the
community has an active Jagaran (Social Accountability) committee. It was, however, not clear whether
the committee members were provided adequate orientation/training on their roles. This community has
been declared Open Defecation Free.
6.     Parsurantalaw Water Supply and Sanitation Scheme. The scheme consists of 47 Shallow
Tube-Well (STW) with handpumps serving 279 households. A tubewell and an institutional latrine (with
cubicles and urinals for boys and girls) have also been provided to the school situated in the community.
There was tremendous appreciation by the school of the contribution to it under the scheme. However, at
the community, how the locations of the handpump tubewells were decided was a matter of concern to the
team. Many of the handpump tubewells were placed within the private property and the neighboring
households, (beneficiary households of the same handpump tubewell) were drawing water from another
location further away from their houses. It was also apparent that only few households had provided cash
contribution in the implementation phase. Social mobilization was found to be weak. The team learnt that
rather than collecting equal contribution for a handpump tubewell from all the beneficiary households, the
installation of the handpump tubewell proceeded when the total amount (NRs. 3,500/=) was collected,
even if it was provided by one individual. This has resulted in a certain level (to some extent perceived)
capture of the facility. The team discussed this with the Board staff and requested them to address this
issue. The team strongly recommends that the Board ensures that during the milestone monitoring of the
schemes, the process monitoring aspect also be given equal importance to avoid such situations.
7.     Aarubastar-Darimtar Water Supply and Sanitation Scheme. This is a gravity system with
metered yard connections for each of the 56 households. The Board has piloted providing yard taps
instead of standposts. During the field visit, the people were extremely happy with the services;
ownership of the scheme was very high. In fact, the community had purchased the water source and had
the land legally transferred to the water supply and sanitation group (WSUC had the Lal Purja). The
community contributed some NRs. 871,000/= additional for a GI suspended crossing, to increase the
capacity of two ferro-cement tanks (from 4 and 5 cum to 12 cu m. each) and the size of pipes over that
designed for standpost supply, and for construction of individual yard tapstands. The community has also
mobilized cash from the VDC. The WSUC was lead by the youth of the village and they demonstrated
exuberance of youthful energy for the development of their village. All the 56 houses had constructed
toilets and some of them were connected to biogas plants. There are two WTSS groups with 56 women
members and the group is making use of its funds for income generation activities. Two VMWs have
been recruited and are being paid NRs. 750/= per month. Each household pays a flat sum of NRs. 10/=
per month for O&M and NRs. 30/= per month for consumption upto 20 units; thereafter, the tariff is NRs.
5/= per unit of water consumed. Coordination with the DDC and VDC was also good; the VDC had
contributed NRs. 100,000/= for the scheme. The WSUC was very appreciative of the support provided by
the SO, Sana Kisan Sahakari Sanstha. This scheme is a successful model and is expected to be sustained
as the youth leaders are committed to the scheme and development of the village.
