                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The primary objectives of the project are to: (i) improve rural water supply and sanitation sector institutional performance and mainstream the "Fund
                         Board" (Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board) approach in the Government's system, and (ii) support communities to form inclusive
                         local water supply and sanitation user groups that can plan, implement, and operate drinking water and sanitation infrastructure that delivers sustainable health,
                         hygiene and productivity benefits to rural households.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has made reasonable implementation progress given the various internal and external issues the Board faced during this period. Till date, 913 schemes covering a
                         population of about 670,000 has been completed against the project target of 1463 schemes covering a population of 1.04 million. In terms of sanitation 67% of HHs in the Project
                         area have latrines as against the National rural average of 38%. Water Supply and Sanitation User Groups have been formed in 1561 schemes with Water Supply and Sanitation

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         It was agreed during the mission in June 2010 that the performance of the Board on agreed set of actions will be reviewed in September and a decision on future engagement of the
                         Bank in the sector and continuation of the project will depend on the outcomes. Based on the reviews in September and December 2010, the closing date for the project has been
                         extended to August 30, 2011. Decision on any further engagement of the Bank in the sector will be dependent on the outcome of the comparative studies being commissioned to
                         compare the different approaches and agencies in the rural water supply and sanitation sector in Nepal.
