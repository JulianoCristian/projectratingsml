LOAN 1976-KB
PR==FCI
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the First
Railway Project, for which Loan 1976-KE in the amount of US$58.0 million
was approved on April 4, 1981. The Loan was closed, as scheduled, on
December 31, 1985. The loan was not fully disbursed and US 5 9.32
millions was cancelled.
The African Development Bank (AFDB) and the Kreditanstalt Fuer
Wiederaufbau (KFW) financed the project in parallel with the World Bank
and the Government of Kenya. The Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) of U.K. financed some of the studies relating to the
reorganization of Kenya Railwayo. The Franco-Kenya Protocol also
financed log-handling cranes, container cranes (in conjunction with
those financed for the Kenya Port Authority), a rough terrain crane and
a breakdown crane.
The PCR was prepared by the Africa Region and is based on
data provided by the Kenya Railway_ torporation, the Staff Appraisal
Report, the Loan Agreement, supervi ion reports, correspondence between
the Bank and the Borrower and int=..cnal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA
FIRST RAILWAY PROJECT
(Loan 1976-KE)
Evaluation Summary
A. Introduction
1.    Kenya's railway system, like railway systems around the world, has
had great difficulty adjusting to the increasing competition of other
means of transport, especially road transport. Rapid expansion of the
Kenya road network in recent years and the concurrent sharp rise ir
motor vehicles led to a decline in both freight and passenger traftic
which, in turn, caused financial stress in the railway.
2.    While many forces were battering Kenya Railways (KRC) during the
late seventies, Kenya leaders and the World Bank considered the railway
system vital to the country's economy. Moreover, the main railway line
in the Mom.asa-Uganda border corridor was presented as potentially
important to the land-locked countries of East Central Africa. With
these considerations in mind, plans were made in the late seventies for
a First Railway Project which would initiate a long-term program to
enable the KRC to realize its transport potential.
B. Obiectives
3.    The Project's main objectives were to improve KRC's operat_-ons,
financial position and transport capacity. For the short term, che
Project would finance _ertain investments (track improvements, new
rolling stock, spare parts, etc.) designed to prevent further
deterioration of the railway and make some progress in terms of basic
objectives. For further progress toward the main goals, the Project
would finance a number of vital studies which were intended to provide
detailed recommendations or plans for fundamental railway improvements
over the longer term (para 2.05).
C. Proiect ImpRementation and Cost
4.    The Project, which covered the 1981/83 slice of KRC's investment
plan for 1978/83, was estimated to cost US$142 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$88.3 million. A Bank loan of US$58 million was
to finance a major portion of foreign exchange costs. Project financing
was also provided by KFW (US$16.7 million equivalent) and AFDB (US$7.5
million). As Project implementation proceeded, lower KRC earnings and
cuts in Government's appropriations left KRC with insufficient local
currency to carry out all the components originally included in the
project (para 3.05b). KRC thus proposed that a number of the Project
components involving substantial civil works be dropped; the Bank
agreed. Another major problem affecting implementation was that a flash
butt welding machine, considered necessary to carry out the track
rehabilitation component, was damaged in shipment and could not be used
(Para 3.03). Another change in the implementation plan was that the
Government of Kenya used' grant funds provided by ODA, rather than Bank
loan funds as planned, to finance a number of studies.
5.    Among the components carried out more or less as planned were the
procurement of rails, spare parts, hopper wagons, plant machinery and
service vehicles, rehabilitation of locomotives, conversion of workshops
in Nairobi, construction of some staff housing, training programs and
studies ¶para 3.03). While the welding machine was purchased it was not
useable for track laying. As a consequence virtually no track laying



(v)
works were undertaken and most of the rails and fittings purchased still
lie unusod. Tho total final Project coat was USS 85.97 million, 60% of
the appraisal cost.
D.  ROnAIto
6.    At appraisal, freight ton kilometers were projcted to rise from
2.0 billion in 1979 to 2.8 billion 1984; actual traffic reached only 2.0
billion in 1984 and declined in 1985 (paras 4.02-4.04). Similarly,
passenger traffic failed to reach appraisal targets (para 4.06). Most
measures of operating efficiency also deteriorated during the first half
of the eighties. While accomplishments in terms of traffic or operating
efficiency were poor, the various studies financed under the Project
provided a foundation for significant progress in the longer term (para
5.02).
7.    The Project studies dealt with a range of institutional problems
including the relationship between the Government and KRC, the
regulatory framework within which KRC operates, the organizational
structure of KRC, a corporate plan, training plans, reorganization of
the workshops, locomotive rehabilitation, supplies and procurement
policies and procedures and commercialization. A Planning Department
was created and extensive training efforts were carried out.
8.    During the early eighties, notwithstanding optimistic appraisal
forecasts for KRC, the railway showed an actual operating profit oaly in
1984. Among the causes of poor financial results were the decline in
traffic, inadequate rate and fare increases during a period of
considerable inflation, and failure to achieve increaa;d operating
efficiency (para 6.01).
9.    The economic rate of return anticipated for the Project Qs a whole
at appraisal was 21%; in contrast, the reevaluated rate on the fulfilled
components is 11% on the 44% of the Project actually completed (para
7.09). In comparing these returns, it should be noted that a number of
Project components were not implemented.
D. Sustainability
10.   The benefits from the Project, primarily he setting of the stage
for institutional improvements and greater commercialization, should be
sustained, assuming that KRC carries out the improvements in
organization and management that have been agreed and the Government of
Kenya carries out the terms of the Corporate Plan and Memorandum of
Understanding that have been agreed with KRC. If the results of the
various studies are implemented reasonably well in the future there is
some basis for expecting satisfactory performanLe of the railway in the
long term. As of April 1991 there is rerson to believe the benefits
could be long lasting. P reorganization of KRC was carried out and
Government and KRC signed the Memorandum of Underotanding (MOU) as a
condition of the Second Railways Project (para 5.0b). After prodding
from IDA and ODA for GOK and KRC to live up to the principles underlying
the MOU, government has granted KRC greater tariff autonomy and is
compensating KRC where Government directives or policies intervene with
KRC' commercial operations. For its part, KRC has created a Business
Development Unit and a Planning Department that has produced a
reasonable draft corporate plan. A more commercial approach is
evolving, begun to carry out traffic and its working ratio is gradually
improving (para 4.10).



(vi)
C.  Overall AsLssment
11.   The First Railway Project was not a success.  Much of the Project
was not implemented at all and some components were executed only
partially. Despite the Project, traffic declined, operating efficiency
deteriorated and finances worsened. Moreover, the economic rate of
return of the completed components was found to be less than
satisfactory. Yet the reorganization, corporate plan and Memorandum of
Understanding concept pro-:osed by the studies give reason for optimism
that KRC may see better times in the future.
12.   Perhaps the principal conclusion from the experience with the
First Railway Project is that too much was expected from the Project
investments in equipment and facilities. Given the pervasive problems
of KRC, the weaknesses and limitations in nearly every aspect of the
organization, it was probably to be expected that the Project
investments would represent little more than a band aid for a patient in
a severely battered and weakened condition. More promising are the
results of the several studies financed under the Project; that formed
the basis for the follow-up Second Railways Project during which there
has been some improvement (Para 4.09 and 5.05).

PROJECT L JMPLETIQN REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        Kenya's tranoport system is, by African standards, well
developed and fairly officient; the primary transport arteries are the
principal railway lines, main national roads and an oil pipeline. The main
road and railway routes run parallel in a corridor extending from the port
of Mombasa to the Uganda border, roughly 1,000 km in length; the pipeline,
too, lies in this corridor though it extends inland from Mombasa only as
far as Nairobi. Corridor transport is of major importance, serving over
half of Kenya's population and much of the country's agricultural,
commercial and industrial demand for transport as well as serving transit
traffic. Inland water transport is of little significance. Aircraft carry
largely passengers, particularly tourists, and some high value freight.
Most road transport :ompanies are privately-owned and compete effectively
in a largely unregulated environment; the railway and the airline are
government-owned. Although the latter are autonomous and are required by
statut- to be financially self-sufficient, these parastatals are subject to
governmental intervention. The Ministry of Transport and Communications
has overall responsibility for developing, operating and maintaining the
transport infrastructure.
1.02        Kenya's railway system, like railway systems around the world,
has had great difficulty adjusting to the increasing competition of other
means of transport, especially road transport. Rapid expansion of the
Kenya road network in recent years and the concurrent sharp rise in motor
vehicles led to a decline in both freight and passenger traffic which, in
turn, caused financial stress in the railway. As a consequence,
maintenance of equipment and facilities suffered and little capital was
available for new investment. Opening of the pipeline in 1978 also caused
the railway to lose substantial valuable traffic. In 1977, the breakup of
the E;sst African Community caused much economic disruption, and the
subsequent formation of the Kenya Railways Corporation posed many difficult
organizational problems. In addition to these problems, civil war in
Uganda and regional tensions led to a sharp decline in railway transit
traffic through Kenya.
1.03        While many forces were battering Kenya Railways (KRC) during
the late 1970s, Kenya leaders and World Bank staff considered the railway
system vital to the country's economy, carrying millions of tons of
domestic freight annually. Moreover, the main railway line in the Mombasa-
Uganda border corridor was once again acknowledged to be potentially
important to the landlocked countries of East Central Africa. Since rail
is by far the most economical mode of land transport for bulk commodities,
growth in KRC's transit traffic would contribute to the economic
development of the inland countries as well as benefit KRC. With these
considerations in mind, plans were made in the late seventies for a First
Railway Project which would initiate a long term program to enable KRC to
realize its real transport potential. It was recognized that the
managerial and physical needs of the system were so great that only a long
term approach could effectively cope with them.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND A'PRA SsL
2.01        In the latter half of 1978, the Government of Kenya and KRC
requested Bank assistance for the rehabilitation and modernization of KRC
following the break-up of the East Africa Railway Corporation (EARC) in
1977. An identification mission visited Kenya in March 1979 and a
preparation mission in June 1979. In Septer1Iber 1979, a Bank appraisal
mission analyzed the investment plans of KRC and prepared an appraisal
report based upon the Kenya Government's Five Year Development Plan for the
fiscal years 1979-83 and KRC's investment plan for the same period. Part
of the plan was already under implementation, with assistance from
bilateral aid and suppliers' credits, and the remainder, which principally
covered the last three yoars of the plan period (1981-83), was reviewed in
detail, particularly with respect to the railways'implementation capacity
and the program's financial and economic justification. The original plan
was reduced by some 30% and the Project included investments and studies
intended to improve KRC's operational and transport capacity in tne longer
term. The proposed Project included a training program for staff at all
levels and investments in track, telecommunications, rolling stock,
iaaintenance facilities, marine services, staff housing, etc. The Bank
coordinated the Project w:ith cther donors, particularly the African
Development Bank (AfDB) and the Kreditanstalt Fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW),
which provided cofinancing for the Project in parallel with the World Bank
and the Government of Kenya.
2.02        Negotiations were held in Washington in September 1980.  The
main issues brought to light during the appraisal and negotiations were
discussed in detail with the representatives of the Government of Kenya,
KRC, AfDB, and KfW. Agreed minutes recording understandings reached during
the negotiations were signed on September 19, 1980. As a result of the
agreements reached during negotiations, a loan of US$58 million was
approved by the Bank in April 1981. The project files do not contain an
explanation for the rather extended processing time between appraisal in
September 1979 and Board approval in April 1981. The Loan Agreement was
signed on May 7, 1981 and became effective on September 3, 1981.
Project Objectives and Description
2.03        The Project's main objectives were to improve KRC's operations,
financial position and transport capacity. For the short term, the Project
would finance certain investments designed to prevent further deterioration
of the railway and make some progress in terms of the basic objectives.
For further progress toward the main goa.s, the Project would finance a
number of vital studies which were intended to provide detailed
recommendations or plans for fundamental railway improvements over the
longer term.
2.04        The Project covered the 1981-83 portion of KRC's 1979-83
Investment Plan.  The main Project components aimed at the more immediate
needs of KRC were as follows:
(a)   relaying of about 175 km of main and branch line track,
ballasting and improvements to yards and crossings, and
provision of miscellaneoug equipment including
maintenance vehicles, machinery and spare parts;
(b)   construction and provision of equipment for a concrete
sleeper plant at Nairobi, construction of a station and
offices at Mombasa, and a trans-shipment. terminal at
Malaba;           -
(c)   telecommunication equipment for Nairobi and Nakuru and
equipment and construction works for the renewal and



-3-
exransion of the telecomunications network between
Mombasa and Nairobi;
(d)   provision of rolling stock and spare parts including the
purchase of thirty hopper wagons, cranes, two emergency
breakdown cranes and forklifts for cargo handling,
provision of roller bearings for wagons and provision of
spare parts and materials for the rehabilLtation of
locomotives and wagons;
(e)   workshop machinery and related equipment for the
conversion and improvement of locomotive workshops,
fueling stations and diesel depots, extension of the
diesel depot at Changamwe;
(f)   water transport facilities at Home Bay and Kisumu and
rehabilitation of marine workshops at Kisumu;
(g)   construction and provision of staff quarters for KRC
staff; and
(h)   expansion of training school facilities in Nairobi and
management training programs in Kenya and abroad.
2.05        For the longer term strengthening of KRC, the Project included
studies for the follow ng:
(a)   railways organizational structure;
(b)   organization and facilities of the Nairobi workshop;
(C)   motive power requirements;
(d)   training needs of lower-level and management staff;
(e)   reorganization of the training school;
(f)   alternative transport between Kisumu and Homa Bay;
(g)   rail vs. road transport of specific commodities;
(h)   KRC's materials management system; and
(i)   development of a Corporate Plan and Short-Term Action
Program (STAP) to achieve operating and financial
achievements.
2.06        The Project was expected to be completed by June 30, 1985.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Initial Zmpleuentation and Prolect Revision
3.01        Initial implementation was in &ccordance with appraisal
plans but the start of procurement actions was slow due to KRC delays in
review and approval of tender documents and speoLfications.  In early
1982, it became evident that traffic levels projected during appraisal
could not be achieved. As a result, there was a fall in KRC earnings
and the railway's capacity to finance local costs. Accordingly, KRC
sought ways to reduce investments, particularly those involving
commitments of local funds on the part of KRC or the Government of
Kenya. KRC proposed, and the Bank approved, changes in the Project.
These amounted to the deletion of certain items for which KRC and GOK
were unable to provide local funds. Items eliminated from the Project
were the concrete sleeper plant, the station and offices at Mombasa, and
several of the staff quarters. The works proposed at Malaba were
reduced and civil works in the training school were dropped altogether.
However, the changes in project scope, from US$142.14 million to
US$85.97 million did not affect the amount of the Bank loan which
remained at US$58 million and the Bank loan represented 67% of the
scaled down Project. Another reason for the modification of the Project
was that tho Government of Kenya desired that studies, originally to be
financed from the Bank Loan, should be financed by grants. Following
the Government of Kenya's discussions with ODA, it was decided, and the
Bank approved, that the studies would be- financed by an ODA grant.
Project Execution
3.02        Table I shows completion dates for project items ae compared
with the appraisal dates, and shows that, while some of the planned
investments were not undertaken, the major portion of the Project was
completed by 1986. Some parts of the Project financed by AfDB and KfW
were completed in August 1987. In regard to items financed by the Bank,
the non-completion of the track work was an important shortcoming.
3.03        A summary of implemented components is given below:
(a)   (i)   Track rehabilitation:  The Project originally
included relaying of 175 km of track on the
mainline and branch lines. Although rails were
purchased for the full program (rails were
procured for 268 km), the relaying work was not
done because the flash butt welding machine
procured under IC8 was received in defective
condition, damaged by sea-water while being
transported to Kenya. A controversy with the
suppliers followed, with the result that the
machine was neither repaired nor replaced, and
the track-relaying program remained undone (para
3.07). Nearly $21 million invested in rails,
fitting and welding machinery remained
unutilized. In the absence of an operational
flash butt welding machine, the program of
relaying could have gone ahead with thermic
welding, a technology known to KRC, but it would
seem that serious consideration was not given to
this possibility, at least in part due to the
emergence of a proposal to purchase a mobile
welding machine under the proposed Second
Railways Project; this machine was acquired in
1q90 but has not yet been fully commisioned nor
has a programmed relaying period begun.



-5-
(ii) Civil works: Improvements to yards and
crossings, as well as the work on the bridges
and culverts, was not done because of lack of
local funds. The concrete sleeper plant was
deleted from the program. The development of
the Mombasa station was undertaken on a reduced
scale.
(iii) Plant and machinery, service vehicles and spare
parts, etc: Purchases progressed as planned at
costs lower than the original estimates, and
with some delay. The same applies to the
service vehicles and spare parts, etc. Plant,
machinery, and service vehicles purchased
included track type loaders, a track measuring
car, gang trolleys, tamping and aligning
machines, ballast crushers and line inspection
trolleys, all of which contributed to enhanced
maintenance and inspection facilities for KRC.
In addition, some cars and landrovers were
purchased to ensure timely transport of staff to
field sites.
(b)   Telecommunications:  Telecommunications work was
performed in two phases. Phase I was the provision of
a PABX at Nakuru and Nairobi and was completed on
time. Phase II was the provision of an underground
cable telephone system between Nairobi and Mombasa.
This was more complicated and required more time and
was not implemented satisfactorily. Both works were
funded by KfW. Phase II had a bad start due to the
selection of an ineffective contractor, and the
implementation time was increased from three years to
five and a half years. This part of the Project was
completed in August 1987.
(c)   Rolling stock:  The thirty hopper wagons for
transportation of soda ash were acquired with ODA
funds and were delivered and placed in service in
October 1982. Eleven third-class coaches supplied by
a Swedish firm and financed by the AfDB were placed in
service between May and September 1983. Ten sets of
train lghting equipment were acquired in 1982 and
fitted to brake vans in 1984 as were ten sets of
batteries. Two emergency breakdown cranes were
supplied to Kenya under a Franco-Kenya Protocal and
placed in service in 1983 (cost US$1.7 million) 1/.
Three forklift trucks were acquired under the AfDB
loan in addition to 2,016 sets of roller bearings for
conversion of old wagons from brass to roller bearings
to reduce the incidence of hot boxes. It is pertinent
to point out here that the supplier offered 2,016 sets
of bearings for the amount allocated for 1,200
bearings (150 wagons). There was, however,
considerable delay in fitting these bearings to wagons
and only about 500 bearings were fitted. The delay is
attributed by KRC to the time and resources required
for machining the axles to fit the roller bearings,
This source of financing does not appear in the original financing
of the Project; it appears under "GOK fu.ds" in the subsequent
finarncing plan. The Franco-Kenya Protocol also financed six log-
handling cranes (US$0.6 million) in 1984, and 11 container cranes,
a rough-terrain crane and a breakdown crane at a total cost of
tTeC,A. -  i II4nl Ie

but a more likely reason is a shortage of local funds.
In addition, KRC financed, in 1984, through its own
resources, the conversion of 100 flats to carry
containers and 60 wagons to carry logs.
(d)   (i,   Rehabilitation of Locomotives:  By the end of
June 1985, ten 92 class locomotives, the
generators of which had caused a large number of
failures, were converted from direct current
generators to alternators with rectifiers. This
was financed at a cost of US$1.82 million,
including USS1.40 million from the IBRD Loan
(as against US$6.93 million planned).
(ii)  Spare Parts:  The savings from the IBRD Loan
(based on changes in exchange rates) helped
finance more spare parts than planned and they
were well justified in view of the deteriorating
condition of the locomotives. Reallocation of
funds (from the above source and other
unallocated funds) enabled KRC to purchase
spares worth $18.5 million from IBRD funds, plus
about $2.0 million worth from AfDB funds.
(e)   Workshops and Equipment:  conversion of locomotive
workshops at Nairobi was completed in 1983. This
included the provisiont of various specialized machines
for the .spair of diesel locomotive components, e.g.,
valve seat grinding machines, test otands for
transmission and injectors, pressure cleaning units,
lifting jacks, underfloor wheel lathe, etc. Also
included and implemented was a foundry for melting
scrap and manufacturing spare parts. Though a major
portion of the work was completed by the Loan closing
date, some items funded by AfDB, e.g., a crankshaft
grinding machine, a helical spring coiling machine,
etc., were installed by mid-1987. The other part of
this work was the construction and provision of
equipment for the diesel fueling stations at Sagana,
Voi, Kajiado and Kisumu. Of these, the facility at
Sagana was constructed and commissioned in 1984. The
Voi fuelling station was completed and commissioned in
September 1987, whereas the facilities at Kajiado and
Kisumu were designed and have been included in the
Short-Term Action Plan (STAP) for financing under the
Second Railways Project. t.s for the extension of the
diesel depot at Changamwe, civil works on the diesel
storage facilities and the installation of the tanks
were completed in 1987; the work on the heavy-lift
shop is included in the STAP under the Second Railways
Project.
(f)   Water Transport:  Items included in the construction
and provision of facilities at Homa Bay, the
rehabilitation of docks and piers between Homa Bay and
Kisumu, and the rehabilitation and provision of
machinery for the marine workshops were dropped from
the Project, largely due to lack of local funds, and
partly because of limited priority after a feasibility
study for the Homa Bay facilities showed them to be
uneconomic.
(g)   Staff Quarters:  The scope and extent of the
construction of staff quarters were reduced



considerably due to the high requirement of local
costs; only 72 flats (apartments) were constructed, 32
at Muthurwa and 40 at Changamwe, against a total of
295 foreseen at appraisal.
(h)   Training:  Expansion of the training school facilities
and creation of a section for management training was
dropped, again due to the shortage of local funds.
The training of staff and supervisors, both in Kenya
and abroad, was substantially implemented with the
help of ODA-financed trainers and the assignment of
KRC staff and officials to U.K. and, to a limited
extent, to India. Expansion of the training school
and the organization of management training (including
provision of a head of the Management Training Center)
have been included in the Second Railways Project.
(i)   Studies and Technical Assistance:  It was agreed
during appraisal that the various consultants for the
studies (to be financed from IBRD funds) would be
employed not later than December 1981. However, when
the implementation of the Project started, the
Government of Kenya insisted on using grant funds
rather than loan funds for the studies. Therefore,
with the approval of the Bank, various studies were
undertaken, using a grant from ODA. ODA carried out
the following studiee:
-     Headquarters and Organization
-     Central Workshops
-     Motive Power
-     Training
-     Supplies Study and Implementation
-     Corporate Plan
-     Short-Term Action Plan Coordination
The above studies led to the formulation of the Short-
Term Action Plan and the Railway Corporate Plan, which
formed the basis for the Second Railways Project.
This exercise was extended through 1986 and a part of
1987. Notwithstanding the delay in the implementation
of the studies and a certain amount of unevenness in
the quality, the consultants carried out the work
rather competently.
Prolect Cost
3.04        The appraisal estimate of the total Project cost was
US$142.14 million, inclusive of price and physical contingencies.  The
actual cost of the Project was only US$85.97 million, 60% of the
appraisal cost. In comparing actual and appraisal costs it should be
kept in mind that a number of Project components were dropped.
3.05        A breakdown of actual and estimated costs in US dollars is
given in Table 2. Table 2 (a) gives the estimated and actual cost in
Kenya Shillings. As the summary below indicates, some items were
completed at lower cost than foreseen. and certain items, particularly
locomotive spare parts, at much higher cost than the ap<-aisal
estimates, due to increases in quantities.

Significant details relating to estimated and actual costs are given below:
(a)  The main reason for the cost underrun was the reduction in
scope of the Project as detailed in paras. 3.01 to 3.03.
(b)  There was a major shortfall of local funds.  Against the
appraisal estimate of US$53.2 million equivalent of local
costs, including contingencies, the Shilling equivalent of
only US$8.1 million was spent, major shortages being in
track works but also in telecommunications, water
transport, staff quarters, and training.
(c)  The level of foreign exchange expenditure remained more or
less as estimated, being US$77.87 million as against an
estimated US$76.16 million without contingencies and
US$88.3 million with contingencies.
Procurement and Disbursements
3.06      Procurement of Bank-financed items proceeded along the lines of
the list of goods foreseen at the time of appraisal, modified by amendments
in 1984 (see para 3.03). Details of estimated versus actual disbursements
are given in Table 3. Although the actual rate of disbursements was lower
than planned, 74 percent of the disbursements were completed by the Loan
closing date of December 31, 1985, and 84 percent was disbursed by June
1986, the final deadline for disbursements. -
3.07      Procurement of the flash butt welding machine and the rails and
fittings for the track-relaying work had an adverse impact on the Project
as nearly USS21 million worth of rails and fittings purchased for the track
relaying work remained largely un-installed because the machine (costing
US$1.7 million) was received by KRC-in damaged condition. Although a
Performance Bond was given by the supplier and conditions of contract
between KRC and the supplier provided for 15% payment within 45 days of
signing of the contract, and the 85% balance payable on shipment, the



-9-
payable on shipment, the contract was for "supply, delivery, erection,
commissioning and handing over to Kenya Railways". Generally, this type of
problem resulting from improper shipping is relatively rare on contracts
for major items of machinery. In retrospect it appears that:
(i) the contract had inadequate safeguards regarding payments
or penalties to be recovered from the supplier in the event
of malfunctioning of the equipment;
(ii) KRC did not act expeditiously in identifying the problem
and in seeking redress from the supplier/shippers/insurance
company;
(iii) alternative arrangements were not made for the timely
completion of track-relaying works by application of
technology known to KRC (para. 3.03 (a)).

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATXIONS
Frgight Traffic
4.01        At appraisal, rail freight ton-kilometers were estimated to
rise from 2.0 billion in 1979 to 2.8 billion in 1984. Actual traffic
was about 2.0 billion ton-kilometers in 1984 and fell to 1.9 billion in
1985.
4.02        Details of KRC's freight traffic are given in Table 4.  In
1971, KRC carried 4.2 million tons of freight, equivalent to 3.0 billion
net ton-kilometers, with an average haul of 710 km. Of the total
tonnage, 2.9 million tons was Kenya's internal traffic and 1.3 million
tons was Uganda traffic. In 1979, after the break-up of EARC, KRC
carried 3.8 million tons or 2 billion net ton-kilometers, the average
haul being reduced to 530 km because of the fall in Uganda traffic to
0.15 million tons. Kenyas domestic tonnage had, however, risen by 0.75
million to 3.65 million tons despite the opening of the Mombasa-Nairobi
oil pipeline which resulted in the loss of over 10% of KRC's freight
traffic.
4.03        In the five-year period 1980-84, the peak annual traffic of
2.3 billion net ton-kilometers was reached in 1981 -- or 4.3 million
tons with an average haul of 531 km. Uganda's share of traffic remained
at only 4% of the total haul, the same level as in 1979. Sixty-three
percent of total KRC traffic was accounted for by six commodities --
petroleum products, cement, grain, fertilizer, soda products, and sugar.
Of the total, 31% comprised general goods, a group of 30 major
commoditie.d such as iron and steel, paper, hides and skins,
limestone/lime. salt, fluorspar, bitumen, and coffee; the balance,
broadly classified as "other goods" represented a multitude of
miscellaneous commodities, including containers.
4.04        The decline in traffic to 1.9 billion ton-kilometers in 1985
occurred largely in cement, fertilizer and sugar. Petroleum products,
soda products and other goods remained practically unchanged in tonnage.
General goods receded by about 6%. Circumstances contributing to the
fall in traffic were: competition from road transport, sluggish
economic activity in 1982, the drought in 1983 (which depressed the
agricultural eector), and the continued instability in Uganda which
depressed the transit traffic from Uganda and other landlocked
countries. KRC's operational problems, more specifically the low
availability of main line locomotives and poor control of operations,
were important contributors to the decline in traffic.
4.05        During the Project period, transit flows contributed some
traffic but were not of major importance to KRC; such traffic could,
however, be more important in the future. In 1985, the Uganda, Rwanda
and Burundi transit traffic amounted to only 259,000 tons as compared to
more than 1.3 million tons in 1971. The all-rail route via
Malaba/Tororo was active in 1988, but could not be exploited adequately
because of track maintenance problems in Uganda and motive power
shortage in Kenya. Moreover, turnaround of wagons was sluggish in
Uganda; generally, more Kenyan wagons were held up there than vice-
versa. In early 1986, however, as operations on this route fell off
sharply, owing to aggravation of the Uganda track problems, the Risumu-
Jinja Lake Victoria ferry service was revived. This service was
averaging 15 trips a month in 1987 with one of the three new Ugandan
wagon ferries -- equivalent to about 1.25 trains each way or 500 tons of
freight per day. The revival of this service resulted in the
underutilization of Project-funded expanded rail facilities at Malaba
but also increased potential transit traffic via KRC's Kisumu line.

Pausgsner Tralfic
4.06        Passenger traffic was projected at appraisal to reach 2.5
billion passenger-kilometers by 1985 but the actual traffic in that year
was only 1.8 billion. Detail. of KRC's passenger traffic are given in
Table 5. Passenger traffic rose from 273 million passenger kilometers
in 1978 to 499 million passenger kilometers in 1979, an increase of 83%.
In this period, however, the number of passenger journeys remained more
or lose constant, indicating an increase in the average journey from 154
to 283 km. This war due mostly to increased travel between the west of
Kenya and Nairobi, a pattern that appears to have continued. A sharp
traffic increase in the two years, 1979-81, to 769 million passenger
kilometers (due to acquisition of new passenger coaches), was followed
by a 38% decrease to 484 million in 1984 (due to sharp increases in
fares), followed by a modest traffic increase of 16% in 1985 to 563
million.
onerations
4.07        Operating statistics of KRC are given in Table 6.  Actual
performance and operational targets laid down during appraisal are shown
in juxtaposition in Table 7. It is evident that operational targets
were not achieved and that operating performance, as measured by traffic
carried and by the utilization and availability indices for motive power
and rolling stock, has steadily fallen. Line locomotive availability
fell from 69% in 1982 to 55% in 1985, shunting locomotive availability
from 79% to 68%, and wagon availability from 88% to 83%. The turnaround
time of general freight wagons deteriorated from 15 days to 17 days,
although turnaround time for tank wagons improved somewhat from 16 days
to 13 days. Both wagon loads and wagon productivity declined. As a
result, staff productivity in terms of traffic units per employee
declined from 125,000 in 1982 to 107,000 in 1985.
4.08        Operationally, the fall in locomotive availability imposed a
severe limitation on KRC's freight-carrying ability. Increases in
telecommunications failures, the inability of KRC to carry out its track
works and poor control of operations greatly increased turnaround time
and resulted in a loss of traffic to road hauliers.
4.09        An important contributor to the efficiency of railway
operations is often a healthy increase in traffic, but in the case of
KRC such growth failed to materialize between 1978 and 1985. Without
traffic growth, KRC was under particular pressure to find other ways to
increase efficiency, by improving operations especially through cost
reductions. While accomplishments in this regard were poor during the
1978-1985 period, the studies financed under the Project provided a
foundation for the restructuring of Kenya Railways attempted under the
Second Railways Project.
4.10        Experience to date during this folow-on Project shows some
basis for optimism that increased efficiency will be achieved. Total
freight tonnage climbed from 3.1 million tons in 1987/88 to 3.53 tons
million in 1989/90. Freight ton-kilometers in 1989/90 reached 2.0
billion, up from the actual 1.85 billion recorded at the end of 1985.
Traffic levels remain lower than projected in the first Railway Project,
however, and lower than traffic "on offer" to KRC. Low locomotive
availability continues to limit KRC'S real carrying capacity and
fundamental operating problems remain. Nonetheless, management is
becoming more serious about tackling these problems and Government more
serious about enabling KRC to do so. Due to two recent tariff increases
and attempts to hold costs down, KRC's working ratio is improving. The
working ratio for Jan. 1991 was 65.1%, a record performance; the seven
month cumulative position for FY91 through January was 72.1%, a
significant improvement over the 82.2% yearly ratio as of June 30, 1990.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PtRFORN-CE AND DEVELOPMENT
5.01        The break-up of the East African Railways Corporation (EARC)
and the problems arising therefrom left KRC considerably weakened
institutionally and organizationally. Attempts at running a regional
railway had failed in a confusion of conflicting interests and
controversy at a time when railways had also been weakened by the
departure of substantial numbers of expatriates. The First Railway
Project therefore included, as a part of the institutional development
program, the carrying out of studies to strengthen the organizational
structure of KRC's headquarters and to develop a corporate plan and
action program by which KRC would gradually move toward more
commercialized operations and financial self-sustainability. Study and
discussions with Government were held to set the stage for improving the
external framework within which KRC operated, including establishing
greater tariff autonomy. The training requirements of KRC's staff and
managers were also highlighted as a problem for review as was the
development of the training school. Locomotive requirements were
assessed as were the organization and facilities of the Nairobi
workshops in the light of KRCs9 future requirements; and certain other
studies were planned to analyze the marine services and uneconomic
branch lines.
5.02        Although the physical implementation of some of the Project
investments was inadequate, particularly with respect to track works,
the implementation of the institutional-development components was more
satisfactory. Studies, conducted by consultants under the auspices of
the ODA (see para. 3.03 (i)), led to subsequent institutional and
regulatory improvements. Among these was the restructuring of KRC's
organization, including the establishment of a Business Development
Department and Accident Investigations Unit, and the establishment of
three high level managerial postsl/ designed to make the managerial
structure less horizontal and prevent every matter involving more than
one department from being brought to the attention of the Managing
Director. Another critical study was the development of a Corporate
Plan and related Short Term Action Program which set operating
performance targets, principles of commercialization, proposed tariff
increases and introduced the concept of Government's providing
compensation where Government's approval of proposed tariff increases
was withheld for reasons of social policy or where Government required
that KRC continue operating uneconomic services. The Corporate Plan,
together with the tenets of commercialization and compensation for
uneconomic rail services became the basis for the Second Railways
Project and were formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding between
Kenya Railways and Government and approved by Cabinet in order to ensure
that the goals of restructuring were supported by the highest levels of
Government. Bank staff inputs into this exercise were considerable,
including reviring the corporate plan, trimming the proposed investment
program and leading discussions with Government on the importance of
agreeing to the Memorandum of Understanding.  A review of KRC's training
facilities resulted in the training of staff and officers within the
railway with the help of expatriates, supplemented by training abroad,
notably in the U.K. and India. A study of the Supplies Department led
to a reorganization of the department and improvement in the methods of
procurement. A study of the workshops and locomotive rehabilitation led
to formulation of plans for the reorganization of maintenance
facilities.

traffic and business development; and (iii) finance and
administration.



- 13 -
5.03        A review of investments and investment strategy led to the
beginnings of a Planning Department in which a nucleus of staff was
trained not only in the analysis of investments but also in the
monitoring of the Bank Project. Establishment of a formal Corporate
Planning Unit within the Business Development Department was undertaken
during the Second Railways Project.
5.04        The institutional strengthening of the railway thus
included: (i) the start of effective reorganization; (ii) the
establishment of more commercial operations and goals, including the
setting of operational targets; and (iii) the development of a more
sound and clearly defined relationship between the railway and the
Government.
5.05        According to a Memorandum of Understanding between KRC and
GOK, signed April 4, 1989 pursuant to covenants agreed in the Second
Railways Project, Government agreed to compensate KRC for losses
incurred as a consequence of Government actions or policy restraints
that interfere with KRCIs freedom to operate commercially.  For example,
Government agreed to comppnsate KR for the operation of non-commercial
services it otherwise wished to cease, for undue delays in approval of
tariff i.acreases and for maintenance of higher than necessary staffing
levels. Government also agreed to give KR freedom to operate
commercially, including the freedom to determine and implement terms,
conditions and p;ices for which it offers its services. After much
delay, a compensation mechanism was agreed and in 1991 Government agreed
to compensate KRC Ksh 277 million for delays in approving tariffs and
for refusing KR's request to cease loss-making commuter services.

The second table shows that KRC did not realize an operating profit in
tho period, except in 1984, although operations generated sufficient
funds to allow the railway to remain in a liquid position after the
payment of annual debt service (except in 1982). The profit in 1984 and
the relatively low deficit in 1983 were the result of tariff increases.
This positive trend did not, however, continue in 1985/86 due to rising
personnel costs and stagnating traffic. As shown above, actual net
revenues for the period 1982-85 were conaiderably lower than forecast
during appraisal. This was due to reduced traffic, inadequate and
untimely tariff increases and higher working expenditures than estimated
during appraisal. These factors are dealt with in greater detail in the
following paragraphs. On the whole, the actual working ratios of 76 to
95% were higher than the targets in the appraisal, 70 to 72%.
!0ieht Traffic Decline
6.02      As indicated in para. 4.01, the appraisal estimates for KRC
freight traffic did not materialize, for reasons already presented. The
decline in traffic and the shortfall compared with projections are seen
in the following data:
Freiaht Traffic (Kenya)
(Torn-km miltion)
1980      1981            1982       1983           1984       1985

This significant decline in traffic was a major factor causing low
revenuee and adverse income results for KRC.
inadeauate Tariff Increases
6.03      One of the assumptions of the financial forecasts for KRC was
that tariff adjustments would be made promptly to offset any cost
increases stemming from inflation. Unfortunately, Government
authorization to increase tariffs was inadequate and slow. As shown in
Table 11, there was no tariff increase in 1982, delayed increases in
1983 and 1986, and insufficient increaees in 1985 and 1986. The tariff
increases between 1980 and 1.986 for the commodities hauled by KRC are
listed below:
General goods        126%      Soda ash:  bagged         29%
Cement               176%                 bulk           80%
Containers           126%      Fluorspar                 85%
Livestock             69%      Oil traffic              125%
Maize and wheat      173%      Passengers: lot claus    98%
Tea                  126%                  2nd class    98%
Coffee               174%                  3rd class    85%
Parcels, luggage          53%
For several important commodities, substantial tariff increases were put
into effect but the long delays in introducing them meant that cost
increases were often not offset by tariff increases for long periods of
time. Furthermore, passenger fare increases were inadequate, and
generally le  than sufficient to offset inflation.  Bank correspondence
indicates that, although tariff increases were a constant source of
concern to the Bank and although the subject was reviewed by Bank
missions on a number of occasions, major action to press KRC/GOK to
raise tariffs as needed, such as suspension of disbursements, was not
taken by the Bank. Instead, the Bank pressed for Government to give
Kenya Railways greater tariff autonomy, a concept subsequently



- 16 -
incorporated into the Memorandum of Understanding which became the basis
for the Second Railways Project.
Incrgases in Railway Labor Costs
6.04      A significant cause of the poor income of KRC in the 1979-
1985's period was the increase in labor costs. One of the reasons for
the increase was the substantial rise in wage rates during the period:
1982             3.43%
1983             7.22%
1984            12.83%
1985            18.00%
Since the consumer price index rose only 13d between 1980 and 1986,
these wage rate increases were greater than necessary to offset
inflation. Another cause of high labor costs was the 10% increase in
the size of the labor force from about 21,000 to 23,066 between 1980 to
1985, a period in which freight traffic declined 11%.
Cash Flow
6.05      The cash flow for the period is given in Table 9, together
with the appraisal projections. During appraisal, it was estimated that
in 1981-83 annual cash flow would be negative due to the heavy
investments in fixed assets but, beyond that date, positive cash flows
would be generated. The cash flow for 1981 was positive due to a
decrease in funds required for the investment program, resulting from
the delay in Loan effectiveness and slow start-up of the Project. The
actual cash flow during the period 1982-1985/86 was negative, although
it was projected to be positive. This negative result was caused by
higher long term debt than had been projected for these years. The
contribution of KRC to the investment plan was only a small fraction of
the amount anticipated at appraisal.
Balance Shaets
6.06      As anticipated during appraisal, KRC remained liquid,
measured by the current ratio (1982=2.1, 1983=4.0, 1984=6.3 and 6.8 in
1985/86) throughout the Project period. The trend toward a high current
ratio reflects a growing inventory of spare parts.
6.07      In 1983, the Government waived an outstanding loan it had
made to KRC amounting to KSh 533 million. This amount was transferred
from long-term debt to equity by way of a credit to the accumulated
deficit account. Accrued interest for 1981 and 1982 that had been
included in accounts payable, was reversed and treated as a reduction of
the deficit account. These adjustments had the effect of: (1) changing
the debt/-quity ratio from 54/46 in 1982 to 22/78 in 1983, and (2)
changing the current ratio from 2.1 to 4.0. The auditors, however, did
not agree with the way KRC converted the loan and interest to equity
contributions. According to the auditors, the correct treatment in the
Balance Sheet as at December 31, 1983 should have been to add the 1982
deficit of KSh 25,003,186 to the accumulated_deficit of KSh 538,817,800;
the KSh 533 million loan and KSh 176 million loan interest and
redemption charges should have been reflected in the Balance Sheet as an
addition to the Kenya Government equity contribution under subventions
and equity.

6.09           The railway lost several competent, well qualified accounting
staff as a result of the break-up of the East African Railways
Corporation and the availability of employment opportunities in the
private soctor. To overcome this loss, KRC trained under the Project,
(to a CPA III level) the Chief Accountant, the Financial Accountant, the
Traffic Accountant, the Senior Expenditure Accountant and the Revenue
Accountant. In addition, three assistant accountants and ten graduate
accountants were trained.

Traffic Coustip
6.10      Since the cost bases underlying the 1979 tariff structure
were out of date (established in 1969), the Bank financed the services
of a consultant to study and design a cost-based tariff system. The
system was completed in October 1981 and thereafter KRC requested tariff
revisions based on the cost data prepared under the new costing system.
Mediation Aersement
6.11      In 1984, the former partner states of the East African
Community signed an agreement on the division of assets and liabilities
of the East African Railways Corporation. KRC executed the Mediation
Agreement during 1984 and the assets and liabilitiea balance for 1984
was adjusted at the agreed mediation ratio of 42%. The adjustment was
based on the available balances as at December 31, 1977.

VII. ECONOMIC R-3VALUATION
7.01        The main objective of the Project, as noted earlier, was to
improve KRC'o operations, financial position and transport capacity
(para. 2.03). Efforts were to be made to increase the efficiency and
reliability of KRC's services and to help expand the use of rail
transport at less cost to the Kenyan economy. Based on performance of
KRC to date, the principal objectives of the Project were not achieved.
The economic returns of individual project components
(telecommunications, spare parts and workshop improvements, hopper
wagons, depot improvements and improved marine serviceo) are considered
below.
7.02        In the SAR, the principal economic benefits from the Project
were measured by the difference between the cost of rail transport and
the higher cost of road transport, the assumption being that without the
railway project, traffic would be diverted from the railway to road
transport. About 87% of overall SAR benefits were thus derived, and the
overall economic rate of return was 21%. The same methodology has been
used for re-evaluation, except that no maintenance cost savings have
been included since track relaying works were not completed.
7.03        Savings per ton-km of freight moved by rail over road
transport increased from KSh 0.21 per ton-km in the March 1981 SAR (in
1980 prices) to KSh 0.38 per ton-km (in 1986 prices). This is slightly
less than the increase in Kenyan consumer prices over the same period.
The figure for 1986 is based on current road transport cost for semi-
trailer trucks and the KRC Corporate Plan estimate for rail cost per
ton-km. As indicated in Chapter III (Implementation and Costs),
investment costs under the Project in terms of US dollars were lower
than expected. The shortcomings of the Project are therefore primarily
due to traffic not developing as foreseen and the fact that the track
relaying works were not completed.
7.04        Project componente implemented include the supply of spare
parts and the workshop improvements. The combined effect of these was
higher availability of locomotives. For the Project period 1982-85, the
average main line locomotive availability was about 59.5%, which is
lower than the target of 75% for 1983 but higher than the 55% expected
without the Project. For shunting locomotives the actual 1982-85
average was 72.2%, compared to a 1983 target of 75%. Wagon availability
for 1983-85 of 87% was near the target of 90% for 1983. With the
primary limiting factor on operations being main line locomotives, an
availability increase from 55% to S9.5% translates into transfer of
traffic from road to rail of about 163 million ton-km or a cost
reduction of some KSh 62 million per year. This represents a return for
this Project component of about 10%, considering all spares procured as
a cost. This is a conservative estimate since a relatively large part
of the spares are not only for locomotive rehabilitation, but also for
regular maintenance. An example of the effect of locomotive
rehabilitation on operations is the improved availability of class 92
main line locomotives, from 33.2% before rehabilitation in 1982-83 to
56.7% in 1984-85.
7.05        Another important Project component was the improved
telecommunications link between Mombasa and Nairobi, representing 11% of
Project cost. The lack of reliable communications on this most heavily
trafficked line, was a major cause of train delays, particularly for
freight trains. In a 1984 survey of 1,056 trains there was an average
time delay of over 4 hours. The main reasone for this were track
crossing, delayed yard acceptance (which Improved communications can
reduce), locomotive failures and brake failures. Communication failures
on the Mombasa-Nairobi line increased from about 28 per month at the



- 20 -
1979 appraisal to about 32 in 1986. (The performance reflected the slow
installation of the new telecommunications link between Mombasa and
Nairobi.   Financed by KFW, the component was not finished until 1987).
With reduced running time for freight trains from 22 to 20 hours from
Mombasa to Nairobi as a result of improved telecommunications (18 hours
in the timetable), locomotive utilization has improved. Average daily
hours for locomotives mainly used for this service (class 92 and 93) in
1985 were 18.7 hours per available locomotive. Translating this into
traffic gain for the railway shows an economic rate of return of 14%.
7.06        Procurement of hopper wagons for soda ash transport was
reevaluated. Unfortunately, soda ash traffic has not developed as
foreseen and therefore no positive economic returns ware found. On the
contrary, wagon turnaround time increased, indicating a decline in
efficiency of wagon utilization. This component has not been justified,
nor has much of the passenger rolling stock procured with AfDB financing
been justified because the traffic has not developed.
7.07        As to the major Project component of track relaying, since
very little work was done, for reasons already discussed (para. 3.03),
this component was essentially not implemented. Failure to implement it
contributed to increased wagon turnaround time.. Because traffic
increases did not materialize, and since a major part of the sections to
be rehabilitated were on the main line to Malaba and Uganda, which has
carried much less traffic than expected, the adverse effect of not
carrying out the relaying works was somewhat mitigated. The retention
of the rail in stock has therefore opened up the possibility of
utilizing at least some of the rails already purchased for upgrading the
Kisumu line under the Second Railways Project. This will be reviewed
after completing a survey of overall civil works needs during the
implementation of the Second Railways Project.
7.08        Taken together, Project components representing about 44% of
total project cost have an overall economic rate of return estimated at
11% (see Table 12). Project components, mainly rolling stock,
representing about 14% of project cost, although not justified on the
basis of current levels of traffic, can provide an improved capacity for
growth once other KRC constraints are removed. Project components
representing 36% of total project cost (major track work) could at some
future time yield economic benefits. Other components, such as
technical assistance and staff housing (about 6% of project cost), were
satisfactorily carried out, but it is not possible to evaluate their
impact directly. A comparison of the economic rate of return at
appraisal and on reevaluation is as follows:

VI1I. ROLt OF THE BAK
Project Justification and Obiectives
8.01        After the break-up of the EARC, the Bank considered it
essential to continue its involvement with tRC to improve its
operational and financial performance. The Bank strategy to achieve
this objective was based, in part, on the Government of Kenya's five-
year investment plan for the year. 1979-83, of which the First Retlway
Project would cover the period 1981-83. In analyzing this investment
plan, the Bank's advice on the priorities and problems was helpful to
KRC. The Bank's strategy for the Project, comprising a series of
investments and basic studies related to a target oriented plan of
action, appears to have been well-founded.
Proiect Content and Scheduling
8.02        During Project implementation, changes in the Project became
necessary, largely as a result of the fall in KRC1s traffic and the
reduction of its earnings. Substantial cuts in the Government's
appropriations to the railway, particularly in regard to local costs and
the failure to allow timely tariff increases, resulted in the reduction
and cancellation of some of the investment items. The reduced funds
from Government were the subject of considerable deliberation and
discussions between KRC and the Bank and, although these discussions
helped to minimize the ill-effects of the reductions in investments,
they could not eliminate the dislocation of the rehabilitation program.
8.03        KRC'e failure to meet the covenanted 70% working ratio was a
cause of serious concern to the Bank. R.easons for the shortfall are
analyzed in paras. e.C1 to 6.04 and were discussed in detail both with
the management of KRC and the Government of Kenya. As a result, the
Bank concluded that, in the light of KRC's difficulty in adapting to its
changing market environment, major structural changes were necessary in
KRC and the basic relationship between KRC and the Government needed to
be redefined. This led to the development of the Second Railways
Project, which, instead of being a traditional investment project,
focuses on KRC achievement of certain operational targets coupled with
the development of marketing capability, together with the Government
taking responsibilities for such actions as paying for failure to
approve tariff increases in a timely manner, granting subsidies for
uneconomic lines, etc. This program was approved by the Kenya
Government in May 1987 and forms the basis for the Second Railways
Project, which was approved by the Board in June 1987.
8.04        The Bank's involvement was helpful in strengthening KRC's
system for planning, developing and evaluating investments. Perhaps the
most significant achievement of the Project, with the particular
assistance of ODA, was the development of the Short-Term Action Program
and the Corporate Plan of KRC, which have formed the basis for the
follow-on Project.

IS. CONCIQSONM
9.01        The Project under review was the first lending operation to
KRC and an such represented the first attempt to improve the operational
and financial condition of the raLlway. In the short term, the impact
of the Project was not particularly succeazful am traffic declined and
operational and financial performance generally deteriorated. It may
well be, however, that without the Project, the performance of the
railway would have been much worse. Although the physical
implementation of some of the project components was inadequate, the
important studies undertaken during the Project are fundamental to the
long term future of the railway. One of the conclusions of these
studies is that the comparative advantage of the railways cannot be
fully exploited unless the external framework of KRC significantly
improves and the railway itself becomes more commercially oriented.
9.02        This conclusion led to the formulation of the Second
Railways Project in which a KRC/Government Memorandum of Understanding
approved by Cabinet defines actions the Government will take in regard
to tariff increases, compensations, etc., and sets specific operating
targets to be achieved by KRC. The greater commercial orientation of
KRC is to be attained by a more efficient organization to manage
marketing; a Business Development Department was created to seek new
business and reshape KRC's operations in accordance with market demand.
9.03        With regard to tariff increases, it appears that the Bank,
which expressed much concern over the lack of timely tariff increases,
could have taken stronger measures, such as suspension of disbursemn6nts,
in pressing the Government to take necessary actions.
9.04        Perhaps the principal conclusion from the experience with
the First Railway Project is that too much was expected from the Project
investments in equipment, facilities and spare parts. Given the
pervasive problems of KRC, the weaknesses and limitations in nearly
every aspect of the organization, it was probably to be expected that
the Project investments would be little more than a band aid for a
patient in a severely battered and weakened condition. More promising
was that the results of the several studies financed by the Project
formed the basis for a Second Railways Project during which attempts are
being made to tackle the overall problems of KRC in a more fundamental
way. To date some progress has been achieved but long term success in
this venture will depend heavily on a serious intent of the KRC and the
Government to deal forcefully and constructively with some of the tough
questions such as: tariff autonomy; financial self-sustainability and
the need for cost cutting measures, including staff reductions,
compensation for uneconomic services, aggressive marketing, attention to
the services of customers and the like. To this end it is significant
that after compensating KRC for delays in tariff setting, Government has
now agreed to improve KR's tariff autonomy. KRC has also proposed to
reduce staff in the near term.
