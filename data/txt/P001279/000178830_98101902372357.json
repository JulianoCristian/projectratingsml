the last three years\n            of KR's 1979-83 investment plan and includes essential\n            track rehabilitation, equipment, and operational\n            improvements to increase KR's effective capacity to\n            meet traffic demands. The Project finances: (a) relaying of\n            103 km of main line track and improving 73 km of branch line\n            track; ballasting and formation works; improving yards,\n            crossing stations, and buildings; a transshipment depot at\n            Malaba; and provision of machinery, vehicles and spare parts\n            for track maintenance; (b) improving the telecommunications\n            system; (c) purchasing hopper wagons and provision of spare\n            parts for locomotives and wagons; (d) improving maintenance\n            facilities; (e) improving marine services; (f) staff\n            housing; and (g) extension of the training school, overseas\n            training, studies to improve utilization of KR's\n            facilities; and technical assistance at the middle\n            management level. The main sources of risk affecting the\n            Project include lower than projected growth rates for both\n            domestic and external traffic, and slower improvements in\n            KR's operational efficiency."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
