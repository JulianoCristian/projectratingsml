7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The revised project development objective of the PHP is to support the integration of Internally Displaced
Persons (IDPs) in Puttalam by providing housing, drinking water, and sanitation facilities to both IDPs and
a limited number of select non-IDPs in host communities, and rehabilitate selected internal roads in the
IDP Welfare centers. The PHP would support the construction of about 4,350 new houses to replace the
temporary thatched huts, as well as the completion of approximately 2,232 partly-completed houses in the
refugee camps and about 600 temporary houses in the host communities for non-IDPs in Puttalarn. These
interventions would help upgrade habitat and contribute to the socio-economic integration of IDPs and
non-IDPs.
