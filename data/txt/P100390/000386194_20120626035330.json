satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was satisfactory; and the\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: implementation arrangements. The\n            implementation arrangements with a field-based project unit\n            in Puttalam helped to address the needs of the Internally\n            Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Puttalam in a timely manner.\n            However, the project demonstrated that effective\n            implementation through this model requires a well\n            capacitated project unit coupled with effective coordination\n            at the center. Planning for integrated investments, housing,\n            water, sanitation, and roads relate closely to each other\n            and thus, any interventions that provide these services in a\n            package require integrated planning covering technical\n            design aspects, staffing, and sequencing of implementation.\n            Owner-driven construction, this ICR recognizes the\n            challenges that were faced by the home-owners in undertaking\n            housing construction as per schedule, but the experience\n            seemed to have been appreciated by the owners. The provision\n            of cash grants ensured beneficiary participation in the\n            construction of their houses, facilitated choice in design\n            and use of construction materials, and reduced the cost of\n            construction. Technical officers supervised construction\n            while a technical audit independently monitored compliance\n            with engineering standards. Job training program/skills\n            development is one of the important activities of the PHP\n            was to create required construction skills among the\n            Puttalam IDPs. The skills training program was designed to\n            meet the demand for skilled and semi-skilled masons and\n            carpenters in project areas. Community involvement in water\n            supply investments is one of the institutional mechanisms\n            for social integration that worked well under the project\n            was the formation of Community Based Organization (CBOs) for\n            managing water supply schemes."}, "docdt": "2012-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
