                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The revised project development objective of the PHP is to support the integration of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Puttalam by providing housing,
                         drinking water, and sanitation facilities to both IDPs and a limited number of select non-IDPs in host communities, and rehabilitate selected internal roads in the
                         IDP Welfare centers. The PHP would support the construction of about 4,350 new houses to replace the temporary thatched huts, as well as the completion of
                         approximately 2,232 partly-completed houses in the refugee camps and about 600 temporary houses in the host communities for non-IDPs in Puttalarn. These
                         interventions would help upgrade habitat and contribute to the socio-economic integration of IDPs and non-IDPs.

                         12, 2011, the credit closing date was extended for 6 months from June 30 to December 30, 2011. Disbursement is US$ 23.1 million (68.5% of IDA allocation) as of November 15,
                         2011. Based on the assessment of the Project Unit, upon closing date of the credit, there will be about Rs. 149 million (approximately US$1.5 million) in commitment for ongoing
                         activities on housing, water supply programs, and road rehabilitation that will not be completed. With credit closing on schedule on December 30, 2011, this commitment will have to
                         be paid from the Government own budget in order for the outstanding activities to be completed and project development objectives to be met. The Government of Sri Lanka

                         confirmed that they will allocate budget to meet this commitment and the Parliament passed the Rs. 191 million budget allocation to fund the PHP ongoing road and water contracts
                         and housing and sanitation activities.

                         A total of 5,600 new houses were targeted under the project and 5,253 were completed. The balance 347 houses will not be completed (due to various social and technical reasons)
                         by December 2011 for which an estimated Rs. 38 million remain as commitment after closing date. There were 12 water supply (WS) schemes targeted under the project, of which
                         construction of 4 schemes was not feasible due to unavailability of good water resources. 3 WS schemes were completed and water is distributed to over 2,035 families through
                         metered house connections. 5 WS schemes are still under construction. The remaining work to complete these WS schemes will be funded by the GOSL to ensure that the
                         beneficiaries receive full benefit of the project.
                         A total of 1,621 sanitation units provided to the communities and the construction is expected to be 100% completed by project closing. There are currently 11 road packages under
                         implementation for the rehabilitation and improvement of about 157 km of internal roads in the refugee camps. It is expected that only 4 will be completed by the project closing and
                         works for the 7 remaining contracts go beyond the closing date. The balance fund will be provided by the Government.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Puttalam Housing Project credit is closing on December 30, 2011. Based on the assessment of the Project Unit, upon closing date of the credit, there will be about Rs. 149 million
                         (approximately US$1.5 million) in commitment for ongoing activities on housing, water supply programs, and road rehabilitation. With project closing on schedule on December 30,
                         2011, this commitment will have to be paid from the Government own budget in order for the outstanding activities to be completed and project development objectives to be met.
