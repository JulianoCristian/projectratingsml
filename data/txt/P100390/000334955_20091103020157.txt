     Puttalam by providing housing, drinking water, and sanitation facilities to both IDPs and a limited
     number of select non-IDPs in host communities, and rehabilitate selected internal roads in the IDP
     Welfare centers. The PHP would support the construction of about 4,350 new houses to replace the
     temporary thatched huts, as well as the completion of approximately 2,232 partly-completed houses
     in the refugee camps and about 600 temporary houses in the host communities for non-IDPs in
     Puttalarn. I These interventions would help upgrade habitat and contribute to the socio-economic
     integration ofIDPs and non-IDPs.

 exchange rate fluctuations the exact number of houses by project closing is difficult to predict.

A.      Introductory Statement

I. This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to introduce the
following changes in the Sri Lanka Puttalam Housing Project, IDA Credit 4261-CE;
Project ID - PI00390.

2.      The proposed changes are as follows:

     ·  The provision of housing will be expanded from the originally planned permanent
        housing to selected IDPs in the refugee camps to a limited number of poorest non
        IDP households in adjacent communities across four divisions in Puttalam
        district. This change is intended to facilitate improvement of social cohesion
        within communities served under the project by addressing the housing needs of a
        group of the poorest non-IDP households. This will promote the integration of the
        IDPs into host communities.

     ·  The basis for selection of IDP beneficiaries for a housing cash grant will be
        expanded beyond the list of original eligible beneficiaries identified by the
        UNHCR 2006 Survey. After the project approval, the Government pointed out
        that the UNHCR 2006 Survey had omitted those IDP households who in fact had
        a temporary house but were classified as those without a temporary house and,
        therefore, had been omitted from the list. The Government found, through
        surveys and an Independent Housing Damage Assessment (IHDA), that a number
        of deserving families met the selection criteria and that the proportion of the
        temporary houses and semi-built houses is slightly different from that surveyed by
        the UNHCR 2006 Survey. The Ministry of Resettlement (implementing agency
        for the project) requested IDA to consider these beneficiaries under the project
        and to accept the Ministry's survey as a complementary tool to the UNHCR 2006
        Survey for verification of beneficiaries eligible for housing grant.

B.      Background and Reasons for Restructuring

3. The project was approved on February 20, 2007 and became effective on August 22,
2007. The project's original development objective was to provide housing to the IDPs
only and extended the provision of water and sanitation to non-IDP communities. The
project is currently meeting its original objectives. After the project was approved by the
Board, and at the time of Sri Lanka's Cabinet approval of this project, some Ministers
representing Puttalam District expressed concerns that the project did not cover the host
communities and benefit the non-IDPs who may be equally poor on the housing
component. In the context where the rDPs use local schools and health centers and have
entered a common local labor market, there is a need to address potential social tensions
arising between IDPs and non-IDPs. The amendment to the project is attempting to
partly address this problem by allowing a group of poorest non-IDPs to benefit from
housing grants as well, the same way they benefit from water and sanitation facilities
under this project.



                                            2
4. The Government of Sri Lanka proposed to use US$ 1.84 million allocation for
physical contingencies under this project to provide housing to a limited number of the
poorest non-IDP households in four divisions of Puttalam using rigorous selection
criteria. The IDA agreed to this proposaL The past two supervision missions discussed
the selection criteria for the non-IDPs. The 2008 Housing Census revealed a 77 percent
increase in non-IDP temporary thatched houses in the four divisions since 2001 with
huge variations across Grama Niladari (GN) sub-divisions. The government would
apportion the houses intended for non-IDPs across the four divisions based on the IDP
population density in each division. The rationale for this method is to reduce possible
tensions triggered by the IDP presence in these four GN divisions. It would further
apportion the divisional caseload across GN sub-divisions on the same premise i.e. IDP
population. Once the allocation is completed, the project unit would rank potential non
IDP beneficiaries on established poverty criteria Le. women-headed households, number
of dependents, number of disabled and number employed. Valid documentation of land
title and non-possession of a house elsewhere would be a precondition for the cash grant.

5. The second change to the project relates to the beneficiary selection in the refugee
camps. According to the original project design, a household within a refugee camp
would have to meet certain criteria to be entitled to housing assistance. (i) It must have
title to land. 2 (ii) The head of the household and the majority of household members
must live in the camp (according to UNHCR Survey 2006 and Social Assessment 2006).
(iii) It should not have a permanent house in Puttalam and should not have received
similar housing assistance in its place of origin. (iv) It should have had a temporary or
partly-completed house within a camp as of April 2006 (according to UNHCR Survey).
At the start of project implementation, the UNHCR 2006 Survey which was the basis for
determining beneficiary eligibility under the project was challenged by the Government
for having inadvertently omitted a number of IDP households who in fact had a
temporary house and should have been eligible for housing grant under the project.
Recognizing that these claims may be valid, IDA agreed to consider the proposed
additional beneficiaries subject to confirmation of their eligibility by a 100 percent
beneficiary eligibility audit.

6. To ensure transparency and good governance, the project includes a Grievance
Redressal Mechanism, through which all IDP households would be able to raise their
grievances to the authorities in the instance that an individual household disagrees with
its non inclusion in the list of beneficiaries. They can complain in writing to the
Grievances Redressal Committee headed by the Additional District Secretary, Puttalam.
At the start of the project implementation, given some concerns of the residents of these
refugee camps, the Puttalam Project Unit (PHP) carried out a survey to verify the
eligibility of those who were reportedly omitted from the UNHCR 2006 Survey and who
claimed that they were eligible to receive housing grants. In addition, the PPU carried
out an Independent Housing Damage Assessment (lHDA) to verify the damages of semi
built houses in each camp. The PPU found that the proportion of temporary and semi
built houses is somewhat different from what was reported by the UNHCH 2006 survey

2   It is important to distinguish between possession of land due to commercial purchase or gift and actual
title to the land which indicates explicit legal documentation and proves ownership. This clause is to avoid
the threat of eviction.
                                                     3
and therefore, the beneficiary entitlement for cash grant would be different. Based on
these findings, the Ministry of Resettlement requested the IDA to consider utilization of
these surveys for verification of eligibility of IDP beneficiaries in refugee camps in
addition to the UNHCR 2006 Survey.

7. During Phase I of the housing construction, the IDA was informed that in camps
selected for Phase I, 216 IDPs who were omitted from UNHCR 2006 survey were found
eligible based on the selection criteria mentioned above. IDA agreed for Phase 1 cycle A
to allow Food Stamps to be used as a proxy for proving a potential beneficiary family's
presence in a refugee camp in Puttalam in lieu of inclusion in the UNHCR 2006 Survey.
Subsequently, serious doubts have been raised regarding the validity of Food Stamps as
proof ofresidency.

8. This situation of potential beneficiaries omitted from the IDP list is not particular to
the camps in Phase I and the Government reported that the total number of such cases is
about 1,300 throughout the 141 refugee camps. The IDA agreed to consider these
additional beneficiaries under the project subject to the 100 percent beneficiary eligibility
audit which would be undertaken by the Government. The IDA also agreed to the IHDA
survey result of the verification of type of housing (temporary v.s. semi-built) for the
remaining three phases of project. This would change the proportion of temporary and
semi-built houses. In short, the project, without changing the selection criteria, would
expand the tools of verification of beneficiary eligibility beyond the UNHCH 2006
Survey that was the primary basis for beneficiary selection. The validity of the
beneficiary selection and their eligibility will be further verified by an audit already
started.

9. It should be mentioned that to ensure a uniform and consistent housing policy in
different parts of the country and across IDA-funded projects, it was agreed that the
housing grant for temporary houses be increased from Rs. 250,000 to Rs. 325,000. This
was approved by the Ministry of Resettlement on May 11, 2009 and by the Cabinet of
Ministers on July 8, 2009. Increase in the individual cash grant and the possible change
in number of beneficiaries (depending on eligibility verified by the audit) would have
implication on the fund allocation for housing and the number of beneficiaries for both
IDP and non-IDP communities. IDA will reassess financing needs at the Mid Term
Review after the beneficiary eligibility audit is concluded.

C.     Proposed Changes

10. The project development objective (Part B - paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Project
Appraisal Document) will be modified to read:

The objective of the PHP is to support the integration of IDPs in Puttalam by upgrading
and improving the habitat, water and sanitation facilities of both IDPs and select non
IDPs, and providing eligible IDPs in refugee camps and a limited number of non-IDPs in
the host communities with housing. It would entail a housing support cash grant released
in installments. The PHP would be implemented over four years in four phases. The
Government would require US$ 32.6 million to meet the total housing needs of IDPs in
                                             4

Puttalam inclusive of dependent families i.e., the children of the original IDPs who have
since married. The PHP would provide US$ 17.0 million (of which US$1.84 million is
for the non-IDP housing) to support the construction of about 4,3S0 new houses to
replace the temporary thatched huts and the completion of approximately 2,232 partly
completed houses in the refugee camps and about 600 temporary houses in the host
communities for non-IDPs in Puttalam. This would meet SO% of the total housing needs
of the Puttalam IDPs. Given funding constraints, the PHP, like the IDA-financed North
East Housing Reconstruction Program (NEHRP), would provide housing to original IDP
families and not to their dependents.

 11. The PHP would provide US$ IS.O million for drinking water, sanitation,
environmental mitigation, and internal roads. It would allocate U8$0.S million for
construction of sanitary facilities for both IDPs and non-IDPs and provide drinking water
to 13,S84 IDP families and 3,291 non IDP families. This component would also help
mitigate environmental problems, including those created by poor conditions of roads and
drainage systems. The PHP would provide US$ 78S,000 for technical support and US$
1.34 million for project management. The total cost of the PHP is US$ 34.2 million, of
which IDA would extend US$ 32.0 million. The Government would provide US$ 2.2
million.

Project Components (Part B - Paragraph 11 of PAD) will be modified to read:

12. A household within a refugee camp would have to meet certain criteria to be
entitled to housing assistance. (i) It must have title to land. 3 (ii) The head of the
household and the majority of household members must live in the camp (according to
UNHCR Survey 2006 and Social Assessment 2006) or other documents such as surveys
and audits that would correctly verify these criteria. (iii) It should not have a permanent
house in Puttalam and should not have received similar housing assistance in its place of
origin. (iv) It should have had a temporary or partly-completed house within a camp as of
April 2006 (according to UNHCR Survey) or other documents such as surveys and audits
that would correctly verify these criteria. 4 The non-IDP houses would be apportioned
across the four divisions based on the IDP population density in each division, and
further across GN sub-divisions on the same premise i.e. IDP population. The project
unit would rank potential non-IDP beneficiaries on established poverty criteria i.e.
women-headed households, number of dependents, number of disabled and number
employed. Valid documentation of land title and non-possession of a house elsewhere
would be a precondition for the cash grant.

13. A Revised Schedule of Withdrawal of Proceeds of the Credit appears in
Attachment 1. An amount US$ 0.9 million (SDR 0.6 million equivalents) will be
reallocated from the physical contingencies under water and sanitation to the Housing
Grant Category. Out ofUS$ 17.0 million for this category, a total ofUS$ 1.84 million is
allocated to finance non-IDP housing.



3   See footnote 3. Owning land title also is an eligibility criterion for non-lOPs for housing grant.
4   The rest of this paragraph reads the same as that in the Project Appraisal Document.
                                                        S
 D.      Analysis

 14. The proposed changes and restatement of development objective will not lead to a
 change in environmental rating, nor trigger any safeguard policy. These modifications do
 not contradict existing Bank policies. The proposed changes would ease any possible
 tension between the host communities and IDP communities, correctly identify those
 beneficiaries who are in fact eligible and deserve to receive housing grant and were
 inadvertently omitted from UNHCR 2006 survey, and facilitating             reduction in
 grievances and complaints by the IDPs regarding the selection process.

 15. The proposed changes also change the number of target beneficiaries as described
 above. It was discussed in detail with the Government that the Bank would only finance
 those households who are found eligible under the project by the 100 percent beneficiary
 selection audit.

 E.      Expected Outcomes

 16. The changes introduced in the project objective will not affect the expected
 outcomes of the project, but they would change the key performance indicators to include
 housing for non-IDP households. Part B paragraph 9 of the PAD (bullet 1) will be
 modified to read:

      ·  Number of housing units constructed and occupied (by the IDP and non-IDP
         households) within specified time and allocated budget;

 F.      Benefits and Risks

17. There is a change in the benefits of the project related to housing grant for non-IDP
communities and those IDPs who were inadvertently omitted from UNHCR 2006 Survey
as reported not having owned a temporary house while in fact they did. These changes
are expected to yield a mix of social benefits and risks. The benefit include: (i) expected
drop in the grievances and complaints by the IDPs on the ground of non-inclusion; and
(ii) less resentment from host communities as some of the poorest households now
receive housing, even though it is for limited number of families. However, the risk
elements need to be taken into account as a lower number of IDP households than
targeted originally in the project is likely to receive housing grants due to the increase of
cash grant from Rs. 250,000 to Rs. 325,000. The increase will be covered by the PHP
project. The Government will explore the availability of funding to cover the short fall
arising in the number of houses due to the increase of cash grant.

 18. Another potential risk that has recently emerged, and is not related to the changes
made in the Project, is the possibility of some of the IDP beneficiaries returning to their
original villages in the North, where the conflict is now over. IDA will continue to assess
this fluid situation and discuss the mitigation measures with the Government.
Furthermore, IDA has introduced control measures to ensure that the beneficiaries will not
be eligible for housing under other World Bank assisted projects.
