                     SRI LANKA – PUTTALAM HOUSING PROJECT

                                      Restructuring Paper

1.    The closing date for Sri Lanka – Puttalam Housing Project, IDA Credit 4261-CE, Project
ID number P100390 will be extended from June 30, 2011 until December 30, 2011.

2.      Briefly summary of implementation progress - The Puttalam Housing Project (PHP) of
US$ 32 million IDA and US$ 2 million Government funds supported housing construction and
water and sanitation for IDPs and selected non-IDPs in host communities, and rehabilitation of
internal roads in refugee camps. The PHP was declared effective on August 22, 2007. It had a
slow start due to its multi-sector and complex nature, social and political issues, and low
implementation capacity initially. Therefore, project performance ratings were Moderately
Unsatisfactory for over two years. However, the pace and quality of implementation have
improved considerably in the last 15 months, and disbursement reached US$ 22 million (69%) as
of May 2011. The project performance ratings were upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory and
recorded in the last Implementation Summary Report (ISR).

3.      The housing construction has been implementing satisfactorily with marked improvement
in pace and quality of construction. A total of 4,400 (86% of the target) new houses have been
constructed through an owner-driven approach, and close to 1,100 semi-built houses (50% of
target) have been repaired. As for the infrastructure component, the implementation was slower
than anticipated. However, 3 out of 12 water supply schemes were completed and close to 2,000
water points were provided to beneficiaries. Another 8 water schemes are under construction
with good progress. Sanitation component is also progressing well and about 960 sanitation
units are completed and balance 590 are under implementation. Road rehabilitation work needs
to be synchronized with that of water supply and therefore, only 3 road package is contracted out
and work is under way. Other road packages are ready to be awarded.

4.    Reason for Extension - The proposed extension is necessary to give the project more time to
implement the activities under implementation and achieve the development objectives. The PHP
is a multi-sector and complex project and is being implemented in difficult environment. The
project has already achieved visible and sizable results on the ground. For the remaining
activities under implementation, in particular important infrastructure component (water,
sanitation, roads) and also the balance housing under construction, there is a commitment of
close to US$5 million. The Government of Sri Lanka has formally requested IDA for a closing
date extension of 6 months to December 30, 2011.

5.   This will be the first extension of the project
