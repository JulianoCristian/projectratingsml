This change is intended to facilitate improvement\n            of social cohesion within communities served under the\n            project by addressing the housing needs of a group of the\n            poorest non-IDP households. This will promote the\n            integration of the IDPs into host communities. The basis for\n            selection of IDP beneficiaries for a housing cash grant will\n            be expanded beyond the list of original eligible\n            beneficiaries identified by the United Nations High\n            Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 2006 survey. After the\n            project approval, the Government pointed out that the UNHCR\n            2006 survey had omitted those IDP households who in fact had\n            a temporary house but were classified as those without a\n            temporary house and, therefore, had been omitted from the\n            list. The Government found, through surveys and an\n            Independent Housing Damage Assessment (IHDA), that a number\n            of deserving families met the selection criteria and that\n            the proportion of the temporary houses and semi-built houses\n            is slightly different from that surveyed by the UNHCR 2006\n            survey. The Ministry of Resettlement requested IDA to\n            consider these beneficiaries under the project and to accept\n            the Ministry's survey as a complementary tool to the\n            UNHCR 2006 survey for verification of beneficiaries eligible\n            for housing grant."}, "docdt": "2009-09-10T00:00:00Z"}
