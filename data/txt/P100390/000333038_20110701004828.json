The\n            closing date for the project will be extended from June 30,\n            2011 until December 30, 2011.  The extension is necessary to\n            give the project more time to implement the activities under\n            implementation and achieve the development objectives. The\n            project is a multi-sector and complex project and is being\n            implemented in difficult environment.  The project has\n            already achieved visible and sizable results on the ground.\n            For the remaining activities under implementation, in\n            particular important infrastructure component (water,\n            sanitation, roads) and also the balance housing under\n            construction, there is a commitment of close to US$5\n            million. The Government of Sri Lanka has formally requested\n            IDA for a closing date extension of 6 months to December 30,\n            2011.  This will be the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
