Ratings for the Lifelong Learning\n            and Training Project, and Science for the Knowledge Economy\n            Project, for Chile were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Higher Education, Improving Access Project for Colombia\n            were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons included: student loans may be an\n            effective instrument to curb student dropout rates in higher\n            education and increase learning. An impact evaluation of the\n            project suggests this strongly by comparing drop-out rates\n            of beneficiaries with those of otherwise similar\n            non-beneficiaries. Since beneficiaries were generally poor,\n            the program also improved equity through lowering dropout\n            rates. However, as drop-out rates remain high, addressing\n            student drop-out rates may need other actions, including\n            adequate remedial programs and counseling. A better design\n            may focus more strongly on accreditation of providers, while\n            relying more on providers to identify the demand for skills\n            by firms and the demand for technical education and training\n            by students and workers."}, "docdt": "2012-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
