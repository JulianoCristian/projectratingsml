Through its components, it will\n            improve equity in access to tertiary education a) by\n            investments in student-aid (loans and grants), and, b) by\n            introducing monitoring and evaluation criteria. The support\n            to doctoral programs will improve the quality of\n            post-graduate programs, and encourage youth to pursue\n            advanced degrees. The institutional strengthening component\n            will ensure a labor market monitoring program, to keep\n            abreast of changing demands in labor markets, while\n            institutional capacity will be built to formulate, and\n            implement new policies. In addition, the higher education\n            information management system (SNIES) will be improved, and\n            strengthened to prod quality enhancement. Project management\n            will support administrative, managerial, and financial\n            project activities."}, "docdt": "2002-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
