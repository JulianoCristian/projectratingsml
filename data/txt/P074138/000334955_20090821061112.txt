F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The objective of the Project was to improve the quality and equity of the Borrower's
Tertiary Education system through sub-sector's response to society's needs for high
quality human capital that would enhance Colombia's competitiveness in the global
market. The Project aimed to make the Colombian tertiary education system more
responsive to demand, and promote greater equity and quality in the preparation of
tertiary education graduates.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

In the two decades prior to the beginning of the Project, Colombia had experienced a continued
and progressive development of primary and secondary education, which produced a substantial
increase in the pool of potential candidates for higher education and an increase in demand for
equitable access to the system. At appraisal, Colombia already had a long and rich tradition in
tertiary education in Latin America and a relatively well-diversified tertiary education system
with both public and private provision in university and non-university institutions. Enrollment
for the age group 18-23 was 21 per cent and the system was producing 132,000 graduates
annually.

However, at that time, attaining tertiary education was still only possible for the wealthy and
secondary education served mainly to prepare for tertiary education. In addition, the substantial
improvements in equity and efficiency in basic and secondary education in the 1990s were
creating an inequitable bottleneck at the gate of post-secondary education. The system suffered
from inadequate financing to support equitable access for lower and middle-income students.
Only 6 percent of the students had access to student loans. In addition, the growing potential
demand for higher education had increased competition for entry into the less-expensive public
institutions. Also, most public institutions had started to recover costs from students.

Another sector issue at appraisal was the low relevance of many programs and the limited
enrollment in technical and graduate education. In fact, 82 per cent of the students were enrolled
in programs with a strong theoretical foundation1. In addition, both at the graduate and post-
graduate levels, the Colombian higher education system presented weaknesses in regard to the
teaching of sciences and engineering. The emergence of a global, knowledge-based economy
became a driving force for tertiary education reform, with the goal of increasing overall
relevance and improving technical and technological education to produce a growing pool of
flexible workers who could easily adapt to rapid changes in the labor market and remain life-
long learners. Finally, the higher education sector suffered from a fragmented and
underdeveloped quality assurance system. The number of accredited programs was only 59.
There also seemed to be an overlap in governance functions and the information system was
generating insufficient data to inform optimal choices for policy makers and students.

The sector weaknesses were further compounded by the worst economic recession in the country
in six decades, which culminated in 1999 with an economic retraction of GDP of 4.5 percent.
While there were modest recoveries in 2001 and 2002, the crisis certainly had a negative impact
at all levels of the education system. At the tertiary level, the crisis resulted in a decline in the
number of entrants into tertiary education and, probably, in a decrease in the quality and
relevance of the programs as well.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the Project was to improve the quality and equity of the Borrower's Tertiary
Education system through sub-sector's response to society's needs for high quality human capital
that would enhance Colombia's competitiveness in the global market. The project aimed to make
the Colombian tertiary education system more responsive to demand, and promote greater equity
and quality in the preparation of tertiary education graduates. The Project was expected to
accomplish the following:

        Increase Equity by redesigning and expanding the student loan scheme to enable needy
        but qualified students to attend (i) undergraduate university education of good quality and
        relevance; and (ii) tertiary level technical and short cycle programs of high relevance for
        skill enhancement;

        Improve Quality by establishing competitive grants to (i) improve post-graduate
        programs in Colombia; and (ii) encourage talented young Colombians to pursue
        advanced degrees;

        Support Coherence and Efficiency by (i) enhancing the legal and technical framework;
        (ii) consolidating and organizing the Quality Assurance (QA) system in a manner that
        promoted quality enhancement and institutional commitment; and (iii) building capacity
        for strategic planning and management in the National Education Ministry (MEN) and
        other governing bodies.

   The key performance indicators as included in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) were
   the following:

                                                                    Revision of Higher Education Law (Ley 30)




                                                     2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDOs were not revised during the life of the Project. Neither were the PAD key performance
indicators. During supervision, a wider and varying set of indicators was regularly monitored. In
November 2007, the Government and the Bank agreed to define the set of indicators which would
be monitored until Project end. This final set of indicators included the PDO and implementation
indicators defined in the PAD, as well as other indicators relevant to the Project, and is reflected
in the data sheet section.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project, as foreseen in the PAD, benefited the following individuals and institutions:

         Academically qualified but financially needy students who wanted to attend universities
         or technical/ technological institutions.
         Talented young students who qualified to study at the doctoral level.
         Professors and researchers participating in exchange programs.
         Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) including universities, technical and technological
         institutions and other centers of excellence teaching PhD programs. All these benefited
         from the Project through student aid, equipment upgrading and access to relevant
         information for decision making.
         Education decision makers such as parents, students and policy makers benefiting from
         an increased access to relevant education and labor market information.
         The MEN, the Colombian Institute for Student Credit and Technical Studies Abroad
         (ICETEX), and the Colombian Institute for the Development of Science and
         Technology (COLCIENCIAS), as the three co-implementing agencies that were
         strengthened as a result of the Project.

While the PAD originally included the Colombian Institute for the Development of Higher
Education (ICFES) and the National Accreditation Council (CNA) among the institutions
participating in Project activities, these two institutions did not finally receive Project funds. As a
result of the creation of the Vice Ministry of Higher Education, ICFES' oversight responsibilities
for the higher education sector were soon transferred to the new Vice Ministry. In the case of the
CNA, Government efforts in QA eventually focused on the expansion of a new mandatory
minimum standards accreditation system (Registro Calificado).

1.5 Original Components

The Project had four components with specific loan amounts assigned to each of them:

i.       Component 1: Improve Equity in Access to Tertiary Education (US$252.14 million
         or 88.3 percent of total Project cost). This component consisted of two sub-components:
         (a) investment in student aid for academically qualified students who could not afford
         to pay for tertiary education; and (b) monitoring and evaluation of the student aid
         subcomponent.

ii.      Component 2: Support for Doctoral Programs (US$25.00 million or 8.7 percent of
         total Project cost). This component provided support for existing and new doctoral
         programs. The component provided funds for the following activities: (i) loans to


                                                  3
        students enrolled in graduate programs; (ii) small civil works to enhance facilities at
        eligible Colombian universities, including purchasing state of the art scientific
        equipment; and (iii) academic staff development and stipends for visiting professors
        and researchers.

iii.    Component 3: Institutional Strengthening (US$ 7.09 million or 2.5 percent of total
        Project cost). This component had three sub-components: (i) support to the creation of
        the Labor Market Observatory (LMO), to monitor, analyze and disseminate relevant
        labor market information; (ii) improvement of the institutional capacity to formulate
        and implement policy; and (iii) strengthening of the National Information System for
        Higher Education (SNIES) to provide better system-wide information for stakeholder
        decision-making.
iv.     Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 1.40 million
        or 0.5 percent of total Project cost). This component would finance: (i) the
        establishment of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU); (ii) technical assistance to the co-
        implementing agencies; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation studies.

1.6 Revised Components

Project components were not revised during the life of the Project.

1.7 Other significant changes

While there were no changes to the Project components, adjustments were made to Project
activities to address some of the challenges that arose during implementation.

In relation to Component 1, Improve Equity in Access, the PAD mentioned the
Government's intention to develop two lines of credit. Line A was originally directed to
technical, technological programs, teacher training programs, and post secondary programs in
teacher training schools (Escuelas Normales). This would have represented 60 percent of the
funding for this sub-component. Line B intended to finance university programs and Masters in
education, and it would have represented 40 percent of the sub-component's funding. Each of
the lines was divided into two sub-lines: two of the four sub-lines granted priority to high
performing students from the lowest socioeconomic strata, who received a grant for 25 percent
of the tuition cost and a loan for 75 percent of the tuition cost. The other two sub-lines provided
loan financing exclusively.

Early into implementation, demand for university student financial assistance was much higher
than envisaged and demand for technical and technological studies was lower than anticipated. In
spite of progressive increases in student demand for technical and technological studies during
2003 and 2004, by 2005 still only 16 percent of the beneficiaries came from technical and
technological programs. As a result, in the course of the May 2005 supervision mission, the
original target of directing 60 percent of the student financial assistance to technical and
technological studies was significantly reduced to 25 percent.

In addition, some of the innovative features for student financial assistance considered at Project
design were not finally implemented and student loan terms and conditions experienced
modifications throughout implementation, as is expected in a dynamic industry such as student
lending, to better achieve the PDOs. For instance, the establishment of a guarantee fund for
student loans with the participation of private commercial banks was never piloted as such given



                                                 4
its complexity. Also, the originally-planned income contingent mechanism that set a graduated
repayment schedule at 16 per cent of expected income was not implemented either, as a
mortgage-type repayment schedule was found to be an effective and more practical solution.
However, by the end of 2007, as a result of the preparation of the follow-on operation, ICETEX
proposed to cap the maximum installment size under the student loan to a percentage of a
borrower's income, a step taken in the direction of establishing income-contingent repayment
mechanisms, as initially planned in the PAD.

In relation to Component 2, Support to Doctoral Programs, while mainly supporting the
allocation of forgivable loans for doctoral programs, the Project also supported the acquisition
of state-of-the-art robust equipment, avoiding financing relatively small expenditure items. No
small civil works were financed under this component either, as both COLCIENCIAS and
participating universities found that investments in equipment could potentially have a more
significant and long-term impact.

In relation to Component 3, Institutional Strengthening, some of the activities aimed at
improving the QA system experienced modifications due to the emergence of the Registro
Calificado. As a result, by the end of the Project, most higher education programs were
accredited through the new Registro and the number of programs and HEIs having received the
voluntary high standards accreditation was still low by international standards, although
growing.

The Loan Agreement was amended in December 2004 through a third-order procedure2
following the Government of Colombia's (GOC) recommendation to change the financing
percentages of two cost categories. The changes to the Loan Agreement were the following: (i)
splitting Category 3, Tertiary Education Loans and Grants, into two separate categories: as a
result, the amount under Category 3, allocated for support to undergraduate students, was
reduced from US$183.9 million to US$174.9 million and, also, a new cost category, Category 9,
was established with a maximum amount of US$9 million to support doctoral studies; (ii)
establishing a constant finance percentage for Categories 3 and 9 at 70 and 65 percent
respectively, as the implementing agencies had succeeded in accessing larger counterpart
resources from education institutions; (iii) increasing the percentage to be financed with Loan
resources for Category 5, Operating Costs, from 50 to 70 percent for the first half of the
expenditures under this category and reducing it to 50 percent afterwards; and (iv) considering
ICETEX as one of the institutions to be included in component 3, Institutional Strengthening,
together with the MEN.

In February 2008, there was a reallocation across Loan Categories: (i) from Category 1,
Goods, and Category 8, Unallocated, to Category 2, Consultant Services. This reallocation
reflected the need for greater resources to create and launch the LMO, to improve the SNIES
and to strengthen the MEN; and (ii) from Category 4, Goods, Works, Consultants' services and
Training for Doctoral Programs, to Category 9, Doctoral Loans, due to the different
implementation speed and need for funds within the different activities of component 2.

Actual Project costs were substantially higher than expected. Borrower's contribution turned out
to be US$ 260 million, versus USD 87 million projected in the PAD. Most of the additional
resources financed component 1: the total cost for component 1 was US$ 417 million, rather

than the US$ 252 million originally projected. This increase was partly due to contributions
provided by the HEIs and municipalities.

Finally, the PAD also included detailed institutional arrangements that were subject to evolution
as core institutional roles changed. For instance, Project implementation was overseen by the
National Policy and Monitoring Council and by a Board including MEN, ICETEX,
COLCIENCIAS, ICFES and the National Planning Department (DNP). ICFES was part of the
implementation arrangements during 2002-2004, while it retained a policy definition role for
higher education and received budgetary resources counting as counterpart funds. Once the Vice
Ministry of Higher Education became fully operational, ICFES moved on to concentrate on its
education evaluation role.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

A number of factors influenced Project preparation and design:

Government ownership of the Project. The administration which took office in 2002 provided
leadership and continuity for the work undertaken during the last months of the previous
administration. The new Government had a strong commitment to improving the higher
education sector. Key objectives of its program were to increase access, improve program
quality and strengthen the institutional framework for higher education.

Solid technical preparation undertaken both by the Borrower and the Bank. There was an
existing relationship of work and trust between the GOC and the Bank, developed through
previous work in other regions in Colombia (i.e. Antioquia). A joint policy workshop was
carried out in 2002 in Bogota between the Bank and Colombian institutions including ICFES,
DNP and some universities, to reach consensus on the reforms. Finally, during Project
preparation, the Bank conducted a sector assessment and commissioned policy papers from
experts, which were disseminated by the GOC.

GOC's decision to increase support to ICETEX. Under the administration in office
immediately prior to Project preparation, the possibility of closing down ICETEX had been
considered. At that time, ICETEX had a weak reputation in spite of its long life as the
Colombian institution providing student financial assistance. It was seen as inefficient, lacking
quality technical personnel and having a poor record of loan recovery. The new Government
decided to appoint a new ICETEX President in 2002 who was able to define and implement a
clear vision and an ambitious reform program to be developed with support from the Loan. The
GOC decision to strengthen demand-side mechanisms through ICETEX was also in line with
the general objective of increasing coverage in higher education in an equitable form.

Appropriate risk assessment and mitigation. An adequate assessment of risks was carried out
during Project preparation. In particular, solvency risk was identified as a major threat to
sustainability of the student financial assistance program. Potential issues in relation to portfolio
management were identified and regularly monitored during implementation and in particular
after mid-term review, when supervision increasingly focused on loan recovery, repayment and
on reducing delinquency and default rates.




                                                  6
Coherence with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Project design was in line with the
main goals of the approved CAS3. The Project supported three of the CAS' six strategic areas
and focused in particular on promoting human capital, attaining public sector responsiveness
and efficiency and ensuring sustainable development.

Regarding quality at entry:

There were some deficiencies in the PAD in relation to the Project indicators that are described in
detail in section 2.3, Monitoring and Evaluation.

2.2 Implementation

A number of factors positively influenced Project implementation:

Sound Project coordination. The effective Project leadership by the PCU was a key factor to
successful Project implementation. The PCU gathered relevant information to prepare quarterly
and semiannual progress reports, consolidating information from the MEN, COLCIENCIAS
and ICETEX. These included a detailed description of progress on activities, reporting on the
progress made toward achieving outputs and, subject to external data availability, outcomes.
When there was the need for specialized technical support during implementation, the PCU
hired consultants to support their work. The PCU's technical expertise was disseminated into
the main operations of ICETEX through managed transfers of personnel and, by Project end,
the PCU kept only a reduced group of consultants mainly working on the implementation of the
follow-on operation. In general, although the PCU chartered unknown waters on different
occasions, practical decisions were taken to resolve problems. Good coordination with the
MEN and COLCIENCIAS was in general achieved. Whenever problems arose, they were
effectively resolved and delays to Project execution were avoided, with a few exceptions. The
three implementing agencies also agreed on core execution priorities throughout
implementation.

Collaboration with HEIs and municipalities. From the early stages of implementation, the
three implementing agencies sought to establish alliances with HEIs as the key counterparts to
Project implementation. Under component 1, HEIs supported ICETEX's refocalization on the
lowest socioeconomic strata, as well as the increased borrowers' localization efforts, and
became, in some cases, co-financiers through additional grant or loan support to students. Under
component 2, HEIs experienced a steep learning curve, in particular in the execution of
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) processes for equipment upgrading. Finally, under
component 3, the development of SNIES required a strong collaboration from HEIs in data
generation and its provision under standard templates. ICETEX also collaborated with some
municipalities, which provided additional financial support to students from their geographic
areas.

Positive economic context. Project implementation occurred in a more a positive economic
environment than that prevailing during preparation or emerging at the time of Loan closing.
The environment during implementation was favorable to an increased demand for higher
education and, in particular, for student financial assistance.

Implementation was also affected by factors that had a negative effect:

Difficulty to overcome cultural perceptions about technical and technological studies. The
Project deliberately set an ambitious goal in regard to increasing support for technical and
technological programs through student financial assistance. The incentive mechanisms that
were put in place in the student loan scheme, such as covering the full cost of tuition to students
enrolled in these programs, proved not to be strong enough to overcome the structural issues
affecting these programs. Low program quality and relevance and, more importantly, the
negative social perceptions toward this type of education, prevented enrollment from growing at
the pace the Project had envisaged.

High turnover of personnel within the HEIs. High turnover required significant training efforts
by the PCU and permanent dialogue with the management and administrative personnel of the
HEIs. This was mainly relevant under Component 2 of the Project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring and Evaluation Design

The PAD paid substantial attention to monitoring and evaluation activities and included a
monitoring and evaluation activity in each of its components. Two main elements can be
highlighted:

Combination of methodologies to assess benefits to beneficiaries. The combination of
quantitative (i.e. surveys and data analysis to be carried out by external institutions) and
qualitative (i.e. in depth interviews, external observations and review of secondary information
and sector reports) methodologies was established in the original design of the M&E framework,
which focused on developing outcome data to assess the difference that the Project made in the
lives of students, the main Project beneficiaries.

Lack of baseline data and targets. While the PAD listed a comprehensive set of indicators,
baselines for these were not included in the official Project documents. Many of these baseline
values, however, had already been documented in the thorough analytical work carried out by the
Borrower and the Bank in preparation for the Project. Additionally, the PAD established that
targets for these indicators would be formalized in the Operational Manual. However, targets for
all relevant indicators were not fully incorporated into the Manual. Only a few indicative
programmatic targets were included, many of which were unrelated to the PDO indicators. The
lack of specific targets was not unusual in Bank projects prepared in 2002, especially in countries
lacking good-quality information systems for higher education, as it was the case in Colombia. In
fact, the Project helped overcome this deficiency by creating the SNIES. This resulted in the
establishment of detailed targets for the follow-on operation prepared in 2007 and approved in
20084.

Implementation and Utilization

Quality and reliability of data to feed indicators progressively improved. The PCU regularly
monitored a broad and varying set of indicators as the availability and quality of external data to
feed these indicators varied throughout Project implementation. In the first three years of
implementation, data quality was not optimal. From 2005, with the progressive implementation
of SNIES and the creation of the LMO, data improved significantly and started to be consistent
and comparable. In November 2007, the PCU and the Bank agreed on a standard set of
indicators, including the PDO and implementation indicators established in the PAD but also
other indicators relevant to the Project, that were used in supervision from that moment onwards.

External impact evaluations focused on component I. ICETEX commissioned two external
evaluations to measure the impact of student loans on the beneficiaries. The results were taken
into account to influence Project implementation and, in particular, the design of the follow-on
operation. With regard to component 2, at the time of preparation of this report
COLCIENCIAS had selected a university to carry out an impact evaluation that will be
concluded in the next few months.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management. In general, financial management practices were in line with Bank
fiduciary rules. In mid 2007, the review of the 2006 Audit Report highlighted several issues
related to information security and integrity. In the 2007 audit report, there were also several
internal control recommendations in the IT area. Following these observations, a plan to
improve financial management was prepared to correct the weaknesses in internal controls. At
the time of preparation of this report, some recommendations from the 2006 Audit Report were
pending final implementation. It is expected that this will be completed in the coming months.
In general, by Project completion, there had been substantial progress in the implementation of
the general internal control recommendations, in spite of the pending issues.

Procurement. Procurement was carried out in line with Bank's rules. An independent review of
the procurement activities under the Project was carried out in November 2007. The review
focused on procurement activities undertaken during 2006 and 2007, while also considering
overall Project procurement performance. It concluded that procurement processes were carried
out adequately by the three co-implementing entities and that adequate management practices
had been followed.

In general, procurement documents were in agreement with Bank's guidelines. The three co-
implementing institutions kept full and well organized documentation of the processes and were
also well equipped in terms of human resources. There were some delays in the preparation of
plans for the hiring of consultants.

Supervision of procurement activities under component 2 was demanding, since these were
fragmented, including 13 institutions. Ex-post review by the Bank proved to be difficult due to
the lack of integration of the different information systems. HEIs found the use of Bank
procurement rules challenging, causing occasional delays.

Safeguards. No safeguard issues either were triggered at the time of appraisal or emerged
during most part of Project implementation. At the time of preparation of the follow-on project
approved in 2008, the Bank preparation team estimated that the social safeguard "Indigenous
and Afro Descendant Population" was applicable and ICETEX committed itself to begin


                                                 9
gathering information on applicants' ethnicity as a necessary first step to develop specific
lending strategies that would address the special needs of these target groups.

Prior to this, ICETEX had been offering two special programs since 1990 to help finance higher
education for indigenous and afro-descendant students: "the "Scholarship-loan Program for
Afro-Colombian peoples" and the "Alvaro Ulcue Chocue Fund for Indigenous Communities".
The Scholarship-loans, which may be forgiven based on academic merit or in exchange for
community service, benefited around 4,850 students from 1996 to 2006. The Alvaro Ulcue
Chocue Fund granted 2,981 loan-grants to indigenous students from 1993 to 2006. From 2007
onwards, fewer new loans were granted due to limited funding availability. Loan renewals until
graduation were honored in all cases.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

ICETEX: Second Student Loan Project (P105164), currently under implementation. A new
operation providing additional loans to students coming from the lowest socioeconomic
backgrounds was approved by the Board in March 2008. Under this follow-on operation,
ICETEX is the Borrower and only implementing agency, with a sovereign guarantee from the
GOC. Unlike in the Project being evaluated, ICETEX will be taking the loan directly on its
balance sheet. This imposes new challenges to ICETEX, as explained in section 4, Assessment of
Risk to Development Outcome.

This follow-on operation is a six-year Adaptable Loan Program (APL) with two phases: a first
three-year phase with a total loan amount of US$300 million, followed by a second three-year
phase for US$200 million. Under Phase I, the Program will have two components: (i) providing
student loans to talented but financially needy students; and (ii) improving management
practices to allow ICETEX to operate more efficiently and increase sustainability.

COLCIENCIAS: next steps in PhD production following the enactment of the new Law on
Science, Technology and Innovation (STI). The recently enacted Law for STI has transformed
COLCIENCIAS into an Administrative Department. In addition, from a financial perspective, the
Law has established a new fund that will leverage public and private resources, allowing for a
multi-annual execution. A critical element of the new STI agenda will continue to be the
production of advanced human capital5. In fact, COLCIENCIAS has estimated that, in order to
respond to the country's growing needs, the financing of 500 PhDs annually will be required.
Therefore, continued financial support to both national and international PhD programs will
remain a key priority for COLCIENCIAS in the coming years.

MEN: Convergence and sustainability of the LMO. Today, the LMO receives 12,000 visits per
month and the target is to increase this figure to 30,000. One recent key challenge is converging
with the observatory currently sponsored by the National Training Service (SENA). This is
currently being addressed in the current policy document on mobility being developed under the
National Council for Economic and Social Policy (CONPES). Another key challenge is ensuring
the Observatory's sustainability. Following a consulting exercise carried out by the MEN to

  Other critical elements of this agenda would be skills acquisition, increasing the value-added of goods and services,
fostering the start-up of new knowledge-based companies that are relevant to the regional economies, increasing
linkages between Colombia's research base and the productive sector, upgrading research infrastructure and
strengthening the policy framework for innovation.

assess potential future income-generating mechanisms to make the Observatory self-sustaining,
options for sale of services under different legal modalities have been considered. A decision to
spin-off the Observatory is pending final resolution by the MEN. To date, LMO's personnel are
under term contracts, a factor of uncertainty looking forward. Another key area of future focus for
the LMO is to continue working on developing appropriate information dissemination strategies.
For instance, the MEN is currently implementing a competitive fund to restructure education
programs based on the information provided by the LMO.

MEN: Expansion of SNIES. The next step for SNIES is to expand and start capturing relevant
data for the STI sector in Colombia and, in particular, to gather information on the sector's
expenditures. This requires consolidation of existing information sources, including, among
others, COLCIENCIAS, HEIs and the private sector. It also requires, as a long term goal,
enhancing coordination with the existing Colombian Science and Technology Observatory.
Another area of future attention for SNIES will be expanding automatic reporting to all HEIs.
Finally, there is also an emerging area of joint work with the International Institute for Higher
Education in Latin America and the Caribbean (IESALC) of UNESCO under the project "Higher
Education Map in Latin America and the Caribbean": Colombia was selected for a pilot program
focusing on achieving consistency of regional information on higher education.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
ICR Outcome Rating: Satisfactory

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
ICR rating: Satisfactory

The relevance of the Project's development objectives was high at the time of preparation and
remains high today. The Project aimed to support an expansion of equitable access in tertiary
education and improve its quality, coherence and efficiency. This continues to be consistent
with the priorities of the current Administration and with the needs of a middle-income country
as Colombia. For instance, the national strategy Visión 2019 has set as a key objective for
Colombia: creating a qualified workforce with the skills and competencies needed in a
knowledge-based economy to support economic growth. The link between education and
economic growth is also mentioned by the National Development Plan 2006-2010 (NDP).

The Project's development objectives are in line with the Bank's assistance strategy. In
particular, they remain consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy6 (CPS) approved in
2008, as the Project directly supports two of the five main CPS pillars: high and sustainable
growth and equity.

Regarding design and implementation, there are three main arguments in favor of relevance:

         Sector reform remains necessary. The Project aimed at producing a sector reform of
         the higher education system by placing a strong emphasis on demand-side financing as
         the key intervention ­in fact, student loans represented 88 percent of the total Project
         financing-, but also intended to upgrade quality, revise the regulatory framework and

  Two main Bank strategy documents are relevant, as the Project was approved under a CAS and completed under a
CPS.




                                                       11
        improve the overall institutional landscape. All these interventions and activities remain
        relevant today and have received attention by the National Education Sector Plan 2006-
        2010.

        Importance of demand-side financing has been confirmed by the follow-on operation.
        This operation incorporated recommendations from a government mission to study
        poverty reduction, carried out in preparation for Visión 2019, which highlighted the
        need to expand post-secondary education in an equitable manner and estimated that the
        higher education system would have to expand its capacity from 1.2 million students to
        2.7 million by 2019. It also recommended that Colombia emphasize short-cycle
        vocational and technical programs and expand education financing for poor and non-
        poor students. The NDP has also highlighted the importance of student financial
        assistance, as explained in section 3.5, Other unintended outcomes and impacts.

        Uncertain economic context at entry and exit reinforce the relevance of investing in
        higher education. At entry, Colombia had just come out of a deep recession and the
        need to stimulate economic growth by improving Colombia's human capital and
        moving production to higher value-added segments was of paramount importance. This
        is also the case at the time of Project completion: the current global financial crisis will
        likely prevent Colombia from sustaining recent economic growth rates. In fact, 2009
        could have the first contraction of real GDP growth per capita. since the 1999 crisis.
        Improving human capital to foster growth becomes, even more than before, a key
        national priority.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

ICR Rating: Satisfactory

The PAD proposed a set of indicators to measure: (a) an increase in equitable access and; (b)
improvements in quality, coherence and efficiency. The PDO indicators were as follows:

        Increased continuation rate from secondary education;
        Increased number of graduates from tertiary education;
        Increased graduate employment rates;
        Greater employer satisfaction with graduates' preparedness;
        Increased number of PhDs produced; and
        Increased employment of PhDs

(a) Increased Equity in Access to Tertiary Education.

 The PAD established that this outcome would be monitored by two indicators: (i) an increase in
the continuation rate from secondary to higher education; and (ii) an increase in the total
number of higher education graduates. During supervision, other indicators have also been
regularly monitored: for instance, increases in coverage for the 18-23 age-group, increases in
retention rates in higher education and increases in student loan coverage rates.

Between 2002 and 2007, the continuation rate from secondary education increased from 53.6
percent to 61.2 percent, while the number of graduates from tertiary education also increased
from 132,000 to 180,000. In addition, coverage for the 18 to 23 year-old group rose from 20.9
to 26.2 percent. Finally, the system's efficiency also improved both for technical and


                                                 12
technological education and for students receiving subsidies. The contribution of the student
financial assistance program to these achievements is found to be very significant. In particular,
the external impact evaluations carried out in 2007 and 2008 brought to light the following
positive effects of student loans:

            Student loans under the Access with Quality to Higher Education Program (ACCES)
            directly contributed to increasing access to higher education for students with good
            academic results from low socio-economic strata. Prior to the Project, the percentage
            of loans to students from the two lowest socioeconomic strata7 was 30 percent. By
            Project completion, students from low socio economic strata represented 72 per cent of
            the total number of students receiving loans. Since its creation, the ACCES program has
            provided support to more than 147,000 students while the total number of loans,
            including renewals, had reached 610,000 by Project completion;

            ACCES contributed to reducing drop-out rates. Drop-out rates among ACCES
            beneficiaries were estimated to be up to 30 percent lower than those among students
            with similar characteristics not participating in the program. This finding was consistent
            across HEIs;

            ACCES students showed better academic results than non-beneficiaries from similar
            socio-economic strata, suggesting a link between student financial performance and
            academic performance. However, this result was not found to be statistically significant
            in one of the two impact studies carried out by Colombian universities.

            ACCES helped increase other aspects of the system's efficiency. In particular, students
            benefiting from student loans graduated earlier than those financing their studies
            through alternative means.

Finally, in the course of the Project, ICETEX was able to significantly reduce administration
costs and portfolio at risk. Administration costs were reduced from 12.0 percent of its annual
income in 2002 to 3.9 percent by the end of 2008, freeing up more resources for student loans.
Portfolio at risk greater than 30 days also decreased from historical levels of around 19 percent
to 14.7 per cent8, mainly as a result of the writing-off of bad debt.

(b) Improved quality, coherence and efficiency in higher education.

The PAD established that these objectives would be monitored by three PDO indicators: (i) an
increase in graduates' employment rates; (ii) greater satisfaction rates reported by employers
and; (iii) an increase in the number of PhDs produced and its performance in the labor market.
Additionally, the PAD also included two output key performance indicators: (i) revision of Ley
30 9 and; (ii) increased number of accredited and evaluated programs. Finally, there are


7
    Out of six socioeconomic strata in Colombia.

8 At the time of closing of this report, however, the indicator had increased again to historical levels of around 19 per
cent.

9 Ley 30 is the law regulating the Higher Education sector in Colombia. It was enacted in 1992 .The enactment of a
new law has been considered at different points in time, but has never materialized.




                                                            13
additional impact indicators that have been regularly used in supervision to monitor progress
against this objective, as new information has become available: (i) average graduates' salaries
by area and discipline; and (ii) an increase in the completion rate by PhD students.

        Labor market performance of graduates. For the period 2004-2007, there was a
        consistent increase in employment rates of graduates in every level of higher education.
        On average, employment rates increased from 69.9 percent in 2004 to 82.9 percent in
        2007. A similar evolution was experienced by the indicator "average earnings by area
        and discipline": there were also increases at every level in the same time period. In
        addition, employers' perception about graduates' preparedness had also improved by
        Project end: a survey to 407 employers targeting small and medium enterprises in the
        service, industry and commercial sectors in Bogota showed increased employers'
        satisfaction with the skills acquired by new graduates. While the Project positively
        impacted the achievement of these objectives, there are external factors, such as the
        positive economic outlook during Project implementation, which might have had a
        more significant impact on these indicators.

        In particular, performance of PhD graduates. Between 2002 and 2008, the number of
        doctoral programs in Colombia increased from 32 to 84. The average salaries of PhD
        graduates also increased, from COP 3.8 million in 2004 to COP 4.4 million in 2008.
        The Project directly contributed to achieving these goals, through COLCIENCIAS'
        competitive fund for quality upgrading and through faculty exchange programs.
        Graduation rates for PhD students increased from 38 to 60 percent in the same time
        period. Finally, employment rates also rose: from 90.4 percent in 2002 to 92.7 percent
        in 2007. Additional information will become available once the impact evaluation of
        component 2 is finalized.

        Enhancing the legal and technical framework. Although Ley 30 was not modified as it
        had been envisaged, significant progress was made in advancing the legal and technical
        framework for tertiary education through other means. This had an effect on improving
        the sector's quality, coherence and efficiency, through strengthening existing
        institutions and through supporting relevant demonstration initiatives. Among the main
        regulatory changes in the course of the Project were the enactment of: (i) Decree 223 in
        2003, creating the Vice Ministry of Higher Education; (ii) Law 1002, in 2005,
        restructuring ICETEX; (iii) Decree 1767 and Norm 626 in 2006, which regulated
        SNIES and other information systems; (iv) Decree 2233, modifying ICFES' structure.

        Consolidating and organizing the QA System. In the period from 2002 to 2007,
        Colombia developed its QA system and increased both the number of programs in
        higher education receiving voluntary high standards accreditation, from 59 to 129, and
        the number of programs with Registro Calificado, which had increased to 5,571 by
        2007 since its creation. These improvements cannot, however, be directly attributed to
        the Project.

        Building capacity for strategic planning and management. The creation of the Vice
        Ministry of Higher Education in 2003 with the support of the Project was a first step in
        building the capacity of the MEN and its two demonstration projects, SNIES and LMO,
        significantly contributed to increasing capacity, as explained in section 3.5 (b),
        Institutional Change.




                                               14
3.3 Efficiency

An economic analysis was not carried out for this ICR. Nonetheless, in relation to component 1,
the team reviewed the economic analysis prepared for the follow-on operation approved in 2008
and included the relevant information in this section of the ICR.

There are several arguments in favor of the higher efficiency of the proposed student financial
assistance program, in particular vis-à-vis other policy options:

        Three core stakeholders achieve positive IRRs. A cost benefit analysis carried out at the
        time of preparation of the follow-on project identified the benefits of ACCES student
        loans from three perspectives: the Colombian economy, the Colombian Government and
        the private benefits of the students. All three analyses resulted in positive IRRs ranging
        from 13.8 percent to 27.9 percent.

        Student loans help reduce drop-out rates. This translates into significant efficiency gains
        in the system as a whole, as explained in section 3.2, Achievement of Project
        Development Objectives. This is particularly relevant in the case of Colombia, as at least
        20 percent of students drop out in the first semester, and estimates of the drop-out rate
        range as high as 40 percent.

        Student loans can be redeployed, reutilizing funds upon collection to reach a larger
        number of beneficiaries than would otherwise be reached through a pure grant
        mechanism. In this case, the limit to redeployment comes from the limited amount of
        grant money available through Government subsidies.

        Student loans encourage student financial responsibility. The GOC is encouraging
        student responsibility and active participation through a student loan program that fosters
        awareness of educational costs and a culture of repayment. In addition, a combination of
        need and merit contributes to a more balanced portfolio and a more efficient use of funds
        through risk diversification.

        ICETEX as a platform for a more efficient operation of student loans in the future. A
        very important factor with a long term impact in the higher education sector is the
        institutional improvement of ICETEX to become a more efficient operational platform
        for the delivery of student loans in Colombia. In fact, in the course of the Project,
        ICETEX reduced its administrative costs, as explained in section 3.2, Achievement of
        Project Development Objectives.

In regard to component 2, there were two factors that helped increase the Project's efficiency:

        ICB procedures in the equipment subcomponent of component 2 may have contributed to
        lowering overall procurement costs under this component as access to international
        markets on competitive terms allowed HEIs to pursue global sourcing strategies.

        Support of national PhD programs. Forgivable loans for national PhD candidates are
        significantly less expensive than COLCIENCIAS' preexisting program supporting PhD
        studies abroad. It is estimated that the cost ratio between both types of programs can be in
        excess of 4:1. The investment in a scientific database allowed COLCIENCIAS to reach a
        significant portion of the national research community in a cost-effective form.



                                                15
Finally, it must be noted that the design of component 3 also paid special attention to efficiency
considerations:

        In the LMO, investing in a portal open to the Internet can be a cost-effective way of
        reaching key decision makers such as parents and students. In spite of the small
        investment made, more than 12,000 visitors access the LMO every month and benefit
        from its open web content.

        In the SNIES, the creation of a web-based tool allows HEIs to access relevant
        information about themselves and their peers, and it is also a cost effective way to
        minimize operational costs and avoid expensive paper-based reports.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The Project's outcome rating is Satisfactory. The Project is responsible for significant
achievements, including meeting its expected outcomes. Project interventions contributed to
improving higher education in Colombia and to meet the sector goals set by the GOC in its
sector plan. Project activities were completed and consolidated by Project completion.

The relevance of the Project's development objectives was high at the time of preparation and
remains high today. Project activities were designed in response to the needs of the country's
higher education sector and were in line with CPS objectives. These objectives are still a
priority for the GOC, as reflected in the relevant policy documents.

The Project achieved its development objectives and made a significant contribution to
increasing equitable access to higher education in Colombia. In addition, completion rates
improved and drop-out rates were reduced by Project end. The Project also contributed to
reducing the difference in access to higher education between the rural and urban areas.

Moreover, the Project brought about quality improvements in higher education by encouraging
HEIs to upgrade their programs and to create new doctoral studies. The Project set an ambitious
sector reform goal and, while some of the original activities were vaguely defined in the PAD
and were eventually not fully implemented as originally defined, this did not prevent the Project
from reaching its development objectives.

Finally, the Project contributed to strengthening the institutional framework in higher education,
supporting the consolidation of the Vice Ministry of Higher Education. By Project completion,
the LMO and the SNIES were fully operational and its information was perceived as relevant
and useful for strategic planning and decision-making by a broad array of stakeholders.

The Project achieved its objectives with efficiency. The choice of student loans as a key
intervention helped the Project achieve its objectives in a cost-effective form, leading to fiscal
savings. Also, the Project's global sourcing strategy in component 2 and the effective use of
technology in component 3 contributed to Project's overall efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Component 1 contributed significantly to reduce fear of borrowing by students coming from the
lowest socioeconomic backgrounds. In general, fear of borrowing, high out-of-pocket costs and
inadequate access to financing prevent individuals from benefiting from the high returns of higher
education. The effective targeting of the student loan component has resulted in a larger number
of students from disadvantaged backgrounds increasing their ability to enroll. The ACCES
portfolio focuses on the lowest socioeconomic strata and represents today more than 70 percent of
ICETEX's new loans and more than 55 percent of ICETEX's total portfolio10.

Additionally, a number of HEIs who had traditionally catered to relatively well-off segments of
the Colombian population started to work closely with ICETEX to communicate the benefits of
financing higher education studies through student loans to potential applicants from lower
socioeconomic strata. This effective targeting resulted in higher enrollment from these groups.
Occasionally, these HEIs allocated additional financial resources to support these students so
that they could complete their studies.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project had a direct impact in strengthening the capacity of ICETEX, MEN and
COLCIENCIAS:

ICETEX's institutional transformation. Starting in 2004 and throughout the Project, under the
vision, impulse and leadership set by its current Presidency, ICETEX underwent significant
restructuring. It centralized operations to become a virtual agency with a nation-wide reach,
streamlined its organizational structure, upgraded the professional qualifications of a significant
number of its staff, started to use virtual interfaces with customers, and refocused its student
financial support toward the lowest socioeconomic strata. Overall, ICETEX became a leaner and
more efficient organization, able to reach even the more isolated regions in Colombia, better
equipped to serve customer needs and to work towards its mission of reducing inequality and
poverty. As ICETEX was subject to budgetary restrictions under Colombian fiscal regulations,
through Ley 1002, passed in 2005, ICETEX became an independent public financial institution
subject to regular oversight by the financial supervisory body ­Superintendencia Financiera-.
The law granted ICETEX greater operating, financial and fiscal autonomy and allowed the
institution to access private capital to scale-up student lending. In this regard, ICETEX is in the
process of developing new resource-generating strategies, such as Títulos de Ahorro Educativo.

Strengthening of the Vice-Ministry for Higher Education. With the creation of the Vice
Ministry of Higher Education, attention to the subsector significantly increased. Resources from
the Loan financed specific areas within the Vice Ministry ­mainly, process design, personnel
training and ISO quality certification- and, although the Project was not directly responsible for
the creation of the Vice-Ministry, it played an important role in its consolidation as the key
oversight entity for Higher Education, which eventually led to revised policies, legal and QA
frameworks.



10
     As of July 2008




                                                17
Revised COLCIENCIAS' strategy in relation to doctoral support. Given the relatively limited
size of the financing under the Loan in relation to COLCIENCIAS' total budget, the
institutional change brought about by the Project was mainly limited to the Strategic Programs
Sub-Directorate responsible for the implementation of component 2. As a result of the Project,
COLCIENCIAS started to consider support to national PhD programs as a priority area,
complementing its traditional focus on international PhD programs. The Project has been able to
help COLCIENCIAS extract lessons on what works and what does not work in financial
assistance of PhD students. For instance, COLCIENCIAS is rethinking the terms and conditions
that apply to forgivable loans to prevent brain drain, such as return-to-home-country provisions
in international PhD programs. The Project has also helped evolve COLCIENCIAS' own
strategy about sharing of research equipment, by increasingly linking the equipment to research
projects, which may include not only universities but also, more broadly, research centers.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Increased policy attention to vocational and technical education. The Project was the first in
Colombia to emphasize technical and technological education as a key driver for economic
growth and competitiveness. It helped shape public policy by the GOC, resulting in new
initiatives such a competitive fund sponsored by the MEN or the entry of well-known universities
into this market segment. It eventually led to a project financed by the Andean Development
Corporation (CAF) focused on expanding technical training supply in key cities. The
management for the CAF initiative came originally from the Project.

Increased policy priority to student financial assistance. Also as an indirect result of the Project,
the NDP specifically named increased higher education enrollment and greater access to student
credit as national goals. The NDP's goal is to raise the higher education gross enrollment rate to
35 percent by 2010, which represents an increase of 320,000 students, with technical and
technological education representing 34 percent of the total enrollment. The GOC recognizes that
this expansion cannot take place without further developing student financial assistance
mechanisms.

Creation of the Regional Higher Education Centers (CERES). To improve access, the MEN has
been expanding the supply of tertiary-level technical and academic training throughout the
country. In particular, the CERES are using distance education to bring programs to rural areas.
During Project implementation, ICETEX was the financial arm behind the CERES expansion.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The overall risk to development outcomes has been rated as Moderate. There are several factors
mitigating the Project's overall risk to development outcome:

        Continuity of objectives and implementation strategies in the NDP and Education
        Sector Plan 2006-2010. The GOC will continue to focus on further increasing equitable
        access, improving the relevance and quality of the programs and institutions who
        deliver them, and strengthening core actors. There is consistency in policies and tools


                                                 18
        looking forward, which must provide a good ground for sustaining current
        achievements. Following the 2010 elections, a newly elected Government might revise
        the current priorities but no significant risks to the sustainability of reforms are
        expected given the country's commitment to a long-term national vision.

        Increased focus on strengthening human resources in the three implementing
        agencies. Improving technical and professional profiles has been an area of focus for
        the three implementing agencies throughout Project implementation, and it continues to
        be today. Upgrading personnel qualifications has proved to be effective in risk
        mitigation and will allow the implementing agencies to place an increased attention on
        achieving results.

        Strong HEI involvement. HEIs are, to a large extent, committed to the results of the
        Project. They are increasingly participating as co-financiers in some of the student
        financial assistance programs, have contributed to information provision under SNIES
        and are starting to participate in new forms of collaboration with the private sector to
        provide opportunities for doctoral students. Also, at the time of Project closing,
        ICETEX was starting to consider sharing financial risk with the HEIs.

Nevertheless, component 1 being mainly a financial product, there are also some specific risks
that derive from the particularities of student loans. In general, ICETEX has made efforts to put
in place appropriate mitigating strategies to minimize financial risks, although the current global
financial crisis may pose significant additional challenges to the institution going forward:

Risk 1: ICETEX is starting to use financial leverage. Following its transformation into a
financial institution, ICETEX is seeking to finance itself via leverage, accessing the capital
markets. An external consultancy carried out at the time of preparation of the follow-on operation
showed that ICETEX's balance sheet could support significant increases in leverage: the follow-
on operation itself is a first step in this direction. While this reflects a new, positive stage of
institutional maturity for ICETEX, it will also increase its risk profile as the organization will
soon become subject to the discipline of periodic installment repayments. In this context,
strengthening portfolio management and collection, as well as financial management, and in
particular ensuring asset-liability maturity matching, becomes, even more than in the past, a top
priority for ICETEX.

As a mitigating factor, an independent credit rating has shown positive prospects. In 2007,
ICETEX sought a credit rating from Duff and Phelps, one of the leading international credit
rating agencies and, on 26 November 2008, the agency confirmed its original ratings. The results
were as follows:

        Duff and Phelps awarded ICETEX an AA- long term credit rating. This is the second best
        rating of a 10-stage scale and is defined as "issuances with very high credit quality, with
        very strong risk protection mechanisms. Risk is modest, but can vary occasionally based
        on economic conditions". The best possible rating, AAA, would imply almost zero credit
        risk and would typically be granted only to sovereign and/or multilateral issuers.

        Additionally, Duff and Phelps awarded ICETEX a DP1 short-term credit rating. This is
        the second best rating of an 8-stage rating scale to assess short-term credit risk. It is
        defined as "issuances with high repayment certainty. Risk and liquidity factors are very
        good and risks are insignificant".



                                                19
Risk 2: Student loans are significantly exposed to economic downturns. In general, the financial
industry perceives student loans as a risky product, with a strong exposure to and correlation with
general economic trends. Drop-out, delinquency and default rates could increase significantly at
the time of an economic recession and portfolio quality could deteriorate significantly if external
shocks, such as high unemployment rates, affect students' ability to pay.

In order to partially mitigate the risk, at the time of preparation of the follow-on project the
burden imposed on borrowers by repayment was measured. The average income of higher
education graduates was estimated and compared to the size of installments according to the
various subsidy levels under the proposed project. The results demonstrated that student debt
burden did not exceed acceptable levels even under stress scenarios characterized by lower-than-
expected post-graduation salaries.

In times of economic hardship, ICETEX's repayment flexibility mechanisms would enable
students to restructure their loans. In particular the following features have been incorporated in
the ACCES loans:

          Possibility of deferring payments for up to two semesters
          Increased flexibility for restructuring in the event of delinquency or default, in most
          cases through a extension of maturities
          Caps to the maximum installment amount, based on a maximum percentage of monthly
          income to be charged to the student, as a first-step toward the introduction of income-
          contingent mechanisms.

Risk 3: ACCES loans lack a medium-to-long term track record. As it is the case in other student
loan programs around the world, the lack of a medium-to-long term track record is still
ICETEX's main limitation when tapping into the private capital markets to raise additional funds
for scaling-up public student loan programs. To date, only the first batch of around 30,000
ACCES loans are in repayment phase, and a significant number of these loans were made to
borrowers who dropped out of school since these were the first to go into repayment stage11. As
the longest possible maturity under ACCES student loans is 22 years, a few additional years will
be needed before a track record of performance can be established.

Risk 4: Quality of higher education institutions is uneven and there is a risk of financing
students who are attending poor universities that offer low quality degrees. Following the
preparation of the follow-on operation, imposing additional quality thresholds to HEI registration
was considered necessary and, to this end, the Bank has been working with ICETEX and the
MEN to define new measures to ensure that students attend quality institutions and to prevent
low-quality institutions whose students have bad repayment records from receiving ICETEX's
financial support.




11
   As ACCES loans started in 2003 and a typical duration for a study program is five years, most of the loans that went
into repayment early on had been granted for either short programs or to students who had dropped-out.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team worked closely with the Borrower during Project preparation, jointly identifying
the key issues in higher education and strategies to better address them. The preparation team
included professionals who were able to provide relevant technical assistance to define the scope
and the objectives of the Project and design its instruments. The team also applied the lessons
drawn from similar experiences in and outside the Latin America and the Caribbean region.

Early on, the Bank team was able to build consensus among the different stakeholders around the
main objectives of the Project. The team participated in a symposium organized by the MEN to
discuss the priorities of higher education in Colombia and identify the main policy challenges.
The symposium included high level Government officials, faculty, and university rectors. Later
on, in January 2002, the Bank led a policy seminar attended by a wider range of stakeholders
including teachers and students.

In advance of the Project, the Bank prepared substantial analytical work which favored acting
simultaneously on access, quality, coherence and efficiency and also incorporate national and
international experience on student loans. Since Project preparation overlapped with the general
elections process, the Bank made a strong effort to meet with all the candidates prior to the vote
to ensure support to the Project by the new administration.

Original Project design was adequate, but ambitious, in particular in regard to the QA elements
under Component 3. The details on how to implement activities relating to QA were vaguely
defined and the creation of the Registro Calificado may have contributed to dropping some of the
original tasks. Finally, impact and implementation indicators and targets should have been
defined up-front in the Project's official documents; as explained in section 2.1, Project
Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The quality of the Bank's supervision was Satisfactory.

There were regular supervision missions, carried out by teams with complementary skills and
abilities. Although four task managers supervised different phases of this Project, there was
continuity and adequate support to the Borrower. The transition between the task teams was
smooth and cooperative. The Bank provided technical assistance throughout Project
implementation and, on occasions, brought international experts to Colombia, mainly in the
field of student loans. However, the Borrower expressed the view that the technical assistance
provided by the Bank (excluding procurement) during the early implementation stages was
weaker than expected and could have provided more timely and solid technical feedback, in
particular in support of the preparation of terms of reference for purchases of systems involving
strong technical content. The Borrower highlighted that the technical assistance provided
during the last phase of the Project was timely and of good quality, highly valuing the close and
effective working relationship between the Borrower and the Bank.




                                               21
The Bank team dedicated substantial time to reviewing implementation progress during each of
the supervision missions, according to the Aide Memoires. The teams worked closely with the
PCU and co-implementing entities to address the initial shortcomings and ensure the regular
monitoring of indicators. They also made significant efforts to use new data relevant to
supervision once it became available. The team closely monitored the financial management
aspects of the Project and followed-up on the observations provided by the auditors. The Bank's
procurement specialists kept an open dialogue with ICETEX, MEN, COLCIENCIAS and the
HEIs. The Bank's responses to the Borrower's consultations were considered to be solid, which
fostered a good working relationship based on trust and respect. However, the Borrower
expressed the view that the Bank's last independent review was carried out in a very short period
of time. The Bank's reviewer did not have enough time to properly interact with ICETEX, this
leading to some discrepancies between the actual procurement processes and the reviewer's
assessment.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank's overall performance is rated Satisfactory based on:

        Thorough work during Project preparation, including incorporating lessons-learned
        from other operations;
        Flexible and timely response to the country's needs;
        Good working relationship and communication with the Borrower and stakeholders;
        Adequate Project supervision, accompanying the Borrower during implementation and
        responding, in most cases, to its priorities; and
        Sustained attention to the Project's procurement and financial aspects, fulfilling its
        fiduciary responsibilities, and helping the Borrower overcome shortcomings.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Government's performance is rated as Highly Satisfactory.

The Government developed its own vision about the higher education sector and demonstrated
strong leadership during the preparation of the Project. It led the preparation process,
adequately shaping the Project to support its priorities. This drive continued during
implementation. Throughout the life of the Project, the Government maintained its commitment
to the Project's development objectives.

Government changes during Project preparation did not cause the process to derail. The new
Government elected in 2002 took decisive steps toward ensuring support to Project activities by
the leadership of HEIs.

Finally, the Government provided adequate budgetary resources to comply with its financial
obligations and it exceeded required budgetary allocations during the life of the Project.




                                               22
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The performance of the implementation agencies is rated as Highly Satisfactory.

ICETEX's performance was Highly Satisfactory.
The PCU ensured sound Project coordination throughout implementation, as explained in
section 2.2, Implementation. In addition, and more broadly, over the course of the Project,
ICETEX made significant achievements:

        Increased its brand equity among Colombian students, becoming a reference institution
        in the higher education field associated with the student loan product.
        Significantly professionalized a part of its staff and management, bringing in talent
        from the commercial sector to become more results-oriented.
        Developed a strategic map for the institution and a Balanced Score Card that enables
        ICETEX to regularly monitor its operational and financial performance based on
        predefined quantitative targets, both at the organization-wide and departmental levels.
        Continuously tried to improve its management practices, including credit procedures,
        loan portfolio management and collection practices, working on incorporating best
        practices from the financial industry.
        Improved screening, scoring and credit check of loan applicants as well as verification
        of applicants' information through the use of an external agency.
        Outsourced other key operations including customer service, loan monitoring and legal
        collection of past-due loans.
        Strived to work towards increased sustainability by focusing on repayment and
        collection and regularly reporting delinquent and defaulted borrowers to credit bureaus.
        Incrementally focused on improving repayment culture among students and graduates
        by publicly communicating the individual and social benefits of timely repayment, by
        establishing collaboration programs with HEIs and by implementing new repayment
        channels.
        Selectively and cost-effectively attempted to collect debt past due, or, when not
        feasible, wrote off bad debt to clean its balance sheet and improve credit quality ratios.
        Established restructuring agreements with borrowers willing to normalize their
        financial situation.
        Improved its IT capabilities, implementing new systems that improved the institution's
        ability to handle information effectively and report data in a form which is useful for
        managerial decision making.
        Gained active support from HEIs to provide the needed financial assistance while
        supporting collection and sustainability efforts.

A key driver of ICETEX's performance was its leadership. Under the term of its current
Presidency, ICETEX was able to significantly transform itself. ICETEX's Presidency was able
to define a vision for the institution, an ambitious reform program and effectively implement
both in a limited timeframe.

MEN's performance was Highly Satisfactory. The Vice Ministry of Higher Education
significantly increased its role and reach during the life of the Project, leading the country's
efforts to support sector's reform. Its two demonstration projects, SNIES and LMO, have
become key tools guiding decision making by a variety of Colombian stakeholders, including



                                               23
students, parents, HEIs, policy makers and researchers. The SNIES had already registered all
279 HEIs in Colombia by 2008, while the LMO has information on labor market insertion for
more than 800,000 higher education graduates. In fact, together with other MEN-sponsored
information systems such as the System for the Prevention of and Assistance to Drop-out in
Higher Education (SPADIES) and the Higher Education Quality Assurance System (SACE),
they have become a regional reference in Latin America. In addition, as a result of the emerging
vision centered on quality, transparent processes, information analysis and strategic planning,
the MEN received in 2006 quality certifications ISO 9001:2000 and NTC GP 1000.

COLCIENCIAS' performance was Satisfactory. The Strategic Programs Sub-Directorate
was able to commit resources to the Project to exceed its own internal physical targets on all
three subcomponents. Under the Project, COLCIENCIAS revised its priorities to include
national PhD programs and was able to strengthen a significant number of national doctoral
programs. It was able to develop a cost-effective alternative to international programs for many
PhD students. By 2008, 38 per cent of the active Colombian PhD students were financed by the
Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The overall performance for the Government and the three implementing agencies is rated
Highly Satisfactory based on the following:

        Government's strong vision and leadership during preparation;
        Government's sustained commitment to higher education sector reform throughout
        implementation;
        Achievement of Project's development objectives;
        Comprehensive monitoring of the implementation of Project activities and solid
        evaluations of component 1;
        Vision and leadership by ICETEX's Presidency, fostering significant institutional
        transformation;
        Excellent performance by the PCU in ensuring effective coordination of all three
        implementing agencies;
        Positive track record by the implementing agencies in transforming themselves to better
        serve their clients.

6. Lessons Learned

A number of general lessons can be derived from both the design and implementation phases of
the Project:

Lessons derived from Project design

        Importance of including baselines and targets in the PAD. The importance of
        including baselines and targets in the official Project documents cannot be
        overemphasized. It is a mechanism to ensure the Project is directed towards reaching its
        outcomes since the beginning of implementation. In the Project, neither baselines nor
        targets were officially formalized in the PAD. While it did not prevent the Project from
        reaching its development objectives given the strong performance on key indicators, it
        might have prevented it from having a more robust account of achievements.


                                               24
       Wide sector reforms require balanced funding. The design of the Project was
       ambitious in aiming at a sector reform of the Higher Education system. Nevertheless,
       the distribution of loan proceeds among Project components was skewed toward
       component 1, student financial assistance. Setting a more comprehensive reform
       program for the whole sector would have probably required higher loan amounts
       directed at components 2, 3 and 4 of the Project.

       Demand-side financing needs to be complemented with other interventions. This is
       particularly relevant when very specific goals are pursued, such as expanding coverage
       of technical and technological education. Under component 1, demand-side financing
       was in itself not sufficient to foster a significant increase in enrollment. Attention
       should have been paid also to increasing program supply and improving the quality and
       relevance of academic programs. For instance, under component 2, student financial
       assistance to doctoral programs was complemented with supply-side interventions,
       such as providing assistance to higher education institutions to upgrade their
       infrastructure.

       Changing social perceptions about technical and technological education requires
       concatenated interventions. One of the Project's main findings was the need to
       increase policy attention to technical and technological education. As a result of the
       Project, the GOC significantly increased public policy attention to technical and
       technological education through new initiatives including a broader array of
       interventions.

Lessons derived from Project implementation

       A strong leadership is a key lever to bringing about institutional change. This is
       particularly true when the leadership is able to promote a results-oriented culture where
       outputs and outcomes are measured and quantitative targets are established to drive
       organizational change. The vision, dedication and hard work of the leadership under
       this Project have been instrumental to achieving results.

       Strong coordination by one entity benefits projects with several implementing
       agencies. In the Project, the role of ICETEX as the overall coordinating agency was
       critical to timely execution and achievement of development objectives. However,
       there were challenges to an effective collaboration that needed to be resolved
       throughout Project implementation, such as the need to provide information in standard
       formats, or the difficulty to handle cross-organizational information with the
       proprietary IT systems of the coordinating agency.

       The PCU can cross-fertilize not only within its host organization but also externally.
       A key element to the success of the project was the Government's ability to recruit
       talent for its PCU, bringing in the necessary skills from other organizations to ensure
       implementation according to Bank standards. In line with the Bank's guidelines for
       PCUs, most of the staff from the PCU had eventually been transferred to other areas
       within ICETEX to support its institutional transformation by Project end Other staff left
       the organization to contribute to launching MEN-sponsored projects such as the
       technical and technological education project financed by the CAF. This facilitated
       knowledge transfer and dissemination of best-practices.




                                               25
        Design evaluations from the beginning of implementation. Impact evaluations
        designed early-on in the Project can avoid selection bias and provide more reliable
        estimates of program impact. One of the lessons learned derived from this Project is the
        need to define, at project launch, a relevant set of impact evaluation interventions
        covering all relevant components, as it occurred early on in the implementation of this
        Project.

        One product can influence and reshape an institution. The ACCES credit line, as an
        innovation brought about by the Project, incorporated features that would later be
        adopted by ICETEX's traditional credit lines. In addition, the ACCES IT platform is
        currently in the process of being expanded to other credit lines, which will grant
        ICETEX's management much greater flexibility in using data for managerial decision
        making. In general, ACCES has been a strong lever for institutional transformation
        within ICETEX.

Additionally, there are specific lessons derived from the each of the Project components:

(1) Specific lessons derived from the design and implementation of the student loan
component.

The Bank has relevant experience in structuring student loan programs. The ICETEX
experience is critical in understanding what works and what does not work in student financial
assistance. Relevant lessons were identified at the time of preparation of the follow-on project
in 2008 as well as through the analysis of ICETEX databases carried out in the course of the
supervision missions. These findings are included below and complement lessons learned in
other Bank-financed student loan projects.

        Market failure remains the key justification for Government-financed student loans.
        In Colombia, a private student credit market has not yet been developed. Some
        commercial credit is available, but lenders tend to limit their exposure to student loans
        because they lack the historical repayment data they need to evaluate the risk of this
        financial product. When they do lend to students, they offer consumer lending products
        with short maturities and high interest rates, which many students would be unable to
        repay. This is a market imperfection that prevents many secondary education graduates
        from accessing higher education. Satisfying student financing needs involves
        uncollateralized long-term lending (i.e., loan repayment takes place during the first
        earning years after graduation) with a long grace period (i.e., only small, partial interest
        repayment required during the in-school period and subsequent one-year grace period)
        and private banks are generally unwilling to provide such financing at competitive
        market rates

        Student loans reduce drop-out rates and might have a positive impact on academic
        performance. Impact studies carried out by Universidad Nacional de Colombia and by
        Universidad de los Andes showed a positive correlation between student lending and
        the reduction of drop-out rates. For instance, in the second study, drop-out risk for
        students benefiting from student loans was found to be 14 to 28 percent lower than for
        non-beneficiaries. This finding was in line with that of the first study. The second study
        also suggests improvements in academic performance by students receiving student
        loans: in particular, in the first semester passing rates for beneficiaries were 15 percent




                                                 26
   higher than those of non-beneficiaries. This finding was, however, found to be
   statistically non-significant in the first study.

   Fear of borrowing can be effectively mitigated by effectively targeting the poorest
   students. Raising program awareness among the core target group is essential to
   increase equity. ACCES beneficiaries were able to overcome fear of borrowing given
   the effective communication of the new product toward strata 1 and 2. Moreover,
   centralized processes for credit allocation have helped increase equity and ensured
   effective targeting.

   Government transfers are needed to reach poor and lower-middle income students.
   Most countries, regardless of their level of development, still rely on government
   subsidies to ensure student credits are available on terms and conditions that are
   suitable for the poorest students. In the absence of government subsidies, the interest
   rates charged to the students would have to be unsubsidized and, as a result, increased
   by more than 700 basis points. In addition, the grant element of the student loan also
   requires a government transfer.

   Loan terms and conditions should take into consideration the special needs of lower-
   income students. In particular, repayment terms should be flexible. For instance: low
   payments during the in-school period, grace periods that allow time to find a job after
   graduation, long maturities that keep repayment installments below certain thresholds
   of disposable income, and caps to installment size that provide a safety net for
   borrowers in times of economic uncertainty.

   The loan agency must collaborate with HEIs to co-finance students and increase the
   information available to secondary school graduates on options for financing tertiary
   education and the potential private returns of a higher education investment. HEIs can
   encourage students to meet partial interest repayment obligations during the in-school
   period, help graduates with job placement, and store and update graduate or drop-out
   student contact information to ensure localization. Collaboration in financial risk-
   sharing is also a must when organizations have reached a stage of maturity.

   Credible and efficient processes to assess creditworthiness prior to loan approval,
   focused on co-signors, are necessary to lower delinquency and default, but they must
   not compromise the social mission of student loan agencies. Outsourcing of core
   processes (i.e. credit check by external credit bureaus, verification of eligibility criteria,
   gathering of contact information from students and co-signors) can help student loan
   agencies become more efficient and pass the benefits along by offering better terms and
   conditions to borrowers.

   Terms, conditions and core processes must include features that increase the
   likelihood of repayment. Examples include: interest payments during the in-school
   period to foster a culture of loan repayment, legal authorizations to report past-due
   loans to credit bureaus inserted explicitly in the loan documentation, repayment terms
   that ensure installments do not exceed certain thresholds of disposable income and the
   possibility of prepayment without penalty.

   Education campaigns highlighting the benefits of a culture of loan repayment can
   help to mitigate public opinion reactions against enforcing collection. Campaigns



                                             27
       should emphasize the importance of repayment to future generations of students, and in
       particular the link between repayment and the future availability of credit to students
       from disadvantaged backgrounds.

       Outsourcing of core processes requires support of IT systems. Outsourcing of core
       processes such as customer care, credit monitoring or collection can be an operationally
       efficient and effective way to improve operations and bring them closer to commercial
       best-practice. However, a model of extended-enterprise with several key partners
       performing core processes requires the support of appropriate IT systems, which need
       to be in place rapidly after the collaboration starts.

Some specific lessons were derived from the analysis of ICETEX repayment and portfolio
performance, including its databases, both in the traditional credit lines and in the ACCES
credit line, carried out in the course of the supervision missions:

       Students who drop out have worse pay records than graduates. While this finding
       may be considered evident, it is an important factor to be taken into account by student
       loan agencies, as it provides the empirical ground to develop specific policies to target
       drop-outs. This may include specific localization efforts or exit interviews at the time
       of leaving the higher education institution.

       There is a positive correlation between paying in the in-school period and paying in
       the out-of-school period... Given the limited size of the payments during the in-school
       period, it could be argued whether forcing students to make regular payments is
       conducive to create a habit of repayment upon graduation. The analysis of ICETEX
       databases reveals that there is in fact a positive correlation between repayment habits
       during both periods, suggesting that a culture of repayment can be developed since the
       first year of higher education.

       ... although there are bad payers during the in-school period that turn into good
       payers during the out-of-school period. This is in spite of the significant increase in
       installment size experienced at the end of the grace period, which was estimated at 4.4
       times the amount paid during the in-school period. Student loan programs should
       carefully consider the size of their installments during the in-school period. If they are
       too low, they might be discouraging potentially good payers, as reflected in the fact that
       these bad payers turn out to be good payers later on, even if installment size
       dramatically increases.

(2) In addition, specific lessons were derived from the implementation of component 2-
Support to doctoral programs.

       Importance of sustaining resource levels for financial assistance of PhD and
       researchers This is needed to maintain adequate levels of PhD and research production,
       to cater to the needs of specific economic sectors and to stay competitive as a country
       in the production of advanced human capital.

       Length of doctoral programs being financed needs to be carefully monitored.
       Otherwise, graduation rates and annual PhD production might be negatively affected.
       To avoid lengthy doctoral programs, incentives could be introduced to reduce the time




                                               28
        needed for completion, as well as more strict policies establishing a maximum length of
        support.

        Higher education institutions purchasing robust scientific equipment require
        significant capacity building on procurement practices. Typically, HEIs carry out
        purchases of research-oriented, sophisticated robust equipment only occasionally.
        Therefore, it is necessary to build-up institutions' capacity from the beginning of
        Project implementation. Failure to provide this training in advance of implementation
        may result in failed tenders or in lengthy procurement processes caused by unnecessary
        delays, deriving from a limited knowledge of the applicable procurement rules.

        Training of higher education officials should reach also administrative personnel, as
        this may be a weak link in project execution. Avoiding administrative staff turnover is
        also critical to ensure that processes are implemented according to the pre-established
        guidelines.

        There are limits to program design flexibility in student financial assistance. This is
        particularly relevant when the financial systems are not ready to support adequate
        program monitoring. Simplicity in program design, with fewer add-on features, can
        facilitate program management.

(3) Finally, there are also specific lessons derived from the Project implementation by the
Ministry of Education.

        Identifying specific subprojects with strong demonstration potential and specific
        completion milestones can help achieve tangible results by Project completion. In
        particular, the selection of two very specific subprojects under component 3, such as
        LMO and SNIES, helped make results more tangible, measurable and easy to evaluate.
        It also enabled a better external communication of Project achievements.

        Implementation in stages can help maintain focus on achieving objectives. This was
        the case with SNIES, which was implemented in three stages. The initial stage, which
        went on until 2006, was a pilot involving a small subset of HEIs. Then, at a second
        stage, the initial pilot was expanded and, in 2007, the first reporting of information
        under the new system took place. A final stage was to make reporting mandatory to all
        HEIs via a ministerial decree, as well as developing strategies for information use and
        ownership by all relevant parties.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower provided timely comments to the draft version of the ICR which were taken into
consideration by the ICR preparation team to improve the quality and accuracy of the document.
The Borrower provided clarifications mainly on two areas of the document: (i) the Borrower
indicated that ICETEX always provided financing to students enrolled in programs duly
registered and approved by the MEN. It pointed out that accreditation through the Registro
Calificado was only introduced sequentially and that the high standards accreditation (Registro de
Alta Calidad) is voluntary. It also highlighted the fact that ICETEX could not impose additional
requirements to those that were established by law, when deciding student loan allocation to HEIs.
Once registration in the Registro Calificado became mandatory, programs that failed to comply



                                               29
with this obligation were banned access to student loans; (ii) regarding financial management, the
Borrower pointed out that the auditors' observations on information security did not relate to any
material fiduciary aspects of the Project. The observations, provided in early implementation,
motivated ICETEX to develop a new software to improve loan management, which is still
functioning. Today, ICETEX is transitioning to a new software version that will be used to
manage all ICETEX subportfolios. The Borrower indicated that the supervision missions never
brought up any material issues in relation with the Project financial statements, disbursements or
the management of funds, including those disbursed to the Special Account.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1. Student Financial Assistance.
ICR Rating: Highly Satisfactory

This component achieved its objectives of: (i) increasing access to tertiary education of qualified
but financially needy students; (ii) expanding the student loan program, making it more effective
and financially sustainable; and (iii) improving the monitoring and evaluation system for the
student loan component and the Project.

Subcomponent 1 ­ Improving Equity in Higher Education
Actual Cost: USD 416.64 (versus USD 250.64 million in PAD).

This subcomponent provided resources to ICETEX to provide student financial support to
students from disadvantaged backgrounds with good academic qualifications. Through the
ACCES line of credit, between 2003 and 2008 ICETEX provided loans to 147,410 students who
could not afford to pay for tertiary education, exceeding the original 100,000 target. 74 percent of
these students belonged to strata 1 and 2, 21 percent to strata 3, and 5 percent to strata 4, 5, and 6.
Overall, ACCES contributed to increasing equity in access and achieving greater social mobility.

The PAD proposed the use of two lines of credit with their respective sub-lines for subsidized
and unsubsidized loans. Line A was originally directed to technical, technological programs,
teacher training programs, and post secondary programs in teacher training schools (Escuelas
Normales). This would have represented 60 percent of the funding for this sub-component. Line
B intended to finance university programs and Masters in education, and it would have
represented 40 percent of the sub-component's funding. Each of the lines was divided into two
sub-lines: two of the four sub-lines granted priority to high performing students from the lowest
socioeconomic strata, who received a grant for 25 percent of the tuition cost and a loan for 75
percent of the tuition cost that could be used to cover either tuition or other living costs. The
other two sub-lines provided loan financing exclusively.

Early into implementation, demand for student financial assistance for undergraduate programs
was much higher than envisaged, and demand for technical and technological studies was lower
that anticipated. In spite of a progressive increase in students' demand to pursue technical and
technological studies during 2003 and 2004, by 2005 still only 16 percent of the beneficiaries
came from technical and technological programs. As a result, the original PAD target of
providing 60 percent of the total student financial assistance to technical and technological
studies was reduced to 25 percent. For students coming from strata 1 and 2 and with SISBEN 1
and 2, ACCES provided 75 percent of the cost of tuition; 50 percent of it as a loan and 25
percent as a grant. For students coming from strata 3 and with SISBEN 1 and 2, the financing
was 50 percent, being 25 percent loan and 25 percent grant. ACCES eliminated the need for co-
guarantors to have collateral, providing incentives for students from lower economic
backgrounds to qualify for student loans.

In general, under ACCES ICETEX successfully transformed key aspects of the student loan
operation: (i) it centralized its procedures, closing down regional physical offices and developing
an on-line application process that improved customer satisfaction; (ii) it started to involve HEIs
in the application process, by giving them a role in information dissemination and loan
legalization; (iii) it transferred student loan proceeds directly to the HEIs, providing strong
incentives for HEIs to support the program; (iv) it upgraded and modernized the information
system, allowing for better portfolio monitoring.


                                                  33
In addition, ICETEX signed strategic partnership agreements with HEIs and municipalities.
These agreements were key to the successful implementation of the Project. In many cases, the
strategic partners provided matching funds. This collaboration had not been initially foreseen in
the PAD.

The planned income-contingent mechanism that set a graduated repayment schedule at 16 percent
of expected income was eventually not implemented. By the end of 2007, in the context of
preparing the follow-on operation, ICETEX proposed to cap the maximum installment size to a
percentage of the borrower's income, a step in the direction of establishing income-contingent
repayment mechanisms. The establishment of a guarantee fund for student loans with the
participation of private commercial banks was ultimately not piloted.

Subcomponent 2. ­ Monitoring and Evaluation

Actual and estimated cost: USD 1.5 millions.

This sub-component financed the implementation of a monitoring system for all Project
components and, in particular, for component 1. The Project supported the improvement of
ICETEX information systems and the development of software to better monitor student loans.
The information monitored included beneficiary, operational, and financial information, including
portfolio management data.

Monitoring activities included providing support to participating HEIs. This required substantial
traveling by ICETEX staff across the country to provide guidance and accompany HEIs
personnel. With regard to component 2, monitoring involved reviewing applicants' information
for forgivable loans to doctoral programs and monitoring progress in the implementation of other
Project activities. Finally, some of the activities carried out by the MEN under component 3 were
also monitored under this subcomponent.

Component 2. Support for PhD Programs
ICR Rating: Satisfactory
Actual cost: USD 32.24 million (versus US$ 25 million in the PAD).

This component aimed to support existing and new PhD programs in Colombia. The Project
successfully: (i) provided loans to students to enroll in national PhD programs; (ii) supported the
acquisition of state of the art robust equipment for universities; and (iii) provided funds to support
academic staff development and stipends for visiting professors and researchers. This component
exceeded the targets established in the PAD and the Operational Manual well before Project
completion. The total amount financed by the loan resources was the planned USD 14.88 million,
while the Borrower's contribution was higher than expected and amounted to USD 17.36. Within
this component, the loan resources allocated to PhD student loans were higher than planned (USD
10.3 actual versus USD 9 million planned), while those for equipment were lower (USD 4.6
million actual versus USD 6 million planned).

This component financed forgivable loans (créditos condonables) to 534 students, 124 percent of
the target set in the Operational Manual. 63 percent of students were male and 37 percent were
female. Universities enrolling PhD students were: Universidad Nacional de Colombia,
Universidad de Antioquia, Universidad del Valle, Universidad de los Andes, Universidad
Industrial de Santander, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,
Universidad de Manizales, Universidad Pedagógica de Bogota, Fundación Universidad del Norte,
Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana de Bucaramanga, Universidad EAFIT, and Universidad de


                                                 34
Cartagena. The largest percentage of students pursued PhDs in basic sciences, followed by
electronics, telecommunications and computer sciences, and industrial technology development
and quality. Other areas of study included human and social sciences as well as health studies.

  forgivable loans

By Project completion, out of 600 selected students, 474 were supported with ACCES funding,
61 had completed their studies and graduated, and 65 had not made use of the approved financing.
Requests for financial support for PhD students were made individually, with the advice of a
doctoral coordinator, and loans were awarded following a competitive mechanism.
COLCIENCIAS financed six rounds of competition during the life of the Project, two more than
the PAD had originally foreseen.

Forgivable loans for PhD studies were administered by ICETEX, using the ACCES procedures.
The funds covered the cost of tuition. Program registration in the SNIES was required. Financing
was awarded for the initial four years of study. In 2006, and for the last two rounds of
competition, COLCIENCIAS decided that funding would only cover one and a half years of
study. COLCIENCIAS would finance the remaining study time through proceeds coming from
loan repayment. While this new policy allowed COLCIENCIAS to expand the number of
students accessing doctoral financial support, it also resulted in limiting the number of students
who could access financing in the later years. For instance, in 2007, only 50 students received
loans to finance their doctoral studies, out of 286 requests for loans, the main reason being
funding limitations. A key finding by the implementation team was the low graduation rates
achieved under the program.

With regard to the support for doctoral programs, the Project fostered the creation of new PhD
programs and provided incentives for HEIs to reformulate existing programs, as was the case
with the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. The total number of programs supported per year
exceeded the original twenty-one targeted in the PAD.

The Project enabled universities to receive grant funding awarded on a competitive basis. Grants
were awarded to finance improvement sub-projects, with the following criteria: (i) excellence and
relevance of the academic programs; (ii) level of regional participation; and (iii) support to areas
of national priority. The Project financed the acquisition of state of the art robust equipment and



                                                35
specialized bibliography, financing access to scientific databases. Universities contributed up to
40 percent of each investment. The number of doctoral programs supported was: 39 in 2003, 42
in 2004; 43 in 2005; 55 in 2006; and 72 in 2007.

This activity helped develop significant institutional capacity in the participating HEIs through
the use of international competitive bidding procurement procedures that required significant
medium and long-term planning capabilities within the HEIs. Throughout the course of the
Project, and to this end, the HEIs received training from the Bank, ICETEX and COLCIENCIAS.

In regard to the exchange programs involving visiting professors and researchers, a total of 721
short term visits were carried out over the course of the Project, versus a target of 253 in the
Operational Manual. There were only nine visits of 3 months or more, for a target of 33. In
general, security issues and tax implications also prevented visiting professors from seeking long-
term stays.

Component 3. Institutional Strengthening
ICR Rating: Satisfactory
Actual cost: USD 6.64 million (versus USD 7.09 million in the PAD)

This component succeeded in strengthening the institutional framework for higher education
through the creation and launch of the LMO, the improvement of the SNIES and the
strengthening of the MEN in its capacity to formulate policies and overview the tertiary education
sector. This component did not directly fund improvements to the quality assurance framework,
though the MEN succeeded in establishing minimum mandatory standards for tertiary education
programs during the Project through the Registro Calificado. This is the main reason for rating
this component as Satisfactory, as both the LMO and the SNIES performed at a Highly
Satisfactory level.

Subcomponent 1- Labor Market Observatory
Actual cost ­ USD 1.23 million (USD 3 million in the PAD).

This subcomponent financed the establishment of the LMO, which was housed in the Vice
Ministry of Higher Education of the MEN. The Project financed furniture, equipment and
capacity building. The LMO initiated its activity in November 2005. It was organized into two
phases. A first phase covered the period 2005-2006, until the Project's mid-term review. The
second phase covered the period 2007 to 2008 and focused on its consolidation.

The LMO mission was to provide relevant information on the performance of recent graduates in
the labor market, by field of specialization. It was conceived as the instrument to assess the
relevance of the tertiary education programs offered in Colombia. It should also guide HEIs' self
assessment processes and re-orient the academic programs offered to meet the requirements of
the private sector. In fact, the LMO intended to create linkages between academic programs and
needs of the most relevant economic sectors.

By Project closing, the LMO's design had been finalized and the Observatory was in operation,
having integrated databases from administrative registers to ensure a standard and systematic
monitoring of higher education graduates. Today, the LMO includes demand and supply
information:




                                                36
        On the supply side, the LMO includes information on higher education graduates. It
        integrates information from the SNIES, as well as other external resources, including the
        Ministry of Social Protection, the Registraduria Nacional and the Ministry of Finance.
        Additionally, it includes information gathered in a series of surveys made to graduates.
        The first survey was applied in 2005 to a sample of five thousand people who had
        graduated between 2001 and 2004. Since 2007, the survey has been completed, on a
        voluntary basis, by 25,000 youth graduating between 2001 and 2007, and its results have
        been posted on the web. From 2008 and onwards, the LMO tracks graduate performance
        at different moments in time: before graduation and on the first, third and fifth years after
        graduation.
        On the demand side, the LMO includes employer-related information relevant to students,
        parents, and professional counselors. In particular, it provides information on labor
        market insertion of higher education graduates. For instance, it provides graduates'
        employment rates over a four-year period, as well as salary increases.

Subcomponent 2- Improving Institutional Capacity to develop and Implement Policy
Actual cost: USD 2.04 million (versus USD 2.90 million in the PAD).

This subcomponent provided support to the Vice-Ministry of Higher Education to strengthen its
institutional capacity in higher education. The Vice-Ministry was created simultaneously with
the launch of the Project. Although the creation of the Vice-Ministry was not a direct product of
the Project, the Vice-Ministry developed its processes and trained its human resources with
Project support. By Project completion, the MEN had seen increases in its capacity to formulate
policies and plan and manage strategically. In addition, the MEN received in 2006 quality
certifications ISO 9001:2000 and NTC GP 1000 endorsing the institutional efforts to adopt a
strategic plan with a vision centered on the quality of service provision and products, with
transparent processes.

During the life of the Project, progress was made in developing the legal and technical
framework for higher education. Among the main regulations enacted were: (i) the Decree 223
in 2003 creating the Vice Ministry of Higher Education; (ii) the Law 1002 passed in 2005
restructuring ICETEX; (iii) the Decree 1767 approved in 2006, which established the regulation
for the SNIES; and (iv) the Resolution 626 passed in 2007 to articulate the information system.
Achieving these legal milestones contributed to increasing the system's coherence and to
strengthening of the institutional framework for higher education.

Finally, the Project did not directly provide technical assistance to consolidate the QA system
under one organization. However, during the life of the Project the MEN made progress in QA by
establishing the requirement that programs be registered in the Registro Calificado.

Subcomponent 3 - Improve and Strengthen the SNIES
Actual cost: USD 3.37 million (versus USD 1.19 million in the PAD).

The SNIES was strengthened with direct support from the Project. Based on the background
work carried out by Universidad del Rosario, ICFES and the International Corporation for
Education Development (CIDE), a new design for the SNIES was developed, which included
the technological developments needed to consolidate HEI information. As a result, the new
SNIES was implemented in all Colombian HEIs and the first complete report including


                                                37
information from all HEIs was produced in 2007 following an automated information
consolidation process. By Project end, the 279 HEIs in Colombia were registered in SNIES.
Today, the SNIES has been able to generate a good set of indicators for analyzing the sector,
which are regularly monitored and used for policy decision-making.

Nevertheless, in its initial stages of development, information capture and provision imposed
significant challenges to the HEIs, which created ad-hoc technical groups to compile statistics.
Progressively, the HEIs simplified and automated their processes to collect information. Also,
overtime the Project clearly defined its hardware and software requirements and the human
skills required to function.

Some additional achievements of SNIES today are: (i) the development of a glossary of higher
education terms, with a clear definition of concepts; (ii) the consolidation of all data under a
single data base and; (iii) the carrying out of information audits on the sources of information to
ensure quality. Today, the SNIES is used in the evaluation process of academic programs for
registration in the Registro Calificado, as indicated in the Law 1188 2008.

One of the main areas for future development of SNIES is to expand to include relevant
information on STI, in coordination with the privately-supported Colombian Observatory for
Science, Technology and Innovation currently in operation. In particular, the main difficulty lies
on gathering relevant information related to private sector investment in R&D.

Component 4. Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
ICR Rating: Satisfactory
Actual cost: USD 2.42 million (versus USD 1.40 million in the PAD)

This component successfully financed the activities originally planned in the PAD: (i) the
creation of a PCU, housed in ICETEX as the coordinating agency; (ii) the provision of technical
assistance for the co-implementing agencies COLCIENCIAS and MEN as well as to the HEIs
and municipalities; and (iii) the preparation of Monitoring and Evaluation studies for key Project
activities.

The PCU's composition varied over time and was generally integrated by a coordinator, a
financial specialist, a procurement specialist, an assistant for financial management, a specialist
for monitoring and evaluation, and a general assistant responsible for office management. It was
supported by technical personnel from other agencies when this was required to address
implementation issues. The PCU was in charge of both implementing component 1 of the Project
and coordinating with the implementing agencies for components 2 and 3. The PCU followed-up
on the general fiduciary aspects of Project implementation. It gathered the information on each
component and prepared the semi-annual progress reports. The evaluation activities were also
carried out under this component. Two impact evaluations of the student loan activities were
completed by the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and by the Universidad de los Andes.

Background

In 2002, when this project was negotiated and went into effectiveness, the Government of
Colombia began to actively intervene in the higher education sector in Colombia, in response to a
state of affairs characterized by the following:

       There were a large number of authorities, including regulatory bodies, generating a dispersion
       of initiatives and a lack of coordination.
       The information system was too fragmented, incomplete, and untimely placing difficulties in
       planning and policy-making in the sector.
       Regional bodies (municipalities and departments) had no real say in the formulation and/or
       execution of public policy for higher education.
       There were no convincing signs of any coordinated linkages between primary, secondary and
       higher education.
       In a context in which society underestimated the value of technical and technological
       education, there was no policy to foster or encourage these types of education. Some of the
       higher education institutions that did offer such courses lacked the required quality.
       Demand for higher education had increased, due principally to an expansion in the coverage
       in primary and secondary education.12
       Although gross enrollment had increased from 13 percent in 1990 to 21.8 percent in 2000,13
       it was still below the average for Latin America (25 percent) and far below the average for
       OECD countries in 1997 (54 percent).14
       In 1993, only 3.5 percent of the bottom two income quintiles attended an institute of higher
       education, while 36 percent did so in the upper quintiles. By 1997, the gap between these two
       groups had widened; 9 percent of the poorest remained in the system compared to 65 percent
       of the wealthiest.
       Despite extensive unsatisfied demand for higher education, many of the places available went
       unused. In addition, there was a very high concentration in certain programs and in university
       education (the private sector used 52 percent of its installed capacity, while the public sector
       used 80 percent).
       High registration fees and other costs, in conjunction with economic constraints faced by
       students and their families, were identified as possible barriers to young people's entry into
       the higher education system.
       Relatively few student loans were made available by financial institutions and they tended to
       be short-term and accompanied by very demanding co-borrower guarantee and income level
       requirements. The loan market is governed by profitability, risk, tenor and collateral, criteria




12
   In 1900 the potential demand for higher education totaled some 300,000 people. By 2,000 that number had increased
already to 583,000, a 94 percent increase in just 10 years.

13
   The gross coverage estimate refers only to undergraduates and corresponds to the school age population aged
between 18 and 22. Other studies take the 18 to 24-year-old segment (seven years) and therefore show lower coverage
ratios.

       that are not geared to the performance of a social function. It does not therefore reach the
       neediest segments of the population.
       Loans had been an important component of the financial aid provided to students in
       Colombia, which has, perhaps, the oldest student loan program in the world. Nevertheless,
       ICETEX, as the institution in charge of the program, experienced years of administrative
       deterioration, politicization, and a lack of strategic vision that resulted in a loss of credibility
       in Colombia, among other reasons due to the high interest rates it charged and complicated
       conditions governing the provision of collateral. That led to a decline in the demand for credit
       and a high percentage of arrears.
       With the promulgation of Law 30, the National Accreditation Council (CAN) was established,
       along with the quality assurance mechanism. However, no minimum quality standards had
       been set for all the tertiary education programs available in the country, nor was there any
       clear definition of the institutions needed for a quality assurance system for higher education.
       Barely four percent of all undergraduate programs had undergone quality assurance
       accreditation.
       In 2002 in Colombia, only one in a million inhabitants per year earned a doctorate, one of the
       lowest rates in Latin America.
       1.66 percent of teachers had a doctorate, compared with a Latin American average of 9
       percent.

General Characteristics, Outcomes, and Impact of the Project

General aspects

Due to time and information constraints when the project was being negotiated and to the urgency
felt by both the national Government and the World Bank to sign the loan agreement, the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) established indicators without, however, quantifying targets for many
of them. That is why, from the very first performance report, ICETEX and its co-executing
agencies proposed a set of indicators and targets that the World Bank knew of and supported at
the time, through its task manager. However, apparently this system was never incorporated into
the Bank's in-house project monitoring system. This evaluation system was used during project
supervision missions until 2007, when the Bank revised the indicators established in the PAD,
analyzed the targets set by the project, and formally agreed with the Government on an updated
set of indicators and targets.15

During execution, the project was affected by the following:

         The project foresaw a high percentage of loans for vocational-technical and technological
training (60 percent of all loans). In fact, the tertiary education system in Colombia generated
little demand for such loans. Approximately 80 percent of the loans granted were for university
programs. That, coupled with the increase in the number of loans granted each year, meant that
more had to be disbursed each half-year, for larger cohorts, and that portfolio recovery was
slower. It became necessary to adjust the share of loans to be granted to the different levels of
tertiary education. Experience showed that there was no high demand for loans for technical and
technological training programs, so the distribution was adjusted to 25 percent of loans for

vocational-technical and technological training programs and 75 percent for university
education.16

The initial programming of loan disbursements was based on exchange rates projected by the
National Department of Planning (DNP) in accordance with 2002 macroeconomic assumptions
for the period of the loan. Real exchange rates, however, turned out to be very different. The
following table compares projected average annual exchange rates with those that in fact applied
during project execution.

Revaluation of the peso meant that the dollar disbursements scheduled for each year yielded
fewer pesos for the project.

Component 1: Equitable Access (Student loans)

Under this component, financing was provided to enable low-income Colombian youths to attend
tertiary education programs. The financing consisted of a combination of a loan and a subsidy
sufficient to fund a high proportion of a student's tuition fees and living cost.

The project gave priority to the poorest and to those wishing to follow vocational-technical and
technological courses of study. Thus, if a student requires aid to pay for tuition fees, the Project
covers up to 100 percent for students in technical and technological courses, and up to 75 percent
for university students. In cases in which a student requires maintenance support (that is to say,
the academic and non-academic costs associated with his studies, especially if his or her nuclear
family lives in a town other than the one in which the institute of higher education is located), he
or she is granted a loan of up to five (5) times the legal minimum monthly wage in force at the
time, depending on the student's needs and the cost of living in the city in which he or she is
studying.

The project introduced a two-stage repayment scheme for students. During the study period, a
small payment is required to cover part of the interest generated by half-yearly disbursements.
Definitive amortization begins after the student has left tertiary education. In any case, when
establishing installment amounts, ICETEX takes into account the student and his or her family's
capacity to pay, in such a way that the installments enable the student to complete the course and
to pay his or her way after graduation.

Under the ACCES project, ICETEX granted 147,410 new loans (147 percent of the target)
between 2002 and 2008, of which 74 percent were for students in social strata 1 and 2 (compared
to a target of 65 percent). It tripled its loan portfolio from $517 billion [Tr. pesos] in 2002 to $1.1
trillion in 2008.

Student loan coverage has tripled in Colombia from six percent of the target population (all those
enrolled in the system) in 2002 to19 percent in 2008. For the population corresponding to the
lowest income strata enrolled in private institutions (which charge higher fees), the coverage rate
is 36.7 percent.

Subsidies in the amount of $118.6 billion benefited 67,069 students corresponding to the most
socioeconomically disadvantaged segments of the population.




The loans granted under the project have had a direct impact on the higher education system:

    They enabled more of the most disadvantaged students in Colombia to access the system
    thanks to highly targeted loans and subsidies (the share of students benefiting from subsidized
    interest rates and direct subsidies increased from 29 percent in 2003 to more than 42 percent
    in 2008).
    They improved access for youth living in remote areas. ICETEX significantly expanded its
    geographic coverage and today serves young people from more than 1,090 municipalities
    (over 96 percent of the Colombian territory).
    They enhanced the efficiency of the tertiary education system, lowering drop-out rates and
    shortening the time taken to graduate (those benefiting from student loans are 28 percent less
    likely to drop out than non-beneficiaries of similar characteristics: they also graduate in a
    shorter time than non-beneficiaries).17
    Implementing the ACCES credit line in ICETEX required a number of changes and
    adjustments that had a positive impact on the organization. During project execution, the
    institution underwent two administrative restructuring processes. One was related to the
    improvement of its loan portfolio tasks and auxiliary administrative and financial services.
    The other involved the development of software for loan and portfolio management and the
    institution's change in legal status to become a "special financial" entity.

All this was undertaken in order to offer student loans to vulnerable segments of the population,
expanding coverage to the whole of Colombia, using modern practices, eliminating red tape, and
increasing transparency in the administration of funds.

This organizational restructuring was triggered in part by a change in the loan management model.
Before, ICETEX followed a centralized, manual model, providing services directly to students

   According to studies carried out by the National University's Research for Development Center (CID), Bogotá, 2006
and the University of the Andes' Economic Development Studies Center (CEDE), 2008.




                                                        47
through its 23 regional offices all over the country, after having received paper applications from
loan applicants that then had to be granted scores by officials who then selected the beneficiaries.
Now, ICETEX has adopted an open, nationwide model in which service is provided by institutes
of higher education (332 offices all over Colombia) over the Internet, which all citizens can
access nationwide. The system is based on trust, in the sense that an application is evaluated
based on the information recorded by the student on the electronic application form. Then,
application legalization is handled by the institutes of higher education, which receive the
documentation and certify that the information has been submitted in the right form, after the loan
has been approved.

ICETEX is now a modern institution with a stronger technological platform and innovative
procedures. It has revamped its relations with users and partners thanks to a new vision of
effectiveness, service, and targeting.

Component 2: Support for Doctoral Programs

Executed directly by COLCIENCIAS,18 this component supported the consolidation of doctoral
programs in Colombia by granting forgivable loans (up to 90 percent or 100 percent of the loan
amount) covering all needs of the beneficiary students while they are studying, by supporting the
purchase of technological equipment needed for doctoral program research, and by supporting
exchanges with international experts and research teams from other countries through visits and
internships.

The project's goal was to finance 432 scholarship holders. In fact, it achieved 124 percent of its
target, with 600 beneficiaries selected and 535 financed by 2007:

By the end of the project, according to statistics by the National Education Ministry and
Colciencias, out of a total 1,246 doctoral students enrolled by the end of 2007, 472 (i.e., the 600
selected between 2002 and 2007, less 61 graduates and 66 unused loans) were students financed
by the project. In other words, by the end of 2007, 38 percent of the active Colombian doctoral
students were financed by ACCES project funds.



18
   Known in 2002 as the Colombian Institute for the Development of Science and Technology, COLCIENCIAS was
transformed by Law 1286 of 2009 into today's Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation.
The same law established the National System of Science, Technology, and Innovation (SNCTI) and contains further
provisions on the subject.

 Total enrollment in doctoral programs increased, partly due to the ACCES project, from 350 in

 The project also envisaged financing internships and encouraging foreign researchers known for
 their excellence in research to visit participating Colombian universities.
 In the course of the project, 721 domestic and foreign exchanges were financed, 285 percent of
 the project target. As regards long internships, the target was to achieve 33 exchanges. However,
 for security reasons, many researchers were unwilling to visit Colombia. As a result of this, the
 original target was not met.

 Another project goal was to support the construction or improvement of equipment for 21
 existing and 8 new doctoral programs. These targets were exceeded, with a 342 percent degree of
 achievement.

 From 2002 to 2007, between 78 and 98 percent of the MEN accredited doctoral programs (as
 meeting minimum quality requirements) received financial support, to both purchase equipment
 and obtain specialized bibliographies through access to scientific databases.

 This support from Colciencias, using ACCES Project funds, was probably a major incentive for
 the emergence of new quality-accredited doctoral programs. An example of that occurred in
 Universidad Nacional in 2005, when the Engineering doctoral program was converted into
 several doctoral programs.

 The equipment support component forced universities to follow new procedures for the
 procurement of high-value items (those exceeding US$500,000) through international bidding
 processes. That probably enhanced the transparency of internal procedures in educational
 institutions with doctoral programs in Colombia.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening

In a very strategic manner, this component supported the establishment of the Vice Ministry of
Higher Education to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Education to formulate policy and
develop the regulatory and operational framework for tertiary education in Colombia, as well as
the processes needed to foster, inspect and oversee the sector. In the process, detailed process
designs were developed for all work to be done by the Vice Ministry of Higher Education,
training was provided to all the officials involved, and information and follow-up systems were
put in place.

In 2006, the MEN obtained certification ISO 9001:2000 Standard and Public Management
Technical Quality Standard (NTC GP) 1000:2004. That certification attests to the fact that the
MEN adopted a strategic approach geared toward ensuring the quality of its products and services,
with transparency, guaranteeing access to information, and undertaking preventive and corrective
measures, as well as other improvements.

This project component supported the design and implementation of a number of tools for
providing valuable information to enable the educational sector authorities, providers of
educational services, students and parents to make informed decisions with respect to their role in
the system and thereby to render it more effective.

The national tertiary education information system, SNIES, was restructured and endowed with
the technological capacity to consolidate first-hand census data using automated procedures. That
system was introduced in all Institutes of Higher Education, allowing for the migration of
information (institutions and programs) and its integration with the information systems of other
sector organizations (ICFES, ICETEX, Colciencias). An Indicator Control Panel was designed for
the sector, along with data sheets including relevant variables and indicators.

The Ministry of Information developed the regulatory framework governing the tertiary education
information system (SNIES), its subsystems and had responsibility for the quality of the
information and the consolidation dates (Decree 1767 of 2006 enabling regulations for the SNIES,
and Resolution 626 of 2007 ­ availability of the information and linkages with SNIES sources).
Those actions helped institutes of higher education to strengthen their information management
procedures and structures.

Enabling regulations such as Law 1188 of 2008 on quality accreditation for tertiary education
programs establish the procedure for evaluating academic institutions and programs. The enabling
regulation decree will establish the use of SNIES as a source of information for the evaluation
processes.

In 2008, the National Higher Education Information System, being aware of the importance of
data quality for generating statistics and indicators, made the demographic data gathering
process--associated with tertiary education enrolment--subject to international quality
evaluation at end-2007, through the Andean Center for Higher Studies (CANDANE). That entity
certified the process, which includes design of the software, and ensured data recording,
consistency and validation. Certification was awarded in the highest category (Level A), for a
three-year period.

Joint work also began with UNESCO's IESALC on a project called "Map of Higher Education in
Latin America and the Caribbean", given that Colombia was selected as a pilot sample because of
its organized handling of information through the systems developed specifically for that purpose


                                                50
by the Ministry of Education. Currently, information on institutions and programs, as well as that
on students that have registered, enrolled and graduated is automatically fed into the IESALC
system, thereby guaranteeing consistency in the information disseminated by UNESCO and used
in Colombia. Recognition of the tertiary education information systems by IESALC came during
the Regional Conference on Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean, CRES, in
June 2008.

Under this Project component, the MEN also designed and developed the Educational Labor
Market Observatory (OLE), an information system that intends to analyze education based on
monitoring graduates' employability. OLE can be accessed on the Internet at
www.graduadoscolombia.edu.co. This tool provides an assessment of the current situation and
trends in the supply and demand for graduates from the tertiary education system and provides
statistics on their academic and job profiles, based on records and cross-comparisons of graduate
data provided by the IES and job s, social security, and tax records culled directly from National
Government databases.

Prior to OLE's operation, the National Government established a regulatory framework for
consolidating available information.. It also formed regional networks of Institutes of Higher
Education (IES), as well as a national network, and it has lent technical and financial support to
the IES to strengthen its ability to monitor graduates' careers.

The MEN has been publishing its graduate monitoring findings since 2001. In 2008, it published
information about 885,000 higher education graduates. It has also accessed and consolidated
information on national and international experiences on monitoring graduates' careers and on
linkages with the productive sector.

Lessons Learned

On Access and Equity

Impact studies have shown that student loans are the best tool for social inclusion and mobility as
they make it possible for very poor students to access and stay longer in higher education.
Students financed by loans have lower drop-out rates, achieve better academic scores, and
graduate in a shorter time.

The poverty and vulnerability levels of ICETEX's target population have led to the realization
that, even though, in and of itself, a student loan raises the chances that a student will remain
within the system; it also requires additional affirmative action. This is to supplement efforts to
ensure the student's well-being and academic performance, so that he or she can graduate on an
equal professional footing. A vulnerable student needs academic and psychological support,
including help in adjusting to a new environment. Beneficiaries of institutions lending that kind
of support now show lower drop-out rates.

Loan repayment during the study period helps to: (i) minimize capitalization of interest and the
cost of the loan, as it reduces the amount of principal to be financed in the amortization period;
(ii) increase collection, thanks to somewhat swifter recovery and rotation of the funds invested;
and (iii) reduce the risk of default during the amortization period by generating a repayment-of-
debt culture in the beneficiary. Despite that, installments may constitute a drop-out risk factor for
low-income families if they are too high. That is why ICETEX has always preferred installments
that take into account a student's capacity to pay to swift recovery. Furthermore, those institutes
of higher education that provide direct pedagogical support to beneficiaries and encourage them


                                                 51
to carry out jobs specifically related to their expertise during their studies also fostered swifter
and more prompt repayment of the student loan and, as a result, exhibit better loan portfolio
performance ratios.

Institutions' social responsibility may also be manifested in contributions to higher education. For
instance, ICETEX has arranged two options: (i) financing living costs for those students
benefiting from a loan covering tuition loan but who cannot afford to complete their studies
without additional support; and (ii) co-financing the tuition loan/subsidy. ICETEX used the
traditional funds-in-trust system to receive contributions from institutes of higher education,
regional entities, cooperatives and the private sector, but directing them toward the co-financing
of the ACCES credit line. This meant that the credit line achieved wider coverage, as well as
eliciting the active participation of local authorities in tertiary education policy.

The management model used by ICETEX after the implementation of ACCES was successful
because it addressed regional constraints to access by young people. Under the new arrangements,
applicants or loan beneficiaries no longer depend exclusively on the physical presence of an
office in their area; they can apply online. Procedures that do require physical presence are partly
taken on by educational institutions. Therefore, a key factor is ensuring that all the directors and
operational staff in those educational institutions have a detailed knowledge of the philosophy
and rules associated with ICETEX student loans. Key determinants of the success of this
management model include targeting criteria, preferential access, repayment culture, monitoring
and timeliness, along with other factors

Likewise, it is essential to keep close tabs on the educational institutions operating the loan.
Supervision provides an excellent opportunity to identify mistakes, lacunae, and needs for
improvement, as well as to correct past errors. ICETEX made it obligatory to undertake half-
yearly reconciliations of accounts with the participating institutes of higher education. All of the
latter recognized that they afforded the best opportunity to grasp key aspects of the way loans are
handled, as well as to raise levels of compliance with the regulations in force, organize or
enhance the equipment earmarked for the model, and boost the project's image within the
institution.

Applied in that manner, the model proved to be successful. Accordingly, ICETEX decided to
extend it to the other credit lines it operates, including those for third party funds-in-trust. That
also helped to create a unified image of ICETEX vis-à-vis educational institutions and to gear the
project toward making the system more equitable.

Regarding Doctoral Programs

Funding for students in doctoral programs needs to be sustained over time into order to maintain
cohort indicators constant and competitive with those of other countries. The 2007 drop in
funding led to hefty criticism and traumas when expectations built up in previous years were not
met.

Graduation rates are probably not optimal. The amount of time allowed for completing doctoral
programs need to be reexamined, along with the causes of delays in graduation, even though
retention rates are fairly high.

Major progress was observed in the ability of Colombian universities to deal with the procedures
required for calling and executing international tenders, given the magnitude of the funds needed
for the procurement of heavy equipment. Many programs had little experience with high-value


                                                 52
procurement. Moreover, it is possible that, even when procurement procedures were in fact in
place, they were never optimal, due to lack of familiarity with managing international tenders.

In several universities it transpired that, although for academic and research purposes they did
have a critical mass of research professors, often the administrative staff was not up to the task of
executing the project. Colciencias trained administrative and financial staff at the universities, but
either that training was not replicated within the universities or the high rate of staff rotation at
that administrative level did not allow for an adequate continuity in project execution.

Program design allowed too much flexibility for individual students, which made it difficult to
design and maintain the information systems required for proper monitoring. Although ICETEX's
information systems were revised and restructured to tailor them to the needs of the project,
future projects should try to devise loans and financial aid mechanisms for students with stricter
but simpler terms, to make monitoring them less complex.

Transforming the National Tertiary Education Information System (SNIES)

Positioning SNIES as the sector's core information system and as a tool facilitating its
management, planning and decision-making required the Ministry of Education to provide
substantial support to tertiary education institutions. The project revealed considerable
heterogeneity in the technological level of development of the different institutions, a product of
the independence they enjoyed in their design and development. The project established a line of
action and basic technical criteria that the institutions have to follow, which then makes it
possible to encourage processes geared toward technical improvement, better information, and
greater sector coordination.

Making tertiary education institutions more conscious of information systems and arranging bulk
terms with system suppliers that bring about economies of scale and better prices for the IES will
yield better and quicker results. The information provided by SNIES has been declared the
official source for Colombia's higher education sector. This enhances the standing of the system
both nationally and internationally, which, in turn, motivates official institutions to report
accurate, complete, and timely information.

The Educational Labor Market Observatory

The Observatory is an information tool for feeding reflection as to what the HEIs need to do to
make their programs more relevant. It is also an ideal mechanism for selecting and choosing an
academic program that is relevant in terms of the country's needs. Both prospective higher
education students and parents make excellent use of it. The success of the Observatory relies on
mass access to, and proper utilization of, the information stored in it, as well as on the inclusion
of information on the demand for professionals, via a mechanism that systematically identifies the
human resources that the country's productive sector needs.

Management of the Project

As regards project evaluation and monitoring, one of the difficulties encountered was the dearth
of analytical data in Colombia when the project began. That made it difficult not only to define
targets, but also to keep track of them. It is important for project preparation to include
measurements of key indicators and to construct a baseline that provides valuable information for
project formulation and implementation.



                                                 53
Dissemination processes are as important as measurement. Dissemination of the findings obtained
through project implementation opened new doors to assisting institutional efforts by co-
executing agencies, generated new strategic partnerships and interest on the part of the
international community, and made a major contribution to the overall positioning of the project.

A core factor toward project's success was its ability to rely on well-identified representatives
within each co-executing institution. On some occasions, when there was staff turnover, there was
a marked decline in continuity and coordination, which was then overcome through swift, direct
interaction. It is worth underscoring, too, that the project was always able to count on the
leadership of the Office of the President of ICETEX, as the entity in charge of overall
coordination, as well as on the willing support of executives in the Vice Ministry of Higher
Education and Colciencias. Their support made it easier to overcome any hurdles institutions
came across.

The Loan Agreement divided ACCES project procurement among three entities, each with its
own structure and functions: The National Ministry of Education (MEN) (component 3,
subcomponents 3.1 and 3.3); Colciencias (component 2); and ICETEX (component 3,
subcomponent 3.2) and the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) under ICETEX (component 4,
subcomponents 4.1 and 4.2). Each entity had a procurement expert and the task of centralizing
execution fell to ICETEX's PCU, which served as the direct contact vis-à-vis the Bank for
approval of purchases.

Although it was a complex arrangement, it functioned satisfactorily thanks to staff's familiarity
with World Bank procurement standards, with the exception of some delays in the timely
provision of information due to different internal administrative procedures and systems by the
co-implementing entities.

Performance by the World Bank

During the preparation stage and the first years of implementation, the Bank's technical
assistance (other than that related to procurement) was somewhat weak and not as timely as
expected. One example had to do with feedback and discussion of the terms of reference designed
for hiring loan and portfolio software or the custody of guarantees, where the Bank failed to
provide technical criteria for analyzing bids. If it had done so, not only would delays have been
avoided, but also the loss of major resources would have been prevented.

As for document record management, the comments made by supervision missions and
independent reviews were in favor of maintaining a chronological sequence for each step of the
process and, in the case of individual consultants whose contracts are renewed, the auditors have
emphasized sound practices using some device or mechanism for separating one process from the
other. Here, concept, organization, disposition and consultation have all been regulated in
Colombia and, by law, all entities have to adopt a general, uniform procedure. These standards, to
some extent, clash, albeit not structurally, with the Bank's suggestions. Just to cite one example,
the Colombian rules state that each contract has to be filed separately; the document must not
have separators or clips; it must be organized according to logical, chronological and sequential
criteria, whereby chronological order is paramount; the folios must be arranged in the form of a
book, that is to say, when one opens the folder, the first page must be the application that
triggered the whole process and the last page must show the current status of the matter in
question. Accordingly, it would be best for the Bank to adjust its own policies to these.

The technical assistance provided during the final stage of project implementation was timely and
of high quality. It was rendered in an atmosphere of trust and credibility which made it possible to
conclude the project and furthermore, in record time (less than 10 months), prepare and negotiate
a second project entailing considerable innovation both within the Bank and in Colombia. In the
missions that simultaneously prepared the second operation while supervising the project being
executed, the latter benefited from the training and assistance imparted to technical teams in the
various dependencies of ICETEX on state-of-the-art matters.

With respect to procurement, the Bank's recommendations were practical, constructive and direct.
The last independent review was impaired by the auditor's lack of time. He was forced to rush
through the basic consultation phase, which made it impossible to interact in an appropriate
fashion with the executor to request further information where necessary. This lack of
consultation was reflected in certain not-exactly-accurate views expressed by the reviewer. He
admitted having obviated the condition precedent to the project regarding volume of procurement.
With it, he would have been able to gain a better idea of the real scope of his visit, particularly on
the need to fly to nearby territories to inspect the actual physical state of the assets acquired using
project funds, especially under component 2. In any case, the difficulty was overcome
pragmatically by requesting photographs over the Internet, even though it must be said that field
visits are still preferable.

The loans disbursement process was efficient, with funds always being available to carry out each
component of the project. That facilitated, in particular, the achievement of student loan targets.
The World Bank disbursed 99.9 percent of the total loan, thanks in large part to the always
excellent coordination between ICETEX, as the entity directly in charge of the process, and the
Ministry of Finance through the Directorate of Public Credit and the Treasury. It is worth
mentioning that the use of advances facilitated timely receipt of funds, given that the World
Bank's procedure for approval and transfer always took less time than the reimbursement method.
