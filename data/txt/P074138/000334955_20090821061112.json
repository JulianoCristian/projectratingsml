follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the importance of including baselines and\n            targets in the official project documents cannot be\n            overemphasized. It is a mechanism to ensure the project is\n            directed towards reaching its outcomes since the beginning\n            of implementation. In the project, neither baselines nor\n            targets were officially formalized in the project appraisal\n            document (PAD). While it did not prevent the project from\n            reaching its development objectives given the strong\n            performance on key indicators, it might have prevented it\n            from having a more robust account of achievements. A strong\n            leadership is a key lever to bringing about institutional\n            change. This is particularly true when the leadership is\n            able to promote a results-oriented culture where outputs and\n            outcomes are measured and quantitative targets are\n            established to drive organizational change. The vision,\n            dedication and hard work of the leadership under this\n            project have been instrumental to achieving results. Impact\n            evaluations designed early-on in the project can avoid\n            selection bias and provide more reliable estimates of\n            program impact. One of the lessons learned derived from this\n            project is the need to define, at project launch, a relevant\n            set of impact evaluation interventions covering all relevant\n            components, as it occurred early on in the implementation of\n            this project."}, "docdt": "2009-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
