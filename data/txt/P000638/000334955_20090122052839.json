This Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was\n            due largely to the decline in world prices and in\n            production. The mid-term evaluation noted that the\n            projection of area to be rehabilitated was over-optimistic.\n            Notwithstanding the overall economic performance, the\n            project was overall successful in meeting the first two\n            objectives of the project: (a) alleviate the constraints\n            impeding the increased production of cocoa and (b) establish\n            the infrastructure to maintain the momentum of development\n            in the future. The project was, however, only partially\n            successful in meeting the third objective, i.e. increase\n            cocoa production in the project area and improve quality\n            control of cocoa beans. While the project was successful in\n            improving the quality control of cocoa beans, the production\n            targets at appraisal were not met because of overoptimistic\n            projections concerning size of holdings and number of\n            participating farmers."}, "docdt": "1992-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
