The performances of both the Bank and\n            the Borrower are rated as satisfactory. Among the lessons\n            noted are: 1) The Bank is well positioned to respond to\n            similar emergencies in the future. 2) The Bank can play an\n            active role to assist countries in meeting established and\n            evolving regulatory standards. 3) There can be significant\n            advantages to implementing multi-country programs through a\n            regional entity. 4) Regional procurement can bring important\n            cost-benefits. 5) Emergency projects benefit from close supervision."}, "docdt": "2006-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
