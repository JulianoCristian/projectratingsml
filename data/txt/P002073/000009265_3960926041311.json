      FHD's (Federal Highway Department) highway sector\n            program over the 1981-91 period. The aims of the program are\n            to protect the existing road assets with a realistic\n            rehabilitation program tailored to available resources, to\n            carry out an appropriate maintenance program, and improve\n            efficiency and cost effectiveness. The loan will finance 33%\n            of FHD's capital works program, about 65% of the cost\n            of specialized equipment for road inventory and data\n            processing, and spare parts. Finally, the loan will provide\n            70% of the cost of consulting services to support and\n            strengthen FHD's implementation capacity."}, "docdt": "1988-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
