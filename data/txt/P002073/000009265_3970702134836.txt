MFAMORANDUtM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPHENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$250 MILLION EQUIVALENT
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A HIGHWAY SECTOR LOAN
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$250 million equivalent is
submitted for approval.  The proposed loan would be repayable over 20
years, including five years' grace.  Interest on the loan would be at
the standard variable rate.   The loan would help finance Nigeria's
1989-91 Federal Highway Program.
2.        Background.  Following massive road investments over the past
decade, Nigeria has a basic road network consisting of 28,000 km of
federal roads, 30,000 km of state roads and 60,000 km of local govern-
ment council roads.    The Government's policy has been to obtain a
maximum length of new roads at minimum unit cost by constructing light
pavements. Rehabilitation and strengthening of many of these pavements
are now urgently needed.  The poor state of many roads is having a
negative effect on the economy by making it difficult for manufacturers,
traders and farmers to fully exploit opportunities created by the new
policy environment.
3.        Major objectives of the transportation sector are to increase
efficiency of services, to price these services appropriately and to
strengthen the sector's institutional framework. During the last two
years, significant policy and institutional improvements have been
introduced. First, the Government eliminated heavy subsidies on fuel
prices by increasing the prices for gasoline, diesel oil and fuel oil by
100%, L70%, and 2502, respectively in January 1986. The devaluation of
the Naira in September 1986 effectively lowered pump prices in dollar
terms requiring further adjustments. On April 11, 1988, the government
announced increases in prices for different types of fuel with a
weighted average increase of 33% which eliminated about 15 to 20% of the
economic subsidy. This is to be followed by further adjustments in fuel
prices to eliminate the subsidy. Second, the publicly owned and highly
subsidized National Freight Company has been wound up, and surplus
personnel of, and subsidies to, transport parastatals are being reduced.
4.        Rationale  for Bank  Involvement.   A high priority  of  the
Federal Government is to rehabilitate and maintain the main highway
system in Nigeria.   Sustainability,  however, requires  improving the
institutional and policy framework in addition to strengthening and
upgrading  the  physical  infrastructure.       The  Bank  supports  the
reorientation of HRD's operations and practices in order to address
FHD's principal operational and institutional weaknesses, and to
increase the cost effectiveness of its operations.   To help address the
financial situation of the Government, the proposed loan would provide
assistance to alleviate the acute shortage of foreign exchange with
relatively rapid disbursements on rehabilitation works.  The proposed
loan also complements the Transport Parastatal Project (Loan 2734-UNI of



-2-
June 1986), and other sector and macro-economic objectives of the
Government.
5.        Project Objectives.  The general objective of the project is
to support FHD s 1989-91 Federal Highway Program. The objectives of PHD
are to define and execute an appropriate and sustainable program of
rehabilitation, upgrading and maintenance, to improve operational
efficiency and cost effectiveness, and to improve road safety.
Institutionally,   these   objectives   call   for  major   policy   and
institutional improvements including: (a) a reorientation from new
construction to rehabilitation, strengthening and routine maintenance;
(b) improved planning of proposed construction works including carrying
out economic analyses; (c) systematic preparation of detailed designs
rbsulting in an enhanced procurement system; (d) emphasis on adequate
supervision of road construction works; (e) an improved road user tax
system to recover from road users recurrent expenditures on Federal
Highways; (f) road safety improvements; and (g) the introduction of a
continuing education program for FHD engineers.
6.        Project Description.  The Federal Highway Program of civil
works covers: (a) the completion of ongoing contracts; (b) annual
programs for rehabilitation and pavement strengthening; (c) a limited
amount of new construction; and (d) routine maintenance of 23,000 km by
contract, and 5,000 km by force account.  Bank participation in civil
works includes a limited amount of item (a) under advance contracting,
and items (b) and (c).  Item (d) is fully financed from the recurrent
budget.  The Bank would also finance some specialized equipment and
spare parts, and consulting services to assist with institutional
development as well as the design and supervision of civil works
execution.
7.        The  total Program would  cost US$955.4 million  equivalent,
including US$718.0 million capital and US$237.4 million recurrent costs.
The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$622.5 million or 65%.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations
in Nigeria are given in Schedules C and D respectively. Staff Appraisal
Report  No. 6326-UNI  dated  April  21,  1988,  is  being  circulated
separately.
B.        Agreed  Actions.   Agreements  reached  during  negotiations
include: (a) preparation by September 1, 1989 of a plan of action to
recover at least recurrent costs of Federal Highways and implementation
by January 1, 1990, of the agreed system of road user charges; (b)
maintenance of a minimum of 15% of the annual federal capital
expenditure allocations to the transport sector during 1989-1991 with
annual expenditure allocations of 80% of that amount to the federal
highway  sub-sector;   (c)  maintenance  of  FHD's  annual  recurrent
expenditure allocations at a sufficient level to cover routine
maintenance of the Federal Highway Network; (d) preparation by April 1,
1989 of detailed designs and economic analyses for the second year of
the project; (e) by March 31, 1989 deposit initial amounts required for
fiscal year 1989 and thereafter replenish accounts with required amounts
not later than three weeks from the beginning of each subsequent
quarter; (f) implementation of changes to accounting procedures and



-3-
practices after an exchange of views with the Bank and not later than
April 1, 1989; (g) as conditions of loan effectiveness employment of
qualified engineers to supervise FHD's civil works program during the
first year of the project, and opening of two project accounts for
capital and recurrent expenditures respectively; and (h) as conditions
of disbursement exchange views annually with the Bank on progress
achieved and compliance with special action programs, the reviews would
he based on a prior report submitted to the Bank for its comments.
9.        Benefits.  The principal benefits would be savings in vehicle
operating costs, which are currently preventing producers from fully
exploiting the opportunities of the Government's economic recovery
program.  Additional benefits would be derived from savings in costs of
road maintenance, from reduced level of accidents as a result of road
safety measures, and from a general increase in efficiency and
effectiveness in highway planuing, design, maintenance and management as
a result of EHD's institutional strengthening and training. The minimum
acceptable  ERR  for  construction,  rehabilitation  and  maintenance
sub-projects in the Program is 12%, with most sub-projects expected to
have ERRs in excess of 35%.
10.       Risks.  No physical risks or adverse ecological effects are
expected from the Program. One risk to the Program is that, if world
oil prices decline further, or if inflation accelerates, further
reductions in road transport investments may be required, which would
delay expected benefits. To reduce this risk, FHD will schedule road
works so as to complete short segments which can be made fully
operational.
11.       There is a risk of not fully attaining the institutional
development objectives for FHD.  However, the Government has demon-
strated considerable commitment toward the full Program implementation
and it is expected that this impetus will be continued throughout the
Program. In addition, satisfactory action on the agreed Program for
each year will be a condition for Bank funding of sub-projects for each
subsequent year.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
