Bank performance\n            is rated unsatisfactory because the Bank misjudged the depth\n            of the political crisis, wrongly interpreted the\n            Government's declaration for reforms as true\n            commitment, and overlooked the lack of commitment within the\n            administration. Borrower performance is rated highly\n            unsatisfactory. The outcome of the Public Sector Adjustment\n            Credit Project is rated moderately satisfactory and project\n            sustainability is unlikely because there was not enough time\n            before the April 1999 coup to fully internalize improvements\n            in a sustainable manner. Bank and Borrower performance is\n            rated satisfactory. The ratings for the Public Finance\n            Reform Credit are satisfactory outcome, satisfactory Bank\n            performance, and unsatisfactory Borrower performance.\n            Sustainability is highly unlikely because of the objectives\n            that were achieved, in the case of the civil service reform,\n            some positive measures taken under the PSAC were reversed,\n            For the Public Finance Recovery Credit, the original ratings\n            of satisfactory outcome, likely sustainability, and\n            satisfacotry performance for both the Bank and the Borrower\n            are confirmed. The main lessons are: 1) Except for the\n            obvious sine qua non condition of political stability,\n            Government commitment is insufficient to ensure\n            success--support within the administration and better\n            communication between the Government and civil society are\n            also necessary. 2) In countries with a large informal sector\n            and a low tax base, the Bank and the International Monetary\n            Fund should explore ways to adapt taxation to the\n            particularities of the country, for instance through modest\n            taxation of the agricultural sector. 3) Addressing the\n            problem of very weak institutional capacity cannot be\n            limited to a piecemeal approach via different operations but\n            requires a full-fledged medium-term strategy agreed with the\n            authorities, targeted at least at the central ministries,\n            and combined with a monitoring and evaluation system in the\n            country. 4) In countries having very limited resources,\n            devaluation unaccompanied by longer-term investment and\n            institutional support of the few existing productive sectors\n            is unlikely to generate a lasting supply response, even if\n            macroeconomic policies are sound, 5) Adjustment operations\n            must include a domestic monitoring and evaluation mechanism\n            to enable senior officials to assess progress and initiate\n            corrective actions. 6) Single tranche operations justified\n            by the contention that future lending will depend on\n            continued performance do not guarantee good performance."}, "docdt": "2003-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
