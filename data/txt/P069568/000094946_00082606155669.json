Project for Niger is a single-tranche operation which will\n            help sustain the government's financial stabilization\n            and fiscal management effort and compensate for the tariff\n            revenue shortfall caused by the implementation of the trade\n            liberalization program of the West Africa Economic and\n            Monetary Union (WAEMU). The credit falls within the\n            framework of the government's medium-term development\n            program aimed at stimulating economic growth and reducing\n            poverty through 1) macroeconomic and fiscal stabilization,\n            and 2) structural and sector-wide reforms mainly focusing on\n            improving the delivery of social services delivery, trade\n            promotion and formal private private sector activity, and\n            the development of the rural economy. Successful\n            implementation of the reform program and of the upcoming\n            Poverty Reduction Growth Facility should provide substantial\n            benefits in terms of macroeconomic and financial\n            stabilization, and the efficiency of fiscal management. The\n            credit assists the Government to further reinforce its\n            credibility and that of the reform program, as well as\n            facilitate consensus building around the proposed measures.\n            Although the project is at high risk due to political and\n            social instability, the incapacity to mobilize external\n            resources, the realization of a low-case macroeconomic\n            scenario, and weak implementation capacity, the\n            credit's potential benefits are expected to outweigh\n            these risks."}, "docdt": "2000-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
