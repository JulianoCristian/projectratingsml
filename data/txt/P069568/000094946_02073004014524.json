"The Public Finance Recovery\n            Credit's outcome is rated as satisfactory,\n            sustainability as likely, institutional development impact\n            as modest, Bank performance as satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance as satisfactory. The main exogenous factor which\n            affected the implementation and therefore the outcome of\n            this operation is the shortage of external financing during\n            the period of 2002 and 2001, which resulted in episodes of\n            cash rationing and diverted attention away from structural\n            reform implementation. On the one hand, the medium-term\n            policy framework supported by such operations need to be as\n            comprehensive as possible. On the other hand, evaluation of\n            past adjustment operations for Niger and other countries has\n            shown that an abundance of conditionalities have been a\n            cause of unsatisfactory outcomes. The lesson learned is that\n            in an emergency or recovery environment, adjustment support\n            should be anchored in a medium-term framework. There may be\n            occasions where the Bank must take calculated risk in\n            providing a timely response to client need, but this can\n            only occur on the basis of close work with the IMF\n            beforehand and with Fund endorsement. Even when time does\n            not permit the formulation of a parallel TA operation, there\n            is potential for capacity building activities through the\n            client's commitment of some of his own resources to\n            that purpose, even if only to jump start activities in\n            anticipation of subsequent external support."}, "docdt": "2002-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
