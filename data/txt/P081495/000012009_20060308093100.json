Despite a well designed\n            program, with necessary and feasible policy actions, the\n            project had to be cancelled due to implementation\n            restrictions in areas not expected during preparation.\n            Lessons suggest the following. When cross-linking\n            conditionalities between different development policy loans,\n            it is not only important to evaluate the financial\n            leveraging impact, but also the potential problems that may\n            arise if reforms move at different speeds. Furthermore, the\n            solid prior understanding of the sectors involved in the\n            operation facilitates the preparation and achievements of\n            the Program. Continuous dialogue with official counterparts\n            and independent analysts, simplified the team's work\n            during preparation, as the main sectors and policies to be\n            supported were clearly identified. Finally, the close and\n            frequent supervision increased sustainability of programs,\n            in spite of the crisis period and government changes.\n            Despite the difficult economic and social situation in\n            Uruguay, and the frequent changes of ministers and staff,\n            the proactive supervision and sustained dialogue with the\n            Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and sector authorities\n            facilitated the support of the program by all counterparts."}, "docdt": "2006-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
