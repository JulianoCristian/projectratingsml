would help\n            alleviate the constraints to increased production of cereals\n            and livestock products in Northwest Tunisia.  It would\n            achieve this by strengthening extension and research in the\n            area, and improving supportive infrastructure.  The project\n            would have an import substitution impact and increase farm\n            incomes.  The project would consist of provision of\n            extension, research and livestock services, farm machinery\n            testing, rural roads upgrading, project management,\n            training, technical assistance, studies and credit for\n            on-farm investments, seasonal inputs and input resale\n            centers.  The project would raise the incomes of about 4,500\n            farmers and 24 production cooperatives.  The risk that\n            farmers might adopt the new project technology more slowly\n            than expected is minimized by projection of realistic\n            adoption rates and by ensuring the adequacy of incentives\n            and the availability of inputs on credit."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
