1.       Introductory Statement

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Country Director: (a) to extend for one year
(from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010) the Closing Date of the IDA Credit (No. 3752-
VN) for the Vietnam Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children Project (P044803); (b) to
reallocate part of the proceeds across expenditure categories under the Credit; (c) to cancel a
portion of the Credit; and (d) to make associated amendments to the Development Credit
Agreement.

2.      The proposed reallocation of the Credit proceeds would finance the costs associated with
continuing activities currently financed by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) (TF051873) and
enhance the impact of these well-performing components of the Project. In particular, the IDA
funds would enable the continuing delivery of a package of support for primary education in
order to ensure a Fundamental School Quality Level (FSQL) is reached at all main and satellite
schools in 226 districts in the Project's 40 target provinces.

3.     This extension of existing activities for a further year in the Project districts can be
expected to contribute to increasing primary education enrollment and completion and to
improving learning achievement in disadvantaged communities, as well as for specific highly
vulnerable groups such as children living with a disability.

4.      Further, the proposed changes would allow full transfer of the Project's innovative
interventions into day-to-day Government (GOV) processes and procedures, allow for nation-
wide expansion and implementation, facilitate a smooth transition and ensure full sustainability
in the long term.

2.       Background
5.     The Project is financed in part by a US$138.89 million equivalent Credit and a US$70.35
million equivalent MTDF. The Credit was approved by the Executive Directors on May 6, 2003
and became effective on October 10, 2003. The current Closing Date of the Credit is December
31, 2009.

6.       The goal of the Project is to support the GOV's overall commitment to universal high
quality basic Education for All (EFA) and the project development objective (PDO) is to
improve access to primary school and the quality of education for disadvantaged boys and girls.
Disadvantaged children are broadly defined as (a) school-age children who are not enrolled or
are at risk of not completing their primary education; (b) children who attend schools that do not
meet fundamental standards; and (c) disabled children or children from other highly vulnerable
groups. The Project is the only large operation that focuses on these last 10 percent of children,
on ethnic minorities, and on remote and poor rural areas [i.e., on the truly disadvantaged].

7.       The Project has four parts:
     ·   Part A: Fundamental School Quality Level. A program to enable primary schools in
         selected districts in the Project Provinces to achieve a fundamental level of school
         quality.

                                                 1
        ·      Part B: Education Initiatives for Highly Vulnerable Children. Programs to promote
               inclusive education (IE) for disabled children and other vulnerable groups of children
               such as street children, working children, children of migrant families and children in
               very isolated communities.

        ·      Part C: Institutional Development and Project Implementation Support. A program to
               strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET), the provincial
               Departments of Education and Training (DoETs) and the district Bureaus of Education
               and Training (BoETs) to implement, manage, coordinate and monitor all Project
               activities and to ensure the implementation of FSQL.

        ·      Part D: Project Management. A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to oversee and manage
               the Project.

   8.      Project performance to date has been good for the components related to policy
   development, capacity building, improvement of teaching and learning, and community
   participation. However, performance has been mixed for the sub-component related to
   improving the physical infrastructure of schools, often because of difficulties beyond the control
   of the Project. Overall, the Project is having a positive effect in helping to narrow the gap
   between advantaged and disadvantaged groups in the provision of education services.

   9.       As the table below shows, at the beginning of the Project less than half the schools in the
   Project area met FSQL standards. After four years of implementation, the proportion of schools
   meeting FSQL standards has increased to 81.3 percent. This growth rate is nearly double the
   national average and more than double the growth rate of the districts not in the Project but in the
   same target provinces. This figure demonstrates the effectiveness of the Project in helping to
   achieve FSQL and better environments for learning for disadvantaged primary schools in target
   districts.

10.       The results of the quantitative performance indicators are also positive:
      ·   Primary net enrolment has improved from 81% in 1999 to 97% in 2008. The original
          goal of 96% by 2009 has therefore been met and surpassed.
      ·   Primary student completion (as measured by the G5/G1 ratio) has increased from 72% in
          1999 to 91% in 2008. The original goal of 86% by 2009 has therefore been met and
          surpassed.
      ·   Primary repetition has fallen from 8% in 1999 to 4% in 2008. The goal is less than 3%
          by 2009, and is expected to be met following the current trend.
      ·   Primary school drop-out has been reduced from 12% in 1999 to 1% in 2008. The
          original goal of less than 4% by 2009 has therefore been met and surpassed.

11.     In terms of learning, the goal was that student achievement, as measured by Grade 5 tests
in mathematics and Vietnamese, would show an upward trend. In 2001, the proportion of
students nationally reaching the `Independent learning' benchmark was 79.9% (mathematics)
and 51.3% (Vietnamese) and in 2007 it was 74.1% (mathematics) and 70.8% (Vietnamese): a
small, but not significant, decrease for Math and a significant increase for Vietnamese. 1
However, a closer analysis by ethnicity shows that: (a) in 2001 the Kinh were well ahead of non-
Kinh; and (b) by 2007 both groups had improved but the gap had widened and the Kinh had
moved markedly further ahead of the non-Kinh, particularly in mathematics. A sample of
project beneficiary schools showed that they had made slightly better progress than for the nation
as a whole. This demonstrates the value of fine-grained analyses and specifically targeted
operations such as this Project.

12.     The Project has employed innovative interventions shown to effect change such as setting
standards, using those standards for targeted, needs-based allocation of funds, decentralization of
responsibility, community participation, in-service teacher training, inclusive education and early
intervention. As well as internal monitoring; surveys and the annual District FSQL Audit
(DFA), there have now been seven external evaluations 2 of specific Project interventions, all
showing positive results. In particular, the Mid-term Report of the Longitudinal Study on
Teaching Assistants (TAs) and School Readiness (SR) programs shows very promising findings
and the value of this intervention 3. The main findings corroborate earlier evidence that students
in classes with a TA attend more regularly and achieve better results in mathematics and
Vietnamese language than those students in similar classes without a TA. SR clearly has a
positive effect on the learning of ethnic minority students in Grade 1. For example, the two
charts below on reading skills (left) and mathematics (right) show that ethnic students attending
SR class (yellow bar) do better than students not attending SR classes (black bar) when assessed
at the end of the first semester of Grade 1, 2008.

13.    Further, the Project is proving to be an important instrument for influencing good
education policy in Vietnam (e.g., FSQL has become national policy, not only for primary
education but for other sub-sectors (Secondary and ECD so far)), and is being used as the
springboard for other operations such as the School Education Quality Assurance Project.

3.     Reasons for Changes
14.    There are four main reasons for requesting an extension of one year and the reallocation
of funds.

15.    First, through the Project, many interesting innovations have been introduced that fit with
the GOV policies of decentralized funding and management. They have captured the interest of
GOV, which has a sincere wish for them to continue, to be mainstreamed, and to go nation-wide.
In an unusual and forward-looking move, a decision has already been made on the framework
needed and the overall approach to be taken (Decision #1068/QD-BGDDT 23/02/09), and eight
sub-committees led by the appropriate technical departments of MoET have been set up
(Decision # 3170/QD-BGDDT 27/04/09) to ensure the sustainability of these critical
interventions, which provide successful models for all to see:


                                                         4
   ·   TAs for schools with children from different ethnic groups;
   ·   In-service training programs for teachers and managers;
   ·   FSQL implementation, and integration into GOV's Education Management Information
       Systems (EMIS);
   ·   Inclusive Education policy implementation;
   ·   Inclusive Education exemplary services piloted in three districts;
   ·   Budget and community support for schools with disadvantaged children;
   ·   Educational Initiatives (grants for innovative approaches to disadvantaged communities);
       and
   ·   Maintenance of school buildings by local communities.

16.     However, this can only be accomplished through the 2011 budget round. Most of the
regulatory reform documents are being prepared but, due to the timing of the GOV financial year
(January-December), this will not be completed in time to incorporate these initiatives into the
2010 budget round. `Bridging finance' is therefore needed. Another year of implementation will
allow the GOV the opportunity to estimate the costs the interventions fully and to include the
new programs in the Budget round for 2011. Further, Norway was unable to make its full
payment of NOK 25.8 million (approximately US$3 million) that it had committed to the MDTF.
This has produced a significant shortfall and means that some successful components may not
now be fully implemented. An extension and reallocation would fund this shortfall and support
the eight sub-committees which are working to bed-in Project innovations to day-to-day GOV
processes and procedures and to ensure a smooth transition to national implementation.

17.     This reallocation would correspond to 6.3 percent of the original Credit amount in order
to continue to finance the `soft' successful components of the Project and ensure that they are
sustained. Funds could be easily and quickly disbursed to the provinces through efficient
existing mechanisms and the FSQL grant for the 2010 school year. If this `bridging' is not done,
there is a risk that the achievements of the Project will collapse and not be sustained as key
personnel will have been lost [e.g., 7,000 TAs who run School Readiness programs for 110,000
children; and District Community Development Specialists who support 18,000 Parent Teacher
Associations (PTAs) to use the Campus Support Funds wisely and well].

18.     Second, the `hard' infrastructure component funded through the Credit has experienced
slow, bureaucratic and lengthy procedures, a weak economic climate and increasing unit costs,
low capacity and/or unavailability of local contractors, inaccessible and difficult sites, and
natural disasters (weather, floods, etc). The GOV now has improved capacity and a number of
programs actively building new schools in poor and remote communities (e.g., the Program for
Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in Ethnic Minority and
Mountainous Areas [P-135], the Education National Targeted Program [ENTP] and the School
Concretization Program). In a volatile economic climate, it makes sense for the GOV to pursue
the infrastructure investments as they can move more swiftly to deal directly with any
bureaucratic issues and fiscal risks. This will lead to improvement of portfolio implementation,
including, but not limited to, improving disbursement.

19.    Third, the `soft' components of the Project funded through the MDTF have achieved very
good results in terms of increased enrolment, attendance and retention, a reduced drop-out rate,

                                                5
improved learning, increased in-service training, increased community participation,
decentralized responsibility, and improved FSQLs in the 226 target districts. Partnership and co-
financing arrangements have been successful through the MDTF. Improving quality has been
the focus and the donor partners (Canada, Norway, Australia and the UK) are enthusiastic about
the results achieved; the possibility of extension; and a firm `bedding in' of the innovative
Project interventions to fully ensure future sustainability.

20.     Fourth, despite the positive results to date, the gap is widening between Kinh and non-
Kinh, urban and rural, and rich and poor provinces in Vietnam. More and rigorous targeting will
be needed in the short and long term to effect real change. The GOV has therefore proposed that
the Project be extended for another year and unused IDA funds (realised from use of the GOV
concretization program as counterpart funds, the weak dollar and exchange rate gains, and the
efficient use of competitive processes through ICB and NCB) be channelled into the successful
Project areas.

4.      Proposed Changes

21.     Neither the PDO nor the design would change as the result of the proposed extension and
reallocation. However, the scope of the project would be enhanced in the following ways:

     a) Through reducing the Project's infrastructure component and allowing GOV initiatives to
        meet school building needs in the future through its own programs [such as the
        Concretization program; ENTP; and P-135].

     b) By funding the components of the Project currently funded by MDTF for another year
        through a reallocation of the proceeds of the Credit, thereby providing bridging
        mechanisms for the successful innovative interventions [e.g., FSQLGrants, including the
        DFA, training programs for community participation, small amount of instructional
        materials, school consumable, in-service teacher training, the TAs and IE initiatives to be
        fully integrated into the government's system].

     c) The change will include the cancellation of US$5 million (equivalent SDR3,121,645) from
        the Credit, the result of: (i) the gains from the SDR exchange rate changes; and (ii) the
        weak absorptive capacity of Project provinces for the remaining time of implementation.

22.    It is expected that this will positively affect Project outcomes through using `lessons
learned' and `what works' and building further on these successes. There are no complementary
changes required to the institutional arrangements, financial management or procurement
procedures as these have all been developed and modified over the life of the Project, they are
working efficiently, and regular internal and external audits have produced unqualified audits
with no major issues. The handover and transition will be managed by the eight sustainability
sub-committees which are being led by the appropriate technical departments of MoET and are
making steady progress.

23.  With regard to the financing mechanism/conduit, this will not change. However, the
MDTF Grant will close as planned on December 31, 2009 and those outputs will be picked up by


                                                 6
the proposed reallocations within the IDA Credit. The Task Team reviewed the Project's 2010
Implementation Plan and suggested the cancellation of US$5 million (equivalent to
SDR3,121,645) which was agreed by the Borrower and approved by the CD.

24.     The project costs and financing plan are outlined in the summary table below. The
disbursement arrangements will all be within the IDA Credit and will: (a) reduce the amount
allocated to civil works and school furniture; and (b) add four extra categories in order to fund
those activities previously funded by the MDTF Grant. 4

5.     Analysis

26.    The proposed changes that the extension and reallocation would support are fully
consistent with the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The PDO is squarely in line
with the second pillar of the 2006-2010 CPS: "Strengthen Social Inclusion, by enhancing human
resources, assets and opportunities for the poor and vulnerable". Extended Project activities will
continue to contribute to the CPS key education outcome of "better access to and use of
affordable quality basic education for all children".

27.     The proposed changes do not alter the environmental category (currently C) of the project
or trigger new safeguard policies. The proposed changes do not involve any exceptions to Bank
policies.

6.     Expected Outcomes

28.     The proposed changes will not affect the PDO and no new indicators are required. It is
expected that outcome targets and outcome indicators will improve further. However, the main
purpose of the proposed extension and reallocation of funds is to meet the GOV's wish of
attaining full, long-term sustainability of the Project's successful components.

7.     Benefits and Risks

29.    No additional risks have been identified with the extension of activities and reallocation
of funds that could jeopardize the achievement of the PDO.

30.      The main risk is that, if the Project is not extended, sustainability could be threatened.
The Project's innovative, decentralized, flexible and `bottom-up' approach is not the norm in
Vietnam. To mitigate the risk and to ensure the acceptance, integration and national
institutionalization of the ideas and interventions, more time and technical support is needed.
The proposed extension and reallocation of funds would provide that.
