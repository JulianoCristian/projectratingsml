Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures

intervals as the Administrator shall specify. 
 
(ii) 
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Recipient shall furnish to

Administrator shall, on behalf of the Recipient, withdraw from the Multi-

at such time as the Administrator shall reasonably request, furnish to the Administrator such 
documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures. 
 
5. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Administrator shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

Conditions; or

once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Multi-donor Trust Fund Grant 
allocated to the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special 
commitments entered into by the Administrator pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the 
Authorized Allocation. 
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Multi-donor Trust Fund Grant Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Multi-donor Trust Fund Grant allocated to the eligible Categories 
shall follow such procedures as the Administrator shall specify by notice to the Recipient.  Such 
further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Administrator shall have 
been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of 
such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

(a) 
If the Administrator shall have determined at any time that any payment out of

Administrator, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the Administrator:  (A) provide 
such additional evidence as the Administrator may request; or (B) deposit into the Special 
Account (or, if the Administrator shall so request, refund to the Administrator) an amount equal 
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.  Unless the 
Administrator shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Administrator into the Special 
Account shall be made until the Recipient has provided such evidence or made such deposit or 
refund, as the case may be. 
 
(b) 
If the Administrator shall have determined at any time that any amount 
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the Administrator, refund to the 
Administrator such outstanding amount. 
 
(c) 
The Recipient may, upon notice to the Administrator, refund to the Administrator 
all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
