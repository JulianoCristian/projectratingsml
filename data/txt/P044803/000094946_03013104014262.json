Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children Project\n            identifies ethnic minority issues, summarized as\n            difficulties in accessing education due to long distances,\n            or late enrollments; persistent incomplete schooling due to\n            high costs, or non-supportive environment to attend school,\n            namely, sibling care in ethnic minority areas, or child\n            labor demands; and, low performance quality resulting from\n            non-supportive instructional environments, lack of\n            instructional materials, and a highly condensed curriculum.\n            Through project interventions, this IPP stipulates measures\n            to involve ethnic minorities in attending schools, and\n            participating in the educational achievements. Community\n            mobilization will prod school attendance, and foster\n            community training to improve school enrollment at the\n            district level, by supporting the provision of free\n            textbooks and supplies, supporting Vietnamese language\n            readiness programs, and improving training of local\n            teachers, in addition to quality improvements at satellite\n            schools, which should result in enhanced educational quality\n            between main campuses and satellite schools. Direct\n            educational costs should be alleviated through fee waivers\n            for books, and supplies, as well as community-supported\n            language-readiness pre-schooling should ease the burden of\n            sibling care, or child labor difficulties. Finally, the\n            national curriculum standards should be evenly applied, but\n            be relevant, and culturally appropriate to ethnic\n            minorities, in accord with educational materials."}, "docdt": "2003-01-24T22:29:02Z"}
