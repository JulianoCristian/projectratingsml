                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to improve access to primary school and the quality of education for disadvantaged girls and boys. Disadvantaged children are
                         broadly defined as school-aged children who are not enrolled or are at risk of not completing their primary education; children who attend schools that do no
                         meet fundamental quality standards; and disabled children or children from other highly vulnerable groups, such as street children, migrant children or girls in
                         certain ethnic minority areas.
