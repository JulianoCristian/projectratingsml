    for Disadvantaged Children Project for Vietnam is to improve\n            access to primary school and the quality of education for\n            disadvantaged girls and boys. Disadvantaged children are\n            broadly defined as school-aged children who are not enrolled\n            or are at-risk of not completing their primary education;\n            children who attend schools thatdo not meet fundamental\n            quality standards; and disabled children or children from\n            other highly vulnerable groups, such as street children,\n            migrant children, or girls in certain ethnic minority areas.\n            There are three project components beside the project\n            management component. The first component raises all schools\n            in the 189 most disadvantaged targeted districts to a\n            fundamental school quality level (FSQL) through a\n            two-pronged approach: 1) it provides necessary support to\n            district administration to improve planning, management, and\n            monitoring capabilities; and 2) it enhances school capacity\n            to provide effective instruction at poorly resourced\n            satellite campuses. Specifically, the component strengthens\n            district school data collection systems; supports the\n            development of a district-wide FSQL action plan; procures a\n            teacher's guide, materials, and training modules;\n            provides workshops; places teacher assistants; upgrades\n            infrastructure; and strengthens parents' associations,\n            among other activities. The second component prsents\n            interventions that address the educational needs of disabled\n            children; and addresses the educational needs of vulnerable\n            groups, such as street and working children, children living\n            in fishing communities, and others. The third component\n            assists the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) to lay\n            down a pathway for reaching national school standards by\n            using FSQL as a first step. It will propose FSQL criteria\n            and raise awareness at all levels of the education system\n            about how to bring every school up to FSQL levels."}, "docdt": "2003-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
