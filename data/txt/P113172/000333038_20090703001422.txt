environment into economic growth through Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA),
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and development of a climate change strategy.

3. Rationale and Links to the Government's 5 year Program. The programmatic DPO
continue to address governance issues in the forestry and mining sectors and improve
environmental management. Currently forestry, wildlife and mining are key to Ghana`s economy
and share common challenges, including revenues that are not well captured and large numbers
of people dependent on the sector for their livelihood. In addition, environmental policy (via the
Environmental Protection Agency, EPA) needs to be strengthened to effectively control
pollution, and to reduce long-term negative health and economic impacts due to environmental
degradation and climate change. Ghana has recognized the need to address these important
issues. The 2006-2009 Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) has the overarching
goals of sustaining economic growth of at least 6 percent per year to attain middle-income
country status and surpass the 2015 Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty levels to
26 percent of the population and reducing inequalities.

4. The GPRS II has three distinct pillars--private sector competitiveness, human resource
development, and good governance and civic responsibility--with priorities for environmental
management identified through a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The DPO focuses
on supporting the Government`s plans to invest in demand and supply-side approaches to
improve governance in the natural resources sector and specifically target improved revenue
management, financial flows and livelihoods in the forestry, wildlife and mining sub-sectors.
The DPO will support GOG actions that will create complementary funding facilities for
expanded civil society engagement in natural resources governance.

5. Long-Term Development Plan. A draft Long-Term Development Plan 2009-2015` was
tabled in June 2008, but its orientations are still to be confirmed by the new administration,
which took office in February 2009. Environment and natural resources continue as elements
within wider national objectives on growth. No major change in strategic direction is foreseen, as

                                                 1

the Plan is expected to remain centered on the objective of Ghana becoming a middle-income
country and reaching all MDGs by 2015. The use of oil revenue constitutes a new factor to be
considered in this planning perspective.

6. Expected Outcomes. The expected outcomes at the end of the DPO series include: (a)
improved management of government revenues and finances in the forestry and mining sectors;
(b) reduced illegal logging; (c) reduced social conflict in forestry and mining communities; and
(d) integration of environmental considerations into policy formulation and implementation
across government, including risks associated with climate change. (See Annex 3 for details on
the expected outcomes and associated indicators).

7. Development Partnership Arrangements: A Framework Memorandum of Understanding
(Annex 4) signed by GOG and participating Development Partners (DPs) --Agence Française de
Développement (AFD), the United Kingdom`s Department for International Development
(DFID), the European Commission (EC), the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in
Ghana (EKN), and IDA--guides the GOG/DP collaboration in support of the NREG program.1
The Framework Memorandum sets out the process for joint agreement and assessment of a three-
year rolling PAF and outlines a review process that is aligned with the broader multi-donor
budget support (MDBS) program.

                                       II      COUNTRY CONTEXT


                  A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS


8. In 2008, GDP growth continued unabated, in spite of global commodity inflation. Real
GDP growth was 7.3 percent in 2008 (4.6 percent in per capita terms). This growth was
attributable to a large surge in exports receipts (+26 percent in US$ terms) and sustained public
and private domestic demand for consumption and investment goods and services. Private
demand was notably fuelled by rapid credit expansion (+26 percent in real terms), following
trends of previous years.2 Positive terms of trade (+5 percent) and temporary tax exemptions on
fuel and food in 2008 limited the impact of global commodity inflation on economic activity and
household welfare. Economic growth was estimated to be particularly pronounced in
construction (+12 percent), transport, trade and financial services (+10 percent). Following
severe shortages in 2007, electricity supply also sharply rebounded (+19 percent), as generation
capacity rose with the construction of new thermal power plants. In contrast, agriculture (+5
percent) and manufacturing sectors (+5 percent) likely further declined in proportion of GDP,
following trends observed since 2000.

9. However, excess demand pressures significantly widened fiscal and current account
deficits. In particular, public expenditures grew rapidly to reach almost 41 percent of GDP (from


1 Even if not providing financing through the NREG program, all participating DPs in Ghana`s Environment and
  Natural Resources Management (ENRM) Sector Group have observer status to the NREG program.
2Credit to the private sector went up from 15 percent of GDP to 27 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2008.

37 percent in 2007 and 34 percent in 2006, including arrears repayments), as a consequence of
substantial increases in public wages, capital expenditures, energy subsidies and debt service.
Meanwhile, indirect taxes and grants declined in proportion of GDP to elevate the (post-grants)
fiscal deficit to 14 percent, up from 9 percent in 2007, and against a foreseen 5 percent in the
2008 budget law. As a result of concomitant large demand pressures, the current account deficit
(including official transfers) also widened by US$1.2 billion in 2008, to reach 18 percent of GDP
(US$2.9 billion). In the event, non oil imports grew much more rapidly (from US$6.0 billion in
2007 to US$7.9 billion in 2008) than oil imports (from US$2.1 billion in 2007 to US$2.3 billion
in 2008), despite the rise in oil prices. The favorable electricity generation mix (hydro vs.
thermal) contributed to contain the demand for oil.

10. The capital account received most of the shock-wave of the global financial crisis
erupting in September 2008. Following the opening up of the market in late 2006, non-
residents were bringing in more than 2 percent of GDP (buying the new 3-5 years government
bonds) annually. But by September 2008, inflows had collapsed and turned to outflows, as
investors liquidated existing positions and repatriated their capital (leading to an estimated 2
percent of GDP shortfall with respect to expected inflows). In the event, Bank of Ghana`s
foreign currency reserves fell by more than US$600 million between August and December 2008
(against US$900 million in the full calendar year 2008), the Ghana Cedi lost 16 percent against
the US$, and Ghana`s sovereign spreads jumped from 470 bps to 1,570 bps. Meanwhile, interest
rates on 3-month Treasury bills gained 10 percentage points between the first and second half of
2008, and grew up further afterwards, to reach 25 percent by April 2009

11. Initially fuelled by large internal demand pressures, consumer price inflation has been
driven up more recently by the rapid depreciation of the Ghana Cedi. The Consumer Price
Index (CPI) reached 18 percent at end-2008, up from 13 percent at end-2007. Core inflation,
excluding energy and utility as measured by the Bank of Ghana, went up from 9 percent by end-
2007 to 14 percent at end-2008. In early 2009, the consumer price inflation further accelerated,
to reach 20 percent year-on-year in January and February, prompting the Bank of Ghana to
increase its policy rate from 17 to 18.5 percent. While inflation until mid-2008 was most likely
driven by high demand pressures (and to a lesser extent, the rise in global commodity prices), it
became since largely the mechanical consequence of the rapidly depreciating Cedi, which lost 31
percent of its value against the US dollar between August 2008 and March 2009 ­ broadly 4
percent per month.

                   B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY


12. Ghana's high fiscal and external deficits now expose the economy to a sharp
correction, as their financing will most likely prove to be much more difficult in 2009 and 2010.
Indeed, the twin fiscal and current account deficits in 2008 were principally financed through the
use of privatization proceeds (Ghana Telecom), the remainder of Eurobonds issued in 2007,
foreign currency reserves, and domestic borrowing through short-term maturities and from the
Bank of Ghana. If not quickly addressed, the deficits threaten to increase public and external
debts to unsustainable levels and further deplete foreign currency reserves. Staff analysis
suggests that forthcoming oil revenues3 (around 4 percent of GDP from 2011 onwards to the
government), would most likely not suffice to stabilize the macro-economic situation under the
current fiscal stance. Besides, their direct transfer to the budget would bear high risk of budget
volatility and institutional absorptive capacity challenges

13. The difficulty of the domestic situation is compounded by an extraordinary
challenging external environment, which is unfavorable to any additional foreign borrowing
(or at an excessive cost with sovereign bond spreads above 1,200 bps for Ghana by April 2009)
or large Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), with the possible exception of investments in oil
extraction capacity.4 External demand for Ghana`s exports and remittances will likely suffer in
2009, the result of the ongoing recession in OECD countries. In contrast, low oil prices and the
good rain season in 2008 (reconstituting hydro reserves) could de facto contain energy subsidies
and the import bill in 2009. In the face of such challenges, the World Bank classifies Ghana
among the group of countries that are the most exposed and with the lowest fiscal room to cope.5

14. From 6-8 percent in the last three years, Ghana's real GDP growth is projected to go
down to an average 4 percent in 2009 and 2010 as a result of the impact of the global
slowdown ­ and possibly to lower levels should the global situation further worsen, before
rebounding in 2011 as oil extraction kick-starts. Staff analysis suggests that real GDP growth
could go down to around 4 percent in 2009-10, as a result of fiscal stabilization, lower
remittances (- 20 percent in US$ terms), lower FDI (-40 percent in US$ terms, excluding
investments for oil extraction capacity), and lower portfolio investment (-95 percent in US$
terms, in the absence of any new privatization in 2009). Larger drops in remittances and FDI,
and lower than expected official development assistance (bilateral and multilateral, including this
operation) could further bring down real GDP growth to a low 3 percent in the next 2 years, that
is, close to nil in per capita terms.

15. Facing such challenges, the Government of Ghana intends to bring down the fiscal
deficit to 9.4 percent of GDP in 2009, as a first step to a longer term adjustment effort.
Measures announced in the budget law to meet this objective comprise (i) improving VAT


3 Revenue figures from COPCO are based on proven oil reserves from the Jubilee Field, and based on the
assumption of oil prices at US$75/barrel. According to COPCO, extraction is profitable for oil prices above US$35 a
barrel. The likelihood of these revenues is thus high.
4 But foreign direct investment to build oil extraction capacity would have very limited impact on domestic
economic activity as mostly constituted of imported equipments.

collection and raising airport taxes; (ii) compressing operational expenditure (goods and
services6) and delaying capital expenditures (with domestically financed capital expenditures
down from 10.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to 6.0 percent in 2009) and the contribution to the West
Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) escrow account; (iii) securitizing arrears to the social security fund,
and (iv) establishing the single treasury account to improve cash management. Furthermore,
higher tariffs, low oil prices and the replenishment of water reserves 2008 would contribute to
reduce transfers needed to cover the financial losses of energy-related public agencies.7 The
Government also intends to reinforce hiring controls (through the re-centralization of hiring
decisions), and to keep public wage rises at reasonable levels, as indicated by the outcome of
minimum wage negotiations concluded in April 20098. The stabilization task will be made more
difficult by the necessity to settle the stock of arrears that had accumulated in the past year. In
order to achieve its targets, the Government intends to conduct a mid-year budget review at the
Parliament, and implement the necessary contingency measures to reach the fiscal goals set in
the 2009 budget law, if budget deviations are recorded at mid-term.

16. As part of a multi-year stabilization plan, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
staff considers the fiscal target for the year 2009 as needed and reachable. The IMF staff
acknowledges that the current deficit will take time to be resolved due to structural rigidities. At
the same time, substantial up-front adjustment is needed to limit the potentially adverse
consequences of fiscal imbalances for inflation and public debt. Additional measures will be
needed in 2010 and 2011, to bring down the fiscal deficit to a sustainable level. Fiscal and
external deficits are considered financeable with an additional US$400 million (2009) and
US$350 million (2010) worth of budget and balance of payment support from the donors`
community in addition to the funding already pledged at the Consultative Group in May 2008.
Alternatively, the authorities could resort to domestic financing to cover the remaining budget
gap and maintain foreign reserves levels (in months of import), but this would bear the risk of
crowding out private sector demand for credit, generating further currency depreciation and
inflation and leading to an unsustainable accumulation of high interest debt.

17. A rapid announcement of an adjustment and reform package, backed by adequate
financing from the IFIs, would strongly contribute to stabilizing the financial and foreign
exchange markets, and serve as a partial bridge to the onset of oil production (expected to start
in the last quarter of 2010). In April 2009, the Government made a request for financial
assistance from the IMF and the World Bank, the latter through the front-loading of the IDA15
envelope to provide greater budget support than initially envisaged for FY09. Both operations
are under preparation and aimed at being finalized in June 2009.




6Goods and services are budgeted to be cut from 3.7 to 1.8 percent of GDP, see table 2. However, this evolution
conceals the reclassification of some allowances to public sector employees from goods and services to wages
between 2008 and 2009. Without such a reclassification, goods and services would be reduced to 3.3 percent of
GDP.

Storage and Transport (BOST) Co Ltd.
8The unions, the private sector and the Government, through tripartite wage negotiations, agreed on increasing the
minimum wage by 18 percent from April 2009 onwards, with no retroactivity effect. The minimum wage increase is
usually an upper limit to the general wage increase negotiated between partners.

18. The full execution of the 2009 budget law would minimize risks of external debt
distress. The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted in June 2008 pointed to a moderate
level of external and public debt distress, and emphasized, in an alternative scenario, the likely
favorable impact of oil discoveries on debt sustainability. Since, the macro-economic situation
deteriorated markedly, while the likelihood of oil revenue increased. Yet, as increased deficits
were mostly financed using available resources (privatization proceeds, Eurobonds issued in
2007, foreign reserves), public debt to GDP only rose by 2 percent (from 50 to 52 percent)
between 2007 and 2008, while its external component rose by 1 percent (from 24 to 25 percent
of GDP). A preliminary DSA based on debt profile data through December 2008 and the
macroeconomic framework (2009-11) currently discussed with the authorities suggests no
significant change in the medium-term risk of debt distress, once accounted for the positive
impact of forthcoming oil revenues. In the very short run, risks are higher, but at the same time
constrained by an external environment not conducive to additional non-concessional borrowing.
A new Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis will be distributed to the World Bank
Executive Board of Directors in June 2009.

            III     SECTOR ISSUES AND THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

19. Government is pursuing improved transparency and revenue management in the natural
resources sectors. A number of governance challenges adversely affect the revenue generation
potential, management, and sustainability of the natural resources sectors. This section of the
program document outlines the challenges and their impact on economic growth and
environmental protection in the three focal areas of the DPO series - forestry and wildlife,
mining and environment - and the Government`s strategy to address them. The Government`s
Letter of Development Policy for sectors supported by this DPO (Annex 1), outlines its approach
to governance of natural resources forming a solid base for improving the ability of the country
to benefit from use of its mineral resources, and conservation and sustainably harvesting its
renewable resources. As part of the new GOG`s program of reform, the intention is to strengthen
its multi-stakeholder Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Board, and develop its
work program, including extension of the EITI principle to other sectors such as oil, forestry and
fisheries. This extension of EITI signals the Government`s commitment to adopt a value chain
analysis approach to guide improved natural resources management and governance. Valuable
lessons can be learned from existing sectoral practice. For example, the Forestry Commission
publishes timber royalty receipts and disbursements every quarter. The Minerals Commission is
building on this to also publish its receipts and disbursements. A wider circulation of these
publications is however required to make them more useful tools for accountability.

20. Ghana has a strong record of social accountability and transparency mechanisms across
a range of sectors. This has been evident under NREG where, inter alia, a participatory process
substantively influenced the forestry sector Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) and civil
society has been consulted on the minerals and forestry policy matrices. It is envisaged that non-
state actors will also engage with the Inter-Ministerial Forum/Environment Advisory Council. To
further enable civil society demand for accountability around NREG, an interim civil society
facility (Kasa Speak out in Twi), is being funded by EKN (1.6m for 2008-10). A dedicated
fund is also being provided by the EC (1.25m for 2008-12) to enable civil society, industry and
local authorities to engage in a Governance Initiative for Rights and Accountability in Forest

                                                 8

Management (GIRAF). Civil society has active membership of the Ghana EITI Steering
Committee and in the emerging committee dealing with forest carbon and REDD, while an
expanded dialogue across civil society and other non-state actors is emerging on climate change.
The intent of these initiatives is to further develop the capacity of civil society to engage in
evidence-based policy advocacy and to enable non-state actors to interact more systematically
with state institutions responsible for natural resource and environmental governance.

                A. FORESTRY AND WILDLIFE


Governance Challenges

21. The need to curtail illegal logging, largely for the domestic market, establish sustainable
forest management, and improved capture of revenues, are the main governance challenges in
the forestry sector. Factors contributing to forest degradation and loss in Ghana have been well
documented. Although the introduction of a new verification system, developed under the
Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) between Ghana and the EU, will do much to reduce the
loss of revenue through illegal logging to supply export markets, the challenge of addressing
illegal supply to the domestic market should not be underestimated. Increasing demand for cheap
lumber for local markets, combined with poor incentives for communities to maintain and
manage forests outside forest reserves, is a major stimulus for illegal harvesting and associated
forest degradation. The challenge is compounded by a lack of reliable statistics on unofficial
trade, covering the domestic market and overland trade with neighboring countries. Establishing
how a legal and sustainable local supply can be achieved and what level of processing for export
is appropriate are pressing concerns. Further attention is also required to create the right
incentives for communities and farmers to sustainably manage forest and wildlife resources.
Additional challenges lie in implementing and maintaining secure and predictable financing for
the sector. Achievement of revenue collections by the Forestry Commission should be in line
with previously set expectations and targets, and the contribution of redistributed benefits to
poverty alleviation needs to be further secured and confirmed.

Government's strategy

22. Improving forest governance will commence first by establishing capacity and procedures
applied to timber bound for export market, and then turning to timber on the domestic market.
The stated overall aim of the 1994 Forest and Wildlife Policy was, Conservation and
sustainable development of the nation`s forest and wildlife resources for the maintenance of
environmental quality and perpetual flow of benefits to all segments of society. The Policy set
out several strategies through which this aim would be achieved, including: (a) revision of forest
reserve management planning procedures for sustainable forest management, including
development of biodiversity conservation and environmental protection in the high forest zone;
(b) establishment of databases and information communications technology (ICT) linkages to
facilitate decision-making and policy analysis; (c) local community participation in the
management of forest and wildlife resources with rights to consultation, access and benefits; (d)
private sector investment in plantation development, focusing on the conversion of the timber
industry into a low volume, high value industry; and (e) legislative reform in support of these

                                                   9

strategies.9 In 1996, the GOG launched a Forestry Development Master Plan to guide the
execution of the Policy to 2020.

23. Illegal logging for the domestic market is leading to overharvesting and loss of revenue.
According to the Master Plan the annual sustainable harvest is 1 million m3, which mainly
supplies a timber industry that is primarily focused on export markets. Monitoring the origin of
timber bound for export markets will be easier to accomplish in the first instance. Domestic
consumption, which mainly derives from illegal sources, greatly exceeds the sustainable harvest.
Since 1992, there has been an upsurge of illegal felling on off-reserve lands, and measures by the
Forestry Commission to control this phenomenon have been ineffective, and forest resources
have been depleted. The Master Plan outlines obsolete laws and regulations, limited financial
resources and the inadequacy of line agencies and their working conditions, and constraints to its
implementation. These factors are particularly critical under the existing socio-economic
situation of pervasive poverty that contributes to agricultural encroachment of forest reserves and
­ in particular - illegal timber operations. Three key elements of the Master Plan supported under
NREG are: (i) ensuring the legality of timber (which will be addressed under the Voluntary
Partnership Agreement, linked to prior actions under DPO 1 and 2), (ii) the need to ensure
sustainable financing for the sector (supported by a prior action under DPO 1), and (iii) ensuring
transparency in distribution of resources to forest communities (supported by a prior action under
DPO 2).

Critical Approaches

24. Under the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the EU Ghana has committed to
ensure that all timber exported from Ghana to Europe is of legal origin. GOG`s commitment
to a more comprehensive approach to sector reform was tested during an Africa Forest Law
Enforcement and Governance conference held in Yaoundé, Cameroon in 2003, where the
concept of a VPA with the EU for the export of verified legal timber was first discussed. The
VPA mechanism forms part of the EU`s Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade
(FLEGT) Action Plan to tackle the causes of illegal logging. Central to these agreements is a
commitment by tropical timber-producing countries to verify the legality10 of their timber
exports to the EU in exchange for which the EC and EU member states contribute toward the
cost of putting in place the required verification systems. These agreements were also promoted
as a means of strengthening sector governance more broadly. In December 2006, GOG initiated
formal negotiation process with the EU, defining the scope of the negotiations to address illegal
logging not just for export to the EU, but to all exports and the domestic market as well. Through
the VPA process, GOG recognized an opportunity to further their sector reform agenda more
broadly. Issues relating to strengthening of rights of access to resources also forms part of the
legislative reform agenda set out under Ghana`s VPA. The NREG framework for the forest and
wildlife sector, therefore builds largely on the reform agenda set out as part of the VPA
negotiation process.

  processing.

International Agreements

25. In September 2008, Ghana became the first tropical timber-producing country to sign a
VPA with the EU. The reform agenda set out as part of this Agreement (described above) and in
particular the multi-stakeholder consultations on which this reform agenda was based, has laid
the foundations for other processes such as those for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
forest Degradation (REDD) that require strengthening of forest governance as a prerequisite for
successful implementation. Ghana is a recipient of support from the World Bank administered
Forest Carbon Partnership Fund to develop its national strategy and plan for REDD, which will
be developed through a consultative process in the coming year. While modalities and values are
yet to be developed, payment for REDD could provide additional economic incentives for
sustainable forest management, and will further bolster NREG objectives. The development of
Ghana`s national strategy for REDD will build on the experience of the broad consultations and
civil society participation in preparing the VPA, and will be institutionalized in the context of
NREG.
                 B. MINING

Governance Challenges

26. Transparency in establishing mineral development agreements, and capacity to assess
mineral revenues owed to government. Improving the transparency of negotiations on mineral
development agreements and the granting of exploration licenses are GOG priorities. Negotiated
mineral development agreements11 are subject to Parliamentary approval as outlined in Act 703.
Additionally, the Minerals Commission is working to put in place a modern mineral rights
cadastre (licensing system). However, the process of negotiation and the level of transparency
with regard to access to resources remains an issue. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the
GOG is not collecting the amount of taxes and royalties agreed in the minerals development
agreements and in the law. This is mainly due to lack of coordination and capacity of relevant
government agencies to project revenues and operating costs for individual mines, which in turn
determines level of royalty to be paid.

27. Revenue distribution, including at the national and local levels. Since 1993, 10 percent of
mineral royalties should be set aside in the Minerals Development Fund to finance mining sector
institutions at the national and local levels in areas where mining operations are conducted.12




11According to Act 703, The Minister on the advice of the Commission may enter into a development agreement
  under a mining lease with a person where the proposed investment by the person will exceed US$ five hundred
  million.
12Ten percent of mineral royalties are allocated to the Mineral Development Fund for the purpose of helping to
  sustain Ghana`s public mining sector institutions. Of the remaining 90 percent of mineral royalties that do not
  flow to the Mineral Development Fund, 80 percent flow to the central Treasury and 10 percent flow to the Office
  of the Administrator of Stools and Lands and to mining communities. This is not done through the Mineral
  Development Fund; rather, the Internal Revenue Service (which collects the royalties) transfers funds to the
  Office of the Administrator of Stools and Lands, and this office transfers funds onward to the District Assemblies,
  Stools, and Traditional Authorities according to the following formula: of the 10 percent set aside for the Office of
  the Administrator of Stools and Lands and mining communities, 10 percent stays with the Office of the

                                                         11

However, the Minerals Development Fund is not codified in law and thus money is not
systematically distributed to the mining agencies. Similarly, transparency in the allocation and
use of monies accruing to District Assemblies and Traditional Authorities is not fully
transparent. Partly due to this lack of transparency of the amounts and uses of revenues that flow
to the mining Districts and Municipalities, and partly due to uneven social responsibility
practices by mining companies, relationships between communities and mining companies are
often strained and communities have grown increasingly wary of new mining investments.13 It is
however important to note that these conflicts, and the ones between large and small-scale
miners, have existed in gold mining areas in Ghana since colonial times and are common in other
mining countries.

Government's strategy

28. The Mining Policy Document is clear and comprehensive. Ghana`s 1992 Constitution
states that all sub-soil or surface minerals are, the property of the Republic of Ghana and shall
be vested in the President on behalf of, and in trust for the people of Ghana. The Constitution
also provides for the establishment of a Minerals Commission, to help regulate and manage the
utilization of minerals in Ghana. The Mining Policy Document developed by the Minerals
Commission outlines sixteen guiding principles for the sector, including inter alia ensuring that
Ghana`s mineral endowment is managed sustainably and an equitable sharing of financial and
developmental benefits of mining between investors and all Ghanaian stakeholders. It also
encourages local and foreign private sector participation in the exploration and exploitation of
mineral resources; recognizes the need for a stable regulatory environment, access to and
security of tenure of areas of mineral potential, and a stable, competitive, and fair fiscal regime.
Regarding the administration of mining laws and regulations, it focuses on the application of
modern principles of transparency and accountability; as well as acting in harmony with regional
and international partners. Furthermore, the policy aims at achieving a socially acceptable
balance between mining and physical and human environment and ensuring internationally
accepted standards of labor, gender-balance, health, mine safety, human rights, community
relations, and environmental protection; and it encourages mining companies to develop
participatory and collaborative approaches in their relationship with neighboring communities.

Critical Approaches

29. Ensuring that the revenue due to Government from its mining operations is fully
captured, and reducing social impacts on mining communities are priorities. The key piece of
legislation guiding operations in the mining sector is the 2006 Minerals and Mining Act (Act
703). NREG is supporting the Minerals Commission as it operationalizes this law and addresses
sector challenges that have developed over several decades (even since colonial times) during
which the strong focus was on mineral development and obtaining revenue for the government.
Two particular challenges stand out: social impacts in mining communities and ensuring that the


  Administrator of Stools and Lands and 90 percent is distributed to District Assemblies (55 percent of the 90
  percent), Stools (25 percent of the 90 percent), and traditional councils (20 percent of the 90 percent).
13See, for instance, The State of Human Rights in Mining Communities, Commission on Human Rights and Access
  to Justice, March 2008

                                                          12

revenue due to Ghana from its mining operations is fully captured. Ongoing stakeholder
consultations by the Minerals Commission are contributing to development of social
responsibility guidelines, which will provide good practice guidance to large-scale mining
companies on how to engage and interact with mining communities, together with a survey and
annual tracking system to establish data on social conflicts in mining communities. The objective
is to reduce conflicts and promote more harmonious relationships between mining communities
and companies. The Minerals Commission is also working to identify specific areas to set aside
for small scale mining to reduce conflicts between large- and small-scale miners and to begin to
formalize small scale mining through the formation of cooperatives so that they are more easily
reachable for training (e.g., on more environmentally friendly and healthier mining techniques),
extension services, and so forth.

30. Measures to improve revenue collection, improve the transparency of distribution of
revenues at the local level, and improve the regulatory framework for the sector are underway,
and supported by NREG. A Mining Revenue Task Force, bringing together key agencies across
government responsible for mining sector revenue policy formulation, assessment, collection,
administration, and auditing, for a collaborative approach to ensuring that Ghana receives the
revenue due under law from the exploitation of its mineral resources. Bringing clarity to the
distribution of this revenue--particularly at the local level--is the subject of guidelines to be
developed by the Minerals Commission, and intersects with Ghana`s implementation of EITI.
The regulatory framework to underpin the 2006 Minerals and Mining Act (Act 703), will include
fiscal, health, safety, technical, and other aspects, updating compensation, closure and post-
closure policies, and updating environmental standards (working with the Environmental
Protection Agency). The Minerals Commission is cognizant of the need to ensure the requisite
skills to deal with the wide range of challenges facing the sector, and has included training as an
integral part of its approach. The Minerals Commission is also considering the establishment of a
unit dedicated to social and environmental issues in recognition of this critical challenge. Finally,
in an endeavor to dispel a perception that the negative impacts of the mining sector outweigh the
benefits, the Minerals Commission plans to undertake a cost/benefit analysis of the mining
sector. The results of this analysis would be subject to national (and international) debate.

International Agreements

31. Ghana is party to a number of important international and regional agreements and
partnerships related to better management of mineral resources. Since 2003 Ghana has been
implementing EITI, having produced three reports to date on the mining sector. GOG has stated
its commitment to incorporating oil in the EITI process as revenues from the sector start to flow
in earnest. Ghana also participates in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) to
ensure origin of diamonds, and by registering small-scale diamond miners in line with the
scheme. Ghana has chaired the African Mining Partnership, led by African mining ministers, to
champion and coordinate mining and mineral-related initiatives under the auspices of the New
Partnership for Africa`s Development (NEPAD). Going forward, this will be linked with the
African Union`s efforts to implement the Africa Mining Vision 2050, which was presented at
the First Ordinary Session of the African Union Conference of Ministers Responsible for
Mineral Resources Development in October 2008, and in which Ghana participated. The
Conference brought together African ministers responsible for mineral resources and experts in


                                                13

mining to discuss key sector issues and propose a strategic vision and action plan with a view to
promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, and achieving sustainable development. The
Ministerial Declaration coming out of the meeting indicates that the participants will undertake
to improve mineral resource policies, legal, regulatory, and administrative frameworks, and
enhance the capacity for auditing, monitoring, regulating, and improving mineral resource
exploitation regimes, and for developing the linkages of the mineral sector with the domestic
economy.14

                C. ENVIRONMENT


Governance Challenges

32. Key challenges include the increasing need to improve environmental assessment and
governance across sectors, and also begin to mainstream climate change adaptation into
development. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the lead agency responsible for
pursuing these agendas, with a mandate to establish effective partnership and collaboration with
relevant institutions and agencies, including the judiciary. The key service delivery process is
the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is required for the issuance of permits and
certificates as well as monitoring of Environmental Management Plans. The demand for permits
and certificates has, since the enactment of the 1994 EPA Act, been growing steadily.
Applications for permits and certificates increased from 515 in 2002 to 1,555 in 2005, with about
50 percent coming from the Greater Accra region. Development of sectoral guidelines to guide
EIA is an important element of a precautionary approach to pollution prevention and ensuring
good environmental governance, however, enforcement of compliance remains a challenge for
EPA, partly due to resource constraints.

33. Strengthening the link between the funding needs and allocations, and clarifying
institutional roles at the national and local level will help. Establishing a robust link between a
core environmental mandate (defined through an EPA strategic plan that is currently being
updated) and financial flows (revenues and public finance allocation) will enable a more
comprehensive dialogue between EPA, the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology,
and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning on budgetary allocations and delivery.
Enhancing the relationship with the judiciary and other sectoral agencies will also be essential
for effective EIA delivery. In addition, there is a need to build decentralized environmental
capacity at district level to provide effective management and governance to complement central
and regional structures. However, there is still uncertainty about the structures that would best
take on board these decentralized tasks. Currently, natural resources and environment
departments are being proposed through the Local Government Service, although the functions,
staff, and funds for these remain to be defined. Departments will need to be assigned and
equipped by the EPA, in conjunction with other relevant sectoral Ministries, Departments and
Agencies (MDAs).

Government's Strategy

34. The EPA strategic plan is currently being reviewed and updated. The directive principles
of state policy of the 1992 Constitution include an article on the need to, protect and safeguard
the environment for posterity. An overall policy framework is provided by the 1991 National
Environment Policy, while the 1991 National Environment Action Plan (NEAP)15 will supported
by a Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) with NREG support. The EPA, according to
its mandate and the EPA Act (Act 490, 1994), is a key actor in environmental protection in
Ghana. EPA`s 2003 strategic plan, which is currently being redrafted and updated, sets out its
overarching objectives, guiding principles, regional and departmental objectives. Additionally, a
National Sustainable Development Strategy, and Sustainable Development Action Plan will be
prepared around the successor to GPRS II.

Critical Approaches

35. Ghana is being progressively recognized as a leader in the use of strategic environmental
assessment, and advancing the climate change agenda. The NREG approach has drawn on
lessons of both Ghanaian and Tanzanian experience of environmental mainstreaming within
national development planning.16 Following early experience with the National Development
Planning Commission (NDPC) in conducting a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)
around the GPRS, the EPA has institutionalized SEA practice, applying this at both sectoral and
district levels. Ghana is now recognized as a leader among developing countries in this regard.17
The EPA will host the major 2009 conference for the International Association for Impact
Assessment (IAIA), where detailed sessions will provide opportunities to share international
experience on sectoral themes relevant to NREG, including oil and gas.18 In 2009, a significant
SEA will be undertaken to address responsible environmental management for the oil sector.
Recommendations from an independent review of SEA practice in Ghana have highlighted the
need for ex-ante SEA and systematic follow up of findings. EPA is also leading the dialog across



15The NEAP covers (a) integration of environmental consideration into sectoral, structural and socio-economic
  planning at all levels; (b) maintenance of ecosystem and ecological processes essential for the functioning of the
  biosphere; (c) guidance for healthy environmental practices in the national development effort; and (d) seeking
  common solutions to environmental problems in West Africa, Africa, and the world at large. The latter
  specifically addresses obligations and contributions under Multilateral Environmental Agreements to which
  Ghana is party.

  and Reduction of Poverty ­ MKUKUTA, IIED, 2007.
17The OECD-DAC Task Force on SEA is preparing a case study on the evolution of Ghanaian practice and linkage
  to country systems around SEA and the NREG program, while the October 2008 World Bank Workshop on
  Country Environmental Analysis in Paris featured extended discussion on Ghana. Ghanaian experience is also
  influencing a new program on environmental integration with Government of Zambia, IIED and in-country
  development partners

MDAs and with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) regarding the
substantive implications of climate change. NREG is supporting related policy dialogue and the
mobilization of an informed national constituency in Ghana, as well as enabling dialogue in
relation to international negotiations on climate change under the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCC).

International Agreements

36. Ghana is party to many multilateral environmental agreements that determine both
international and national response measures.19 As with many other countries, translation of
these into national legislation and policies in Ghana can be challenging. However, where
successful, this is influential. For example, participation in such agreements has been effective in
supporting the EPA in preventing the type of hazardous waste disaster and scandal that affected
Abidjan, Cote d`Ivoire in 2007. As an active and influential party within the African Group, and
in wider structures such as the Adaptation Financing Board, Ghana is making a particularly
substantial contribution to international negotiations under the UNFCCC. With a compressed
schedule to negotiate and reach agreement on a post-2012 international framework at
Copenhagen in December 2009, an informed and engaged political mandate is needed (across
Ministries (MOFEP, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sectoral MDAs) to complement the
considerable technical input by the EPA, Forestry Commission, and other members of Ghana`s
delegations.

Governance Challenges on Climate Change

37. Although MEST and EPA are promoting the need to address climate change, a
coordinated response across GOG remains to be developed. The widespread flooding in 2007
indicated that Ghana`s current capacity to predict and respond to climate-related risks is
inadequate. To enable climate-resilient development, Ghana needs to develop national and sector
specific responses through policies, legislation, strategies and programming. In particular, Ghana
needs to tailor its response to climatic risk in a strategic manner, incorporating both geographic
and social dimensions, to ensure a rapid response in higher risk areas such as the northern region
which is prone to flooding, and the vulnerable coastal areas.

Critical Approaches

38. Coordination across sectors will be key to improving environmental management, and
preparing to manage the impacts of climate change and variability. Ongoing research on
climate impacts will contribute towards the development of the national adaptation strategy.
However, further quantification is required on socio-economic impacts and on climate models.
Improving the early warning systems will require the strengthening of the Ghana Meteorological
Agency to be able to perform this function, by collecting the relevant data and also engaging in

sub-regional, regional, and global observation networks. Alignment is also required between the
EPA (coordinating responses through a revitalized, inter-sectoral, national climate change
committee), and the National Disaster Management Organization, to ensure effective integration
of disaster risk reduction and response into broader development planning. An increasing
awareness and commitment to develop and adopt climate change policy on the part of MOFEP
suggest that climate change issues can now be addressed at both political and technical levels,
thereby increasing the prospects for integrating climate change strategies effectively into sectoral
and national development planning.

                D. BUDGET MANAGEMENT


39. Budget management by the NREG agencies has been improving over the last year.
Promoted by the DPO-approach, the agencies are moving to a unified budgetary framework.
Under DPO1, the agencies had continued to work with a specific NREG-program budget.
Targets in the policy matrix were more or less linked to specific activities in the program. Under
DPO 2, the NREG program has been mainstreamed in the annual working plan of the agencies,
and the agencies are no longer working with a specific NREG-budget. They receive funding
from GOG to execute their work program, in addition to internally generated revenues (levies
and fees). Under DPO 2 the policy matrix has been considerably rationalized and now focuses
on the key strategic policy and institutional issues.

40. Multi-annual budgetary frameworks of the three agencies are not yet very detailed, and
need to be further strengthened. With the support of technical assistance from the Royal
Netherlands Embassy, MDAs involved in the NREG program have formulated an action plan for
strengthening financial programming and financial management. The action plan focuses on
improving the quality and comprehensiveness of the agencies` budgets and the multi-annual
budgetary frameworks, ensuring that audits are produced in a timely manner covering all
expenditures, developing strategies to exploit the revenue generating capacity of the respective
sectors, training staff in procurement planning and cash flow projections. A detailed analysis of
the agencies` annual and multi-annual budgets is laid down in a policy note, and is an important
aspect of the annual policy dialogue.

41. Government funding levels of the sectors has increased. The increased budget allocations
to the agencies and strengthening of the budget management capacity are expected to lead to
more effective functioning of the agencies, which will help them to considerably improve the
collection of levies and fees and improve the effectiveness of their governance functions in the
immediate future. GOG will need to ensure that the three agencies continue to be adequately
financed through IGF and/or GOG sources. For the Minerals Commission, for example, which
(with exception of the Inspectorate Division) did not receive any GOG funding prior to NREG,
GOG resources will become their most significant source of funding.

   IV     JOINT DEVELOPMENT PARTNER SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S
                                             PROGRAM


               A. LINK TO COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY (CAS)

42. CAS Objectives. The NREG program is aligned with the 2008-2011 CAS. The CAS sets out
the broad objectives of increasing growth and decreasing poverty and inequality, to be achieved
with the help of the Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS) and a series of World Bank
programs, including PRSCs and other DPOs such as NREG. The first part of the CAS is the (G-
JAS), agreed by 17 partners, including those involved in Natural Resource and Environment
(NRE) issues.20 The G-JAS sets out to harmonize DP assistance and align it with the
government`s political cycle, and includes arrangements for results monitoring and risk
mitigation (based on the Ghana Partnership Strategy, which discusses DP support to GPRS II). In
line with the donor harmonization agenda and Ghana`s good track record of PRSC
implementation, 50 percent of lending under the CAS is expected to be in the form of DPOs.

43. Natural Resources and Environment and the CAS. The G-JAS has a substantial chapter on
environment, reflecting the findings of the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA). The
environment as a key priority for development was thus accepted at the highest level of the donor
community and marks an important step forward toward joint NRE programs. The CAS also
recognizes that sustainable NRE management is urgent, and prioritizes the reform and capacity
building of key natural resource/environmental agencies as central to improving environmental
protection. Additionally, CAS priorities include the need to improve: (a) public financial
management of natural resource revenues; (b) the relationship between extractive industries and
local communities; (c) coordination between natural resource/environment ministries and
agencies; and (d) civil society`s strengthened oversight capacity with regard to natural resource
and environmental management.

44. The NREG DPO is mentioned in the CAS as supporting the first GPRS II-pillar promoting
private sector competitiveness (by improving investment climate) and also related to the third
GPRS II pillar promoting good governance and civic responsibility, and complements the
PRSC. One of the outcomes mentioned in the CAS is that the Bank, in conjunction with other
DPs, anticipate a 0.5% annual reduction in the costs of resource depletion, as compared with a
cost of depletion of 10% per year of GDP (2006).

               B. DONOR HARMONIZATION


45. Bank/Fund Collaboration. The Bank and International Monetary Fund collaborate closely
in Ghana, with the two institutions coordinating policy advice to GOG. The IMF leads on the
macroeconomic policy front, while the Bank leads on economic reform policies in such areas as
infrastructure, water and sanitation, agriculture and rural development, private sector
development, and public sector reform. The Bank and Fund have shared responsibility in
supporting Ghana`s structural reforms in budgeting and public expenditure management, public
enterprise reform and divestiture, and the financial sector. Furthermore, the two institutions have
worked together in supporting GOG`s GPRS I and II, on the Joint Staff Advisory Note on the
GPRS II and Annual Progress Reports, the 2004 HIPC Expenditure Tracking Assessment and
Action Plan, the mid-2004 assessment of progress toward the completion point under the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative, and the update of the findings of the 2000­2001 Financial Sector
Assessment Program.

46. DP Support. GOG`s NREG program is supported by five DPs--AFD, DFID, EC, EKN,
and the World Bank--with such support designed and implemented jointly with GOG from the
outset. The cooperation between DPs began with joint analytical work (CEA, Ghana
Environment Sector Study) and joint sector dialogue via the ENR Sector Group. During
preparation and implementation of DPO-1 and preparation of DPO-2, joint missions were
undertaken and a joint program document developed. Simultaneously, VPA negotiations
proceeded with EC and DFID support. A joint Framework Memorandum (Annex 4) states how
DPs and GOG will work together under the NREG program. DPs have harmonized support by
using a joint PAF, and undertaking a joint assessment of the PAF.

47. While Bank support for DPO-2 will be US$10 million equivalent, to be disbursed in a single
tranche on effectiveness, the following development partners would also provide a total of
approximately US$16.6 million to support the program:

EKN: approximately 7 million per year over five years (2008-2012);
DFID: approximately £2.1million per year for three years starting in 2009 (2009-2011);
AFD: approximately 1 million per year over five years (2008-2012);
EC: approximately 2.7 million per year over three years starting in 2009 (2009-2011).

48. Other DP Support, and the shift from project to budget support: DP project support in the
forestry and wildlife sector is being largely phased out in favor of budget support under NREG.
However, the Fonds Français pour l'Environnement Mondial, is financing a US$10.7 million
biodiversity and forestry project, and the EC`s US$12 million Protected Areas Development
Program, which will end in 2009. The Netherlands` approximately US$25 million project
funding in the forestry sector ended in 2008. EC`s 40 million Mining Sector Support Project is
expected to end in the second half of 2009, and thereafter support to the sector will be channeled
through NREG. Complementary to NREG, CIDA is supporting a Ghana Environmental
Management Program (C$8 million) to strengthen EPA and its parent Ministry`s capacity and
combat desertification in the northern Ghana. NREG-related Bank project support is discussed in
Section IV.C. The DP group on oil, chaired by DFID, is the main mechanism to ensure, at

                                                19

GOG`s request, a coordinated approach to respective DP interventions. Norway continues to be
the lead DP providing technical support in the oil sector. Norway and NREG DPs are
coordinating closely in regard to environment and oil and respective interactions with EPA in the
light of the targets on environmental guidelines and the SEA on oil in the NREG PAF.

49. Environment and Natural Resources Sector Group. Sector Groups have been established
in Ghana to improve GOG/DP dialogue and coordination. The Environment and Natural
Resources Sector Group was established in 2004, and its membership includes the key
Government institutions responsible for mining forestry and environmental management,
MOFEP and Development Partners with an interest in supporting improved environmental and
natural resources management. The Sector Group`s three main objectives are to (a) conduct
continuous sector policy dialogue between GOG sector representatives and interested DPs; (b)
review the performance of the ENR sector at least once each year and exchange views on
progress toward agreed outcomes and actions that contribute to improved sector performance;
and (c) improve harmonization and alignment of GOG`s and DPs` procedures, projects,
programs, and skills to improve the efficiency of implementation of GOG`s sector policies and
strategies. The Technical Director for Forestry in the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources
and the Chief Executive of the Environmental Protection Agency are currently co-chairs of the
Sector Group on GOG`s side, while the EC has taken over as sector lead, with EKN and the
World Bank as co-sector leads, on the DP side. Civil Society representatives attend Sector Group
meetings on a quarterly basis and participate in the Annual Sector Review. Within the wider
donor architecture in Ghana, the Sector Group is the first contact point for information and
analysis of achievements in the sector. It maintains a strong link with the MDBS group and
contributes directly into the MDBS dialogue.

50. Link to MDBS. The MDBS general budget support operation (to which the Bank`s PRSC
contributes) is assisting GOG to implement GPRS II. NRE priorities included in the MDBS have
been expanded, and deepened under NREG. To maintain a high-level link between MDBS and
NREG, the 2008 MDBS target 5 under objective C2 (improve cross-sectoral natural resources
and environmental management) was "to submit a paper to cabinet on inter-sectoral forum on
natural resources, environment and sustainable development." In addition, target 25 under
objective D1 (improve public expenditure management) of the 2008-2010 MDBS policy matrix
was is, "to improve budget implementation by setting benchmarks and strengthening MDA
capacity with the view of (a) reducing the time lag between MDAs request and releases piloting
with 5 MDAs including MLFM and MLGRDE, (b) reducing discrepancies between expenditure
request by MDAs and their updated procurement plans and cash forecast piloting with 5 MDAs
including MLFM and MLGRDE. Additionally, a target in the NREG environment matrix to
propose options to establish an Inter-Ministerial Forum on Environment and Development was
also supported by a 2008 target under the MDBS. While the parliamentary elections delayed the
submission of a paper to Cabinet on the inter-sectoral forum, the new Government has expressed
its intent to establish an inter-ministerial Advisory Council on Environment under the
chairmanship of the Vice President, which is now an MDBS trigger for 2009. A new three year
rolling PAF for the MDBS is presently being designed by Government and the NREG sector
group is considering a number of cross cutting actions that require high level Government
attention, outside the NREG sectors, for inclusion.

                C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS


51. Bank projects that support improved natural resources and Environmental governance
include - The Agricultural Development Policy Operation, which provides sector budget
support for policy and institutional reforms that contribute toward promoting sustainable
management of natural resources in agricultural lands. The Land Administration Project
(US$55 million, of which US$20.5 million IDA contribution), which supports Government`s
land administration reform by harmonizing land policies and the legislative framework with
customary law; undertaking institutional reforms to improve the land administration system; and
establishing an efficient system of land titling, registration, and land use planning. Under the
Community-Based Rural Development Project (IDA, US$60 million - a project aiming at
increasing rural income, improving rural infrastructures, and access to key support services) one
component specifically supports natural resource-based development. Also, in the context of the
TerrAfrica Global Partnership Program, the Bank provides technical advisory services to
strengthen the analytical underpinnings and the capacity of various Governmental institutions to
oversee the development and implementation of sustainable land management activities. The
Northern Savannah Biodiversity Conservation Project (GEF, US$7.6 million, completed in
February 2009), supported a range of sustainable land and natural resource management
activities in the Northern Region, and tested approaches to NRM and sustainable livelihoods that
could possibly be adapted and replicated in the wider context of sustainable development in
Northern Ghana. Among planned operations, the Integrated Water Resources Development
and Agricultural Competitiveness project (IDA, US$50 million) aims at supporting
implementation of the Sustainable Development Initiative for Northern Ghana (NDI) by (i)
reducing vulnerability to the risks of floods and droughts, and (ii) supporting irrigation
development as an engine to attract private investors and facilitate the development of
commercial agriculture in the North. Within this umbrella` project, a GEF supported component
(US$7.4 million) would provide technical and financial support for watershed protection and
rehabilitation to reduce the risks and the impact of natural hazards by promoting the adoption of
sustainable land management technologies and practices.

52. Links to Other DPOs. Specific links via targets in the MDBS/PRSC are described above.
More generally, the two sector DPOs - NREG and agriculture - rely on macroeconomic
assessments and debt sustainability analysis carried out under the PRSC. Government-wide
issues related to expenditure frameworks, budget allocations, and budget execution are carried
out as part of the PRSC dialogue, with sector-specific issues in these areas discussed as part of
the NREG dialogue. The External Review of Public Financial Management (ERPFM) underpins
this dialogue. Currently, fisheries resources are included under the agriculture DPO because
institutional responsibility for fisheries is under a Department within the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture, and because of the inclusion of fisheries in the national agriculture strategy (i.e., the
FASDEP).

53. Lessons from Previous Projects. The design of the NREG program reflects lessons learned
from previous Bank interventions in the NRE sectors in Ghana and other countries as set out
in the program document for DPO-1. In particular, key lessons learned under the Natural
Resources Management Project, completed in 2003, included the:

i)     Centrality of fostering country ownership and aligning with the GOG sector programs;
ii)    Importance of the strategic approach to build capacity while using country systems,
       including a sound monitoring and evaluation system;
iii)   Need for realistic end of program outcomes;
iv)    Need to leverage reforms and capacity building and to focus the policy dialogue on key
       governance issues;
v)     Importance of incorporating public participation, addressing the needs of civil
       stakeholders;
vi)    Usefulness of leveraging co-financing and harmonizing DP interventions.

54. Lessons from Global Experience. The following lessons or principles have also emerged
from global experience from the development and implementation of DPOs and they have been
incorporated into the design of the DPO series (see Box 3 for details): (a) reinforce country
ownership; (b) agree upfront with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework; (c) customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank
support to country circumstances; (d) choose only actions critical for achieving results as a
condition for disbursement; and (e) conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to
predictable and performance-based financial support

55. Lessons from DPO-1. The first year of NREG provided valuable lessons that have been
incorporated into the design of DPO-2. In particular, the DPO continues to rely on MOFEP-led
coordination as this has demonstrated that a central coordinating function is needed to ensure
consistency in the management of the program. On the DP side, there have been intense and time
consuming efforts toward donor collaboration and harmonization, and this new year of
implementation will include a review and better division of labor among the DPs in supervision
of the program. Box 3 provides a series of best practices which have been adopted in this DPO.

                           Box 1: NREG DPO and DPO Good Practice Principles

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
GOG has demonstrated strong ownership of the NREG program. The program matrix was developed by the
Forestry Commission, Minerals Commission, EPA, their parent Ministries, with an active leadership role by
MOFEP, and in discussion with DPs.
GOG consulted broadly with key stakeholders on the program matrix. Consultations with stakeholders were
carried out as part of the preparation of the NREG program, and as part of the validation of the program matrix.
There is a strong political will to take civil society`s perspective into account. Stakeholder and Risk Analyses
were launched under DPO-1 and continue under DPO-2, deepening the analysis of impacts of mining, forestry,
and oil exploitation on vulnerable communities.
Public disclosure. Documents related to the NREG program have been publicly disclosed to help ensure
accountability and transparency, and reinforce country ownership.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The NREG program matrix, or PAF, serves as a harmonized basis for monitoring and annual review by DPs.
The program matrix, jointly agreed with DPs, is used to assess GOG`s progress on the reform agenda. Through
it, prior actions and triggers for each year are determined and agreed with GOG and disbursements are based on
achievements. The NREG program matrix combines policy-based actions and output/outcome-oriented targets
for each year of the program, with means of verification and a column quantifying (whenever possible)
expected outcomes. Each sector validates its matrix at the Ministerial level, confirming GOG`s commitment to
the program.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The reform program captured in the NREG program matrix reflects GOG's agenda and intentions. The key
policy makers in each sector lead the process of developing the matrix and its actions for their respective sector.
In addition, the NREG program matrix is fully aligned with GPRS II pillars.
The program focuses on three key sectors. Taking Ghana`s circumstances into account, the NREG program
decisively focuses on forestry and wildlife, mining, and environment precisely because the three sectors have a
very high potential for growth and have important social and environmental welfare implications. Sustainable
oil exploitation is part of the environmental governance focus.
The NREG program complements the ongoing MDBS program. Rather than include the objectives of the
NREG program in the existing MDBS (general budget support) program, the need for separate and more in-
depth reforms in this particular area led GOG and DPs to agree on the separate, yet complementary, NREG
program. It does not overlap with the MDBS program, but picks up on important sectoral areas not addressed by
the MDBS due to its focus on overall public sector management.
The timing and modality of budget support is aligned with the country's needs. The choice to use a DPO
reflects an understanding of the need to focus on governance reforms in the three sensitive sectors, and reflects
the growing capacity of Ghana`s PFM system. All contributing donors use the same monitoring framework,
which reduces the transaction cost for the GOG.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
For DPO-2 there are 6 prior actions and 29 targets ­ reduced from 66 under DPO1. The prior
actions/triggers are purposely limited in number and were selected because they are considered key in the
agencies` own policy documents.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
Under the NREG program, there are regular performance reviews. In accordance with Ghana`s budget and
monitoring cycle, the PAF review takes place in the first half of the year, to review progress on triggers, and the
annual sector review takes place in the second half of the year, to take stock of progress and look forward. The
PAF review assesses implementation progress and determines disbursements, which are contingent upon
results. The reviews are conducted in accordance with Ghana`s budget and monitoring cycle and in a
transparent manner--all stakeholders participate in the annual sector review.

                 E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

56. The Analytical underpinnings for the NREG program are described in detail in the
program document for DPO-1. Key among these are the Country Environmental Analysis, the
Ghana Environment Sector Study (GESS), and preparatory studies for the VPA in forestry. The
Country Environmental Analysis grew out of recognition by GOG and DPs of the importance of
natural resources to Ghana`s economy and the alarming rate of depletion/degradation and
inefficient management of these renewable and non-renewable assets. NREG is a response to
the Country Environmental Analysis`s findings, to strengthen environmental
governance/management and mainstream policy dialogue in this area. It is the main platform for
DPs to engage with GOG to address issues raised in the report related to mining, forestry and
wildlife and wider environmental governance mechanisms.

57. Other studies were undertaken during the preparation of DPO-1 and DPO-2, to inform
policy directions. They include a Public Revenue Analysis of the Forestry, Mining, and
Environment Sectors, to determine what can be done to enhance further the revenue generation
from these sectors; a Review of Budgets, Expenditures, and the Financial Management System
of the Natural Resources and Environment Sector; Translation of the NREG Matrices into
Action Plans and Budgets, beginning with the costing of 2008 and 2009 actions in the matrices;
and a Stakeholder and Risk Analysis, undertaken as the first phase of Poverty and Social Impact
Analysis (PSIA).
                    Box 2: Summary Findings of Recent Studies under the NREG Program

   Public Revenue Analysis of the Forestry, Mining, and Environment Sectors. Key findings of this study
   include inter alia:
    There is a gap between economic rent capture from the NREG sectors and budget policy implementation.
    Wildlife revenue generating potential is constrained by the command and control approach to resource
        regulation and management, limited institutional capacity, and marketing of wildlife potential.
    How Forestry Commission`s finances work are not well understood in the public sector, and there is a lack
        of clarity in legislation about the purpose of Timber Rights Fees.
    Ghana`s mining royalty system does not adequately address the extraction of economic rent as currently
        applied. The nature of the mining fiscal regime is straining the capacity of institutions to administer it.
    Placement of a reclamation bond has been made a requirement for all mining companies to comply with
        under EPA`s mandate to enforce environmental compliance. This will be an excess charge on the mining
        industry under the policy of charging economic rent.
    EPA`s mandate cuts across areas of responsibility of economic and social sectors. EPA is constrained
        financially and in terms of human resources in attaining the ultimate objective of certifying environmental
        compliance of establishments.
    In the short to medium term, EPA should be dependent on government budget. EPA`s long term policy
        should be one of self-financing through a taxation of the private sector for provision of environmental
        services.
   Review of Budgets, Expenditures, and the Financial Management System of the Natural Resources and
   Environment Sector. Key findings of this study include inter alia:
    The funding requirements of the sector necessary to perform its core functions far exceed the funding
        available from its revenue sources.
    The budget process fails to meet the resource expectations of the agencies; the annual budget is not
        currently guided by the rolling, three-year MTEF.
    Failure to adjust budget proposals for inflation leads to the need for additional funds.
    Consistent application of the expenditure classification codes is necessary for budget management.

      V       THE PROPOSED NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL
                    GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION
               A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION


58. DPO Series Objectives and Outcomes. The objective of the DPO series is to support the
Government of Ghana to implement a set of policies and reforms intended to: (a) ensure
predictable financing and sustainable management of the forest and wildlife resources and
effective forest law enforcement; (b) improve mining sector revenue collection, management,
and transparency; (c) address social issues in forest and mining communities; and (d) mainstream
environment into economic growth through Strategic Environmental Assessment, Environmental
Impact Assessment, and development of a climate change strategy. The proposed operation is
likely to have a significant positive impact on the environment, forests and other natural
resources. DPO-2 continues the focus on policies and reforms in the inter-related sectors of
forestry and wildlife, mining, and environmental protection toward achieving the overall
expected outcomes at completion of the proposed DPO series, which include (a) improved
management of government revenues and finances in the forestry and mining sectors; (b)
reduced illegal logging; (c) reduced social conflict in forestry and mining communities; and (d)
integration of environmental considerations into policy formulation and implementation across
government, including risks associated with climate change. The Government`s NREG Program
covers a five-year period, which is why five year outcomes were indicated in the DPO1 PAF.
As required by the Bank, three year outcomes (i.e., associated with the end of this DPO three
year series) have now also been defined. The five and three-year outcomes are outlined in
Annex 3.

59. DPO-2 Prior Actions and Triggers for DPO-3: NREG is a three year programmatic
operation and IDA financing is provided annually based on completion of a set of policy reform
actions (i.e. prior actions) following annual joint review of progress by DPs and MDAs, and
before approval of each operation in the series by the Bank`s Executive Board. The policy
actions and indicators for the DPO series will continue to focus and deepen the dialog on the
forestry and mining sectors, and on environmental protection.

60. Based on the implementation experience with DPO-1, the Government, World Bank and
other development partners agreed to reduce the number of policy reform actions and targets for
DPO-2 and DPO-3.

       B.     POLICY AREAS

61. Implementation Progress, Prior Actions, and Indicative Triggers. Over the course of 2008,
NREG MDAs focused on implementing the comprehensive set of policy and institutional actions
included in the original matrices developed under DPO-1. Progress achieved since DPO-1 is
outlined below and detailed in Annex 6. Prior actions for DPO-2 and indicative triggers for
DPO-3 are captured in the rationalized NREG program matrices (Annex 2). The prior actions for
DPO-2 and their status are shown in Tables 5, 7 and 9. Indicative triggers for DPO-3 are

                                                25

summarized in Tables 6, 8, and 10. IDA`s support to the NREG program will be evaluated
following the disbursement of DPO-3 (which would mark the end of the first NREG DPO series)
and a decision on whether to proceed with a second DPO series taken at that time. Given that
GOG`s NREG program runs for five years, indicative key actions for 2010 and 2011, as
developed by the respective MDAs, are shown in the tables below, as are the associated expected
outcomes.

Component 1: Forestry and Wildlife Sector financing and Forest Law enforcement

62. Progress Under DPO-1. Under DPO-1, the Government implemented policy reforms and
actions outlined in PAF. It achieved both prior actions: (a) development and signing of the
Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the EC, and (b) ensuring predictable and
sustainable financing for the forest and wildlife sector, through a new financial framework for
the Forestry Commission, which was submitted to the Cabinet.

63. The VPA with the EC commits Ghana to ensure that all Ghanaian timber entering European
markets is of legal origin. Legality includes harvest origin as well as wider legal compliance,
such as ensuring that the timber derives from an area that has a current forest management plan
that is being implemented, that permits have been acquired in conformity with regulations, and
taxes and royalties have been paid. Furthermore, transport and processing was in accordance
with the legal prescriptions, environmental regulations have been respected, and Social
Responsibility Agreements are in place. Options to apply the VPA principles to the domestic
market would be developed in 2009 under DPO 2. This will entail a review of existing benefit
sharing arrangements in order to strengthen the forest sector`s contribution to equitable and
broad socio-economic development. The VPA, which was developed with broad stakeholder
participation, will commence implementation in 2009.

64. The second prior action focused on securing predictable and sustainable financing for the
sector. In 2008, the Forestry Commission made real progress with respect to improving
stumpage and export levy collection rates (currently estimated at 75 percent). Regarding
additional targets a wildfire control project, which was completed in 2008, successfully put in
place mechanisms to prevent and reduce damages caused by wildfires, and promote sustainable
ecosystem management. Terms of Reference for a full Forestry Development Master Plan have
been developed and currently await implementation in 2009. Based on a 2008 needs assessment
the Forestry Commission is putting in place a new M&E system.

65. Areas of Focus in DPO-2. MLFM led the development of the forestry and wildlife sector
matrix for DPO-1, in close collaboration with representatives of the Forestry Commission.
Following the ENR sector review in July 2008, during which progress against agreed 2008
targets was discussed, it was agreed that a reduction in the number of targets would facilitate
program monitoring and assessment. Consequently, for DPO-2 there has been a revision of the
policy matrix to focus GOG/DP dialogue on priority areas for sector reform and a significant
reduction in targets, including reducing the number of program/policy objectives from eight to
five focal areas, as follows:




                                               26

        Institutional Strengthening and Governance. This focal area represents the merging of
three program/policy objectives from DPO-1: Strengthen Institutional Capacity to Implement
Policy`; Ensure Effective Law Enforcement`; and Increase supply of Legal Timber on
Domestic Market`. The rationale for this merger was that the key issues of concern for each of
these policy objectives are directly related to commitments that GOG has entered into as part of
the sector reform agenda set out under the VPA process, i.e., strengthening the Forestry
Commission`s regulatory function by delegating authority to the private sector for certain aspects
of resource management; agreement on an institutional structure to implement the wood tracking
system and the related Timber Legality Assurance System (TLAS); and supplying more of the
growing domestic market demand with timber from verified legal sources.

        Secure Natural Ecosystems for the Benefit of all Segments of Society. This policy focal
area was reflected under DPO-1. Illegal logging, bushfires, encroachment of reserves, and
poaching have greatly contributed to the degradation of the forest and wildlife resources.
Implementation of a national wildfire management policy, and development, implementation and
monitoring of Integrated Management Plans for forest reserves and protected areas are therefore
included as key targets under this policy focal area. The main outcome expected under this
objective is an improvement in the integrity of the forest and wildlife resource base.

        Sustainably Finance and Promote Investment in the Forest and Wildlife Sector. This
policy focal area under DPO-2 represents a merging of the DPO-1 policy objectives relating to
securing predictable and sustainable financing for the sector and attracting private sector
investment. With respect to the sustainable financing element, targets relating to the submission
to Parliament of a legislative bill relating to the Forestry Commission`s financial framework and
also the assessment of potential for sector financing from various carbon markets have been
proposed for DPO-2. With respect to attracting private sector investment, the areas of particular
concern for the sector are ecotourism, plantation development and the promotion of value-added
timber processing. Wildlife-based tourism generates revenues of around US$2.5 million,
however significant opportunities exist to increase this source of revenue as tourist numbers to
Ghana rise. The development of an action plan for improved revenue collection is a target for
2009. With plantations playing a key role in the future supply of Ghanaian timber, the sector has
embarked on a process of preparing land-lease and benefit sharing agreements for private sector
plantation development. The promotion, implementation and monitoring of these agreements are
therefore an important target under this focal area. Finally, with a decreasing resource base and
only 12 percent of timber export revenue attributable to tertiary processed products, the
development of a strategy for promoting value-added processing was also considered a key
target for DPO-2. The main expected outcomes are to secure predictable and diversified sources
of funding and to increase the level of (socially and environmentally responsible) private sector
investment in the sector.

        Strengthen Monitoring and Evaluation Systems (with use of Information
Communications Technology). This policy focal area is a reframing of the policy objective
Strengthen Information Management and Monitoring and Evaluation Capability of the sector`
under DPO-1. The objective reflects the need to make better use of existing information
management systems (e.g., financial and administrative) as tools for more effective monitoring



                                                  27

and evaluation that can be used to assess progress against targets set out in the sector Master Plan
and three-year Corporate Plan, and the use of information systems for better planning.

        Promote Equitable Resource Access Rights and Benefits for all Segments of Society.
Similarly, this focal area is a variation of the wording used in DPO-1 for the Ensure Equitable
Socio-economic Benefits for All Segments of Society from Forest Resource Management` policy
objective. Poverty impact is difficult to measure and it is not possible to attribute poverty
outcomes to one sector alone. Hence, targets on revenue collection rates were proposed as an
appropriate measure of progress since a percentage of these revenues is shared among local
stakeholders. In recent years, the level of timber royalties redistributed to stakeholders has been
affected by poor performance in revenue collection and unpredictable sector financing. The
publication of bi-annual disbursement reports was therefore considered to be an appropriate
means of verification for the poverty impact target since the reports would indicate revenue
collection rates and their distribution. Disclosure of revenue disbursements at the local level is a
prior action under DPO-2. To better realize potential poverty impacts, local communities will be
encouraged to monitor spending of revenues received by District Assemblies and traditional
authorities21. Regional and national fora will help provide platforms for multi-stakeholder
engagement in policy dialogue and help to build trust among actors.22 There are two main
outcomes expected under this focal area in DPO-2, and they are transparency for communities on
revenue distribution and more active participation of communities in natural resource
management.

66. Status of DPO-2 Prior Actions. The first of the prior actions for DPO-2, the VPA,
contributes to ensuring effective law enforcement. The negotiations for the VPA were
successfully concluded and it was signed in September 2008. Local and international civil
society organizations and other relevant stakeholders played important roles during the
negotiations. The Cabinet approved the resubmission of the agreement to the new Ghana
Parliament for approval in April 2009. The second prior action is related to the objective of
ensuring predictable and sustainable financing of the forest and wildlife sector. The Forestry
Commission initiated the implementation of the financial framework developed under DPO-1,
including the introduction of a 2% export levy and an increase in forest fees (Table 3).




21Guidelines for the use of timber royalties at local level have been prepared by MLFM/MLNR and are being
  discussed with the MLGRD. Once these have been approved, their implementation and monitoring may also
  become a target under this objective.
22The success of the regional fora in 2007 prompted a discussion about whether they should widen the issues
  discussed to also cover mining sector issues or Natural Resources more broadly.

67. DPO-3 Indicative Triggers and Key actions beyond DPO 3. Following on the policy
actions under DPO-2, the indicative trigger for DPO-3 with regard to institutional strengthening
and governance is piloting the wood tracking system with three commercial companies, in
accordance with the agreed VPA roadmap.23 The indicative trigger related to promoting
equitable resource access rights and benefits to all segments of society is dissemination ­ at the
district level - of bi-annual revenue disbursement reports within one month of their publication
by the Forestry Commission, thereby actively supporting greater transparency and awareness of
the current uses of forest revenues (Table 4).




23The VPA contains annexes detailing the supporting measures required for its successful implementation as well as
  an implementation schedule for these measures. A Joint Monitoring and Review Mechanism will use these to
  develop an operational plan and roadmap for VPA implementation.

Component 2: Mining sector revenue collection, management and transparency, and social
issues affecting forestry and mining communities

68. Progress under DPO-1. The policy actions initiated under DPO-1 include measures to
improve the availability of information on the sector, institutional strengthening, address social
issues related to mining, improve support to the small-scale mining sector, and improve revenue
collection, management and transparency. Specific achievements include improvements to the
geological survey information management system. The long term goal is to upload data to the
web site of the Minerals Commission to make it more easily accessible to investors and others.
Simultaneously, working together with international expertise, the Minerals Commission is
putting in place a modern mineral rights cadastre (licensing system), in line with the 2006
Minerals and Mining Act (Act 703). Easily accessibly geological data and a fully automated
cadastre will help to improve the mineral licensing system and the award of mining exploration
licenses and concessions. With regard to the institutional strengthening policy objective, the
Minerals Commission, including all of its departments and divisions, has drawn up a first-phase
human resources development plan for 2008-2009. To improve cross-sectoral collaboration, a
workshop involving the key stakeholder agencies engaged in the mining sector reviewed roles
and responsibilities with respect to a range of topics including asset verification, environmental
permitting, distribution of royalties, compensation to employment, health, and water issues26.
The Minerals Commission has also launched consultations with a wide-range of stakeholders on
compensation and mine closure/post closure arrangements.

69. Areas of Focus in DPO-2. Minerals Commission continues to fully own the mining sector
policy matrix, which it originally developed under DPO-1. However, realizing the need to
prioritize actions, and in line with MOFEP`s request that the NREG sector agencies rationalize
and streamline the policy matrix, Minerals Commission pared down the number of
policy/program objectives from eight to five, concentrating on the critical sector policy and
institution-related areas. These are outlined below.

        Institutional Strengthening in the Mining Sector. The ultimate outcome of this
objective is to enhance the capacity of the staff of the mineral sector agencies (Minerals
Commission, Geological Survey Department, Inspectorate Division of Mining, the Ministry,
etc.) to deal with the difficult and complex challenges facing the mining sector. The outcome
indicator chosen to measure this is, % of licenses processed within the time limit provided in
the 2006 Minerals and Mining Act (Act 703), which is an important indicator of the investment
climate and ease of doing business for private investors in the minerals sector as well as Minerals
Commission`s capacity to facilitate this in a timely manner. This objective also focuses on a
wider-range of training and human resources development activities under Minerals
Commission`s 2008-2009 Human Resources Development Plan, which is currently being
updated. This will help ensure that Minerals Commission staff have the requisite skills to
respond to sector governance issues and address the varied challenges in the mining sector.

        Reduce Social Conflict Issues in Mining Communities and Improve Support to Small
Scale Mining (SSM). The outcomes expected under this objective include (a) enhanced mining
community benefits; and (b) improved performance of Small Scale Mining (in terms of working
conditions, use of techniques, legal compliance, and environmental reclamation) through the
eventual establishment of cooperatives. With regards to enhanced mining community benefits ,
the focus is on developing and implementing ­ with the participation of impacted communities
and other actors ­ social responsibility guidelines in the mining sector. These will provide
guidance to large-scale mining companies on how to engage with mining communities to ensure
that communities are properly informed about planned or ongoing mining operations and to
ensure that communities and companies work together to see that the mine benefits the
community. These guidelines could eventually make up a community development policy, or
alternatively be part of a so called model agreement between communities and companies,
attached to the mining regulations, and applicable to all future Mineral Development
Agreements. Accompanying the social responsibility guidelines is the establishment of a tracking
mechanism--in the form of an annual survey and database--to record the level of
actual/perceived conflicts and other issues as decided in consultation with the mining
communities.

        With regard to improved performance of Small Scale Mining, the Minerals Commission
will continue to explore areas ­ three are currently being surveyed ­ with known mineralization
that are suitable and can be set aside specifically for Small Scale Mining. This should reduce the
incidence of Small Scale Mining trespassing onto large-scale mining concessions, facilitate
organization of cooperatives, and targeting of training and extension services offered by the
government. Tenders for the reclamation of areas degraded by small-scale mining, including
Ajakamanso in the Western Region, have also been prepared, with a focus on agricultural
reclamation and oil palm development. In addition, further collaboration with the Communities

                                                 31

and Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (CASM) Partnership and the Bank Group`s Community
Development Facility will be pursued.

         Improve Mining Sector Revenue Collection, Management, and Transparency. The
ultimate outcome expected under this objective is improved governance of mining sector
revenues. A key outcome indicator to measure success is a reduction in the revenue gap, i.e.,
the difference in amounts paid by mining companies and actual amounts due by mining
companies. As mentioned above, currently, due to lack of capacity and coordination between
agencies involved in the formulation of the mining sector revenue policy, and agencies
responsible for revenue collection and auditing, it is likely that not all revenue due to the
government is being captured. The creation of the Mining Revenue Task Force in 2009 has
brought agencies together and allows the institutions that understand the mining fiscal regime to
work closely with the parties responsible for collecting the revenue (i.e., Internal Revenue
Service) to ensure that GOG is receiving tax and royalty payments in accordance with the legal
basis. The fiscal models also enable the Task Force agencies to carry out rapid controls and
take appropriate action (e.g. audit) in the event of (major) discrepancies. In implementing EITI
in the mining sector, Ghana is now focusing attention at the local (District and municipal) level,
including publication at the local level of revenue received from the mining sector together with
guidelines--development of which is being led by the Minerals Commission--on how District
Assemblies should use the resources (e.g., for development purposes rather than on recurrent
costs). The Minerals Commission is also liaising with the Ghana EITI Secretariat on the
establishment of a first local EITI office, in Tarkwa.

         Enhanced Policy and Regulatory Framework and Effective Coordination among Key
Government Agencies to Improve the Performance of the Mining Sector. The ultimate
outcome of this objective is to ensure that the policy and regulatory framework for the mining
sector is in place and in line with international good practice, and compliance with
environmental standards is improved. Key outcome indicators to measure success include the
number of reports (as required under the law and regulations) submitted by the mining
companies and regular financing for the Minerals Commission from the Minerals Development
Fund. Policy actions include finalization and adoption of the draft regulations that will
operationalize the 2006 Minerals and Mining Act (Act 703); review and adoption by the
Government of the draft Mining Policy prepared by the Minerals Commission; and adoption of a
Minerals Development Fund Bill. With NREG support, the Minerals Commission has already
engaged an international mining legal/fiscal specialist to help review and strengthen draft mining
regulations.27 Coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency on new standards for the
mining sector is also being pursued, and lessons learned from the SEA and EIA work carried out
with the EC funded Mining Sector Support Project will be incorporated.



27With regard to the draft fiscal regulation, in particular, and the wider mining fiscal regime in general, the
  conclusion of the review is that Ghana`s statutory fiscal regime is internationally competitive and the proposed
  royalty regime is in line with international norms (i.e., sliding scale royalty of 3 to 6 %). However, operational
  costs, which drive the level of royalty paid, need to be better clarified, and collection capacity strengthened. In
  addition, negotiation of mining agreements that allow for special concessions (i.e., deviation from parameters
  outlined in the law) and long stabilization periods (permitted under the law) explain why Ghana`s effective tax
  rate on paper may deviate from actual effective tax rates under negotiated agreements.

                                                         32

         Enhance International and Regional Cooperation. The ultimate outcome of this
objective is to ensure compliance by Ghana with its obligations through international
agreements, in particular the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. This is important for
Ghana`s reputation internationally in terms of it being clear to the international community and
diamond consumers that Ghana`s diamonds are conflict free. Registration of small-scale
diamond miners in line with the certification scheme is expected to be progressively increased to
ensure that Ghana continues to meet the Kimberley standards.

70. Status of DPO-2 Prior Actions. DPO-2 Prior Actions focused on: (a) addressing social
issues in mining communities; and (b) improving mining sector revenue management and
transparency. With respect to addressing social issues, the Minerals Commission has taken a
participatory approach ­ including consultation with a wide-range of local and national
stakeholders ­ in the development of guidelines and practical tools to improve relationships
between mining companies and the neighboring communities. This includes a series of
consultations undertaken in communities around the country`s large-scale mines.28 The
consultations confirmed the need for guidelines and for strengthened policies regarding
community engagement and for improved channels of communication between mining
companies and communities. Moreover, stakeholders recommended inter-alia that needs and
impact assessments be systematically undertaken by companies upfront ­ and with the active
participation of the communities themselves ­ as social responsibility programs are considered,
and that disbursement of corporate voluntary contributions be fully transparent. A summary of
the consultations is available on Minerals Commission`s web site. With respect to improving
mining sector revenue management and transparency the multi-agency Mining Revenue Task
Force is fully functional29. The Task Force has developed an action plan that includes activities
aimed at carrying out joint audits, production of mine fiscal models, international
benchmarking of fiscal regimes to determine Ghana`s international competitiveness, and training
needs (e.g., on auditing). A first mine fiscal model for the Chirano gold mine is also
functional. The model is allowing GOG/the Task Force to estimate and project the amount of
taxes, royalties, dividends, fees, import duties, etc. that the mine should be generating and
compare this with actual revenues/tax payments received. Table 5 shows the status of prior
actions for DPO-2.




28 Consultations included farmers, settlers, youth, women`s groups, Traditional Authorities, Unit Committee
Members, District/Municipal Assemblies, mining companies, civil society organizations, security forces, and
artisanal and small-scale miners.
29Participation includes MOFEP, the Revenue Agencies Governing Board (Revenue Agencies Governing Board),
Internal Revenue Service/Large Taxpayer Unit, Customs Excise and Prevention Service, VAT, Office of the
Administrator of Stool Lands, EITI, and Minerals Commission.

71. DPO-3 Indicative Triggers and Key Actions beyond DPO3. The indicative triggers for
DPO-3 that relates to addressing social issues in mining communities is the preparation of the
guidelines on social responsibility in mining activities, which will be based on the feedback
gathered from mining sector stakeholders. The indicative trigger on improving mining revenue
collection, management, and transparency is for the Mining Revenue Task Force action plan to
be satisfactorily implemented, particularly the action to conduct a collaborative pilot audit of one
mine (Table 6) and the development of additional mine fiscal models. The first pilot audit will
involve all relevant agencies (e.g., Minerals Commission, Internal Revenue Service, Customs
and Excise Prevention Services, etc.) as collaboration is key to ensuring that the fiscal regime for
the mine has been applied and assessed correctly, allowing GOG to determine whether the
amount of taxes and royalties that should be paid have actually been paid. It is expected that
fiscal models for all of the large mines will be developed over the next 8-12 months and that
joint audits would be extended as necessary based on the results of the mine fiscal modeling.

Component 3: Mainstreaming Environment into Growth

72. Progress under DPO-1. Measures were taken to improve the coordination of environmental
policy, and capacity for environmental management and regulation. A draft concept paper on an
inter-ministerial forum was prepared, and in the 2009 Budget Speech, the creation of an
Environment Advisory Council was announced. It is understood that the Council to be chaired
by the Vice-President will facilitate the resolution of cross-sectoral environmental matters at
ministerial level. A roadmap was prepared for a Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP)
for Ghana, which includes multi-stakeholder consultation and dialogue processes. A draft
strategic plan for the Environmental Protection Agency is being updated, and a working paper on
the revision of environmental fees and levies charged by the Environmental Protection Agency is
under preparation. Training and capacity building has been provided to 24 districts, but the
establishment of decentralized Natural Resource and Environment Departments offices did not
progress. Following the transfer of the Environmental Protection Agency from the MLGRDE to
the MEST in 2009, new functional relationships will need to be developed, both at central,
regional and at decentralized district level.

73. The Environmental Protection Agency has continued to promote and mainstream the use of
Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs) across Government as a key tool to assess policies
and inform decision-making, building on the experience of the SEA of GPRS I and II.
Subsequent SEAs have included the water and sanitation, energy, transport, mining, and
agricultural development sectors, and ­ during DPO-1 ­ an additional SEA on the tourism sector
was prepared. A lesson-learning review of experiences with SEA in Ghana was also undertaken,
and it will be subject to international peer review, including in the context of an international

                                                     35

conference on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) hosted in Accra in May 2009. Efforts to
simplify EIA permitting continued through the computerization of processes and the
decentralization of EIA Technical Review Committees, which have now been established in all
ten regions. Terms of Reference for an Environmental Degradation Study were prepared and
circulated for comment. The Ghana Environment Outlook report for 2008 was completed and is
ready for publication.

74. Climate change has been recognized as an increasingly important and urgent area for
environmental policy. A draft National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy has been prepared,
and in consultation with stakeholders, ten priority action program areas have been identified,
including linkages with health. The Government has established a Climate Change Committee,
and Ghana has represented its national interests at international fora, including the UNFCCC
meetings.

75. Areas of Focus in the DPO-2. The environment matrix now includes six focus areas rather
than the eight included under DPO-1. The program/policy objectives in relation to SEA and EIA,
which were separate, have now been combined under the second program/policy objective. Each
of the areas of focus is described below (see also Annex 2 for details).

        Cross-sectoral natural resource and environmental management and partnerships:
DPO-2 will support GOG actions to improve cross sectoral coordination, policy coherence and
integration of environment into policies, programs and budgets. A new inter-ministerial advisory
panel on environment is expected to meet and address key inter-sectoral challenges. This is being
addressed under the MDBS dialog. The SDAP will help inform the plans of sector agencies, as
well as long term development planning by NDPC.

        Strategic Planning for Environmental Institutions: The Ghana Environment Sector
Study (GESS) identified priorities and opportunities to strengthen the Environmental Protection
Agency in terms of its institutional role and organizational development. This needs to be
embedded in a process of strengthening the related ministerial function on environment as a
whole. The Environmental Protection Agency planning needs to be linked to resourcing in a
more comprehensive and systematic manner. Previous shifts in the ministerial function (e.g., the
dissolution of MEST and transfer of environmental policy to MLGRDE under the previous
administration) have resulted in a lack of clarity on function and weakened policy and delivery
capacity. A strategic planning process for the Environmental Protection Agency and the
ministerial environmental function will build on the earlier Agency strategic plan and NEAP to
define future resourcing and delivery plans, as well as core mandates, key functions, and
capacity building needs. Development of a draft Sustainable Development Action Plan, update
of the strategic plan for Environmental Protection Agency, and establishment of an inter-
ministerial committee on environment will be achieved under DPO-2.

        National Environmental Monitoring and Reporting: The GESS identifies a number of
ongoing environmental monitoring, data collection, and information management activities.
However, data are not yet systematically collected, stored, analyzed, or shared across agencies
and among districts. A consolidated reporting system is needed to provide information that can
be made accessible to relevant national, sectoral and district agencies, as well as civil society.

                                                36

This is will be particularly important at decentralized levels to assist in early warning of climate
change associated and other natural hazards and potential disasters (including chemical and toxic
waste hazards that the Environmental Protection Agency has successfully averted in the past).
Reinforcing environmental monitoring and information management will enable more regular
reporting on the state of the environment and cost of environmental degradation. Agreeing
mechanisms for public access to environmental information will also enhance both public
awareness and engagement with policy development and delivery. DPO-2 targets would include
the development of indicators for the Sustainable Development Action Plan.

        Decentralized Environmental Management: Environmental Protection Agency's key
service delivery process is the EIA, which results in the issuance of permits and certificates as
well as monitoring of Environmental Management Plans. The demand for permits and
certificates has been growing steadily. Applications for permits and certificates increased from
515 in 2002 to 1,555 in 2005, with about 50 percent coming from within the Greater Accra
region, highlighting the importance of the Agency`s decentralized strategy for EIA permitting.
Under DPO-2 the capacity to apply Strategic Environmental Assessment, including full
disclosure and consultation, will be developed in a third of all Districts and mainstreamed in
District Medium Term Development Plans; and EIA procedures will be decentralized to ten
Regional and three District EPA offices.

        Climate Change: The importance and urgency of addressing climate change have been
recognized by policymakers in Ghana, but a more systematic response across GOG remains to be
fully developed. A second national communication to the UNFCCC is in preparation, while
ongoing research on climate impacts will contribute towards the development of the national
adaptation strategy. Ghana will also need to develop national and sector specific climate change
policies, legislation, programs, and strategies. Climate change response also needs to incorporate
geographical dimensions, especially in the northern region where some of the most severe
impacts are likely to be felt among some of the poorest and most vulnerable groups. DPO-2 will
support the development of a comprehensive climate change strategy for Ghana, a multi-
stakeholder policy dialogue, the mobilization of a domestic constituency, and a shift towards
more climate-resilient development systems.

        National Environmental Assessment System: In 2003, in connection with the
formulation of GPRS I, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Development
Planning Commission led a number of SEAs. Subsequently, GOG decided to develop SEA at
the district level, focusing on pilots in selected districts, and to introduce SEA to selected key
sectors such as energy, water, and agriculture, and to build capacity across a broad range of
stakeholders to ensure they play an effective role in these processes. Under DPO-2 two more
SEAs will be completed. A SEA on the oil sector is a trigger to be completed in 2009.

76. Status of DPO-2 Prior Actions The Environmental Protection Agency has met the two prior
actions. A draft national climate change adaptation strategy has been prepared by EPA. It will be
completed in 2009, and a climate change mitigation strategy will be developed in 2010.
Additionally, an SEA on tourism policy has been prepared, and an international peer review of
an assessment of SEA experience in Ghana carried out in May 2009 (Table 7). The review
includes social issues, the consultation process and complementarities with the EIA process.

77. DPO-3 Indicative Triggers and Key Actions beyond DPO3. Following on the policy
actions under DPO-2, the first indicative trigger for DPO-3, which is related to improving cross-
sectoral environmental management, is Cabinet approval of the climate change adaptation
strategy. The other indicative trigger associated with enhancing the reach and impact of
environmental assessment is the preparation of a SEA for the oil sector. The SEA would
complement on-going site specific EIA work the Environmental Protection Agency undertakes
to determine the potential site-specific impacts of oil and gas exploration and development as it
provides information on the potential cumulative environmental and social impacts of the oil
sector. The Environmental Protection Agency currently uses the provisions of the Environmental
Assessment Regulations (1999) and the Environmental Assessment in Ghana Guidelines (1995)
to ensure that the oil industry complies with EIA procedures for planning and implementation of
investments before issuing environmental permits. As part of the SEA for the oil sector,
guidelines for monitoring and other environmental management activities specific to the oil
sector would be developed. The Environmental Protection Agency, in collaboration with the
Government of Norway, is currently undertaking baseline surveys to collect information on the
physical environment, biological environment, socioeconomics, etc. It is also updating the
existing oil contingency/emergency response plan for the oil sector.

                A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT


78. Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA). The aim of a two-phased approach to the
PSIA is to provide evidence with which policy makers and other stakeholders can inform their
discussions with the range of actors engaged in the natural resource management debate in
Ghana. Hence, each phase is being closely coordinated with the design of the program and the
policy dialogue among government, civil society, private sector and DPs. An initial Poverty and
Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) was completed in 2008. This provided valuable inputs, including
stakeholders` perceptions of, and engagement with, the NREG program. The first phase also
identified some of the key risks confronting NREG implementation and identified core strategies
for mitigating these risks. A summary is provided in Box 5.

79. A second phase of the PSIA, to be conducted with DFID support in 2009, will enable
disaggregated analysis to identify specific groups and geographical areas that are likely to be


                                                     39

subject to the greatest impacts. This will facilitate targeting of appropriate response measures. It
will examine the extent to which risks identified in the first PSIA have been mitigated and also
assess and identify any additional risks that have been encountered. For example, failure to
implement the forestry VPA risks a hard landing` if the forestry sector dwindles rapidly in the
face of unrestricted illegal logging, with major degradation in ecosystem services and foregone
carbon payments affecting community livelihoods and revenue streams. This will require
substantive consideration of, e.g., the deficit in timber supply, investment in small enterprise and
emerging forest income mechanisms.


                         Box 3: Summary Findings of Stakeholder and Risk Analysis
       Stakeholders. The three sectors covered by the NREG Program have a wide range of stakeholders. In
       addition to government (e.g., Forestry Commission, Minerals Commission, EPA, etc.), primary
       stakeholders include communities, Traditional Authorities, Stools, large corporate entities, small and
       micro-enterprises, artisanal miners, and chainsaw operators. Many local-level actors, while impacted by
       policies, are distant from the policy process and not sufficiently involved or adequately consulted in
       decision-making. The result has in large part been disinterest or opposition, which can lead to conflicts.
       Important stakeholders, such as CSOs and the media, have not always been sufficiently consulted and
       engaged in policy decisions in the three sectors. The NREG program offers an immense opportunity for,
       and has engendered, an elaborate stakeholder engagement process between GOG, DPs, CSOs, and primary
       stakeholders at all levels.
       Risks. Five principal risks have been identified: (a) institutional risks (caused by weak institutions, limited
       capacity, and lack of resources); (b) increased social conflict; (c) increased poverty and vulnerability; (d)
       reduced investment and growth; and (e) climate change impacts. Social conflict is at the heart of the risk
       scenario. The underpinning causes of social conflict include: (i) discretionary power due to weak,
       confusing, or in some areas non-existent rights, (ii) weak policy, legislative, and regulatory frameworks;
       (iii) inadequate access rights, incentives and compensations, (iv) unconventional enforcement practices, and
       (v) human rights abuses. For instance, the poor collection rates of taxes and revenues, and the rural elite
       capture of revenues can lead to conflicts between the private sector, communities and the state and its
       agencies. Unclear guidelines, for example on compensation for displacement or damage to prime
       community-based resources (e.g., water) have led to mistrust, which in turn leads to frustration, and
       occasionally proceeds to violence. The consequences of social conflicts can be devastating in terms of
       international reputation, decline in investment, and Ghana`s progress toward the MDGs.
       Risk Mitigation Measures. Strategies identified for mitigating risks include:
        - Meaningful, timely and effective consultation with communities,
       - Community based monitoring systems built into the enhanced policy and regulatory frameworks for
       mining and forestry sectors.
       - Social protection arrangements to support compensation and displacement packages for poor people
       during transition periods to ensure they have adequate livelihoods..
       - A realistic and comprehensive, macro-level alternative livelihood strategy, incorporating
       responsibilities and approaches across several MDAs.
       - A systematic review of all current skills development and social protection packages to see how these can
       be broadened and transferred to rural communities that are negatively impacted (in terms of livelihoods) by
       tighter, more rigorously enforced, regulatory environments in forestry and mining
       - Actively involve forest-dependent communities by clarifying and securing their tenure, property, and
       carbon rights and removing barriers to transparent, inclusive and accountable forest governance.
       - Increasing the share of benefits accruing to local communities from both the mining and forest sectors
   - Increased transparency and accountability concerning the sharing of revenues

                 B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

80. Environmental Impacts. An overarching objective of the NREG program is to achieve
positive environmental impacts. However, there is a possibility that some outcomes could lead to
unintended negative effects if insufficient due diligence to environmental impact is pursued
during implementation. For example: (a) new investment in the forest and wildlife and mining
sectors; or (b) diversification of the mineral production base leading to increased mineral
exploitation. However, NREG reduces risks by heightening attention to environmental impacts.
Also environmental implications of targets and triggers that could entail risk of environmental
damage is undertaken during annual progress reviews and during ongoing sector dialog.
Additionally, Ghana`s experience of SEA is also being reviewed to consolidate good practice
and inform inter-sectoral planning and implementation.

81. Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA). Ghana`s experience of SEA practice and
institutionalization of this approach is under independent review and will inform the
consolidation of country systems to address such concerns. The evolution of the NREG sector
budget support has attracted considerable favorable attention from the OECD-DAC Taskforce on
SEA and Environment in 2008, as well as in the World Bank-convened workshop on Country
Environmental Analysis. A case study on this is being included in the 2009 DAC Taskforce
report on implementation of SEA Guidelines for Development Cooperation.30

                 C. IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION


82. NREG Steering Committee. GOG has established a high-level NREG Steering Committee,
which meets at the Ministerial level (MOFEP, Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, and
Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology) for the purpose of taking policy and strategic
decisions needed to implement the NREG program.

83. NREG Technical Coordination Committee. This committee supported by a Technical
Secretariat, and provides guidance and facilitates overall policy dialogue, coordinates cross-
cutting issues, and organizes annual reviews of the NREG-PAF. The Technical Coordination
Committee is led by MOFEP (with MOFEP also responsible for the Technical Secretariat) and
includes representatives of the relevant MDAs and the National Development Planning
Commission (NDPC).

84. The ENR Sector Group. This group consists of all DPs intervening in the ENR sectors. The
group is chaired by the Government. The purpose of the ENR sector group is to ensure a full
donor harmonized approach to the environment and natural resources sector.




30The EPA is hosting the May 2009 conference of the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA). This
  will feature many Ghana and NREG-related presentations and discussions, including strategic environmental
  assessment for oil and Social Impact Assessment.

                                                     41

85. Annual Sector Reviews. The ENR Sector Group is used as a forum to address issues related
to the NREG program, and the annual sector review of the ENR Sector Group contributes to the
NREG (and related MDBS) performance assessment process, in line with the annual budget
cycle. As with the MDBS, the NREG Technical Coordination Committee and DPs have agreed
to hold at least two joint meetings per year: one in the first semester to discuss the results of the
annual review of the NREG PAF, and one in the second semester to update the PAF for the
following years; discuss the execution of the annual work plans and budgets of the MDAs
involved in the NREG program during the first half of the year; review the audit reports as
regards the previous year; and discuss special policy, strategy, and reform issues. All NREG
consultations and assessments will be open to all DPs who are a member of the ENR Sector
Group, whether or not they provide sectoral budget support.

86. Modalities for DP Disbursement. Actual disbursements by DPs for the NREG program
could be less than the amounts programmed if the joint assessment exercise reveals that prior
actions and targets in the PAF have not been achieved. The overall set up of the disbursement
modalities is spelt out in the Framework Memorandum (Annex 4). Detailed disbursement
arrangements for each DP are reflected in individual financing agreements. All NREG
disbursements are contingent upon satisfactory progress in the implementation of the GPRS II
and satisfactory IMF assessment of the macroeconomic framework, as expressed in the
MDBS/PRSC dialogue. DP disbursements are aligned with the budget cycle and, in line with the
Framework Memorandum, commitment amounts for the coming year are estimated and
conveyed to GOG ahead of budget preparation for the coming year. The main modalities of DP
disbursement are as follows:

        EKN and DFID: both agencies disburse single annual tranches, on the basis of a
satisfactory holistic assessment of the three matrices. Satisfactory progress with VPA
implementation is particularly important for DFID.
        AFD: AFD disburses, after a holistic review of the PAF, a single annual performance
tranche based on the assessment of the triggers of the forestry matrix, although the funds will not
be ear-marked specifically for the sub-sector related to these triggers (e.g., forestry).
        EC: the EC will disburse single tranches for the financial years 2009 and 2010, based one
trigger per sub-sector, selected among the triggers agreed in the PAF for 2011 and 2012.
        IDA: the Bank will disburse a single annual tranche based on satisfactory implementation
of the overall Government program in the three sectors, with a special emphasis on prior actions
highlighted in the NREG.

87. National M&E Framework. The National Development Planning Commission (NDPC)
monitors GPRS II implementation and has overall responsibility for M&E in line with GPRS II
objectives. To this end, NDPC has issued guidelines for sectoral as well as district M&E systems
in Ghana. Accordingly, MDAs and DPs work closely with NDPC to ensure that the NREG M&E
arrangements are aligned with core national indicators and the sectors` reporting requirements.
Under the leadership of MOFEP, M&E systems for natural resources and environmental
governance will be aligned and harmonized with the national M&E framework and will build on
the guidelines produced by NDPC. Terms of reference for technical assistance to development a
consolidated approach to M&E within the NREG MDAs are currently under preparation and
consultant services will be contracted by GOG in the coming months.

                                                42

88. NREG M&E Framework. In the first instance, an M&E plan will be developed to outline
the policy objectives, baselines, targets and indicators, as well as data acquisition and reporting
methods, and the responsible institutions. It will outline critical assumptions and key risks, and
how information will be used, e.g., for strategic decision making, better planning and budgeting,
improved implementation and reporting, accountability and transparency, or combinations
thereof. The M&E plan will incorporate participatory methods for data collection and analysis,
systems for data processing and storage and presentation of data. It will also define institutional
arrangements, job descriptions, incentives, training needs, as well as a communication strategy to
ensure that information on the status and impacts of GOG`s program to improve natural resource
management and environmental governance reaches key stakeholders and the general public.
The plan is expected to be completed by 2009 and then implemented by all participating MDAs
in a coordinated manner. Additional tools, such as enhancing GOG`s capacity to track the cost of
environmental degradation, will also be key to tracking progress on overarching NREG program
objectives.
89. Annual NREG Assessment. More specific to the year-on-year tracking of progress under
the NREG program, M&E is undertaken through the annual environment and natural resources
sector review, which is led by GOG, as well as via the joint GOG-DP annual assessment of prior
actions and triggers in the PAF. A set of three year and five year outcomes has been developed
by each sector agency to track progress on policy objectives and outcomes (Annex 3). Following
DPO-3, the Bank`s Implementation Completion and Results Report for the first NREG DPO
series will act as a mid-term review of GOG`s five-year program. If steady progress under the
first DPO series is observed and GOG remains committed to the long-term reform agenda that
NREG is addressing, it is likely that the Bank will remain a committed partner in the NREG
program.

               D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS


90. Public Financial Management Analytical Work. Ghana`s fiduciary environment is
considered adequate for development policy lending. The 2009 draft ERPFM carried out by the
World Bank, together with some of the other DPs that contribute to the MDBS, confirmed the
findings from earlier reports (including a 2006 Public Expenditure Financial Accountability,
PEFA, report) that Ghana has a solid legal and regulatory framework for public financial
management that performs at an average level and occasionally above-average standards. Ghana
scores high in terms of budget alignment to the poverty reduction strategy, as well as in terms of
budget formulation. Ghana`s financial management systems continue to operate in a reliable
manner, even if some weaknesses remain. Existing expenditure commitment controls and
reporting systems have contributed to improved fiscal management, with timelier execution of
the budget, including the automatic releases of items 2 (administration) and 3 (services) which
began in 2008. A summary assessment of the country`s budget credibility and the quality of
financial reporting is found in Box 4.




                                                43

                     Box 4: Ghana's Public Financial Management System: Key Findings

     The key findings of the 2009 draft ERPFM assessment against six core PFM objectives are as follows:
     Credibility of the Budget. Aggregate expenditure and revenue outturns broadly matched the budget plans,
     but credibility was diminished by variance across budget heads, reflecting weaknesses in budget formulation
     and the treatment of contingencies.
     Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget. This improved considerably over the period 2004-
     2008, through the incorporation in the Budget Statement of information on IGF, direct donor disbursements,
     HIPC and statutory funds. However, in-year reporting was less comprehensive, hampering overall budget
     scrutiny and management.
     Policy-based Budget. While budgets have become more policy-based in recent years, performance is held
     back by limited ability to cost strategies, the lack of effective wage bill planning, and the absence of a
     transparent link between planned and executed budget activities.
     Predictability and Control in Budget Execution. GOG has improved commitment and other internal
     controls, but recognizes weaknesses in management and oversight of control systems.
     Accounting, Recording and Reporting. This is predominantly a paper-based system, resulting in delays and
     data errors. Analytical and technical capacity constraints hamper MOFEP and MDA efforts to monitor and
     analyze budget performance.
     External Scrutiny and Audit. There are now more timely completed accounts and financial statements and
     timely submitted audit reports to the legislature, which in turn is more actively scrutinizing both budget and
     accounts. However, effective follow-up has only just begun, with the Parliament's Public Accounts
     Committee (PAC) active in overseeing the accounts of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of the
     Central Government by carrying out public hearings based on the Auditor General's reports spanning 2002 to
     2005. For those accounts where there was found to be wrongdoing, the PAC submitted their report to the
     courts for the prosecution led by the Attorney General. .

91. Credibility of the Budget. Reducing the deviation between budgeted and actual expenditures
is essential to improve budget credibility according to the draft 2009 ERPFM. Table 14 shows
that total budget deviation has improved since 2004, when actual expenditure exceeded budget
by 12.4 percent, to only 3.2 percent in 2007. Budget credibility at individual MDA level was less
satisfactory. The budget deviation of actual expenditures at the MDA-level (when compared to
the approved budgets) increased from 15.8 percent in 2003 to 36.3 percent in 2006, and dropped
to 21.0 percent in 2007. Low budget credibility of MDAs is due to several factors, including (a)
cash flow problems at the Treasury level; (b) lack of capacity and other implementation
problems at the MDA-level; and (c) changes in priorities at the government level regarding how
to allocate available resources. Strengthening budget preparation of the MDAs through the multi-
annual budgetary frameworks, including all available resources, and better comprehensive
reporting is needed, as is better budget execution.

     Notes: 1. Data cover both discretionary and statutory expenditures, exclude contingency, and measure: (i) individual deviations between
     originally budgeted expenditures and actual expenditure outturns for the 20 largest budget heads; and (ii) total deviations for the
     remaining budget heads as a group.
     2. Figures refer to the absolute value of the difference between actual outturns and original budgeted amount, expressed as % of original
     budgeted amount. For budgeted amounts, the original appropriated amounts were used, excluding supplementary budgets.
     3. Figures refer to the sum of the absolute value of deviations as a proportion of the total (original) budgeted allocation for primary
     expenditure.

92. Treasury Realignment. To address cash flow problems, the Controller and Accountant
General Department (CAGD) has integrated treasuries into the Finance/Accounts Division of
MDAs and Metropolitan Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs). Highlights of
realignment include (a) Treasury staff to be part of MDA; (b) day-to-day administration of
Treasury functions to be within the purview of MDA management; and (c) CAGD will continue
to be responsible for the recruitment and posting of accounting staff to the MDAs and MMDAs.

93. NREG Agencies. Detailed public expenditure and revenue analysis of the budgets of these
MDAs have been carried out and some of the results are summarized in Section III. The review
of the budgets, expenditures and financial management systems of the NREG agencies and their
related line ministries assesses the budget execution and its sustainability. The revenue analysis
study examines the sources and predictability of funding and the potential that each sector has
for raising more public revenue.

94. Financial Reporting. Timely, comprehensive, and reliable reporting on actual annual
expenditures is a crucial element of monitoring NREG program implementation. The Financial
Administration Act requires the Controller and Accountant General to submit its Annual
Financial Statements for audit within three months after the end of the year. Since 2003, the
Controller and Accountant General has been able to respect that deadline.31 However, the
financial statements are prepared for the Consolidated Fund and for some other funds. It does not
include funds established by or under an Act of Parliament, details of donor project expenditure
and retained IGF. It is important for the financial statements to have the same coverage as the
approved budget to ensure accountability for the use of all funds and properly measure
performance. An agreement on the NREG program includes a commitment by GOG to provide a

comprehensive overview of all expenditures of the MDAs concerned on a yearly basis within
three months after the closure of the financial year.

95. Actions Taken by GOG. As part of the Public Sector Reform Program, GOG has aimed to
strengthen central government structures and organizations by introducing programs to make
them more efficient, effective, and private sector-friendly. PFM laws, namely, the Financial
Administration Act of 2003, the Internal Audit Agency Act of 2003, and the Public Procurement
Act of 2003, have been enacted to regulate the use of public funds. New approaches in the scope,
timing, and quality of reporting on budget management have also been introduced and the
Accounting Manual and Departmental Accounting Instructions updated. A computerized budget
and public expenditure management system is being installed in Accra and in three regional
capitals, while a computerized payroll management system is currently being established. Lastly,
two Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys, for education and health, were completed in
September 2008, and provide valuable advice on how to improve budget execution. GOG
continues therefore to improve the quality of its public financial management, with efforts to
develop more efficient data collection systems, and to bring greater transparency in the use of
funds.

96. NREG Policy Matrix and PFM. One of the objectives of the NREG program is to improve
PFM as it relates to the three sectors (including accounting systems, audits, and revenue
collection). This will ultimately have the end-program outcome of greater transparency of
financial flows relevant to natural resources and environment sectors, more efficient and
effective use of available funds, and an increased level of budget allocation and revenue
collection. Targets related to this objective can draw upon ERPFM diagnostic work, which
identifies short- and medium-term priority actions, as well as technical assistance provided on a
regular basis by EKN as regards strengthening financial management of the MDAs involved in
NREG. Monitoring of budget execution will be done in parallel with MDBS/PRSC supervision
missions, with the MDBS/PRSC focusing on aggregate fiscal spending and the NREG program
focusing on the implementation of the individual budget programs of the relevant MDAs.

97. Procurement. A new Public Procurement Act came into force in 2004 providing the legal
framework for a public procurement system based on transparent and fair competition, and clear
and comprehensive procurement procedures and regulations. A Public Procurement Board (PPB)
assigned to monitor the application of the new law and to regulate public procurement became
operational in October 2005. The 2009 ERPFM includes an assessment of Ghana`s procurement
practices. The review concluded that the legal and institutional foundations for sound public
procurement are now in place in Ghana, but that continued efforts still need to be made to build
capacity and institutionalize the processes now laid down in all the ministries, departments and
agencies of the Government. While part of the challenge is on the supply side ­ creating a cadre
of experienced procurement professionals ­ the PPB assessments also point towards a demand
side problem that ultimately has to be addressed, namely the low status senior management
assigns to the procurement function. Although entities are more aware that there is a well defined
set of rules for public procurement, watched over by the PPB and statutorily enforced, many are
still not giving the procurement function the importance it deserves. This in turn is part of a
larger issue discussed regarding the priority given to all aspects of PFM, and the recognition that
PFM is not just about rules compliance, but a vital underpinning of public entity performance.

98. Monitoring public procurement practices. The draft 2009 ERPFM strongly supports the
continued use of the PPB`s procurement assessment tool, the PPME. Of particular interest is the
proportion of public procurement subject to open, competitive bidding on a transaction basis,
which in the 2007 report declined to only about one-quarter, down from around one-half in the
2006 report.32 These two estimates however are not entirely comparable. The 2006 sample was
skewed toward larger public sector entities, more likely to follow competitive processes, while
the sample of entities reviewed in the 2007 assessment appears to be more representative,
containing a large number of entities procuring smaller amounts and therefore relying
disproportionally on price quotation as a procurement method.33 This information will continue
therefore to draw increasing attention. There are two main reasons why. First, the share of
procurement following competitive procedures is a critical measure of the effectiveness of the
system as a whole. Second, given donor interest in the greater use of country systems, it will be
important to measure and track the ratio of open and competitive bidding to total procurement on
a total value basis. The review recommends therefore that the proportion of public procurement
that is open to competitive bidding be monitored by value. The most important improvement to
procurement practice needs however to go beyond actions by the PPB and include clear
incentives and sanctions by MOFEP. The first step is to have final public procurement plans for
the MDAs submitted to the Public Procurement Board (PPB) soon after the approval of the
appropriation law by Parliament. These procurement plans would then provide the basis for
budget releases by CAGD to these MDAs.

99. Central Bank of Ghana. The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment of the Bank of Ghana
in 2003. The assessment recommended that the Bank of Ghana should address vulnerabilities in
the external audit, financial reporting, internal audit, and internal control areas. The Ghanaian
authorities have confirmed that all of the proposed measures were implemented. Also, the IMF
has found that the new central bank law of 2002 places the Bank of Ghana on a more solid legal
foundation by giving the Central Bank more independence, limiting the government`s access to
bank resources, providing improved auditing functions, and introducing price stability and
inflation targeting as the Central Bank`s primary objectives.

100.Independent Auditing. The draft 2009 ERPFM report concludes that the audit statements of
the Auditor General are of reasonable quality, but that the performance as regards the timeliness
of the audits is not up to the same standards. Annual financial statements of the CF and the



32In either case, Ghana still ranks below the threshold for an A score under the PEFA methodology, which requires
  that more than 75 percent of the procurement contracts be awarded on an open competitive basis. An A, B, or C
  score requires that either more than 50 percent, or less than 50 percent of the procurement contracts, respectively,
  be awarded on an open competitive basis. This means that while in 2006 Ghana was on the borderline between a
  B and C score, in 2007 Ghana scored a clear C on the PEFA indicator for competition, value for money and
  controls in procurement` (PI-19 indicator). The PEFA ranking for this same indicator for other countries in Africa
  is the following: Rwanda, A; Mauritius, B+; Kenya, B; Cote d`Ivoire, C. Rwanda ranks particularly high under
  this indicator with 82 percent of contract in 2006 awarded on the basis of open competition, accounting for 73
  percent of the total value of contracts above the threshold awarded during that year.
33For instance, half of the entities in the sample in the 2007 assessment (258 out of 515 entities) were located
  outside the regional capitals, while none of the entities were located outside the regional capitals in the 2006
  assessment.

MDAs are to be prepared and audited within six months after the closure of the financial year.
The 2004 Auditor General reports were sent to Parliament in October 2005 (for MDAs) and
December 2005 (for the CF). The audit report did not include the IGF retained by the MDA,
which represents about 5 percent of total government revenue (no information is provided
whether or not the audits of the MDAs covered all retained IGF). Most MDAs are not producing
financial statements as required by the financial regulations. The Auditor General is therefore
limited to focus on compliance: whether accounts are properly kept, rules and procedures
properly followed, resources expended for the purposes appropriated, and records correctly
maintained. Very few performance audits are undertaken. Audited entities provide a formal
response to the findings and conclusions presented in the audit reports, although the responses
vary in terms of extensiveness and timeliness. The Auditor General keeps a record of its
recommendations and conclusions, the responses from the MDAs, and the actions taken by the
MDA concerned.34

101.Internal Auditing. Following the passage of the Internal Audit Agency Act in 2003,
progress has been encouraging, with the establishment of Internal Audit Units in MDAs and
MMDAs and the submission of quality reports. Under the Act, audit reports and implementation
committees have been created in spending ministries and departments with responsibility of
following up internal and external audit findings. The current business process for BPEMS`
requires the Internal Auditors to approve transactions in the system before a payment is made;
this weakens their independence. There is a need therefore to shift the focus of Internal Auditing
from pre-payment audit to adoption of risk-based audit concentrating on systemic issues with the
objectives of ensuring (a) conformity to GOG`s strategy; (b) effectiveness and efficiency of
operations; (c) reliability of financial reporting; and (d) compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. To meet this objective the major challenge facing the Internal Audit Agency is
attraction and retention of suitably qualified auditors. The Agency has made proposals to the
Head of Civil Service and MOFEP for a special scheme of service for Internal Auditors so that
the required skills and competencies to perform specialized audits can be attracted.
                E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

102.Borrower and Credit Amount. The Borrower is the Republic of Ghana and this operation is
a single-tranche IDA Credit of SDR 6.8 million (US$10 million equivalent) that would be made
available upon effectiveness. Repayment will be in US Dollars.

103.Disbursement Arrangements and Use of Funds. The Credit disbursement will follow the
standard Bank procedures for Development Policy Lending. Once the Credit is approved by the
Board and becomes effective, the Credit amount will be disbursed into a foreign currency
account of the Borrower at Bank of Ghana that forms part of Republic of Ghana`s official
foreign exchange reserves. The equivalent amount in Cedis will immediately be transferred to
the Ghana Government main Cash Account and appropriately recorded in the general operational
Treasury account of the Borrower that is used to finance budgeted expenditures, as the Credit is
intended to be used to support the general government budget. The Borrower will provide to the
Bank a written confirmation within two working days that the proceeds of this Credit have been

received in the foreign reserve account and this transfer has been completed and provide to the
Bank any other relevant information relating to these matters that the Bank may reasonably
request. Disbursements of the loan will not be linked to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the Borrower is required to comply
with the standard negative list of excluded items that may not be financed with Bank Credit
proceeds. In the event that the proceeds of the Credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined
in the Financing Agreement, the equivalent amount of Credit will be cancelled and the Borrower
will be required to refund an amount equal to the amount of the said payment. The
administration of this Credit will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning. Ongoing discussions with the Government on the overall reform program being
supported by this operation will form the basis for reporting on substantive policy issues.
Fiduciary aspects and risks of this operation are discussed elsewhere in this document.

104.Auditing. Financial resources provided as budget support become part of the Consolidated
Fund of the Treasury. The Bank reserves the right to request the GOG to (a) have the transfer of
the foreign exchange proceeds of the Credit into Central Treasury Account and the GOG`s
budget management system audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Association; (b)
furnish to the Association as soon as available, but not later than four months after the date of the
request for such audit, a certified copy of the auditor`s report, of such scope and detail as the
Association shall have reasonably requested, and any additional information concerning the said
account and the treatment of the Credit proceeds by GOG.

                F.   RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION


105.Risks and risk mitigation measures are similar to those discussed in the program document
for DPO-1, and are outlined below:

106.Risks of Weak PFM. MDAs lack adequate capacity to prepare credible and comprehensive
multi-year work plans that are accurately costed. Plans may not be translated to realistic and
credible budget estimates, preferably under the MTEF framework. Technical assistance under
the NREG program is helping to mitigate this risk by assisting MDAs to develop capacity and
standardized approaches to planning and budgeting.

107.Political. Natural resources in Ghana are highly political and contested, with a complex
institutional and contextual history. The NREG program is sensitive to this reality, and continues
to work to promote dialogue and positive interaction between relevant stakeholders to improve
natural resources and environmental governance through enhanced transparency and
accountability mechanisms. In addition, Ghana is one of eight case studies on the political
economy of natural resources being carried out by the Bank to try to better understand political
economy drivers behind the natural resource sector (the case study in Ghana is focusing on the
mining sector, with lessons to be learned for other natural resource sectors, including oil). With
the change of administration following closely contested elections in late 2008/early 2009,
GOG`s commitment to the NREG program has not been questioned. The new administration is
committed to improving natural resources management in Ghana and views the NREG program


                                                49

as a key component of this agenda. The proposed ministerial level Environment Advisory
Council will further enable policy coherence and political ownership of this agenda.

108.Macroeconomic Risk. There is a potential risks that the global macro-economic situation,
with implications for GDP growth, macro-economic stability and financing prospects (from
public and private creditors), could possibly lead to insufficient GOG funds being made available
to the NREG sectors. The combination of the envisaged EGPRC (stand-alone DPO) and IMF
program would mitigate these risks by providing support to the budget and balance of payments
and sending a strong signal to markets and Development Partners of Ghana`s commitment to
bring its fiscal stance to a sound and sustainable track.

109.Financial. Delays in the release of funds to the MDAs (either by MOFEP or by the line
ministries once funds are transferred to them by MOFEP) is a potential risk that DPs closely
monitor in the context of implementing the NREG PFM action plan, which is aimed at
improving MDA planning and budgeting. Conversely, implementation capacity of the NREG
agencies may delay effective utilization of funds when GOG budgetary allocations are increased as
projected in the 2009 budget. While timely releases of funds may reduce the chances of this
occurrence, the NREG agencies may also require technical assistance to facilitate the effective
implementation of the NREG programs.

110.Environmental. An overarching objective of the NREG program is to achieve positive
environmental impacts. However, there is a possibility that some outcomes could lead to
unintended negative effects if insufficient due diligence to environmental impact is pursued
during implementation. For example: (a) new investment in the forest and wildlife and mining
sectors; or (b) diversification of the mineral production base leading to increased mineral
exploitation. However, NREG reduces risks by heightening attention to environmental impacts.
Also environmental implications of targets and triggers that could entail risk of environmental
damage is undertaken during annual progress reviews and during ongoing sector dialog.
Additionally, Ghana`s experience of SEA is also being reviewed to consolidate good practice
and inform inter-sectoral planning and implementation.

111.Social. An overarching objective of NREG is to address social issues in forest and mining
communities. Forestry, mining, and environmental resources are highly contested in Ghana.
There is a risk that benefits are captured by elites, or reforms blocked by entrenched interest
groups. In addition, social accountability and transparency require joint-decision making, and
there is a risk that stakeholder participation may be constrained if the enabling environment for
inclusive natural resources governance remains weak. Social conflict may be reduced if efforts
to increase the share of benefits accruing to local communities are successful. However, there is
a risk that social conflict may increase as a result of distributional asymmetries becoming more
transparent. In order to reduce these risks ex ante, there is a need to apply lessons learned from
international experience in promoting sustainable forest management by actively involving
forest-dependent communities in planning processes, clarifying and securing tenure, property,
and carbon rights, and removing barriers to transparent, inclusive and accountable forest
governance. The PSIA is helping to shed light on the role and influence of various stakeholders
(domestic and international) and their reach and impact, particularly in regard to local
communities and the most vulnerable groups (e.g., the rural poor/artisanal miners and illegal
loggers, women, children). NREG implementation involved active stakeholder consultation and

                                                 50

participation in an endeavor to mitigate such risks, and ensure that the program results in social
benefits.

112.Misperception. While non-state actors have been - and will continue to be - engaged in
NREG program, there is a possibility that some groups will feel inadequately consulted and
informed and may misunderstand the intent of NREG. There is a need to expand on
communications and awareness raising activities, and further develop mechanisms for involving
non state actors in implementation and monitoring of NREG. The success of NREG will be
reliant on key stakeholders being continuously informed and updated on the objectives and
intended positive outcomes of the program, as well as their opportunities to contribute toward its
success.

ANNEX 4. FRAMEWORK MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING




                        74

1. Preamble

1.1.This Framework Memorandum (FM) contains the understandings of the Government of Ghana
    (GOG) and the Development Partners which have signed this FM (hereafter called the
    signatory DPs), as regards providing sector budget support (SBS) for the design,
    implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Natural Resources and Environmental
    Governance (NREG) program in Ghana. This FM has been endorsed and approved by the
    GOG and the signatory DPs and came into force on the date of signature. DPs not yet
    signatory of this FM, can join this FM by agreement of all signatories and an official exchange
    of letters between the new signatory and the existing signatories.
1.2.This FM will operate subject to the provisions of the bilateral financing
    agreements/arrangements between the GOG and the individual DPs, which form the legal
    basis for the provision of budget support by each of these DPs. This FM is not a binding legal
    agreement and, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this FM and the bilateral
    agreements/arrangements, the provisions of the bilateral agreements/arrangements will prevail.
    Ultimate approval of the provision of budget support, and the circumstances/conditions under
    which it is provided, rests with the individual DP. However, DPs will, with due regard to the
    separate accountability of each DP, endeavour to sign bilateral agreements and maintain
    financing arrangements that are compatible with the spirit and provisions of this FM. In case of
    deviations, the signatory DP concerned will inform the GOG and the other signatory DPs of
    such deviations in writing.
1.3.Signing this FM is a commitment to participate actively in the activities foreseen in this FM, to
    respect the spirit and provisions of this FM and to provide financial resources for the NREG
    Program as agreed in the bilateral agreements.
1.4.Initially the NREG Program covers the forestry, mining and environmental protection sectors.
    The scope of the NREG Program could be expanded at a later date, after mutual agreement
    between the signatories, with other sectors and sub sectors dealing with natural resources and
    environmental governance issues.
1.5.When implementing this FM, the signatories endeavour to apply international guidelines as
    regards budget support, notably to focus the objectives and targets on results.

2. Principles and objectives

2.1.The overall objective of SBS for the NREG Program is providing support to the GOG for
    achieving the GOG`s goals as regards the sectors and sub sectors covered by the NREG
    Program. The SBS will therefore be based on and embedded in well defined and result-
    oriented policies and strategies for the (sub) sectors concerned, translated into medium term
    action plans, medium term expenditure frameworks and annual work plans and budgets. It is
    acknowledged that not all these prerequisites are in place at the start of the NREG Program,
    but will have to be further developed and strengthened during the first years of
    implementation of the NREG Program.




                                                75

2.2.The SBS-NREG consists of (i) transfers of financial resources to the Consolidated Fund of the
    Treasury of the GOG and (ii) a joint policy dialogue conducted by the GOG and the signatory
    DPs as regards a number of policy and strategy issues and the targets to be achieved in the
    (sub) sectors covered by the NREG Program. A progress assessment framework (PAF) will be
    used for measuring progress towards achieving the sector development goals and the annual
    targets.
2.3.SBS for the NREG Program is based on the concept of a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp),
    which implies comprehensive planning, programming, budgeting, reporting, monitoring and
    evaluation as regards the (sub) sectors involved in the NREG Program, encompassing all
    sources of funding (treasury funding, Internally Generated Funds, project and program aid,
    etc.). This comprehensive planning, programming, budgeting and reporting is the
    responsibility of the MDAs involved in the NREG Program, and will be one of the subjects of
    the policy dialogue between the GOG and the signatory DPs.
2.4.The SBS funds to be transferred to the Consolidated Fund of the national Treasury will be
    taken fully into account by the GOG in the planning, budget and accounting process. They
    will become part of the national resources of the Treasury and will be managed and spent
    according to national procedures as regards public finance management. The transfer of funds
    from signatory DPs is subject to certain disbursement conditions as regards policy measures to
    be taken and/or performance targets to meet, as mentioned in the PAF (see chapters 3 and 5).
2.5.In principle the use of the SBS funds will be un-earmarked, which means that SBS funds are
    not meant to be used specifically for certain budget chapters, budget lines or expenditure
    items. In stead the GOG will ensure adequate levels of funding made timely available to the
    (sub) sectors covered by the NREG Program in order that the agreed NREG objectives and
    targets will be achieved. Funding levels required for the (sub) sectors of NREG will be one of
    the subjects of the policy dialogue. In specific circumstances a DP could decide to earmark its
    SBS in accordance with its own policy and procedures.
2.6.The signatory DPs confirm that they will, as far as possible, harmonise and align their policies
    and procedures as regards providing support to the NREG Program, while at the same time
    strengthening the ownership of the GOG as regards the design and implementation of the
    NREG Program. Harmonisation and alignment require:
    - a joint Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) with clearly defined objectives and targets;
    - a joint policy dialogue between the GOG and the DPs, and;
   - a joint regular review mechanism of the PAF
   - a joint review of the financial audits (see chapter 6).
2.7.The signatory DPs confirm also that they aim for improving the predictability of donor flows
    to the Treasury of the GOG through the arrangements agreed in this FM.
2.8.This FM for the SBS-NREG is compatible with the FM for the Multi Donor Budget Support
    (MDBS) in terms of (i) approaches and procedures, and (ii) division of tasks. In principle the
    PAF of the MDBS deals with macro and cross sector issues. Those issues will thus not be
    included in the PAF of the NREG Program. On the other hand, sector related issues covered
    by the PAF of the NREG Program will not be included in the PAF of the MDBS. Exceptions
    could be made for some key reform issues, particularly those exceeding the strict boundaries
    and competences of the NREG (sub) sectors.

                                                 76

2.9.Reliable, transparent and effective Public Finance Management (PFM) is a requirement for
    each budget support program. The MDBS policy dialogue reviews regularly the progress with
    the implementation of the overall action plan for strengthening PFM in Ghana. The NREG
    policy dialogue will address some PFM issues at the level of the MDAs involved in the NREG
    Program, including the implementation of overall PFM reforms at the level of those MDAs.
2.10.One of the objectives of the NREG Program is to support the establishment and proper
     functioning of an inter-ministerial and inter-sectoral coordination mechanism for
     environmental and natural resource governance. The implementation of the NREG Program
     will become part of such a coordination mechanism once it has been established.

3. The Progress Assessment Framework and the review process

3.1.The Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) of the NREG Program contains the program and
    policy objectives and the annual targets as agreed by the GOG and the signatory DPs. The
    PAF will be used to assess progress with implementation of the NREG Program. The PAF is a
    forward rolling three-year planning instrument, containing fixed objectives and targets for the
    first year, projected objectives and targets for the second year and indicative objectives and
    targets for the third year.
3.2.The GOG and the DPs agree that the PAF will be limited in size and will be focused on the
    most crucial objectives and targets of the (sub) sectors concerned. The policy documents,
    medium term action plans, MTEFs and annual work plans of the MDAs involved will be
    broader in scope and more detailed. The PAF is not meant to replace those policy and planning
    documents of the MDAs concerned. The PAF will be result-oriented and comprise a balanced
    mix of policy actions/input indicators and result/outcome indicators.
3.3.The signatories of this FM will carry out a joint annual review of the progress achieved as
    regards the objectives and targets of the PAF. The purpose of that annual review is to assess
    progress as regards the implementation of the NREG Program, to formulate recommendations
    for strengthening the implementation of the NREG Program, to inform the decision making
    process as regards the disbursements of SBS (see chapter 5), and to prepare updating the
    objectives and targets of the PAF for the following years (see also article 4.3).
3.4.The annual review will be based on annual reports to be produced by the MDAs involved in
    the NREG Program. The review will be coordinated by the Chairpersons of the NREG
    Coordination Committee and the DP-NREG group (see chapter 4) and will be carried out by
    representatives of the participating MDAs, the NDPC and the signatory DPs. The NREG
    Coordination Committee and the signatory DPs may wish, at certain occasions, to organise an
    external review of the NREG Program carried out by independent experts every three years.
    The results of such an external review will feed into the annual review process.
3.5.The annual review as regards the results of a particular year will be carried out before the end
    of April of the subsequent year, and preferably before the annual review of the MDBS.
3.6.Ideally the targets of the PAF for a particular year should be fixed before the end of September
    of the previous year in order to be in line with the budget preparation cycle. However, for the
    first year (2008) of this NREG Program a special arrangement is necessary to phase-in that
    sequencing. The first NREG-PAF, to be finalised before the end of January 2008, refers to the

                                                  77

    years 2007-2009 and includes fixed targets for 2007 and 2008 and indicative targets for 2009.
    Attainment of the targets of 2007 will be evaluated before the end of January 2008. All future
    NREG-PAFs will follow the MDSB/PRSC timeline for preparation and assessment.
3.7.Notwithstanding differences in disbursement procedures (see chapter 5), the signatory DPs try
    to reach joint conclusions as regards the holistic assessment of the progress achieved in the
    (su)sectors on the basis of the PAF targets, as well as regards each target of the PAF
    individually.

4. Coordination, dialogue and reporting

4.1 The GOG will set up (i) a High Level NREG Steering Committee for the purpose of taking
    policy and strategic decisions as regards the NREG Program and (ii) a Technical Coordination
    Committee supported by a Technical Secretariat for the purpose of organising and
    coordinating the policy dialogue and the annual reviews of the NREG-PAF and for
    coordinating cross sector and common issues of the MDAs involved in the NREG Program.
    The High Level NREG Steering Committee will be composed of the Ministers responsible for
    Finance, Forestry, Mining and Environmental Protection. The Technical Coordinating
    Committee will be co-chaired by the Chief Directors of the three Ministries involved in the
    NREG Program. All MDAs involved in the NREG Program, including the Ministry of
    Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP), will have a high level representative in the
    Technical Coordination Committee (chief executive level). The MOFEP will be in charge of
    the Technical Secretariat. The terms of reference of the Technical Coordination Committee
    are attached to this FM.
4.2 The DP signatories of this FM will nominate a focal point (one of the DPs having signed this
    FM), which will be in charge of maintaining contact with the chair of the High level NREG
    Steering Committee and the chair of the NREG Technical Coordination Committee about all
    implementation issues concerning the NREG Program.
4.3 The NREG Technical Coordination Committee and the DPs will have at least two joint
    meetings per year: one in the first semester to discuss the results of the annual review of the
    NREG-PAF and to update the PAF for the following years, and one in the second semester in
    order (i) to discuss the execution of the annual work plans and budgets of the MDAs involved
    in the NREG Program during the first half of the year, (ii) to review the audit reports as
    regards the previous year (see chapter 6), (iii) to discuss special policy, strategy and reform
    issues, and (iv) to discuss the budget of the following year. These joint meetings will be co-
    chaired by the chairperson of the NREG Technical Coordination Committee and the focal
    point of the signatory DPs. The sector dialogue will take place in the context of the
    Environment and Natural Resources Sector Group (see also paragraph 4.6).
4.4 The annual review of the NREG-PAF will be coordinated by the Chairperson of the NREG
    Coordinating Committee and the focal point of the signatory DPs. Representatives from
    Parliament and non-state actors may be invited to participate in the review as observers.
    Results of the joint assessment of the NREG-PAF will be disseminated to a broader group of
    stakeholders.
4.5 The annual review of the NREG-PAF will be informed by the budgets, medium term action
    plans, annual workplans and Annual Progress Reports (APR) of the MDAs involved in the

                                                 78

    NREG Program and the means of verification (of the targets and triggers) as defined in the
    PAF. In order to ensure a fully informed dialogue, the GOG will submit that documentation to
    the signatory DPs at least 3 weeks prior to the annual review.
4.6 Besides coordinating the NREG Program itself, the NREG Technical Coordination Committee
    will also take care of coordinating the NREG Program with other programs and projects being
    implemented within the NREG sectors. However, broader issues of environmental governance
    and coordination with other projects and programs in the environment and natural resources
    sectors (outside the NREG sectors) will be dealt with by the existing Environment and Natural
    Resources Sector Group and the future inter-sectoral coordination mechanism for
    environmental and natural resources governance (see also article 2.10).
4.7 It is acknowledged that the MDBS policy dialogue and coordination structure will be the
    pivotal point in a network of sector dialogues, guided by the GOG, where cross cutting issues,
    major policy reform issues and issues with significant budgetary implications can be raised.
    The MDBS policy dialogue will add value to and will be informed by policy dialogues at
    sector level. However, the MDBS policy dialogue will not repeat discussions that have been
    handled adequately at sector level nor will the NREG policy dialogue repeat discussions about
    macro and cross-sector issues already dealt with by the MDBS policy dialogue.

5. Disbursement mechanisms

5.1.The annual SBS of each DP consists of either one disbursement or two disbursements (a base
    tranche and a performance tranche). The decision as regards the disbursement conditions is
    left to the discretion of each individual DP and will be stipulated in the respective bilateral
    agreements as regards providing SBS for the NREG Program. However, the signatory DPs aim
    for harmonising their disbursement conditions as far as possible within the framework of
    guidelines presented in the following paragraphs.
5.2.Both general and sector budget support is only be provided to countries with adequate macro-
    economic and fiscal policies and an adequate public finance management (PFM) system or a
    program aimed at strengthening the PFM system. These preconditions will therefore be part of
    the disbursement conditions of SBS for the NREG Program, but assessing whether these
    conditions have been met will be done in the context of the annual MDBS reviews.
5.3.In case of a single annual SBS-NREG disbursement the decision to disburse will be subject to
    the preconditions mentioned in paragraph 5.2 and a satisfactory assessment of attainment of
    the NREG-PAF targets. As regards those targets some signatory DPs will focus on a holistic
    assessment, others will focus on specific targets (then called triggers), or on both a holistic
    assessment and specific targets (triggers).
5.4.In case of two disbursements per year, the base tranche will be subject to the preconditions
    mentioned in paragraph 5.2 and a holistic assessment of attainment of the NREG-PAF targets,
    while the performance tranche will be based on certain specific targets (triggers) of the NREG-
    PAF.
5.5.The signatories of this FM agree that triggers (specific disbursement conditions) will be
    limited in number and will be chosen out of the list of targets mentioned in the PAF.


                                                 79

5.6.In order to improve the predictability of aid flows and to facilitate GOG`s budget preparation
    process, the disbursement of the tranches in year N will depend on assessments made in year
    N-1 as regards the achievement of the targets of year N-2. The signatory DPs will inform the
    GOG as soon as possible after the annual review and at the latest before the end of August in
    year N-1 about the disbursements of the volume and timing of the tranches in year N.
    Disbursements should preferably take place during the first four months of year N. However
    special arrangements are needed for the first year (2008) of the NREG in order to phase-in this
    system (see next article).
5.7.At the start of the program the disbursements of 2008 will be based on the NREG-PAF review
    carried out in January 2008 (which has evaluated the targets of 2007). The following reviews
    and related disbursements will follow the time schedule of the MDBS. As stipulated in article
    5.6 the GOG will be informed about the disbursements to be effectuated in 2009 before the
    end of august 2008.
5.8. Disbursements will be deposited in a foreign exchange account with Accounts Name: Nat.
    Res. And Environmental Gov. Budget Support, Accounts No. 1018631512593, in the name
    of the GOG held at the Bank of Ghana (BoG). The BoG will immediately inform in writing the
    signatory DP concerned and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) as
    regards the receipt of the foreign exchange funds. Within 48 hours after receipt of the SBS
    disbursement the BoG will credit the Cedi equivalent to the Central Treasury Account (using
    the Central Bank buying exchange rate on the date of purchase). The MOFEP will
    immediately inform in writing the signatory DP and the Chairs of the NREG Coordinating
    Committee as regards the receipt of the Cedi equivalent. These acknowledgements should be
    accompanied by documentary evidence of the amount and date of, respectively, the foreign
    exchange payment received and the amount and date of the deposit of the GH Cedi equivalent
    in the Central Treasury Account.

6. Audit

6.1.The annual accounts of the MDAs involved in the NREG Program will be audited according to
    the official regulations of the Government of Ghana as regards auditing MDAs.
6.2.The audits of the Agencies involved in the NREG Program will cover all their sources of
    income and all their expenditures, including treasury funding, Internally Generated Funds and
    donor funded projects of which financial management is under the control of the Agencies
    concerned.
6.3.The audit reports mentioned in articles 6.1 and 6.2 will be presented to the signatory DPs
    within 9 month after the closure of the year and will be reviewed by the NREG Coordinating
    Committee and the DP-NREG group during their second semester meeting. As far as the audit
    reports of the ministries are concerned, special attention will be paid to the Departments
    involved in the NREG Program and the flow of funds towards the Agencies involved in the
    NREG Program.

could be interpreted as an illegal or corrupt practice.




                                                  81

8.2. Each partie involved in the NREG program will promptly inform the other parties of any
instances of corruption as referred to in the previous paragraph. In case of signs of corruption a
formal investigation will be carried out and the outcomes shared with the parties concerned.

9. Responsibilities of the Development Partners

9.1.The signatory DPs will work in partnership with the GOG and will provide support for the
    implementation of the NREG Program as laid down in this FM and the bilateral agreements as

                                  ANNEX 5. FUND RELATIONS NOTE

              Ghana--Assessment Letter for the World Bank and Bilateral Donors

This note provides the IMF staff assessment of recent economic developments and prospects in
Ghana. It reflects the findings of a staff mission to Accra during May 11-22, 2009 to conduct
discussions for the 2009 Article IV consultation and respond to the authorities` request for IMF
support under a PRGF arrangement. Substantial progress was made in discussions between the
authorities and IMF staff on a Fund-supported program. Once these discussions are satisfactorily
concluded, the arrangement will be submitted to the IMF Executive Board for its approval.

Recent macroeconomic developments

Ghana`s fiscal deficit widened from 9 percent of GDP in 2007 to 14.5 percent of GDP in 2008.
Although revenues were broadly unchanged relative to GDP in 2008, large increases in
expenditures were recorded for wages and salaries, capital spending, and petroleum subsidies. The
2008 deficit was partly financed by drawing down the unspent balance of Ghana`s 2007 Eurobond
issue, partly from the sale of a majority stake in Ghana Telecom, and partly through heavy
borrowing from the Bank of Ghana.

Fiscal stimulus and strong credit expansion in 2008 contributed to buoyant economic growth
(estimated at 7.3 percent) and rising inflation (18 percent at end-2008). Rapid demand growth also
resulted in pressure on the balance of payments. The currency depreciated by about 30 percent
against the dollar through 2008, and foreign exchange sales by the Bank of Ghana reduced gross
reserve cover to 2.2 months of import cover at end-2008, down from 2.7 months a year earlier.

The government's economic program

The Ghanaian authorities economic program is centered on an ambitious consolidation of public
finances during 2009-2011 to reduce pressures on inflation and the balance of payments and
reverse the recent deterioration in public debt indicators. It would be supported by structural
reforms to strengthen the management of public finances and address persistent sources of
expenditure pressure.

The program assumes a modest slowing of economic growth. Ghana`s terms of trade have
improved on account of lower oil prices. However, with a decline in remittances, a less favorable
outlook for non-oil foreign direct investment, and tighter fiscal and monetary policies, economic
growth is projected to decline from 7.3 percent in 2008 to 4.5 percent in 2009. With a recovery in
the external environment, growth is projected to strengthen to 5 percent in 2010, and rise strongly
in 2011 with the start of oil production. Tighter fiscal and monetary policies are projected to
reduce inflation to single-digit rates during 2010.
The fiscal program targets a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 9.4 percent in 2009, and then to
6 percent and 4.5 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2010 and 2011. The 2009 deficit target is
largely based on expenditure restraint. With lower global oil prices and the readoption of market-
based petroleum product pricing, energy subsidies would be largely eliminated in 2009, except for
targeted support for low-income consumers, compared to subsidies of about 1½ percent of GDP in

                                                   83

2008. At the same time, infrastructure projects funded by the Eurobond have ended, and savings
have also been identified in administration costs and other expenditures. Revenue collections are
projected to rise in 2009 by about 0.7 percent of GDP, broadly evenly divided between new
revenue measures and strengthened revenue administration.

On structural policies, Ghana has made progress in tax policy, revenue administration, and public
finance management over the past decade, but has fallen behind best-practice among peers in
recent years. The government recognizes this gap and is putting in place a strengthened senior
management team to lead a reinvigorated reform program supported by the IMF and other
development partners.

Further, in light of fiscal pressures from Ghana`s high and rising public wage bill, emphasis will be
given to public sector reform. Initial steps have been taken to strengthen oversight of new public
sector recruitment to ensure consistency with the budget. Further reforms, including the proposed
simplification of the salary structure, should be consistent with the goal of reducing the cost of the
public sector payroll, and should be combined with a broader review of the appropriate size of the
public sector workforce.

Parallel steps to strengthen the operations of state owned enterprises are also a priority. In the
energy sector, the government`s goal is to apply cost recovery pricing for energy products and
utilities to avoid the re-emergence of heavy subsidy costs.

Fiscal outlook and financing prospects

Preliminary fiscal data for the first quarter of 2009 show revenue collections remaining strong.
However, the staff`s updated fiscal projections for the full year suggest that the fiscal deficit could
slightly exceed 10 percent of GDP, on current policies. The authorities intend to adopt new
measures to bring the deficit back to the budget target of 9.4 percent of GDP.

Even with these new measures, the fiscal outlook is subject to important risks. With uncertain
prospects for economic growth, revenue performance could slow more than expected. Equally,
updated assumptions regarding domestic interest rates could prove optimistic, and the civil service
wage negotiations, which have been a past source of spending overruns, have not yet been
concluded. Given the limited flexibility in regard to new external or domestic financing,
contingency plans would need to focus on intensified spending restraint.

For 2010, the key challenge will be to identify new fiscal savings of about 2½ percent of GDP. As
noted above, this will require determined efforts to address the cost of the public sector wage bill,
as well as application of cost recovery pricing for petroleum products and utilities. Consideration
should also be given to measures to strengthen revenue mobilization, with scope for a considerable
contribution from tax policy reforms. Options should also be explored to tackle a range of
structural rigidities within the budget that earmark revenues and ring fence spending. For 2011, the
fiscal deficit target could be met through revenues from oil production, currently projected in the
5 percent of GDP range; however, further expenditure prioritization would be needed to rebalance
from recurrent to capital spending.



                                                   84

With limited prospects for external market financing in the near term, the fiscal financing gap is
estimated at close to $250 million for 2009, declining to about half that amount in 2010. By 2011,
the reduced deficit would be readily financeable without access to exceptional financing. A large
portion of the financing gap in 2009-2010 is projected to be closed through new World Bank
financing. At the same time, discussions are underway between the government and other
development partners on accelerating or augmenting their support, and there are good prospects to
close the remaining small financing gap. Potential financing under the PRGF would be dedicated
to strengthening Ghana`s weak official foreign exchange reserve position.

Reflecting the overall financing need, as well as the impact of currency depreciation, gross public
debt is projected to rise from 56 percent of GDP at end-2008 to peak at 65 percent of GDP at end-
2010. Over the medium-term, the gross debt ratio declines to 62-63 percent of non-oil GDP, while
the net debt-GDP ratio falls below 58 percent of non-oil GDP, reflecting the assumed
accumulation of assets in an oil heritage fund.

Preliminary updates to the joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis (DSA) using the latest debt
data and projected financing flows suggest that Ghana remains at moderate risk of debt distress, in
line with the 2008 DSA. In baseline projections, external debt indicators remain well below
threshold levels for debt distress. These results depend on a sustained reduction of the fiscal deficit
to low levels: debt dynamics based on recent average fiscal deficit levels would relatively quickly
exceed the DSA threshold levels. Stress tests also indicate that the DSA outlook is sensitive to the
economic growth and borrowing cost assumptions.

Monetary and financial sector issues

The large gap between inflation outturns of 20 percent during January-April 2009 and the Bank of
Ghana`s single-digit inflation goal poses a significant challenge for its inflation targeting regime.
While fiscal consolidation will ease demand pressures, there is a risk that inflation expectations
will become established at a high level. Monetary conditions will need to remain tight to support
the exchange rate and avoid further inflationary impulses from currency depreciation. At the same
time, it will be important that the central bank follows through with plans to communicate more
clearly its monetary policy framework and inflation targeting strategy.

The Bank of Ghana`s supervisory approach appears to be rigorous, but will need to be alert to
emerging financial sector risks. Financial soundness indicators have deteriorated over the past
year, with non-performing loans rising to 9.6 percent of total loans in March 2009, up from 6.4
percent at end-2007 (despite rapid growth in the loan base), while the return on banking assets and
equity has trended lower. The rapid growth of the banking system and high levels of industry
competition have been associated with a rise in the cost of funding and increased risk taking, while
corporate governance in some of the state-owned banks remains a source of concern. If non-
performing loans continue to rise, banks could increasingly shift to high-yielding treasury bills,
with potentially adverse implications for private sector credit and overall economic growth.
