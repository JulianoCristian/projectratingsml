"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Second Natural Resources and\n            Environmental Governance Development Policy Operation\n            (DPO-2) Program for Ghana focuses on: (a) ensuring\n            predictable financing and sustainable management of the\n            forest and wildlife resources and effective forest law\n            enforcement; (b) improving mining and forestry sector\n            revenue collection, management, and transparency; (c)\n            addressing social issues in forest and mining communities;\n            and (d) mainstreaming environment into policies for economic\n            growth. The programmatic DPO continue to address governance\n            issues in the forestry and mining sectors and improve\n            environmental management. Currently forestry, wildlife, and\n            mining are a key to Ghana's economy and share common\n            challenges, including revenues that are not well captured\n            and large numbers of people dependent on the sector for\n            their livelihood. In addition, environmental policy needs to\n            be strengthened to effectively control pollution, and to\n            reduce long-term negative health and economic impacts due to\n            environmental degradation and climate change. Ghana has\n            recognized the need to address these important issues. The\n            2006-2009 Second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS\n            II) has the overarching goals of sustaining economic growth\n            of at least six percent per year to attain middle-income\n            country status and surpass the 2015 millennium development\n            goal of halving poverty levels to 26 percent of the\n            population and reducing inequalities. The expected outcomes\n            at the end of the DPO series include: (i) improved\n            management of government revenues and finances in the\n            forestry and mining sectors; (ii) reduced illegal logging;\n            (iii) reduced social conflict in forestry and mining\n            communities; and (iv) integration of environmental\n            considerations into policy formulation and implementation\n            across government, including risks associated with climate change."}, "docdt": "2009-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
