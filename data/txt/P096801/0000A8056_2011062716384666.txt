                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Phase I sub-projects have been completed in several instances, and Phase II is under progress, although slow. Interim monitoring indicators show that sub-projects are having a
                         positive impact on quality of electricity supply in their areas. Phase III bids were received in December 2010, and their review has taken longer than anticipated. Phase IV sub-
                         projects need to be decided and the bidding document finalized.

                         The project did not initially trigger the Bank's operational policy (OP 4.12) on involuntary resettlement because no land acquisition or resettlement was anticipated. However, during
                         implementation land acquisition became necessary, and hence TEDA# submitted a draft resettlement policy framework (RPF) for the Bank's review along with ex post expropriation

                         All the regional distribution companies have been privatized, and in some cases, private owners have taken over operations, while in others, the final steps towards hand-over to the
                         private owners is under way. In this transition process, employees and routine processes are being impacted, as is natural. This has been impacting project activities including
                         monitoring, contract implementation and supervision.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Ongoing issues that have been impacting Group I and II progress need to be addressed - agreement with regional companies on detailed designs, agreement with municipalities to
                         allow continued time-periods for construction works, regular monitoring to ensure projects are progressing on time. Group III bid evaluation needs to be completed early. Group IV
                         sub-projects have to be identified and the bidding documents issued. The quality of quarterly reports needs to be improved, and safeguards documentation needs to be finalized and
                         disclosed.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
