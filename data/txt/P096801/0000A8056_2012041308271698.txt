                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Four of the six Group 1 packages have already been completed and the remaining two will be completed by June 2012. One of the five packages in Group II has been completed
                         ahead of the contractual end date, and TEDAŞ expects to complete two packages in Group II byyear end. However, the remaining two packages in Group II are not likely to be
                         completed before the project closing date of December 2012. The implementation activities in Group III and Group IV have not commenced yet and the decision regarding the future

                         Most of the regional distribution companies have been privatized, and private owners have taken over operations. In this transition process, employees and routine processes are
                         being impacted, as is natural. This has been impacting project activities including monitoring, contract implementation and supervision.
