was substantial;\n            bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance also moderately satisfactory. Some of the\n            lessons learned included: institutional arrangement, one of\n            the key challenges in the original phase of the project was\n            the institutional arrangements did little to clarify the\n            roles and responsibilities of the organizations involved.\n            Capacity assessment, while significant investments and\n            improvements have been made in strengthening capacity of the\n            implementing agency, the importance of accurately assessing\n            capacity during appraisal cannot be overstated. Community\n            development challenges, the complexity of social dynamics\n            and community development was also underestimated, and the\n            diversity of ethnic groups, resource practices, and\n            languages compounded these challenges. Finance and\n            procurement arrangement, although the implementing agency\n            had prior experience of bank financing and procurement\n            compliance requirements establishing the required\n            arrangements took longer than anticipated. Inclusive\n            principles and Practice, the project adopted an inclusive\n            approach and prioritized ethnic group communities, but\n            translating these principles into practice remained a\n            challenge. Independent Participatory Sustainable Forest\n            Management (PSFM) Monitoring, The project introduced the\n            concept of rapid surveys conducted by professionals both\n            outside and inside line organizations to focus on selected activities."}, "docdt": "2013-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
