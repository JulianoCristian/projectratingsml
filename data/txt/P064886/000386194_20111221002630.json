{"cdata!": "The objective of the Sustainable\n            Forestry for Rural Development (SUFORD) Project for Lao\n            People's Democratic Republic is to assist the borrower\n            to achieve the sustainable management of production forests\n            to alleviate rural poverty in the project provinces by\n            implementing the forest policy reform actions and policies\n            set forth in its letter of forest management policy. This\n            restructuring paper introduces changes in the project and\n            accompanying amendments to the project's legal\n            documents. Specifically this proposal seeks to extend the\n            closing date of the International Development Association\n            (IDA) financing for the above-referenced project by twelve\n            months from the current closing date of December 31, 2011 to\n            December 31, 2012 to provide more time for completion of\n            on-going activities especially in ethnic group communities\n            that have been delayed due to factors outside the control of\n            the government and the project implementing agency. The\n            restructuring also includes changes to the financing plan\n            and a minor reallocation of grant proceeds amongst\n            expenditure categories. Rationale for closing date\n            extension. The extension is necessary to provide more time\n            for completion of on-going activities especially in ethnic\n            group communities that have been delayed due to factors\n            outside the control of the government and the project\n            implementing agency."}, "docdt": "2011-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
