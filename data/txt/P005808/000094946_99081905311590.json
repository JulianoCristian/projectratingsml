The physical structures built under the\n            project proved their effectiveness in 1996 and 1997, when\n            these structures saved human life, public infrastructure,\n            and private property from heavy floodwaters. Other benefits\n            are road improvements that ease traffic flow and facilitate\n            access for waste collection units as well as benefit local\n            traders. The institutional effectiveness of the ministry of\n            construction, housing, and urban planning and its local\n            branch in Taiz has been strengthened. Residents have\n            welcomed the project, which greatly improved their\n            neighborhoods and mitigated health hazards, as well as\n            facilitated access from their homes to the main city areas.\n            Key lessons learned are: Good project preparation and design\n            as well as strong political and local support for project\n            objectives are essential for a successful outcome. Adequate\n            provisions for maintenance, institutional strengthening, and\n            a viable cost recovery program help to ensure the long-term\n            sustainability of project benefits. Overvalued exchange\n            rates can cause serious shortages of local currency funds,\n            resulting in protracted implementation problems. The\n            strengthening of the implementation team in the resident\n            mission effectively contributed to project completion."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
