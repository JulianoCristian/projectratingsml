                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved by the RVP on January 31, 2011. The First Grant Funding Request was approved on April 18, 2011, and the Grant became effective on June 14, 2011.
                         Project implementation has taken off since then and major activities have been completed, except the rehabilitation works of the Sona-Lossa-Kokomani irrigation schemes which
                         have huge delay and have not been completed in spite the twice extension of the Project's closure date. All activities under component 1 were successfully completed including the
                         procurement and distribution of the complementary herd of 200 goats as well as remaining capacity building activities towards the village-based sub-projects management

                         For the component II (74% of the grant’s proceeds), the rehabilitation and protection works related to the first part of irrigation scheme (Kourani and Baria 1 and 2- covering 693 ha)
                         were completed early in CY 2013 ; the technical reception took place in March 2013 and the final reception has also been completed. Such perimeters, the largest block compared
                         to the second batch are fully functioning and the rice production has been successful during the 2013 rainy season; the 2013/ 2014 full irrigated season and the 2014 rainy season.

                         Regarding the similar rehabilitation works of the second batch of Sona-Lossa-Kokomani irrigated schemes (381 has) which started in April 2013, they are still ongoing with huge
                         due to unfortunately the very weak capacity of the WAZIR Enterprise which was awarded with such works. Despite combined pressure from the Bank SPN Task Team, the ministry
                         of agriculture, the awarded enterprise has lagged far behind the works completion date. and subsequent revised planning that it has set up and shared with the SPN team. Following
                         multiple high level site visits which included high level Bank staff (CD, CM ) and the ministry of agriculture, and the Director of Rural development matters and head of Spanish
                         bilateral cooperation in Niger, the Enterprise has didn't performed as planned pledged to complete the works by end March 2014, then by July 2014. In spit eof the continuous close
                         monitoringfrom the Bank and the ministry of agriculture, there are still visible gaps to fill regarding the different activities to be completed for the rehabilitation to function. All parties
                         had made clear that the delay penalty fees should be applied.
                         This important delay of works completion at Sona-Lossa-Kokomani continues to be the sole but important and disappointing aspect of the project's implementation. A very last action
                         plan has been set up as outcome of the implementation support of September 2014. It is expected the full completion of the works by the project's closure on November 30, 2014.
                         Among other recommendations of this mission it was agreed that the ministry of agriculture and the PIU will pursue day-to-day pressure on the enterprise for completion of the
                         works..
