                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved by the RVP on January 31, 2011. The First Grant Funding Request was approved on April 18, 2011, and the Grant became effective on June 14, 2011.
                         Project implementation has taken off since then and major activities have been completed, except the rehabilitation works of the Sona-Lossa-Kokomani irrigation schemes which
                         have huge delay. All activities under component 1 were successfully completed including the procurement and distribution of the complementary herd of 200 goats as well as
                         remaining capacity building activities towards the village-based sub-projects management committees.

                         For the component II (74% of the grantâ€™s proceeds), the rehabilitation and protection works related to the first part of irrigation scheme (Kourani and Baria 1 and 2- covering 693 ha)
                         were completed early in CY 2013 and the technical reception took place in March 2013. Such perimeters, the largest block compared to the second batch are fully functioning and
                         the rice production has been successful during the 2013 rainy season and the ongoing full irrigated season. Regarding the similar rehabilitation works of the second batch of Sona-
                         Lossa-Kokomani irrigated schemes (381 has) which started in April 2013, they are still ongoing with more than 2 months delay due unfortunately to a weak capacity of the WAZIR

                         Enterprise which was awarded with such works. Despite combined pressure from the Bank SPN Task Team, the ministry of agriculture, the awarded enterprise has lagged far behind
                         the works completion date. Following a recent high level site visit which included the ministry of agriculture, the Bank country manager and the Director of Rural development matters
                         and head of Spanish bilateral cooperation in Niger, the Enterprise has pledged to complete the works by end March 2014. All parties took note and a close monitoring is being
                         pursued while it was made clear from that joint visit that the contractual sanctions, particularly the delay penalty fees should be applied.
                         This important delay of works completion at Sona-Lossa-Kokomani constitutes the sole but important disappointing aspect of the project's implementation. With the combined close
                         monitoring and pressure from the GoN and the Bank, it is expected the full completion of the works by the project's closure.
