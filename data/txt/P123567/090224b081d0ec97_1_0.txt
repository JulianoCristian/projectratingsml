                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved by the RVP on January 31, 2011. The First Grant Funding Request was approved on April 18, 2011, and the Grant became effective on June 14, 2011.
                         Project implementation has taken off since then and good progress has been achieved so far. Since August 2012, all investments of Component I (13% of the grant proceeds)
                         consisting of 45 cereals banks and 5 animal feeding banks as well as procurement of 16800 small ruminants were fully implemented since August 2012. In the meantime the 2
                         categories of banks, each managed by women led managing committee, have functioned well in terms of selling the initial stock and replenishing stocks for each bank.

                         For the component II (74% of the grant’s proceeds), the rehabilitation and protection works related to the first part of irrigation scheme (Kourani and Baria 1 and 2- covering 693 ha)
                         started on March 8, 2012 and have been completed and the technical reception took place in March 2013. However, given the delays that occurred in the procurement of similar
                         works of the second batch of perimeters (Sona-Lossa-Kokomani ; 381 has), the work only started in April 2013. Thus, such works will continue during the forthcoming 2013 rainy
                         season. Challenges may arise in case the rains become heavy resulting in a break in the works progress which would necessitate extension of the project's closure date initially

                         scheduled for November 29, 2013. The suggestion to extend the closing date was agreed upon with the Client during the last supervision mission. In the meantime the Bank has
                         received a formal GoN’s request in this regard. The task team is currently processing the extension of the closing date of the project.
