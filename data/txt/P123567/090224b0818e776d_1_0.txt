                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved by the RVP on January 31, 2011. The First Grand Funding Request was approved on April 18, 2011, and the Grant Agreement became effective on June
                         14, 2011. Project implementation has taken off since then and it is likely that all planned activities will be completed by end of project closing, and that PDO will achieved. Most
                         activities of Component I (13% of the grant proceeds) consisting of 45 cereals and 5 animal feeding banks as well as procurement of 1680 small ruminants banks were fully
                         implemented since August 2012.

                         The rehabilitation and protection works related to the first batch of irrigation scheme (Kourani and Baria 1 and 2-started in March 8, 2012 covering 693 ha) under the Component 2
                         (74% of the grants proceeds) have significantly progressed and are on track. In the meantime, the procurement process for the rehabilitation and protection works related to the
                         second batch of irrigation scheme (Sona, Lossa and Kokomani totalizing 381 ha which process have been re launched after an initial failed process) is coming to close after a
                         lengthy procedure due to the need of adapting the technical design to the remaining budget of the Project
