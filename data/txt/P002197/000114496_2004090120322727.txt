Nairobi, Kenya
    Re:   Cr. 1849-KE / National Agricultural
          Research Project (NARP)
          Amendments
1.  We refer to your letter of January 2, 1991, in which you requested
certain amendments in the Development Credit Agreement of May 13, 1988,
between the Republic of Kenya and the International Development Association
(IDA) for reallocation of the amounts of the Credit allocated to different
categories and to provide for incremental support activities under the
Project.  We also refer to the telex send by Miss. W.W. Ikua of January 11,
1991 providing additional clarifications.  We are pleased to inform you that
the Association accepts your request in principle although minor
modifications were made to take account of the Bank's disbursement
guidelines.  Schedule 1 and 2 to the Development Credit Agreement shall
therefore be amended as indicated in the attachment.
2.  The amendments shall be considered effective as of July 1, 1990, except
for the Adaptive Research Grants which would become effective after IDA
review and approval of guidelines for the operation and use of these grants
to be submitted by the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute before April
1, 1991.
3.  All provisions of the Development Credit Agreement as amended herein
shall remain in full force and effect.
4.  Please confirm your agreement to the amendments by countersigning and
returning to us the enclosed copy of this letter.
                                  Sincerely yours,
