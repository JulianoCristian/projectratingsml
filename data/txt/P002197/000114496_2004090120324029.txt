Dear Sir:
Re: National Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 1849-KE) - Amendment
      We refer to our letter of June 30, 1993, countersigned by you on July
27, 1993, agreeing to extension of the closing date of the above project and
reallocation of funds; a revised table to Schedule 1 to the Development
Credit Agreement was attached.
      Unfortunately, the disbursement percentages for nonsalary operating
costs (Categories 1(c) and 2(c)) shown on the revised table were incorrect.
A corrected version is attached.  We request that you kindly ignore the
previous version.
      We very much regret this error and apologize for any inconvenience it
may have caused.
                                    With kind regards.
                                    Sincerely  yours,
                                    Sushma Ganguly
