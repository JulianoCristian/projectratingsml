MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE SEWERAGE BOARD OF LIMASSOL-AMATHUS (SBLA)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOR A SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
1.     The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Loan to the
Sewerage Board of Limassol-Amathus (SBLA) with the guarantee of the Republic
of Cyprus for US$ 25.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The Loan
would be made on standard Bank terms to assist in the construction and
implementation of sewerage and drainage systems for the Limassol-Amathus area.
Financing in the amount of US$ 30.0 million is to be provided by the Council
of Europe Resettlement (Social) Fund.
Backaround
2.     Cyprus is a small country with a population of 532,000 and an open
economy: exports and imports average 55% of GDP in recent years. The economic
structure is diversified: industry contributes 27% cf GDP and employs 38% of
the labor force; the service sector contributes about 55% of GDP and employs
45% of the labor force.
3.     Cyprus has a long history of good economic performanne characterized by
high growth, low unemployment and reasonable price stability. The economy
recovered rapidly from the severe recession created by the 1974 dislocations
when GDP fell by 30% from 1973 levels. By 1978, the pre-1974 output level was
regained, and full employment was restored. The economy's resilience and
strength are largely a reflection of local adaptability and flexibility; e.g.,
as demonstrated in its rapid response to changing market conditions in Middle
Eastern oil-exporting countries. Continued gains in output and incomes have
been recorded in the last decade. While rapid growth in exports of
agricultural and manufactured products played an important role in past
development, tourism remains the dominant foreign exchange earner in the
economy, with value added in the hotel and restaurant subsector showing growth
of over 16% per year.
4.     The challenges of identifying and securing competitive opportunities
under changing external market conditions have recently become more acute with
the impending internal unification of the European Community (EC). Cyprus
entered into a Customs Union Agreement with the EC in January 1988; and the
envisaged phasing out of tariffs and other restrictions on trade between
Cyprus and the EC has already begun to take effect. The need to increase
competitiveness in the agricultural and industrial sectors, while seeking new
opportunities, has 'Decuie more urgbuL.
5.     The objective of the Bank's assistance strategy in Cyprus is to support
the Government's efforts aimed at diversifying the country's economic base and
at fostering exports. The main areas of concentration have been
infrastructure, industry, agriculture, and water resource development. Recent



- 2 -
efforts have focused increasingly on projects that aim at relaxing major
sectoral constraints, and includa industrial restructuring and financial
sector reform activities, in response to the Government's request for
assistance during the period of transition under its association with the EC.
In providing assistance, the Bank focuses on those areas where its technical
expertise and international experiences are most valued, particularly in
projeri design, policy and institutional advice and sector work.
6.     The proposed project is for the Limassol-Amathus area, the second
largest urban area in Cyprus, with a population of 121,000. The area's
population had experienced an earlier period of rapid growth as a result of
immigration of refugees following the events of 1974, without commensurate
provision of infrastructure. In recent years, rapid tourism growth has
resulted in the area being the most important tourist destination in Cyprus.
A concentration on construction of accommodation capacity, together with weak
zoning regulation and enforcement, has, however, resulted in some serious
deficiencies in infrastructure, particularly sewerage. The project is
consistent with the Bank's focus on the provision of essential infrastructure
and development of export-oriented activities.
7.     Proiect Obiectives.  The main objectives of the project are to: (i)
provide a safe, reliable system for the disposal of human, commercial and
industrial waste water and thereby eliminate the nuisance and health risks,
including the threat to the area's water supply and important tourist
industry, that arise from the present unsatisfactory disposal arrangements;
(ii) provide key elements of a stormwater drainage system to reduce the worst
flooding in the rainy season; (iii) contribute to improved environmental
management through the provision of sewage and sludge treatment processes that
will enable optimum use to be made of the sewage effluent and sludge; and (iv)
strengthen the institutional capacity of the SBLA.
8.     The project will have a major positive environmental impact.  The
treatment plant is located in an industrial area, remote from any tourist or
residential development. Land for this purpose has already been
requisitioned. The sewage effluent will be treated to a secondary level
(beyond the usual requirement of grit, grease, and large solids removal), and
a rigorous environmental impact assessment will be carried out to ensure
little or no deleterious effect of the sea outfall. Moreover, the project
will provide opportunities for ensuring positive environmental effects on a
wider scale through: (i) a study of rural sanitation, which will define
strategies for waste management in rural areas, in order to prevent future
environmental degradation; and (ii) studies of effluent and sludge reuse which
will define environmentally sound ways of disposing of otherwise potentially
harmful wastes, in a manner which will have a large net positive effect.
9.     Proiect Description.  The project is the first phase of a program to
provide sewerage and drainage systems in the greater Limassol area and
consists of: (i) a central sewage collection and treatment system; (ii)
upgrading the existing stormwater drainage system; and (iii) technical
assistance and training and provision of related equipment to SBLA. Related
to the project will be studies that will lead to re-use of the treated



effluent and sludge from the project and the formulation of a rural sanitation
strategy.
10.     Although SBLA has no operational experience, similar organizations in
Cyprus have demonstrated their soundness, and the need for technical
assistance is not great. To ensure timely Troject implementation, a critical
path program will be prepared that covers all the project works. With respect
to institutional development of SBLA, staff will be recruited in line with an
agreed organizational plan. Technical assistance is to be provided through a
twinning arrarngement with an experienced overseas sewerage utility, which will
allow flexibility in the amount and type of technical assistance and on-the-
job training. The first phase of the twinning arrangement, to be completed by
the end of December 1990, will produce a developmental plan for SBIA, and
detailed terms of reference for the technical assistance and training to be
supplied by the overseas authority.
11.     The cost of the Project is estimated at US$ 69.1 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$ 37.2 million equivalent (54%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Cyprus are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 842&-
CY is being distributed separately.
12.     Rationale for World Bank Involvement.  The Bank's country assistance
strategy is in agreement with the Government's priorities concerning
environmental issues, particularly those related to the management of scarce
water resources, and protection of coastal waters. It also seeks to support
sustainable economic development, ensuring that the necessary infrastructure
is in place to accommodate tourism growth, while minimizing the adverse
environmental impact of the large and increasing number of visitors. In
addition to supporting the Government in addressing its priority concerns,
Bank assistance is indicated because of limited institutional capacity and
operational experience in the country regarding centralized sewage collection
and treatment systems. Finally, given the substantial Bank involvement in the
water supply sector in Cyprus -- particularly through the Southern Conveyor
Project (SCP) -- Bank support for the proposed project would strengthen the
coordination of water resource activities in the country.
13.     The Bank made a previous loan of US$ 16.8 million for a sewerage and
drainage project in Limassol in FY84. The loan was cancelled, however, in
April 1987 without any disbursement at the request of the borrower, because of
problems related to land acquisition of the sewage treatment plant site and
project financing.



14.     Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the following principal
agreements were obtained:
(a) As conditions of effectiveness, the Government of Cyprus will have
approved the SBLA's sewer rates, and satisfactory arrangements and
procedures for billing and collecting revenue will be in place.
(b) Beginning in FY 91, SBIA will implement rates and other charges to
provide adequate funds to cover: (i) all expenses of operations,
maintenance, administration, taxes and contributions required by law,
and depreciation; (ii) all interest and other charges on debt as well
as principal repayments in excess of depreciation; (iii) all increases
required to maintain adequate levels of working capital; and (iv) 20%
of each year's annual investment determined as the average of
investment over the subject year and two subsequent years.
(c) The rate structure will be amended as appropriate for meeting SBLA's
financial objectives, as outlined in (c) above, and this structure
will include (in addition to the sewer rates) a sewerage surcharge on
water consumption.
(d) SBLA will not, during the prolect implementation period, contract any
medium or long-term debt (other than for financing obligations under
this project) without the Bank's prior agreement.
15.     Ben6fits.  The proposed project represents a major contribution
towards improving the environment in the greater Limassol area ant protecting
its tourism industry, which is of critical importance to the eco ny of the
area and of the whole country.  The existing methods of dealing   :h liquid
wastes are inadequate, and, in some areas, are responsible for i.  Ltuation
which is already hazardous and limiting the development potential of the area.
The proposed project will provide an environmentally sound sewerage system and
sewage treatment process, with suostantial cost savings over the_ -resent
methods of disposal of human, commercial and industrial liquid wastes.
Benefits from the drainage works include reductions in productivity losses and
damage to property due to flooding during the rainy season. The proposed
systems for sewerage and drainage are affordable to the lower income
households in the area.
16.     Risks.  Local opposition to the siting of the sewage treatment plant
had been the main factor in causing delays and ultimate cancellation of the
previous project (Ln. 2411-CY). In order to reduce this risk under the
project, extensive preparatory work has been undertaken by the Government and
by SBLA: the proposed plant and related facilities have been carefully sited
in accordance with environmental considerations, and high-level discussions
held with concerned leaders of the communities in the vicinity of the proposed
plant have been effective. The proposed site has been requisitioned to assure
access for the purposes of construction, and acquisition procedures are at an



- 5 -
advanced stage. The risk of effective local opposition to the treatment plant
site is therefore now considered to be minimal.
17.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
