provide a safe, reliable system\n            for the disposal of human, commercial, and industrial waste\n            water; b) provide key elements of a stormwater drainage\n            system in areas subject to severe flooding; c) contribute to\n            improved environmental management; and d) strengthen the\n            institutional capacity of the SBLA.  The project comprises\n            the following major components : 1) a sewage collection\n            system consisting of 152 km of laterals and main sewers and\n            9,000 service connections; 2) a collector sewer; 3) 5\n            pumping stations; 4) sewage treatment plant of 23,600"}, "docdt": "1990-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
