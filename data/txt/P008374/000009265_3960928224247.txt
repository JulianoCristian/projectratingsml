LIMASSOL-AMATEUS SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUNARY
Borrower:      Sewerage Board of Limassol-Amathus (SBIA)
Guarantor:     Republic of Cyprus
Loan Amoumt:  US$ 25 million
Terms:         Fifteen years, including five years grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project
DescriRtion:   The project is the first phase of a program to provide sewerage
and drainage systems in the Limassol-Amathus area and consists
of: (i) a central sewage collection and treatment system; (ii)
upgrading the existing stormwater drainage system; and (iii)
tecunical assistance and training and provision of related
equipment to SBIA. Related to the project will be studies that
will lead to re-use of the treated effluent and sludge from the
project and the formulation of a rural sanitation strategy.
The project's main objectives are: (i) to provide a safe,
reliable system for the disposal of human, commercial and
industrial waste water and thereby eliminate the nuisance and
health risks, including the threat to the area's water supply
and important tourist industry, that arise from the present
unsatisfactory disposal arrangements; (ii) to provide key
elements of a stormwater drainage system to reduce the worst
flooding in the rainy season; (iii) to contribute to improved
environmental management through provision of sewage and sludge
treatment, and the identification and design of processes that
will enable optimum use to be made of the sewage effluent and
sludge; and (iv) to strengthen the institutional capacity of
the SBLA, which at present has only a nucleus of staff.
Benefit's
and Risks:     The project will have a major positive environmental impact.
It will protect the tourism industry in the Limassol-Amathus
area, which is of critical importance to the economy. In
addition, it will replace the inadequate methods of liquid
waste disposal in the area with an environmentally sound
sewerage system and treatment process. Benefits from the
drainage works include reductions in productivity losses and
damage to property due to floodinb. The risk of effective
local opposition to the siting of the sewage treatment plant
has been reduced to a minimal level through extensive
preparatory work by the Government and SBIA; the proposed plant
and related facilities have been carefully sited in accordan.ce
with environmental considerations, and high-level discussions
held with concerned local community leaders have been
effective. The proposed site has been requisitioned to assure
access for the purposes of construction, and acquisition
procedures are at an advanced stage. The risk of delays in
development of adequate institutional capacity within SBLA will
be addressed through the provision of technical assistance and
training for SBLA, and agreements to be reached on the
organizational structure and schedule of staffing.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
LIMASSOL-AMATHUS SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The proposed project is for the benefit of the town of Limassol and
its environs, with a population of about 121,000, the country's second largest
urban area and an important tourist center. There is an urgent need to
provide an adequate sewerage system for the area. The present methods of
sewage disposal aro highly unsatisfactory, being increasingly responsible for
both groundwater and sea water pollution and presenting health risks and
nuisance odors with a potentially negative effect on tourism. The project
covers the construction of a sewage collection and treatment system, works to
reduce flooding in the area; and the training, equipment, and technical
assistance needed to operate and maintain the system. The proposed project is
estimated to cost US$ 69.1 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$
37.0 million, and is planned to be completed in the 1991-1998 period. A Bank
loan of US$ 25.0 million is proposed to cover a large proportion of the
foreign exchange costs of the project.
1.02     A similar project was appraised in 1984; however, because of strong
local opposition to the siting of the sewage treatment plant, the project was
not implemented (paras 3.10 - 3.12). No disbursements were made, and the loan
was cancelled in 1987.
II,  SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. Water Rosources
2.01     Water resources available to Cyprus are scarce and their rational
management and development are critical to efficient economic development.
Average annual rainfall in Cyprus varies from about 1,000 mm in the mountains
to about 400 mm in the plains. About 85% of the total rainfall occurs between
November and March, and most of it runs off in flood flows. Shallow aquifers
have variable yields which drop considerably during the dry season when water
extraction is high and induced recharge from rivers ceases. Potential of the
two major deep aquifers is limited as the water from both is frequently very
hard, with a high sulfate content.
2.02    Groundwater from shallow aquifers, together with a few perennial
springs, have been the main source for irrigation and for water supply of
urban and rural communities. As most groundwater resources have been
developed and many aquifers overpumped, surface water is increasingly
important as the predominant source of water for development. There is some
surplus of water in the western part of the island on the southern slopes of
the Trodos Mountains. Development of this water supply resource is under way
by the Government with Bank assistance, principally under Phases I and II of
the Southern Conveyor Project for Water Resources Development (SCPI Ln 2386-CY



- 2 -
and SCPII Ln 2914-CY) .- the largest of the major water resources development
projects for Cyprus. The SCP is a multi-purpose project to alleviate water
shortages in the major urban centers and tourist areas and provide vitally
needed irrigation water. Phase I is expected to be completed by end 1990, and
Phase II is scheduled for completion in 1994.
2.03     This water scarcity, together with the high cost of developing the
few remaining water resources, have induced a general awareness in both
Government and Water Boards, of the need for conserving water resources in
Cyprus. The Government is introducing basic policy measures aimed at
optimizing their utilization, and endeavoring to increase cost recovery,
particularly of irrigation water, which is still priced substantially below
its economic cost.1
B. Tourism
2.04     The rapid growth of tourism has been one of the most important
factors contributing to Cyprus' economic success (real GDP growth of around 7Z
in 1987 and 1988). Gross tourism receipts registered an increase of 251 from
1986 to 1987, and represented over 341 of total receipts from exports of goods
and services. A concentration on construction of accommodation capacity,
together with weak zoning regulation and enforcement has, however, resulted in
some serious deficiencies in infrastructure, particularly sewerage; and labor
constraints, particularly in the unskilled and semi-skilled areas, are
beginning to be felt. The Government is aware of the need for an appropriate
development strategy for tourism, and in 1989 declared a moratorium on the
issuance of construction permits for new tourism accommodation.
C. Sector Service Levels
2.05     Only Nicosia has a piped sewerage system, constructed under a Bank
assisted project (Ln. 729-CY). The remaining urban population is served
mainly by individual disposal units consisting of septic tanks and percolation
pits. Recently constructed hotels and apartment buildings are served by small
biological package treatment plants. Problems are being experienced in high
density areas, in coastal areas with high groundwater levels, and where soils
have poor permeability. The Government plans to expand and construct sewerage
systems in major towns and tourist centers. Limassol-Amathus will be the
first urban area constructing major sewerage works since the Nicosia project
was completedY
3' Under the Southern Conveyor Project, Phase II (Ln. 2914-CY), Government has
agreed to establish charges for irrigation w.-ter sufficient to recover 381 of
the weighted average unit cost, and to mainta,n tariffs on domestic water
which will cover operating and maintenance costs, debt service or
depreciation, and yearly revenue shortfalls.
V Construction, with Bank assistance, of a sewerage system for Famagusta was
almost complete in July 1974 when political events caused implementation to be
suspended (para 2.11).



- 3 -
2.06     Virtually the entire population of Cyprus is served with piped water
of satisfactory quality. However, since Cyprus has a water shortage, water
rationing is often resorted to in years with below average rainfall.
D. Sector Organization
2.07     Water resource development and the supply of bulk water for
agricultural and urban use is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR), and is carried out through its Water
Development Department (WDD). Drinking water quality standards consistent
with WHO guidelines are established and monitored by the Ministry of Health.
Sewage effluent quality standards that will protect the public and the
environment have been set under the Sewerage and Drainage Law of 1971 and its
subsequent amendments, and the Ministry of Health is responsible for
monitoring. Sewage effluent quality standards for sea disposal are
administered by the Department of Fisheries of MANR, and are in compliance
with the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea, which Cyprus
signed in 1976 and ratified in 1979.
2.08     Each city is responsible for the provision of water supply and
sewerage within its corporate municipal boundaries, and in some cases, to
contiguous areas when agreement is obtained from the concerned authorities.
These se~rvices are provided through separate Water Boards, and Sewerage and
Drainage Boards, under the guidance of the Ministry of Interior. Water supply
in rural areas is the responsibility of local communities, administered
through Village Councils.
2.09     Management of water resources is fragmented in both policy and
execution. The Government is aware of the inefficiencies resulting from such
fragmentation. It has agreed, under the SC-, to take the steps necessary to
establish an integrated national water entity, which would be responsible for
the development and use of all water resources in Cyprus, and for "he
implementation, operation, and maintenance of all major water supply schemes
for both domestic water and irrigation. The Government is also aware of the
need for coordination between the water supply and sanitation sectors, both
because of their operational links, and because of the need for long-term
plans making optimum use of limited water resources. Ways of establishing an
improved coordination will therefore be considered following the
reorganization in the water sector.
E. Sector Objectives
2.10     Provision of sewerage in both urban and rural areas is given hign
priority by the Government of Cyprus. Plans are under way to install piped
sewerage systems for the currently unserved larger towns (Limassol, Larnaca,
Ayia Napa, Paralimni, and Paphos). Earlier delays in project implementation
(paras. 3.10 - 3.12) have contributed to the current urgency of the situation
in the Limassol-Amathus area. The Government also wishes to define a strategy
for rural sanitation in Cyprus that would be consistent with its other
objectives in the areas of natural resource conservation and the environment
(para. 4.16).

F.  Bank Involvement in the Water Supply and Sewerage Sector
2.11     Bank involvement in the water supply and sewerage sector started in
1971 with the Nicosia Sewerage Project (Ln. 729-CY) and Famagusta Sewerage and
Drainage Project (Ln. 730-CY). These projects provided for sewage collection
and disposal facilities,and were well advanced until the events of July 1974,
when the implementation of both projects was suspended. The Nicosia project
was subsequently completed, and operations began in 1980. The Project
Performance Audit Report (No. 3694), issued in 1981, concluded that even
though the operation of the system is divided, the project's institutional and
investment objectives had been met. The Nicosia Sewerage and Drainage Board
is an extremely efficient, financially viable authority. The loan for the
Famagusta project was extended several times in the hope that arrangements
could be made to complete the works, but these did not materialize, and the
loan was closed in 1981. The Bank has also assisted in the implementation of
two multi-purpose water resource development projects --the Vasilikos-
Pendaskinos (VPP) (Ln. 1658-CY, completed in 1967) and the ongoing SCP (para.
2.02).
2.12     The Bank made a loan of US$ 16.8 million for a sewerage and drainage
project in Limassol in FY84, which became effective in September 1985, about
15 months after Board approval. The loan was cancelled, however, in April
1987 (without any disbursement), at the request of the Borrower, because of
problems related to acquisition of the sewage treatment plant site and project
financing (paras. 3.10-3.12).
G. World Bank Lendina Strategy for Cvprus
2.13     The objective of the Bank's assistance strategy in Cyprus is to
support the Government's efforts aimed at diversifying the country's economic
base, modernizing its industrial and financial sectors, further improving its
transport and communications infrastructure, and improving the quality of the
environment. In providing assistance, the Bank focusses on those areas where
its technical and international expertise are the most valued, particularly in
project design and sector work. The Bank's lending strategy in Cyprus is to
provide assistance for a limited number of projects, in high priority sectors,
in support of the Government's overall development plan.
2.14     The Government has identified the sewerage sector as a high priority
area, and is seeking solutions to its sewage disposal problems that are
environmentally sound and make optimum use of scarce resources. The Limassol-
Amathus Sewerage and Drainage Project is the highest priority in a series of
actions by the Government to provide sewerage facilities in unserviced urban
areas (para. 2.10). The project would provide much needed infrastructure to
protect the resident population and visitors to the area from potential health
hazards, and would substantially eliminate the present occurrence of nuisance
odors.



III. THE PROJECT ARE. SERVICES AND DEMAND
A. Pro1ect Ame
3.01     The project area is the second largest urban area in Cyprus.  Located
on the southern coast along the shore of Akrotiri Bay, it comprises areas
within the municipalities of Limassol, Ayios Athanasios, Mesa Yitonia, Kato
Polemidhia, Yermasoyia, and the Improvement Board of Amathus (Map IBRD 2225),
and is referred to hererinafter as the Limassol-Amathus area. To the west are
the Akrotiri Salt Lake, and an agricultural expanse which includes extensive
orchards and vineyards. The picturesque setting of beaches and the Trodos
mountains behind the town, together with the benign climate, make this one of
the principal tourist areas in Cyprus. The Amathus Improvement Area,
containing many restaurants and hotels serving the tourism industry, stretches
out to the east for several kilometers.
B. Urban Growth and Economic Activity
3.02     Population in the Limassol-Amathus area has increased from 95,000 in
1973 to an estimated 121,000 inhabitants in 1989. Since 1974, the area has
led the other coastal towns in rapid tourism development. In 1987 there were
12,600 tourist beds, and an estimated 1.9 million tourist overnight stays.
High population densities have overloaded the existing wastewater disposal
facilities; the lack of a sewage collection and treatment system has resulted
in a deterioration in sanitary conditions and could undermine the valuable
tourist industry. During the rainy season flooding occurs in several areas of
the town. Because of inadequate drainage, the flood waters disrupt economic
activity in the areas affected, and there is often damage to property.
C. Existina and Planned Water Suppl1
3.03     The town of Limassol is supplied with water from local boreholes, aad
from springs located along the Kouris river in the Kouris catchment area, some
10 kilometers north-west of the town (Map IBRD 22254). Provision for the
future water demand of the Limassol-Amathus area up to the year 2010 has been
within the water resource allocations of the major surface water supply source
of the Kouris reservoir, constructed under SCPI (Ln 2386-CY). Under Phase II
of the SCP (Ln 2914-CY), a water treatment plant is under construction by the
MANR and is expected to be completed by 1992. In comparison with borehole
water supply sources, the SCP supply will be very expensive. Three different
water boards operate within the project area: (a) the Limassel Water Board,
which produces about 88% of the water consumed within the project area; (b)
the Yermasoyia Improvement Board, and (c) the Amathus Improvement Board. The
Limassol Water Board is an efficient and sound organization, financing about
40X of its investment out of its internal resources.
3.04     In 1988, the total water consumption in the greater Limassol area
reached 11.3 million cubic meters (mcm). Domestic consumption accounted for



- 6-
about 65X of the total, with tourism accounting for around 121, and industrial
and commercial use making up Lhe remainder. This represents an average
consumption of 237 liters per capita per day (lcd) for domestic and
industrial/commercial use, and an average consumption of 500 lcd per tourist.
A substantial number of the borehole sources of potable water for the
Limassol-Amathus area have had to be taken out of service due to pollution by
sewage from septic tanks and percolation pits. Under the project, sewerage is
to be provided for the urban development in the areas of the borehole fields;
and it is expected that, over time, the affected boreholes can be brought baek
into use.
D. Existing Solid and Liquid Waste Disposal
3.05     Generally, solid waste collection and disposal are satisfactory.
However, in spite of municipal ordinances some refuse is dumped in natural
drainage ravines and vacant lots. Control measures are being taken by
municipal officials to reduce such problems by prosecuting violation.
Domestic and commercial refuse collection and disposal in the Limassol-Pmathus
area are carried out by the municipal government, while private companies
service primarily the industrial community. A sanitary landfill site, i.e.,
tip and cover, located at Vati about 10 kilometers northwest of the town is
operated and maintained by the municipality. Adjacent to the site are waste
stabilization ponds for disposal of septic tank sludge and holding ponds for
toxic wastes. The site for the ponds is clay, and leachate is not a problem.
Only one facility is affected by the effluent from the waste stabilization
ponds, i.e., a small irrigation reservoir downstream of the landfill site
where nutrient loading from the septic tank sludge has contributed to the
reservoir being eutrophic during the summer months, but the water quality is
acceptable for irrigation.
E. Existing Seweraae and Drainage Systems
3.06     At present, wastewaters are disposed of in individual systems
consisting mainly of septic tanks and absorption pits, with the exception of
some hotels and industries which have installed package biological wastewater
treatment plants. These plants are costly to construct, operate and maintain.
In the older parts of Limassol, septic tanks overflow as the ground can no
longer accept the effluents due to the higher population densities and long
period of usage. The septic tanks and abscrption pits do not function
properly because (i) volumes of wastewaters far exceed the soil absorption
capacity; (ii) there is insufficient space for construction of disposal unitb
of the proper size; and (iii) the groundwater table is high. Septic tanks are
not emptied regularly (pumping out of the tanks is relatively expensive), and
often, after a relatively short period of operation (sometimes within a few
months), solids flow into absorption pits, plugging the surrounding soil and
the effluents overflow into the streets, exacerbating bcth the health hazards
and nuisance odors. Wastewater volumes in the area are projected to be 11.4
mcm in 1990, i.e., 951 higher than they were in 1982, and the situation is
rapidly deteriorating.
3.07     This pollution is an increasing threat to boreholes operated by the
Limassol Water Board (LWB), and already boreholes have had to be taken out of



service (para. 3.04). The LWB monitors water quality closely, with
bacteriological and chemical analyses of the water abstracted from all
boreholes carried out on a regular basis.
3.08     There are three industrial areas within the project area.  The two
largest have bp   .eveloped by the Government.  For the largest area, a
treatment plant has been built to remove toxic materials and carry out some
biological treatment. At the other Government area, "wet" industries carry
out treatment within the site. The third area, consisting principally of a
cannery and wine factories, discharges its effluents into the sea adjacent to
the new harbor area of the Akrotiri bay. The three areas will be connected to
the sewerage system under the project, with the effluents from all areas
having to meet municipal standards for discharge of waste from a property, and
also those within SBLA by-laws. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the Government would take all measures necessary to ensure that the
industrial enterprises within the project area follow practices for waste
water discharge consistent with the ap?licable requirements.
3.09     The existing drainage consists primarily of surface flow to natural
water courses and rivers. Three major streams, the Yermasoyia, Vathias, and
Garyllis rivers, cross the area on their way to the sea. Most of the runoff
is drained into these water courses via roadside ditches and storm drains.
Based on the 1974 Master Plan for drainage in the Limassol area, about 30
kilometers of storm drains have been constructed in the downtown area, which
represents about 20X of the total length of streets and roads. Canalization
of the lower sections of the Yermasoyia river has been carried out to reduce
flooding in low lying areas. The growth of the town toward the high ground,
together with the channeling of flows by roads and by development, have
increased the frequency and severity of flooding problems. In several areas,
the storm drainage system is now grossly inadequate and flooding, particularly
during the winter season thunderstorms, has caused substantial damage to
government and private property. There is a need to update the 1974 Master
Plan for drainage and this will be carried out under the project (para. 4.16).
F. Project History
3.10     The original master plan for sewerage and drainage of Limassol was
completed in May 1974. Delays in implementation were caused by the events of
1974. The study was updated in 1977; and in 1979, the sewerage part of the
study was expanded to include the Amathus tourist area. Following a Bank
project identification mission in September 1982, and the updating of the
feasibility study in 1983,1/ a loan (Ln. 2411-CY) was approved in May 1984.
3.11     Designed to meet the sewerage and drainage needs of the area up to
the year 2010, the project comprised the first phase of development of a two-
phase sewerage system and high priority drainage works. The proposed sewerage
system at that time followed the natural slope of the terrain towards the
southwest, and resulted in the proposed sewage treatment plant's location
being close to the sea about 8 km from the western boundary of Limassol. The
X All studies were carried out by experienced consultants. Studies
undertaken during preparation of Ln 2411-CY are listed in Annex 14.

project included the first of two interceptors to service the densely
populated coastal area, with the additional interceptor to service the higher
grounds of the town, proposed for the second phase, Sewage was to be treated
using the extended aeration activated sludge process with sludge drying beds.
An outfall for effluent disposal into Episkopi Bay, remote from the tourist
areas, was to be constructed for use during an interim period while irrigation
use was developed.
3.12     The loan was made effective in September 1985, after a one-year delay
caused by difficulties in securing the site for the sewage treatment plant.
Apparently resolved, the sewage treatment plant site re-emerged as an issue
when newly elected municipal officials took office in 1986. Several sites on
the western side of Limassol were proposed but all were subsequently rejected
for a variety of reasons. The amount of Government financing available for
the project also became an issue. As these issues could not be resolved, the
loan was cancelled in 1987, without disbursements, at the request of the
Borrower.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.  Project Settina
4.01     In early 1989, the Government requested that the Bank again consider
financing a sewerage and drainage project for the Limassol-Amathus area
because of the accelerating need to rectify the unsatisfactory situation
before the important tourism industry was affected. An identification mission
visited Cyprus in May, 1989, followed by a pre-appraisal mission in October of
the same year. The project was appraised the following February, and
negotiations were completed in May, 1990.
B. Proiect Objectives
4.02     The project's main objectives are: (i) to provide a safe, reliable
system for the disposal of human, commercial and industrial waste water; and
thereby eliminate the nuisance and health risks, including the threat to the
area's water supply and important tourist industry, that arise from the
present unsatisfactory disposal arrangements; (ii) to provide key elements of
a stormwater drainage system in areas subject to severe flooding during the
rainy season, which causes damage and disrupts commercial, industrial, and
other activities; (iii) to contribute to improved environmental management by
identifying and promoting the optimum use of sewage effluent and sewage sludge
in the project area; and (iv) to strengthen the institutional capacity of the
SBLA, which at present has only a nucleus of staff.
C.  Rationale for World Bank SuDport for the Project
4.03     The Bank's country assistance strategy is in agreement with the
Government's priorities concerning environmental issues, particularly those
related to the management of scarce water resources, and protection of coastal



waters. It also seeks to support sustainable economic development, ensuring
that the necessary infrastructure is in place to accommodate tourism growth,
thus minimizing the adverse environmental impacts of the increasing number of
visitors. In addition to supporting the Government in addressing its priority
concerns, Bank assistance for the proposed project is indicated because of
limited operational experience ir the country with centralized sewage
collection and treatment systems./ In addition, given the substantial Bank
involvement in the water supply sector in Cyprus -- particularly through the
SCP project -- Bank support for the proposed project would assist in the
coordination of water resource activities in the country.
D. Planned Service Levels
4,04     Projections for the resident population of greater Limassol have been
updated since the 1983 study, and incorporate a growth rate of about 1X per
year over the next decade or so.Y Within the greater Limassol area, the
densely populated area in the older parts of Limassol, together with the high-
rise development, including hotels, that are close to the sea, comprise the
area where the lack of adequate sewerage results in the most unsatisfactory
situation (Map IBRD 22254). The sewerage component of the project would
service this area (Phase I of the total scheme -- the project area-- para.
4.05). The remaining urban development will be serviced under Phase II and is
referred to hereafter as the general benefit area. Projections of the entire
urban area population, and of the populations within the project area and the
general benefit area are presented in the following table:

E. Proiect Components and Description
4.05     The proposed Limassol-Amathus Sewerage and Drainage Scheme would
provide sewerage for the Limassol area and its environs, and the means for
treating domestic sewage and industrial effluent, and upgrade the storm

drainage system in parts of the area most susceptible to flooding. The scheme
is to be constructed in two phases. The proposed Bank project, to be
constructed during the 1991-1997 period and representing Phase I of the Scheme
(Map IBRD 22254) includes the following major components:
(a)      a sewage collection system consisting of about 152 kilometers
(km) of laterals and main sewers, in sizes from 150 - 300
millimeters (mm) diameter, and about 9,000 service connections;
(b)      a collector sewer, i.e. main interceptor/force main consisting
of about 20 km of sewer pipe varying in size from 400 - 1300 mm
dia.;
(c)      five pumping (sewage lift) stations;
(d)      sewage treatment plant of 23,600 m3/day maximum capacity;
(e)      a 900 mm dia. sea outfall, of total length 2,100 m (1,500 m
land, 600 m sea section);
(f)      upgrading of the existing storm drainage system by provision of
about 21 km of storm drains throughout the SBLA area, and
improvements to existing drainage catch basins and inlet
structures to drains;
(g)      operation and maintenance equipment for the sewerage and
drainage systems;
(h)      consultant services for project implementation, including
institutional development of SBLA and updating of the master
plan for drainage; and
Mi)      study of the environmental impact of the effluent outfall to
determine the design of the outfall, and ensure an effluent of
acceptable quality (paras. 4.11 and 4.16).V
The works to be constructed in Phase II would consist of additional lateral
and main sewer extensions to the collection system, expansion of the sewage
treatment plant, and additional equipment for the pumping stations.
4.06     Sewerage:  The sewer system of the project would comprise laterals,
main sewers and collector sized to meet sewage flows through the year 2010.
The lateral sewers to be laid in each street in the area to be sewered would
be of a minimum dia. of 150mm (for reasons of accessibility for cleaning).
The topography of the area, i.e., a coastal strip with mountains parallel to
the sea, dictates that the laterals discharge into a series of main sewers,
parallel to each other, each of a length of 1 to 4 km, running north to south
towards the sea, with the collector traversing the area from west to east
close to the shoreline (Map IBRD 22254).
V Studies of (i) effluent and sludge reuse, including demonstration projects
and (ii) rural sanitation, are also associated with the project (para. 4.16).



- 11 -
4.07     Under the project, sewers would be provided in 900 ha of the highest
density area of Limassol and the adjacent municipalities and in 375 ha of
Amathus. A total of 152.2 km of lateral and main sewers would be provided; of
which 131.3 km would be 150 to 200 mm diameter, and 20.9 km would be 250 to
300 mm diameter. Present value analysis of alternatives for sizing and
staging the laterals and main sewers show that there is no advantage in
staging their construction. Manholes would be provided for cleaning access.
Flow in the lateral and main sewers would be by gravity.
4.08      The only practical location for the main collector sewer is adjacent
to the sea shore, but pumping will be required along the whole length of 20.1
km. Based on an analysis of variables such as energy, number and location of
pumping stations, and depth and diameter of sewers, the arrangement found to
be the least cost comprises five pumping stations and a sewer pipe varying
from 400 to 1300 mm dia. For the most critical length of the collector -- the
force main between the last pumping station (F) and the sewage treatment plant
-- present value analysis shows that the least-cost alternative is to provide
a pipe of a 700 mm diameter capable of meeting Phase I flows as compared to a
larger 1100 mm pipe to meet Phase II flows. It is not practical to stage
construction for the other lengths of the collector, as the pipe has to be
laid in the road constituting the main tourist thoroughfare and there would be
an unacceptable inconvenience to tourists and local traffic.
4.09     lumping Stations:  All five pumping stations will be constructed of a
size to accommodate Phase II flows, but the majority of the equipment provided
under the project will be for Phase I flows. All pumping stations will
contain equipment to eliminate odors. Capacities would be:

F                           980        32.0
4.10     Sewage Treatment:  A secondary, i.e., two-stage, biological plant
will be provided to treat Phase I sewage flows (i.e., average flow of 18,600
in/day, and maximum flow of 23,600 m3/day). Comprising primary treatment --
grease, grit, and large solids removal -- followed by conventional activated
sludge treatment, the plant will remove in excess of 90% of the biochemical
oxygen demand and suspended solids of the sewage. Sludge from the plant will
be stabilized utilizing anaerobic sludge digestion with the gas produced used
for heating the sludge digestors. The sludge will be dewatered using belt
presses. A present value analysis has shown that the sewage and sludge
treatment processes proposed are the least-cost solutions to produce a

treatment plant effluent that can be disposed of through a sea outfall, with
minimal environmental impact (para. 4.11), and a sludge that can be used as a
soil conditioner. While the market for the sludge is being developed (para.
4.16), the sludge will be disposed of by landfill at the existing solid waste
disposal site at Vati (para. 3.05), about 20 km. from the treatment plant,
where the sludge will not cause any environmental problem. Although the
treatment plant would be located more than 1 km from the nearest residence,
and about 2 km from the nearest hotel, precautions will be taken in the design
to prevent any odor nuisance.
4.11     Sea Outfall:  Initially, the effluent from the sewage treatment plant
will be disposed of through a sea outfall of 900 mm dia. The outfall has been
sized only to meet Phase I flows, as it is expected that, prior to completion
of Phase II of the sewerage scheme, full use will be made of the effluent for
irrigation (para 4.16). The land section of the outfall will be 1,500 m, and
the sea section 600 m long, of which the 200 m long diffuser section will
discharge into 12 m depth of water. The Fisheries Department in MANR has
considerable data on wind and sea currents and the sea bed profile in the area
of the proposed outfall; and the length of the outfall has been determined on
the basis of a preliminary environmental assessment of the effects of the
outfall on the sea, to ensure that there will be no significant environmental
degradation. The final design of the outfall will be based on a detailed
study of the oceanographic data (para. 4.16).
4.12     Drainage:  The drainage works included in the project cover high
priority zones throughout the SBIA area where flooding is particularly severe.
Considerable investments in drainage have already been made in the major
built-up parts of the area to alleviate some of the worst flooding, and the
drainage works under the project will result in the remaining most serious
flooding problems being eliminated. The sizing of the drains will be as
identified in the 1974 Limassol Drainage Master Plan. Generally street drains
have been designed to carry a one in two year flood; area drains, a one in
five year flood; and major drains, a one in twenty year flood. Drains to be
provided under the project would be:
Size             Length (km)
Up to 600 mm dia.         9.5
600 to 1000 mm dia.         3.9
Over 1100 mm dia.         7.2
General improvements to drainage throughout the whole SBLA area comprise the
replacement of 2550 catch basin and inlet structures that, at present, do not
function properly because they are under-sized. Although the drainage works
included under the project will not be affected, there is a need to update and
expand the scope of the 1974 Drainage Master Plan to the whole of the SBLA
area, and SBIA is requesting its consultants to carry out this task.
Agreement was reached at negotiations that SBLA would complete the updating of
the Drainage Master Plan by June 30, 1991 (para. 8.02-g).
F.   Ogeration and Maintenance Eguipment
4.13     Equipment will be provided to enable SBIA to efficiently operate and
maintain its sewerage and drainage systems. Items include a truck mounted



- 13 -
combined jetting/suction machine, trailer mounted jetting machine, and trailer
mounted winding device, two vehicles and miscellaneous sewer and drainage
cleaning tools.
G. Construction Supervaision
4.14     Experienced engineering consultants will assist SBLA in construction
supervision of the project works (para. 4.20).
R. Institutional Development
4.15     The project will include technical assistance to strengthen SBLA.
Organizations in Cyprus similar to the SBIA have demonstrated their soundness,
and the need for technical assistance may not be great. A twinning
arrangement with an experienced overseas sewerage authority, which would allow
flexibility in the amount of type of assistance to be provided, has been
agreed in principle with SBLA. Outline terms of reference for this
arrangement, included in Annex 1, have also been agreed. Other forms of
technical assistance, however, may also be acceptable to the bank. As a
minimum, it was agreed at negotiations that, in order to ensure timely project
implementation, SBIA would recruit staff in a timely manner in line with the
organizational chart in Annex 8; and Phase I of the twinning arrangement for
the provision of technical assistance (Annex 1) would be completed by the end
of the year. Some specific training for SBLA staff will be obtained under the
equipment supply and installation contracts (para. 5.03).
T. Studies
4.16     Studies of: (a) the environmental impact of the sea outfall; (b)
sewage effluent and sludge reuse; (c) rural sanitation; and (d) drainage
master plan, will be associated with the project.
(a)      Environmental Impact Assessment of the Outfall:  In order to
gain information under the full range of tide and weather
conditions, the environmental impact assessment of the sea
outfall will involve surveys to be carried out over at least a
one-year period, and analysis of their results so as to
determine the design of the outfall in order to ensure an
effluent of satisfactory quality. The surveys to be carried
out are summarized in Annex 2.A together with the estimated
resources required. Most of the work will be carried out by
qualified staff of the Fisheries Department, with some
assistance from specialist consultants.
(b)      Sewage Effluent and Sludge Reuse:  Outline terms of reference
for the studies of sewage effluent and sludge re-use are given
in Annex 2.B. They will be carried out in two phases; the
first phase will identify the most promising uses, taking into
account the anticipated qualities and quantities to be
produced, potential markets, health hazards and needs for
safeguards, and the costs and benefits, etc., of each possible



- 14 -
use. Their associated treatment and infrastructure needs will
be identified, and pilot demonstration projects will be
designed, which will be implemented under the second phase.
The issues related to pricing of the effluent for irrigation
purposes, taking into account current irrigation pricing
policies, will be reviewed under the study, and recommendations
will be made. Qualified staff of the Water Development
Department and the Agricultural Research Institute of MANR,
assisted by specialist consultants will undertake the studies.
(c)      Rural Sanitation:  The study of rural sanitation, outline terms
of reference at Annex 2.C, will review the existing solid and
liquid collection and disposel situation in the rural areas of
Cyprus, and define long-run strategies for managing wastes and
safeguarding the rural environment.
(d)      Limassol Drainage Master Plan:  Outline terms of reference for
updating the plan are given in Annex 2.D.
The effluent and sludge reuse and rural sanitation studies fall within the
scope of studies included under SCPII, and will be financed under that project
(Ln. 2914-CY). The outcome of the study of the sea outfall will determine the
final design of the outfall; and thus has an impact on project implementation.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government would carry
out this study in accordance with the project implementation schedule; i.e. by
June 30, 1992 (para. 8.01-b).
I. Land AcqLuisition
4.17     Acquisition of the land needed for the project is under way, with the
exception of the land section of the sea outfall, which is currently being
surveyed. The land for the treatment plant site has been requisitioned,
enabling construction to proceed without awaiting final transfer of title to
SBLA; and assurances have been obtained that there are no legal impediments to
site access for the purpose of construction. Acquisition procedures have been
started for the land for the pumping stations; no difficulties are foreseen
with respect to obtaining the necessary easements for construction and
maintenance of the pipes.
J. Cost Estimates
4.18     Detailed project cost estimates are given in Annex 3, and are
summarized in Table 4.1. The cost estimates of the sewerage system are based
on detailed designs. The estimates for the sewage treatment plant and pumping
stations are based on preliminary designs; and that for the sea outfall on the
preliminary environmental assessment (para. 4.11). The costs of a large part
of the drainage works are based on detailed designs, the remainder on
preliminary designs. Costs of pipe materials and major electrical/mechanical
equipment are based on representative quotations furnished by established
suppliers. Civil works construction costs are on the basis of data furnished
by major local construction companies. For the sea outfall, the cost is based
on similar outfalls elsewhere. All cost estimates are based on early 1990
price levels. Physical contingencies are 10 for the sewerage and drainage
works, and 20X for the sea outfall civil works. Annual price increases for



- 15 -
foreign costs are estimated at 4.9X per year until 1995, and at 3.7X per year
thereafter; and for local costs at 41 per year.

4.19     The proposed loan of US$ 25.0 million equivalent would finance an
estimated 36X of the cost of the Project. The balance of the Project's cost,
estimated at US$ 44.1 million, would be financed by a loan from the Council of
Europe Resettlement Fund (CERF), and from charges to customers. The proposed
project financing sources and amounts are summarized below.

K. Project ImDlementation
4.20     The Sewerage Board of Limassol-Amathus (SBLA) (para. 5.01) will be
responsible for project implementation and for the operation and maintenance
of the sewerage and drainage system. Project implementation will be directly
under the control of the Engineer of SBLA (para. 5.02) who will be an
exp3rienced engineer#. However, revision and updating of the previous
detailed design and day-to-day construction supervision of the project works
will be the responsibility of consultants (para. 4.26). During
implementation, the consultants will carry out (i) tender evaluation; (ii)
review of contractors' drawings, verification of equipment and materials
quality for approval by SBLA; and (iii) construction supervision of civil
works, equipment and materials supply, installation, training, testing and
commissioning. This work is being financed by SBIA.
4.21     The project implementation period will be from 1991 to 1997, plus a
one year guarantee period (Annex 4). Detailed Critical Path Method (CPM)
networks will be prepared by respective contractors. A project monitoring and
repotting system, including performance indicators (Annex 5) and progress on
staffing, billing, etc. (paras. 4.15, 5.04, and 5.08), was discussed and
agreed upon during loan negotiations.
4.22     In order to make full economic use of the investment included in the
project, assurances were obtained during negotiations that SBIA would continue
to expand its operations in accordance with a plan acceptable to the Bank
(para. 8.02-h).
f' An experienced, qualified engineer has recently been recruited.

L.  Prourment
4.23     Proposed contracts and their respective cost estimates are presented
in Annex 6. A summary of project elements and method of procurement is given
in Table 4.2.
4.24     It is anticipated that there will be eight contracts for the sewerage
and drainage works. Seven of these contracts will include civil works and the
supply of equipment and materials, including pipes. These are: the sewage
treatment plant; the main pumping station and the force main to the treatment
plant; four pumping stations and the main collector sewer; the sea outfall
(land and sea section); two contracts for the laterals and main sewers
(including the majority of the drains); and the drainage works outside the
sewered area. The eighth contract will be for the supply of operation and
maintenance equipment.
4.25     Seven of these contracts will be procured through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the Bank Procurement
Guidelines. Those portions of the drainage works within the area to be
sewered will be included in the two contracts for laterals and main sewers.
The remaining drainage works outside the sewerage works area, estimated to
cost US$2.43 million, comprise relatively small works in several locations,
and, therefore, would be of little interest to foreign contractors. They will
be procured through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to
the Bank. One set of sample bidding documents for procurement through LCB
will be submitted to the Bank for prior approval.
4.26     Contracts for equipment and materials above $50,000 would be procured
through ICB procedures; total contracts to be procured through ICB amount to
about US$61.0 million. Contracts for equipment and materials below US$50,000
will be procured through prudent shopping based on at least three price
quotations. The aggregate value of these contracts will not exceed $200,000.
The "other" category in Table 4.2 includes procurement of consulting
engineering services for project implementation (para. 4.20), studies, and
training of SBLA staff (para. 5.03). Services of consultants required for
studies and training will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants. It is anticipated that a limited amount of
retroactive financing up to $300,000 may be required for the first phase of
the twinning arrangement (Annex 1), consultant services, and equipment and
materials for the outfall studies (Annex 2.A). All bidding packages for goods
and works estimated to cost $200,000 or more, as well as the contract for the
project implemeatation consultant (para 4.20), will be subject to prior review
by the Bank. Contracts for prior review amount to about 92% of the contracts
to be financed by the Bank. Contracts not covered by prior review procedures
will be subject to random post review by the Bank after contract award.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that procurement will be in
accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans.

b According to Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants
4.27     The SBLA has employed a consultant for all engineering studies, final
design and preparation of tender documents for the project. The SBIA has
indicated it±s intention to retain the same consultant for project
implementation including construction supervision and updating the master plan
for drainage. This consultant is a major international engineering firm,
technically qualified to undertake such an assignment.
4.28     It is anticipated that most of the pipe materials and all of the
electrical and mechanical equipment will be supplied by foreign manufacturers,
and that contracts for the pumping stations and associated pipelines, sewage
treatment plant, and outfall would be awarded e.ther to foreign contractors or
to joint-ventures of foreign and local contractors. It is expected that the
contracts for laterals and main sewers and drainage works would be awarded to
local contractors who are competent. Operational equipment would be supplied
by foreign manufacturers through local agents; local agents will not be
mandatory, however. The studies would be undertaken generally by competent
government agencies assisted by foreign specialists.

M. Disbursements
4.29     The proposed Bank loan of US$ 25.0 million equivalent would be
disbursed against normal documentation as follows:
Amount         Percent of
US$ million   Expenditures to
Category       DescriDtion             Eauivalent      be Financed

Total                         25.0
4.30     Disbursements would be against Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for
eligible expenditures under the contracts valued at US$ 200,000 equivalent or
less. Supporting documentation for these would be retained by SBLA and made
available for review by the Bank during supervision. The annual audits of the
project accounts would include a separate opinion on the disbursements made
under the SOE procedure. All other disbursements would be made against normal
documentation submitted to the Bank.
4.31     In order to expedite project execution, a Special Account would be
opened at the Central Bank of Cyprus (or any commercial bank acceptable to the
Bank) with an authorized allocation of US$ 2,000,000, about four months of
estimated expenditures. The documentation of replenishment requests would
follow the same procedures as in para. 4.30.
4.32     An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 7.  The
Bank's historical disbursement profile for Cyprus was used in the estimation
of this schedule. The closing date of the loan would be June 30, 1998.
N. Proiect SuDervision
4.33     Progress toward meeting project objectives would be monitored through
regular supervision missions that would be undertaken twice yearly.
Supervision would be aided by SBIA's documentation of progress in its reports



- 20 -
to the Bank, which would be submitted twice yearly. SBLA would also submit an
annual report which will contain full information on the monitoring indicators
outlined in Annex 5 (para. 4.21).
V. THE BOROER
A. Introduction
5.01     The borrower would be the Sewerage Board of Limassol-Amathus (SBLA),
established by the Council of Ministers order 248/80 V published September 5,
1980, in accordance with the Sewerage and Drainage Law of 1971. The Republic
of Cyprus will be the guarantor. The 1971 Law and subsequent legislation is
broad and comprehensive, and provides the Council of Ministers with the
authority to: (a) establish sewerage and drainage boards, define the area in
which those boards are to operate, and nominate members of the board to
represent the interests of non-municipal areas included in the board's
operating area; and (b) approve the sewerage boards' annual investment
programs, and their proposed schedule of rates, charges and fees. The Law
also: (a) provides that boards are to be financially autonomous corporate
entities; (b) gives boards rights-of-way and power to compulsorily acquire
property; and (c) establishes record keeping and auditing requirements.
B. Organization and Nanagement
5.02     The SBIA Board members were appointed by Council of Ministers
decision 20,216 dated April 2, 1981. Project preparation work has been
carried out under the control of SBLA's, as yet limited, staff and Limassol's
municipal staff. Present SBIA staff comprises an initial nucleus; i.e., an
engineer, a chief accountant, plus supporting staff. An outline
organizational chart, along the lines of that indicated in Annex 8, was agreed
with SBLA during loan negotiations. A sewerage engineer has recently been
hired. This engineer, and one additional accounting staff to be hired, are
expected to be working by June 1990. Advice on staffing and long-term
development of SBLA will be obtained through the twinning arrangement, or
other forms of technical assistance to be provided (para. 4.15), and will be
discussed with the Bank. While final authority for all decisions rests with
the Board, the engineer would be responsible for physical development of the
sewerage and drainage system (including the project works) and operation and
maintenance, and the chief a countant/administrator would be responsible for
financial, accounting and administrative matters including development of
accounting procedures.
Pi Order 248/80 also specified the area of operations.



- 21 -
C. Staffing and Training
5.03     The technical staff of SBIA would receive training by the consultants
during project implementation. The treatment plant superintendent and his
assistant would be hired in sufficient time to provide '-6 months practical
training abroad in management and process operation of a similar treatment
plant, and both staff would also be given three months training in Limassol by
the treatment plant equipment suppliers. In addition, the chemist would be
provided with three months training abroad in system technology, sampling and
laboratory testing. Other technical staff, i.e., mechanic, electrician, and
foreman for the sewerage system and pumping station operators, would be
trained locally by suppliers of the equipment and through arrangements with
the Nicosia Sewerage Board.
5.04     Administrative and accounting staff would be added as required.  Such
staff are available in Cyprus, and would be under the direct supervision of
the chief accountant/administrator (para. 5.02), thus not requiring consultant
services. Progress on staffing and training will be reported to the Bank as
part of the project monitoring system (para. 4.21).
D. Accounting and Auditing
5.05     SBIA uses acceptable budgeting procedures as provided for in the
Sewerage and Drainage Act of 1971. The budget, which consists of a projected
income statement, a statement of sources and applications of funds, and a
statement of capital expenditures, is subject to approval by the Council of
Ministers (CH) (para. 5.01). The budgeting cycle starts in September of each
year and the CM approval is usually granted prier to the beginning of the
fiscal year, which runs from January 1 to December 31.
5.06     SBIA is in the process of developing its own accounting systems,
which will be tailored after systems that are currently used by the Nicosia
Sewerage Board. The system will be based on accrual accounting principles and
capable of generating the usual public utilities financial statements.
Procedures will be computerized as part of the effort to be undertaken for the
billing (para. 5.08). SBIA accounting staff, which is being strengthened
(para. 5.02) will complete and implement the accounting systems; the systems
will be ready for recording SBLA activities as from January 1991.
5.07     Annual audits of the SBLA accounts are required by the Sewerage and
Drainage Law of 1971, and are to be carried out by the Auditor General of the
Republic, and this is acceptable to the Bank. Agreements were reached during
negotiatiots with SBLA that, beginning with fiscal year 1991, SBIA's financial
statements would be audited by an independent auditor satisfactory to the
Bank, and that such statements and the audit report, including the audits of
the Statement of Expenditures and the Special Account, would be submitted to
the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal year (para 8.02-f).



- 22 -
E. Billlng and Collection
5.08     SBLA will start billing and collecting revenues from beneficiaries
during tehe first year of construction, i.e., 1991 (para. 6.02). Collection of
revenues from sewer rates to be levied on the assessed values of properties
will be undertaken by SBLA, following procedures to be prepared by SBLA staff
along the lines of those currently applied by the Nicosia Sewerage Board. The
list of properties and ownerships in the project and the project general
benefit areas are being prepared and will be handed over by the Lands and
Surveys Department (LSD) to the SBLA in time for billing at the beginning of
1991. LSD has completed data on the project area and made them available to
SBLA in April 1990; those pertaining to the general benefit area will be made
available in September 1990. SBIA is in the process of completing its
arrangements for computerized billing and collection with assistance from its
software consultants, and possibly from the Nicosia Sewerage Board. Progress
on billing and collection activities will be reported ti the Bank through the
project monitoring system (para. 4.21).
5.09     Agreement was reached with SBLA during negotiations that, as a
condition of loan effectiveness, SBLA will have satisfactory arrangements and
procedures for billing and collecting its revenues from sewer rates, i.e., (i)
SBLA has obtained sufficient data on ownerships and value assessments to
enable it to start billing its customers; (ii) SBIA has entered into
arrangements with LSD for the future updating of these data; and (iii) SBLA
has completed arrangements for billing, including acquiring the services or
facilities for issuing customer bills and collecting revenues (para. 8.03-b).
Revenues from a water surcharge on water consumption will be billed and
collected through the Limassol Water Board (LWB), but this activity will not
start before 1995, when the first group of customers are connected to the
sewerage system. Agreement was also reached with SBLA that the necessary
arrangements for billing the water surcharge through LWB will be completed as
soon as feasible, but by not later than December 31, 1993 (para. 8.02-c).
5.10     The Sewerage and Drainage Act of 1971, (as amended in 1972 and 1978)
entitles the sewerage boards to request the authorization of the Council of
Ministers to collect bills overdue by more than six months through the
Department of Inland Revenues. It also authorizes SBLA to levy a 20X late
payment penalty.



- 23 -
VI FINANCE
A. Past Performance and Present Position
6.01     SBLA was established in 1980 in accordance with the Sewerage and
Drainage Act of 1971 (para. 5.01). Since then, SBLA has not undertaken any
operational responsibilities; and its limited staff have been involved only
with project preparation. Funds for these SBLA on-going activities and for
project preparation were financed by loans from the Government in anticipation
of SBLA own revenues from operations. Agreements were reached during
negotiations with the Government and zBJA that by December 31, 1990, SBLA will
enter into arrangements with the Government for consolidating and repaying
these loans, including repayments and accrued interest through 1990, in order
to determine SBLA's annual debt service on these loans and ensure their
repayment (para. 8.02-b).
B. Rate Structure and Revenues
6.02     The Sewerage and Drainage Act of 1971 (para. 5.01) authorizes the
Sewerage Boards to establish their rates in accordance with specified
requirements for financial viability. According to the Act, the rates should
be approved in time for billing the beneficiaries starting in the first year
of project construction. The rates should cover all costs of operations and
maintenance, the higher amount of debt service or depreciation, and adequate
working capital. In addition, they should provide for financing part of the
investments. The SBLA rate structure would consist of: (i) sewer rates levied
as percentage of the value assessments in the project and general benefit
areas; and (ii) sewerage surcharges on water charges, levied per cubic meter
of water consumed by customers connected to the sewerage system. The sewer
rates, which will be applicable starting in 1991, were approved by SBLA's
Board in April 1990. They have to be approved by the Council of Ministers and
the House of Representatives before they can be applied by SBIA. Agreement
has been reached during negotiations with the Government and SBLA that all
legal actions required to enable SBLA to apply these rates, including their
base value assessments (para. 6.04) will be completed before the loan can be
declared effective (para. 8.03-a).
6.03     The sewer rates which were approvad by SBLA Board for application in
1991, are as follows:
CC 2.30 (US$ 4.83) per C£ 1,000 of property value in the project
area; and
C£ 0.70 (US$ 1.47) per C£ 1,000 of property value in the general
benefit area.
The above rate structure is, however, based on non-discriminatory flat rates
applicable to property owners. SBLA intends to introduce an increased degree
of differentiation in the rates on the basis of possibly higher rates for



- 24 -
certain businesses such as hotels. SBLA will carry out a study on rate
differentiation with assistance from its twin institution (para. 4.15). The
sewerage surcharge on water consumption, which will be applicable in 1995,
when customers are first projected to be connected to the new system, is
currently estimated at about CC 0.17 (US$ 0.36) per cubic meter of consumed
water. Agreement was reached during negotiations that: (i) the SBLA rate
structure will be amended, as appropriate for meeting SBLA financial
objectives (para. 6.10), to include, by not later than one year before
customers are connected to the system, a sewerage surcharge on water
consumption of those customers, in addition to the sewer rates; (ii) SBLA will
submit this new rate structure as per (i) to the Bank by June 30, 1994 for
review; and (iii) SBIA will adopt this new structure by December 31, 1994, or
not later than six months before starting billing this surcharge to customers
(para. 8.02-c). The above rate structure is broadly similar to the rate
structure applied by the Nicosia Sewerage Board. It is appropriate for this
type of operation as provided for under the Sewerage and Drainage Act of 1971;
it is simple and straightforward in terms of public understanding and
administration, and for the purposes of future adjustments.
6.04     The value assessments of the properties located in the project and
general benefit areas were undertaken by LSD over a six year period (1980-86).
They are given in the equivalent of 1980 market value prices. Although the
sewer rates are established as a percentage of the assessed values of the
properties in 1980 prices, the use of this 1980 property value assessment may
not be legally enforceable until it is approved for this (and other purposes)
by the House of Representatives. A draft law to this end, approved by the CM,
is currently before the House; and indications are that it will be promulgated
by the time the rates are expected to be fully applicable by SBLA (para.
6.02). In case of an adverse ruling, the Government will seek a special
dispensation from the House to use the 1980 assessment for the purposes of
sewer rates, or the rates will have to be adjusted as percentuges of the
applicable value assessments.
C. Financing Plan
6.05     A detailed forecast of the SBLA sources and application of funds for
the period FY 1990 through FY 2000 is given in Annex 11. Summaries of the
financing plan for the project (1990-1998), and for the period through FY2000
are presented in Table 6.1
6.06     The project financing plan consists of about 31X from internally
generated funds, about 30X from the proposed Bank loan, with the remainder to
be financed by proceeds of a loan from the Resettlement (Social) Fund of the
Council of Europe (CERF). The Government confirmed during negotiations that
it has secured commitment for the CERF financing; and that SBLA will enter
into agreement with the CERF (with Government guarantee) as required for
financing the project.

D. Future Performance
6.07     SBIA's projected income statements, balance sheets and statements of
sources and applications of funds for the period 1991-2000, as well as the
underlying financial assumptions are given in Annexes 9, 10, 11 and 12
respectively. SBLA's annual self-financing ratio would average about 41X over
the projection period, but will increase substantially in 1999 and 2000 to 82%
and 69X respectively. Consequently SBLA would be able to finance its second



- 26 -
phase of investments (1999 and beyond) from its own resources without
incurring any new debt.
6.08     SBLA's financial performance during the period 1990 and 2000 and
beyond will be geared toward achieving a self-financing ratio, after debt
service and increase in working capital (other than cash), of at least 20X of
average annual investments (over three year intervals). To achieve these
targets, SBIA would require periodic adj-stments in its revenues from sewer
rates and sewer surcharges on water tariffs of about 13X on average over the
projection period. A first adjustment of about 581 would be required in 1993.
Another adjustment of about 501 (coupled with the levy of the sewer surcharge
on water tariffs starting in 1995) would be implemented in 1996 when the
project facilities are completed and SELA's first repayment installments for
financing the project will be due. Although the above increases are not
expected to affect the affordability (para. 7.07), the introduction of a
differentiated rate structure (para. 6.03) would facilitate the implementation
of new rates. By the end of the projection period, SBIA revenues from sewer
rates will constitute about 851 of its revenues, the remainder being provided
by the water surcharge. SBLA's operating ratio is expected to peak at about
37X in 1998; the unusually high margin of net income before interest is
justified by the high level of debt service (para. 6.09); it will also allow
SBLA to build additional cash reserves for financing subsequent investments.
6.09     The proposed financing plan, wherein 691 of the full construction
cost consists of borrowed funds, means a heavy debt load for SBLA. However,
its debt equity ratio (about 64:36 in 1995) would be reduced fairly rapidly as
SBIA builds up its equity, to reach about 32:68 in 2000). SBLA internal funds
would provide debt service coverage averaging about 1.6 beyond 1995.
Agre-ment was obtained at negotiations that SBLA would not, during the project
implementation period, contract any medium or long-term debt (other than for
financing obligations under this project), unless its net revenuesV for the
fiscal year immediately preceding the date of such incurrence or for a later
twelve-month period ended prior to such incurrence, whichever is the greater
amount, shall not be less than 1.3 times the maximum debt service requirements
for any succeeding fiscal year (para. 8.02-d). The preceding assurances,
together with the financial covenant proposed below in para. 6.10, should
ensure that SBLA would have sufficient funds to meet its annual investment
requirements.
6.10     During negotiations, agreement was obtained that, beginning in FY
1991, SBLA will implement rates and other charges to provide adequate funds to
cover: (a) all expenses of operations, maintenance, administration and other
taxes and contributions required by law, and depreciation; (b) all interest
and other charges on debt as well as principal repayments in excess of
depreciation; (c) increases required to maintain adequate levels of working
V the difference between (i) the sum of revenues from all sources related to
operations and net non-operating income and (ii) the sum of all expenses
related to operations, excluding provision for depreciation, other non-cash
operating charges and interest and other charges on debt.



- 27 -
capital (other than cash); and (d) at least 20% of each year's annual
investment determined as the average of investment over the subject year and
two subsequent years (para. 8.02-a). This financial discipline would be
monitored through annual reviews. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that SBIA will, six months before the beginning of each fiscal year,
provide the Bank with a copy of its proposed budget for such fiscal year and
financial projections for the following two years, as well as its plans for
proposed rates and charges for the Bank's review and comments (para. 8.02-e).
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISMS
A. Project Benefits
7.01     The Limassol-Amathus area is estimated to generate well over US$ 420
million per year in tourism revenues, i.e. over six times the total cost of
the project. Over 10% of employment in the area is in activities directly
related to tourism; i.e., in hotels, rental apartments, restaurants, etc.  It
is estimated that an additional 10-15% of the area's employees work in tourism
related activities such as taxi services, gift shops, and beverage production,
etc. Hence the proposed project, that will protect the tourism industry in
the Limassol-Amathus area, is of critical importance to its economy, as well
as to the economy of Cyprus.
7.02     The present system of sewage disposal using private septic tanks and
absorption pits for domestic sewage, and some biological treatment for tourist
hotels and industry, is inadequate. In densely developed areas, the situation
is particularly acute, as the present situation is close to a failure
situation. Also, the present methods and processes for treatment and disposal
of human, commercial and industrial wastes are costly, in terms of both the
frequent emptyings required and the limiting effect on future growth. Even
now, the present arrangement produces nuisance odors and constitutes a health
hazard. An outbreak of disease from sewage contaminated bathing waters would
have a disastrous effect on the tourist industry. The only permanent solution
to this problem is to install a central collection and sewage treatment
system.
7.03     There are some additional sewage pumping costs associated with
locating the treatment plant to the east of the project area, rather than on
the west side where it was not possible to obtain land (para. 3.11). However,
the economic consequences of not proceeding with a sewerage system that
efficiently removes sewage from the urban area and treats it, far outweigh the
additional costs in terms of health and potential loss of tourism revenues.
The treatment site selected represents the least cost location on the eastern
side consistent with environmental considerations, in that it is in an
industrial area, remote from residential and tourist areas, and is close to



- 28 -
the sea for safe disposal of the sewage treatment plant effluent during the
initial years of operation.
7.04     Benefits attributable to the proposed sewerage system are in five
principal areas: (i) savings in operational cost of the existing sewage
disposal arrangements, and in the cost of constructing and operating
additional individual waste disposal units in the future; (ii) increases in
property values due to the improved sewerage and drainage systems; (iii)
reduced risks to human health due to waste-water related diseases; (iv) an
improvement in air quality from the elimination of methane gas (one of the
major contributors to the "greenhouse" effect) and from the elimination of
odors from overflowing septic tanks and from the regular emptying process; and
(v) protection of the tourist industry in the greater Limassol area, a major
source of foreign exchange earnings and employment. Benefits from the
drainage works include reductions in productivity losses and damage to
property, including roads, due to flooding during the rainy season.
B. Economic Rate of Return
7.05     An economic rate of return was calculated only for the sewerage
system to be implemented under the project (about 85X of total project costs),
since it was not possible to obtain the data needed for an economic analysis
of the drainage system; i.e. on the value of lost production caused by the
intermittent flooding which impedes road transport for varying lengths of time
over the winter season, and on property and road damage. Although the
proposed project is essential to the continuation and expansion of tourism in
the area, it is not possible to attribute the tourism benefits directly to the
project, since there are additional constraints to tourism development (para.
2.04). The health and air quality benefits of the project, although
important, are also non-quantifiable.
7.06     Revenues attributable to the project were used as a proxy for
consumers' willingness to pay in quantifying the benefits for the estimated
rate of return for the proposed project. Cost streams include the costs
(including physical contingencies) of land, civil works and equipment, design
and supervision, and operation and maintenance, as well as the connection
costs to be incurred by private property owners. Only the costs and benefits
attributable to Phase I of the sewerage system were included (details of the
assumptions are given in Annex 13). Because of the exclusion of the
substantial unquantified benefits of property value increases and additional
tourist revenues, the resulting economic rate of return, 17.61 is considered
to be a very conservative estimate.
C. Affordability
7.07     The rates and charges envisioned for the project would not impose an
undue burden on the households at the lowest income levels in the Limassol-
Amathus area (details are provided in Annex 13). The lowest salaries, paid
for municipal grade A-1 employees and beach attendants at the area's tourist



- 29 -
hotels, average about CC 3,120 per annum in 1990. The average household has
1.5 salaries, or CC 4,664 per annum. Assuming that such a low income family
would reside in a small duplex house (rather than a 2-bedroom apartment which
has a much lower assessed value) and would use 1001/ liters of water per
capita per day, its average total bill for water, sewerage and drainage would
increase to about 2X of household income by 1994. Then the sewerage scheme
starts to come on stream in 1995, these costs are expected to increase
substantially but would still remain well below 41 of the estimated lowest
annual fam4ly income. This is considered to be within the affordable level.
Estimates also show that for a family with an average income, a property with
the highest assessed value, and daily per capita water consumption of 155
liters (present average domestic water consumption in the Phase I area), the
total charges in 1996 (the year charges account for the highest proportion of
income) would not exceed 41 of the faily's annual income. Moreover, the
project is also considered to be affordable if compared to currently incurred
costs. For the lowest income family, the annual sewerage charges in 1996
would be less than the cost of about 12 emptyings of the present septic
tank/absorption pit system. The Limassol authorities consider that this is
the minimum frequency required to maintain the system in working order, i.e.,
without overflowing.
D. Environmental Imnact
7.08     The project will have a major positive environmental impact in
removing polluting wastes from the urban area and treating and disposing of
them with minimum environmental degradation. The treatment plant is located
in an industrial area, remote from any tourist or residential development. It
will provide secondary treatment, as opposed to the primary treatment
(comprising grit, grease, and large solids removal) usually provided.
Furthermore, a preliminary environmental impact assessment of the sea outfall
location has been carried out, and the detailed design of the outfall will be
based on a rigorous environmental impact assessment study to ensure little or
no deleterious effect, and to identify any possible mitigating measures.
7.09     The studies associated with the project provide opportunities for
ensuring positive environmental effects on a wider scale. Sanitation
strategies will be defined to "get ahead' of the problems in rural areas and
prevent future environmental degradation. The studies of sewage effluent and
sludge re-use will define environmentally sound ways of disposing of otherwise
potentially harmful wastes in a manner which will have the largest net
positive effect (para. 4.16).
/ This is twice the minimum quantity of water considered necessary to meet
basic needs.



- 30 -
E. Risks and Safeguard&
7.10     Local opposition to the siting of the sewage treatment plant had been
the main factor in causing delays and ultimate cancellation of the previous
project. In order to reduce this risk under the project, extensive
preparatory work has been undertaken oy the Government and by SBLA: the
proposed plant and related facilities have been carefully sited in accordance
with environmental considerations, and high-level discussions held with
concerned leaders of the communities in the vicinity of proposed plant have
been effective. In addition to the acquisition procedures, which are at an
advanced stage, the proposed site has been requisitioned to assure access for
the purposes of construction. The risk associated with the treatment plant
site is therefore considered to be at an acceptable level (para. 4.17).
VIII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED A   REg0OENAI0,
8.01     During negotiations, it was confirmed that the Government of Cyprus
would carry out the study of the environmental impact of the sea outfall in
accordance with the timing necessitated by the project's implementation
schedule; i.e., by June 30, 1992 (para. 4.16).
8.02     The following agreements were confirmed with the Borrower during
negotiations:-
(a) Beginning in FY 1991, SBLA will implement rates and other charges
to provide adequate funds to cover: (i) all expenses of
operations, maintenance, administration and taxes and other
contributions required by law, and depreciation; (ii) all interest
and other charges on debt as well as principal repayments in
excess of depreciation; (iii) all increases required to maintain
adquate levels of working capital; and (iv) at least 20% of each
year's annual investment determined as the average of investment
over the subject year and two subsequent years (para 6.10).
(b) By December 30, 1990, SBLA will enter into arrangements with the
Government, that are satisfactory to the Bank, for consolidating
outstanding loans, including repayments and accrued interest
through 1990, and for their repayment (para. 6.01).
(c) The rate structure will be amended as appropriate for meeting SBLA
financial objectives, but not later than one year before customers
are connected to the system, and this structure will include (in
addition to the sewer rates) a surcharge to be applied against
water consumption by those customers. SBLA will submit this new
rate structure for Bank review by June 30, 1994, and will adopt
this structure by December 31, 1994. SBLA will complete the
necessary arrangements for billing the water surcharge through LWB



- 31 -
as soon as feasible, but by not later than December 31, 1993
(paras. 5.09, 6.03).
(d)   SBLA will not, during the prnject implementation period, contract
any medium or long-term debt (other than for carrying out the
project), unless its net revenues for the fiscal year immediately
preceding the date of such incurrence or for a later twelve-month
period ended prior to such incurrence, whichever is the greater,
shall not be less than 1.3 times the maximum debt service
requirements for any succeeding fiscal year (para. 6.09).
(e)   SBLA will, six months before the beginning of each fiscal year,
provide the Bank with a copy of its proposed budget for such
fiscal year and financial projections for the following two years,
as well as its plans for proposed rates and charges for the Bank's
review and comments (para. 6.10).
(f)   SBLA's financial statements will be audited by an independent
auditor satisfactory to the Bank, beginning with fiscal year 1991,
and such statements and the audit report, including the audits of
the Statement of Expenditures and the Special Account, will be
submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each
fiscal year (para. 5.07).
(g)   SBLA will carry out the updating of the Master Plan for Drainage
for Limassol by June 30, 1991 (para. 4.12).
(h)   In order to make full economic use of the investment included in
the project, SBLA will continue to expand its operations in
accordance with a plan acceptable to the Guarantor and the Bank
(para. 4.22).
8.03     Conditions for Effectiveness:  The following have been set as
conditions for effectiveness of the proposed loan:-
(a)   The Government of Cyprus will have approved the SBLAts sewer rates
(paras. 6.02).
(b)   SBLA will have in place satisfactory arrangements and procedures
for billing and collecting its revenues from sewer charges (para.
5.09).
8.04     Agreement having been reached on all other issues referred to in
Chapters III through VII of this report, the proposed project is suitable for
a Bank loan of US$25 million to the Sewerage Board of Limassol-Amathus,
guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus, with final maturity of 15 years,
including a 5 year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
LIMNASSOL-AMATHUS SEWERAGE MAD DRAINAGE PROJECT
Twinning Arrangement for the Sewerage Board of Limassol-Amathus
Outline Terms of Reference
I. The Twinning Arran_ement
1.     To assist in its growth and development, the Sewerage Board of
Limassol-Amathus (SBLA) is interested in entering into a twinning arrangement
with a successful sewerage utility.  SBIA understands a twinning arrangement
to be a professional relationship with a similar but more mature organization
in another part of the country or overseas. Through the twinning arrangement,
services would be provided to the SBLA by the twin utility (hereinafter called
the supplier). The SBLA is interested in having such services provided by a
utility in order to benefit from that utility's successful operating
experience; to be able to integrate technical assistance services with
training for its staff; and to benefit from the flexibility possible under a
twinning arrangement to alter the work programme over time as the needs of
SBLA change.
2.     Two Phases.  The twinning arrangement will be carried out in two
phases. In the initial phase, a team from the twin and local specialists, to
be proposed by the supplier, will study existing institutional arrangements
and make recommendations: (i) to assist SBIA in its organizational
development; and (ii) to identify the type and amount of assistance that SBLA
will require from the supplier utility and/or other sources (such as the
Nicosia Sewerage Board) to implement the plan outlined in (i).
3.     The second phase of the twinning arrangement will be the implementation
of the assistance identified during the first phase. It is envisaged that the
services for each phase of the work would be contracted separatez.y, with the
contract for the second phase contingent upon satlsfactory completion of the
first phase. A more detailed description of the work to be done during the
first phase is provided in section II below.



- 33 -
Annex 1
Page 2 of 4
II.  First Phase: Planning of SBLA's Development and Twinning Arrangements
4.     As indicated in paragraph 2, the outputs of the first phase would be a
development plan for SBLA and terms of reference for technical assistance and
training inputs to be provided during the second phase.
5.    Work to be Carried Out During the First Phase is likely to include the
following:
(a)   Review of legal documentation, as necessary, including relevant
statutes creating SBLA, by-laws of other Cypriot utilities, etc.,
to obtain understanding of the legal framework under which the
SBIA operates, its policy environment, etc.; and to establish the
legal framework for the twinning arrangement (prior to entering
into the agreement with the twin) and any possible privatization
of any of SBIA's functions.
(b)   Review of all relevant background documents describing the history
of SBLA, the project, etc.;
(c)   Review of systems for billing/collectio.i/accounting procedures at
SBLA;
(d)   Preparation of outline terms of reference for a study of the
potential for increased differentiatior, within the agreed sewer
rate structure. The study will be carried out under Phase II of
the twinning arrangement, as will the implementation of the
differentiated rates, subject to the approval of the Bank, and to
the financial covenants of the Loan Agreement.
(e)   Identification of other procedures/systems which need to be
developed.
(f)   Identification of staffing requirements by specialty (accounting,
engineering, etc.), number, and time of hiring (in relationship to
anticipated schedule for implementation and commissioning of
physical works, etc., and consistent with agreements reached
during loan negotiations.
(g)   Recommendations for an appropriate organizational structure.
(h)   Identification of other necessary steps which need to be taken by
SBIA (such as preparation of job descriptions, definition of
levels of authority for staff, etc.), when such steps need to be
taken, who should have responsibility for carrying out such steps,
etc.

Annex 1
Page 3 of 4
6.     Staff and Time Required to Carry Out the First Ehase.
(all inputs to be in Cyprus)
Lawyer - 1-2 weeks inputv
Engineer - 4 weeks input
Accountant/Financial Analyst - 4 weeks input
Organization development/management specialist - 5-7 weeks total
input (as team leader: one week prior to start of other team
members, during stay of team, and depending on progress, possibly
an additional two weeks after other team members have completed
their assignments to prepare draft final report and present it to
SBLA. Possibly an additional one week by team leader and one or
two other team members, as required, to answer follow up questions
from SBLA and finalize the report and recommendations).
Total for first phase: 12-15 staff weeks
7.     Detailed job descriptions and qualifications for members of the team to
be provided in an annex to the terms of reference (TOR). Team members should
represent a mix of experience within an operating utility and management
consulting (the latter of which to ensure knowledge and previous experience in
organizational desigr and growth).
8.     OutDut of the First Phase.  This phase should result in a report having
two parts: (i) a developmental plan for how the organization will grow over
time; and (ii) terms of reference for the assistance and training to be
provided through the twinning arrangement during the second phase.
9.     The following points should be kept in mind while carrying out the
study and preparing the report:
- SBIA is interested in developing into a small, efficient utility, so
recommendations should be based on the most cost effective way for it to
carry out its functions
- To the extent possible, SBLA is interested in obtaining assistance
during both phases from Cypriot sources, in association with the
overseas utility. Therefore, a careful assessment should be made of
assistance which could be provided locally. Special attention should
focus on systems which can be modelled on those of Nicosia Sewerage
Board, Limassol Water Board, and Limassol municipality, and on the staff
and time inputs which would be required from them to assist SELA.
V a lawyer may not be required on the team if the input is obtained through
use of SBLA counsel.



- 35 -
Annex 1
Page 4 of 4
- It is expected that the assistance to be provided from the overseas
twin during the second phase will consist largely of assistance which is
not available locally (such as attachment of SBIA staff to sewage
treatment plants for short term training).
- It is further expected tr.at the assistance requirements from overseas
will be minimal, so that the contractual relationship during the second
phase could be in the form of a letter of agreement which provides for a
minimum level of assistance to be guaranteed each year for, say, a four
to five year period, with specific inputs to be identified on a yearly
basis and the possibility of additional assistance to be provided as
identified in yearly reviews.
III. Second Phase: Implementation of the Twinning Arrangement
10.     Inputs required during this phase need to be timed in accordance  with
the progress of physical works, initiation of billing, hiring of staff, etc.
It is expected that the majority of assistance provided during this phase will
coincide with the implementation and subsequent operation of the project
works.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
LIMASSOL-AMATHUS SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Environmental Impiact Assessment of Sea Outfall
Terms of Reference
1.     The effluent from the Limassol-Amathus sewage treatment plant is a
valuable resource, and it is the intention of all parties involved in the
project (the Ministry of Interior, the Departments of Fisheries and Water
Development in the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and the
Sewerage Board of Limassol-Amathus) that the effluent should be reused on land
and not discharged to sea. The ultimate purpose of the outfall is to act as a
disposal route only in an emergency when reuse cannot be practiced. It is
probable, however, that only a part of the effluent flow will be reused
initially, and that for some years, a portion of the effluent will pass
continuously to the outfall.
2.     The Department of Fisheries has provided some data on salinity,
temperature, density and dissolved oxygen of coastal waters in the vicinity of
the outfall, as well as a depth profile. On the basis of this information,
and some data from the Electricity Authority of Cyprus on the nature of the
sea bed near to the proposed outfall route, the indicated design of the
proposed outfall incorporates the following elements:-
Disinfected secondary effluent;
Outfall of 900 mm dia. of total length 2,100 m
(1,500 m land, 600 m sea section);
including a diffuser having 47 ports of 150mm dia., of total
length of 190 meters;
Estimated cost: C£1,332,000.
3.     In order to safeguard the marine environment, thorough surveys of
hydrographic and environmental parameters are to be carried out and serve as a
basis for design of the outfall. The nature and content of such surveys have
been discussed and agreed with the Department of Fisheries, and are summarized
in tabular form (pp. 3-7 of this Annex) as follows:-
Sheet 1:  Hydrographic
Sheet 2:  Physical/Chemical
Sheet 3:  Geophysical
Sheet 4:  Bacteriological
Sheet 5:  Biological.
4.     The findings of the surveys in para. 3 will be used in conjunction with
a computerized mathematical model to determine the impact of the wastewater
discharges on water quality for recreational purnses, as well as on marine
life.

5.     The design of the outfall and diffuser to be determined on the basis of
the results of this analysis will ensure satisfactory wastewater effluent
standards.
6.     The estimated cost of the surveys include:-
Cost (US S)
-    Approx. 4.5 person months, (including accommodation        58,500
and local transport)
-    Visits to Cyprus (12)                                      12,000
-    Geophysical surveys                                       136,500
-     Supplementary equipment purchase                          42.000
Total                                         249,000
7.     The cost in person months above is for foreign specialists only.  The
estimates assume that all work, other than geophysical, will be carried out by
the Department of Fisheries, which has vessels and crews, and possesses (or
has access to) much of the necessary equipment.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
LIMASSOL-AMATHUS SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Effluent and Sludge Re-Use Studies
Outline Terms of Reference
1.     The following outline terms of reference refer to a study of the re-use
of sewage effluent in the Limassol-Amathus area, but are to be taken also
(with appropriate modifications) to refer to a study of the re-use of sewage
sludge. 
2.     The study is being carried out in response to the concern of the
Government of Cyprus that the country's scarce water resources should be
optimally utilized. The study is based on the following premises which
reflect the understanding of all parties concerned:
Mi)      as much of the treatment plant effluent as possible should be
reused in order to conserve water of primary quality for
potable use;
(ii)     only that part of the effluent which cannot be reused should be
discharged to sea through an outfall;
(iii)    a study of re-use options should be made culminating in the
completion of demonstration facilities from the outset of
operation of the sewage treatment plant; and
(iv)     the objective of the demonstration facilities is to encourage
public acceptance of re-use such that within five years, (or as
early as feasible), all effluent would be reused, and discharge
to sea would occur only in emergencies.
g This study, and the study of rural sanitation (Annex 2.C), fall within the
scope of studies included under the Southern Conveyor Project, Phase II
(SCPII), and will therefore be financed under that loan (Ln. 2914-CY).
Supervision of the studies will be carried out jointly with Bank staff
responsible for SCPII.

Anx2. B

3.     The study would be carried out primarily within the Water Development
Department (WDD) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources,W with
consultants to assist as required.
ScoRe of Work
4.     The study would be carried out in two phases, the first being a
primarily theoretical exercise to quantify the flow of effluent that can be
expected from the treatment plant, to identify the most promising uses of such
effluent and their associated treatment and infrastructure needs, and to
design the appropriate pilot/demonstration projects for Phase II.
5.     Phase 1:  In the first phase, the following steps would be undertaken:
i)      Define all reasonable potential uses for effluent, and identify
the potential end-users (i.e., farmers, park and hotel
landscapers, etc.) and other concerned parties (i.e.,
ministries and other public and professional agencies
interested in regulating and monitoring re-use, and its
effects)
(ii)    Consult with the above to identify their requirements,
perceptions and concerns, and assess the effluent quality
requirements of the potential end-users.
(iii)   Design appropriate public relations activities to encourage the
acceptance of effluent re-use by potential users and the
public. (This information activity should be reviewed at
various stages, revised and repeated as necessary).
(iv)    Estimate the annual quantities of effluent that will be
available from the Limassol-Amathus sewage treatment plant,
taking into account such factors as the construction
implementation schedule (particularly of the house
connections), infiltration into the sewers, and seasonal
variation.
(v)     Carry out preliminary market research for those uses which
result in a marketable product, including an investigation of
v A Project Policy and Coordination Committee (PPCC) was set up in 1984,
under the chairmanship of the Director General of MANR. Its other members are
the Directors General of the Ministries of Finance, Interior, And Commerce and
Industry, and the Planning Bureau. The Director of WDD acts as Secretary.
Appropriate changes for the purposes of these studies will be agreed during
negotiations.

the comparative advantage afforded to Cyprus in the production
of new crops by the availability of the effluent as a
consistent and reliable source of water.
(vi)    Complete any remaining review of the literature still required
(see work carried out by I. Papadopoulos of WDD for FAO, etc.)
(vii)   Assess these identified re-uses with respect to:
- identifying areas where each re-use is practicable;
-  quality and quantity requirements;
-  benefits and disadvantages arising out of re-use;
-  potential hazards, their effects on use, and consequent
precautions/safeguards; and
-   infrastructure requirements.
(viii)  Identify which potential uses would benefit from pilot scale
testing, and in what manner; and eliminate those which are no
longer practical or promising.
(ix)    For the remaining uses, assess:
-  what further treatment of the effluent, if any, would need
to be practiced beyond the discharge quality set for the
sewage treatment works;
-   specific potential users of the effluent (i.e., individual
farmers or groups of farmers);
-   infrastructure required (i.e., storage ponds, networks,
pumps, etc.);
-  eventual pilot treatment plant requirements; and
-   relative environmental impacts.
(x)     Determine the size of treatment plant, infrastructure, and
pilot demonstration facilities needed, and estimate both
capital and operational costs, in order to carry out cost-
benefit analyses to assign relative priorities for effluent re-
use.
(xi)    Determine the responsibilities and institutional requirements
for managing the provision of quantity and quality of effluent,
and monitoring the effectiveness of the provision.
(xii)   Prepare guidelines for cost recovery from the various end-
users. This will require a study of current irrigation pricing
policies and the issues involved in pricing effluent for this
purpose. This economic work should be coordinated with ongoing
work on irrigation water pricing (para. 2.03) being carried out
under SCPII (Ln. 2914-CY). Issues to be considered in the



- 46 -
Annex 2.B
Page 4 of 6
study should include, but not necessarily be limited to:-
-     the incremental cost of effluent treatment costs
necessary for reuse;
-     appropriate pricing for effluent, taking into account
costs, scarcity/resource depletion considerations,
seasonal availability, and potential benefits to
users;
-     the rationale and need for subsidization of the price
of treated effluent, taking into account current
pricing practices and future price revisions, for
fresh water vis a vis costs; and
based on the above, the minimum subsidy (if any)
required to encourage the use of effluent, and
scenarios for phasing out of subsidies over time.
(xiii) Design the pilot/demonstration schemes, for implementation
under Phase II.
6.     phase II:  Under the second phase, pilot/demonstration schemes
considered feasible by the Interministerial Monitoring Committee, would be
implemented, subject to Bank approval. During this phase of the study, the
end-users should take on as much of the implementation responsibility as
feasible. Monitoring of the schemes, including testing of soil and effluent
quality, end-product quality and acceptability, would be carried out
throughout this phase.
Resources
8.     The resources required for phase I of the study have been tentatively
estimated as follows:
8 weeks from an independent study adviser (internationally
recruited)
170 weeks from specialists (Cypriot, and internationally
recruited).
Requirements for Phase II of the study in terms of plant/equipment and human
resources, will be estimated during Phase I. An activity chart and a proposed
organization structure for implementing the study are outlined on the next two
pages.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
LIMASSOL-AMATHUS SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Rural Sanitation Study
Outline Terms of Reference
I. Need for the Study
1.    About 200,000 people (37% of the population of Cyprus) live in rural
areas. Villages vary in size but a large percentage of this population reside
in villages that are in the range of 500 to 1000 people. Almost all the
villages have access to piped water supply services. Only the very small and
remote villages are self-served.
2.     Improvements in standards of living in the rural areas have led to
accelerating water demand and the consequent need to dispose of increasing
quantities of water-borne sewage. Few, if any, villages have a sewerage
system comprising sewers and sewage treatment plant. Older houses have simple
pit latrines but as new houses are built, or plumbing installed in older
houses, septic tanks are now common. Both the pit latrines and septic tanks
cause problems. Pit latrines are health risks and sources of odor and fly
nuisance. Septic tanks cause problems because the soil in many parts of
Cyprus is not suitable for the percolation fields required for the septic
tanks to work efficiently; and also access for tankers to empty many of the
tanks is difficult and expensive. Consequently many of the villagers have
requested the Government to provide a piped sewerage system.
3.     Increasing quantities of solid waste is causing problems, particularly
with safe disposal, in many villages. Problems are particularly acute in
villages that are subject to rapid growth, principally those on the outskirts
of urban areas, as traditional methods of disposal such as burying pits, are
now becoming overloaded.
4.     The Government realizes that action needs to be taken in the near
future to stop the degradation of the environment in the villages due to
inadequate liquid and solid wastes disposal. The responsible ministry (the
Ministry of the Interior) wishes to proceed with a program to improve
sanitation in villages but is concerned that any such program should proceed
on a sound basis.

Annex 2.C
Page 2 of 2
II. ScoDe of Study
5.     There is a need to carry out a study that will identify a strategy for
the provision of adequate sanitation in villages. Specifically the strategy
would be based on:
(a)      a review of the need for adequate sanitation through visits to
representative villages;
(b)      evaluation of alternative sewerage systems and sewage treatment
processes, and solid waste collection and disposal systems;
(c)      preparation of cost estimate curves of sanitation processes and
systems for vaizous sizes of villages;
(d)      a financial analysis, and to the extent possible, an economic
evaluation, of the provision of adequate sanitation; and
(e)      an evaluation of household incomes in the rural areas and
analyses of affordability and willingness to pay for adequate
sanitation; and
(f)      a review of the appropriate role of government and the
beneficiaries to finance the sanitation works proposed.
III. Staff and Time Required for the Study
5.     A firm of consultants with considerable experience in the design of
rural infrastructure will be recruited by the Ministry of the Interior to
carry out the study. It is expected that a total input of about 5 to 6 months
of time of three specialists will be required, plus support staff, comprising
team leader - a rural sanitation specialist (12 weeks); a social scientist (6
weeks); and an economist (3 weeks).
IV.  Output
6.     The study would be carried out in two parts and will take just over 3
months in total. All three specialists will be involved in the first part, to
be implemented over a period of about 10 weeks. Close to the start of the
study, the team leader and the social scientist will visit a representative
number of villages over a three to four week period. At the end of the first
part of the study, a draft report will be prepared and submittul to the
Ministry of Interior and other government agencies concerned with the rural
sector, for review and comments. The second part of the study will involve
the review (time for tne review about 4 weeks), and the team leader's two week
involvement in discussions with the reviewers and finalizing the report.

LIMASSOL-AMATHUS SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Master Plan of Drainage for the
Greater Limassol Area
Outline Terms of Reference
I. Need for the Plan
1.    The Sewerage Board of Limassol-Amathus (SBLA) is responsible for
sewerage and drainage for an area of 4220 ha in the greater area comprising
the municipalities of Limassol, Ayios Athanasios, Mesayitonia, Kato
Polemidhia, and Yermasoyia and the Improvement Board of Amathus.
2.     In 1974, consultants prepared a master plan for drainage for an area
comprising 3270 ha of the Limassol municipality. While a 1989/90 review by
consultants of the 1974 study has concluded that high priority drainage works
recommended in this study remain valid, there is a need to update and expand
the 1974 master plan to include: (i) the whole of the SBIA area; (ii)
subsequent development that differs from that existing in 1974 (a major
difference is the west-east bypass, constructed in the mid 1980s, that has
affected drainage patterns in the area); (iii) most recent development plans;
and (iv) advances in the design of drainage systems since 1974.
II. Scope of Study
3.    The 1974 report is comprehensive but the basic data used in the report
need to be reviewed and updated, as necessary, and expanded for the whole of
the SBIA area. This will include:
(a)     rainfall;
(b)     existing urban development, and development such as the east-
west by-pass road, that affect drainage patterns;
(c)     existing drainage and drainage works under construction;
(d)     proposed urban development; and
(e)     recent computer-aided designs for drainage.

III. Staff and Time Reguired for the Studo_
4.     A firm of consultants with considerable experience in the design of
urban drainage systems will be recruited by SBLA to update and expand the 1974
study. It is expected that a total input of about 6 to 7 months of time of
four specialists will be required, plus support staff, comprising:
team leader
(a specialist in preparation of drainage            (12 weeks);
system master plan)
an assistant engineer                               (7 weeks);
town planner                                        (3 weeks)
drainage system computer design-specialist          (3 weeks).
IV. Qutputs
5.     The study would be carried out in two parts.  All four specialists will
be involved in the first part, that will be implemented over a period of 12
weeks. At the end of the period, a draft report will be prepared and
submitted to SBLA and government agencies for review and comment. Following
this review (time for the review about 4 weeks) the team leader will have
discussions with the reviewers and finalize the report over a 2 week period.
V It appears that recent topographic maps, with contour lines, of a
sufficiently large scale to carry out the study, are available for the whole
area. In preparing their proposals, the firms of consultants will be required
to review the available information.

LIMASSOL-AKATHUS SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Project Cost Estimates
1.     Summary cost estimates by expenditure category, year, and financing
source are in Tables A3.1 through A3.4. Detailed estimates are included in
the Project File. All of the estimates were prepared using January 1990
prices, and the base estimates are presented in these prices.
2.     Cost estimates for the sewerage and drainage civil works are based on
recent civil works contracts in the Limassol-Amathus area. For the equipment
and materials, costs are based on recent budget quotations obtained from
suppliers in Europe.
3.     The cost of consultants for construction supervision, technical
assistance, and studies are based on person months estimates and on rates
charged by foreign and local consultants in Cyprus.
4.     Physical contingencies are 10, except for land acquisition and for the
sea section of the outfall, where 0 and 20X contingencies, respectively, have
been used. Import duties are not included, since SBLA is exempt.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
LIMASSOL-AMATHUS SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Sewerage Board of Limassol-Amathus (SBLA)
Assumptions for Financial Projections
I. Inflation Rates
1.     All financial statement projections are in current Cypriot pounds.  The
same rates of local inflation, as used for the capital investments costs (SAR,
para. 4.18), have also been used in estimating operating expenses over the
projection period.
II. Income statements
2.     The sewer rates and water surcharges are based on revenue requirements
as per the SBLA financial objectives (SAR, para. 6.10). Sewer rates for the
period 1991-2000, together with the water surcharge starting in 1995 were
devised to cover operating costs, excluding depreciation, debt service,
appropriate increases in working capital (other than cash) and to yield at
least 20X of the cost of investment during the projection period (calculated
for each year as the annual average of that year and the two subsequent
years). The rates used for 1991 are those approved by SBLA Board for
application in January 1991. Subsequent rate adjustments were made to meet
the SBLA requirements of financial objectives.
3.    The properties assessed values for the project and general benefit areas
were developed by the Land and Survey Department of Limassol District. They
are in 1980 prices. A nominal increase of 2X per year for new construction is
projected starting 1992. The properties in the general benefit area, as per
the planned investments through 1998, are assumed to be included in the
project area as from 1999 when the new investments for that area would be
started. The volume of water consumed in 1996 and beyond was estimated on the
basis of planned sewerage connections to the system.

Annex 12

4.     Operating expenses were projected as follows:
(i)   Salaries and wages are based on the number of staff needed for the
project implementation, administrative functions and operation of
the SBLA. The number of staff was developed from similar types
of operations such as the Nicosia sewerage system; salaries were
based on current levels, including allowances, as adjusted for
statutory grade progress plus increase for cost of living
adjustment;
(ii)  Energy costs consists of electric power and fuel consumption at
the project facilities at current energy prices;
(iii) Chemical and maintenance costs were developed from engineering
experience on similar types of projects at current prices;
(iv)  Administrative and other expenses include normal office expenses,
miscellaneous and cost of billing and collection of SBLA revenues,
including collection fee for services by the Water Board starting
in 1995;
(v)   Depreciation expenses were calculated on a straight line basis,
and according to the following rates:
Civil works and pipes                     2.5X
Mechanical and electrical equipment       5.0X
The average annual depreciation rate is   3.25X
III. Balance Sheet and Sources and Anplication of Funds
5.     SBIA balance sheet for 1990 includes the estimated cost of deferred
expenses which were incurred for project preparation, and outstanding advance
loans from the Government (para. 11 below).
6.     Investments include the project costs which were then incorporated in
SBLA fixed assets in the year in which they were commissioned. Investments in
1999 and 2000 comprise those for Phase II of the project. Interest payments
during construction were capitalized in accordance with local practice;
thereafter they were charged to operating results.
7.    Accounts receivable consist of an estimated 251 of revenues for the
first four years of projection (through 1994). During this period SBLA is
expected to experience some difficulties in the billing and collection of its
revenues. The receivable balances should improve gradually thereafter to be
at a level of about 151 of revenues through the year 2000.

8.     Inventories represent an estimated two months of maintenance costs.
9.     Accounts payable were assumed to be equivalent to one month of
investment costs plus two months of cash operating cost.
10.     Long term loans include, in addition to the Bank loan, a loan from the
Council of Europe Resettlement (Social) Fund (10 years final maturity
including 5 years of grace, at interest rate of 9% per annum).
11.     Government advances to SBLA for project preparation since its
inception in 1983 are assumed to be consolidated (including repayments and
apitalized interest through December 1990) as of January 1, 1991 as follows:
(i)   Ministry of finance: C£ 1,084,000 to be paid over 20 years final
maturity including 5 years of grace beginning in 1991, at interest
of 62 per annum;
(ii) Central Bank Loan: C£ 329,000 to be paid over 15 years final

LIMASSOL-AMATHUS SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Economic and Affordability Analyses
Economic Rate of Return
1.     In estimating the economic rate of return (ERR) for the sewerage system
to be implemented under the proposed project, revenues attributable to the
project (Phase I of the sewerage system) were used as a measure of benefits.
Cost streams include the costs (including physical contingencies) of land,
civil works and equipment, design and supervision, and operation and
maintenance, as well as the connection costs to be incurred by private
property owners.
2.    Only the costs attributable to Phase I of the sewerage system are
included; the cost of the main collector and main sewers, which are sized to
handle Phase II flows, have therefore been adjusted.
3.    The costs and benefit streams are shown in Table 1 on page 2 of this
annex, together with the estimated economic rate of return (17.6X). Also
shown on the table are the results of tests of sensitivity of the ERR to a 1-
year delay in benefits (e.g. delays in completing the house connections), and
to a 10 increase in costs. Detailed information on the assumptions
underlying the calculations, and the estimated streams are in the project
files (Annex 14).
4.     The rate of return is relatively sensitive to the speed at which
properties are connected to the system; a one-year's delay reduces the ERR to
14.8X. The 17.62 rate of return assumes that 7,000 properties will be
connected by the year 2000. This is a conservative assumption; i.e., the
total 9000 connections required for the Phase I properties will be included in
the two contracts for laterals and main sewers (Annex 6) and the works under
those contracts will be completed by mid 1996. It is also sensitive to cost
increases: a 102 increase in total costs reduces the ERR by close to 202 (to
14.11). However, even under the assumption of both a one-year delay in
connections and a 102 increase in costs, the rate of return is still
satisfactory, at close to 121.

Affordability Analysis
5.     A summary analysis of affordability for low-income households is shown
in Table 2 on page 4 of this annex, and is based on the following assumptions.
It considers an average household comprising 3.4 persons earning 1.5 salaries
annually. The lowest income level corresponds to the salary earned by a grade
A-1 municipal employee, which, in 1990 is about C£ 3,120 annually. This is
also comparable to the earnings of a beach attendant in one of the area's
tourist hotels, and would result in an annual income in 1990 of about C£
4,664. Incomes are assumed to grow at a modest 4X per year, the rate of
estimated inflation. The property value used is the assessment (in 1980
market prices) of a 2-bedroom duplex house on 1/2-plot of land outside the
tourist area.
6.     Based on these assumptions, and including a realistic estimate of
current water consumption charges, the project would be affordable. In 1996,
when the sewerage scheme comes on stream, total charges reach their highest
level -- 3.6X of total income.
7.     Using the same assumptions, but lowering the property value to
correspond to that of a 2-bedroom apartment outside the tourist area, with an
assessed value of CE13,000 (in 1980 market prices), the maximum percentage of
total income attributable to water, sewerage and drainage charges would drop
to 2.41 in 1996. The same analysis was performed taking into account average
income levels, maximum property assessments, and an average per capita water
consumption of 155 liters per day. In this case the maximum charges remained
within the affordable level at 4X of total income.
8.     Further details of this analysis are available in the project files.
