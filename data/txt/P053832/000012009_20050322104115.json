Institutional\n            lessons suggest that financial incentives, and heavy\n            reliance on effectiveness, and disbursement conditions,\n            require the support of an overriding framework of\n            macroeconomic, or sectoral reforms, i.e., broader framework\n            for reform of the agricultural, financial, or rural finance\n            sectors, to mobilize the support needed to implement\n            ambitious reform programs, and, in addition, the existing\n            capacity of the implementing agency should be taken into\n            consideration early on. Projects designed as a banking\n            reform project, should be implemented as such, and not as\n            rural credit or rural development project, with the\n            appropriate resources and skills mix made available as\n            required. Operational lessons reinforce that lack of\n            commitment to aspects of projects, should be clearly and\n            timely reported by task teams, supervision efforts need to\n            re-build project understanding and commitment, and the task\n            team should timely, and proactively assess needed corrective\n            measures. Supervision efforts should complete project\n            preparation, as necessary, before embarking on\n            implementation. Moreover, involvement of second tier\n            officials in project preparation should protect project\n            ownership, and implementation from staff turnover risks,\n            while clear project legal documents, and its consistency\n            with the appraisal, would help maintain implementation\n            momentum, should a high turnover of leadership occur."}, "docdt": "2005-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
