medium-term process of legal, institutional, and structural\n            development that promotes growth and improves social\n            conditions. There are four project components. The first\n            component supports the maintenance of the macroeconomic\n            framework which has underpinned Turkey's recovery after\n            the 2001 crisis as well as the ongoing sustained episode of\n            rapid economic growth that began in 2002 and continues to\n            date. The second component focuses on improving the quality\n            of fiscal adjustment by addressing the growing deficits in\n            the social security system through (a) parametric reforms of\n            pensions and (b) structural improvements in the\n            institutional and administrative framework for the provision\n            of social security benefits and social assistance. This\n            component also supports universal access to health services\n            while deploying actions to increase the efficiency and\n            contain the cost of health services funded by the state.\n            The third component supports continued implementation and\n            broadening of the structural and institutional reforms of\n            the public financial management and budget systems that the\n            World Bank began supporting under the Programmatic Financial\n            and Public Sector Adjustment Loan series of loans. The\n            fourth component supports improving the administration and\n            governance of the public sector through actions required to\n            reduce regional disparities, promote decentralization, and\n            combat corruption at all levels of the public sector."}, "docdt": "2006-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
