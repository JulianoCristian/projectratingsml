Among the lessons learned are the following:\n            (1) Participation of the four utilities and municipalities\n            during the project implementation was key to design and\n            execute the project investments in response to the local\n            needs.  2) The frequent changes of the ministers in Ministry\n            of Territorial Adjustment and Tourism (MOTAT) is becoming a\n            chronic problem with continuous negative impact on\n            maintaining continuity and commitment.  (3) Benchmarking\n            developed as a pilot in this project was an innovative idea\n            implemented for the first time in Albania's water\n            sector, which allowed the local authorities and the project\n            team to measure the project progress and impact on the\n            ground.  (4) Working in good partnership with the government\n            on this investment project has created a positive\n            environment between the Government and the Bank, which\n            helped address institutional issues at the sector and\n            utility level during implementation of the Water Supply\n            Urgent Rehabilitation Project (WSURP) and preparation of the\n            Municipal Water and Wastewater Project (MWWP), such as:\n            transformation of utilities into commercial entities,\n            merging sewerage with water management, increasing water\n            tariffs, and introducing for the first time the sewerage\n            tariffs, which positively affected the increase of the\n            billed revenues of four utilities, and the preparation for\n            the upcoming management contract with a private operator."}, "docdt": "2004-08-24T00:00:00Z"}
