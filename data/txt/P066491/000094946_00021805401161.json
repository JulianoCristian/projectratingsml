services of four municipalities.\n            The Water Supply Rehabilitation Project is regarded as a\n            forerunner of the Municipal water and Wastewater Project\n            currently under preparation. The latter project will\n            introduce private sector participation into Albania's\n            water sector in the form of a management/lease contract. The\n            Water Supply Urgent Rehabilitation Project bridges the gap\n            between the present situation and the Municipal Water and\n            Wastewater Project by taking over the private operator in\n            one or two years. The project rehabilitates components of\n            the water supply systems which are prone to failure and/or\n            which are causing extremely high operation costs or health\n            risk due to their state of disrepair. There are twelve\n            project components. The first three build new wells and\n            valve chambers, improve the pumping station and the pressure\n            break tank, and conduct a feasibility study in rural areas\n            of Durres. Components 4 and 5 upgrade well fields and\n            distribution mains for Fier. Components 6 and 7 replace\n            distribution mains, wells, and pumping stations for Lezhe.\n            Component 8 replaces gravity transmission mains and feeder\n            mains to Saranda. Component 9 repairs water leaks for all\n            cities. Component 10 procures consultant services. Component\n            11 provides a consultant to all cities to enhance network\n            analysis and operation."}, "docdt": "2000-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
