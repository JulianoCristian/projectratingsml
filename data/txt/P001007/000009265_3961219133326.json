and Infrastructure Relief\n            (SIRP) Project in Guinera-Bissau was satisfactory. There is,\n            nonetheless, a continuing need for assistance in the\n            development of more detailed procedures and in fully\n            implementing the introduction of the accounting system. The\n            development of training facilities has for the various\n            reasons been subject to major delay largely due to disputes\n            arising between the various entities whom it was proposed\n            should be responsible for operation and provision of the\n            facilities. The in appraisal of this first lending operation\n            in Nepal, was over optimistic in the targets set for project\n            execution. Nonetheless, this has probably provided some spur\n            to speedier execution than might have otherwise have been\n            the case. In retrospect, the selection of rehabilitation\n            works, and their cost evaluation must be carefully done\n            during appraisal; the substitution of the works later should\n            be avoided. Only guaranteed donors' support, based on\n            firm commitments, should be counted on in the project's\n            financing plan before a project is presented for Board\n            approval. The project coordination unit should have full\n            authority and responsibility and the various ministries\n            involved in the project should have high-level\n            representatives in the unit to solve implementation problems\n            and speed up information exchange. A more appropriate\n            lending instrument for SIRP would have been a program loan,\n            with its built-in flexibility but with specific criteria for\n            project selection."}, "docdt": "1996-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
