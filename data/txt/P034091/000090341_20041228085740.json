The\n            lessons learned indicate that support of an already ongoing\n            reform process facilitates implementation, provides\n            legitimacy and increases commitment to project development\n            objectives. Only following several years of hard work and\n            trial and error was Comision Nacional de Evolucion y\n            Acreditacion Universitaria (CONEAU) established as an\n            integral part of Argentina's higher education system.\n            Lack of clarification of roles and responsibilities during\n            project preparation for collecting baseline and performance\n            data makes it difficult to sustain momentum for maintaining\n            indicators. Even limited investment, distributed based on\n            transparent and objective procedures selection, can go a\n            long way in stimulating a culture of change and quality\n            improvement. As illustrated by the Asignacion de Recursos\n            (AR) funding formula, linking components to increases in\n            public subsidies makes implementation highly vulnerable to\n            external shocks. The implementation of subprojects under the\n            competitive fund went into implementation delays because\n            there was no control over counterpart funding at the project level."}, "docdt": "2004-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
