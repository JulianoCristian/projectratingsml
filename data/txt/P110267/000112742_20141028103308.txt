1. Introduction
Access to safe and reliable drinking water supply is still very erratic in rural Kyrgyzstan, and it
necessitates urgent improvements. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has identified
reliable and well-functioning basic infrastructure services as a priority for sustainable national
development. The Government and Parliament have focused on the rural water and sanitation
sector and sought World Bank and other donor’s support for investment in the sector.
A first investment (Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project ) was approved by the World
Bank in 2002 and closed in 2008, and a second investment, which would build on the first Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSP), was approved in April 2009. When the Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Project (2002-2008) closed, it was assessed to have improved
access to drinking water for 350 thousands residents of rural areas of the three Northern regions
of Issyk Kul, Naryn and Talas. In May 2009 the representatives of the Kyrgyz Republic and of
the International Association for Development (IDA) signed an agreement for financing of «the
Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project» (RWSSP-2) (the Grant № Н462-KG, the
Credit № 4560 KG), to rehabilitate water schemes in the same regions. The RWSSP-2
implementation period is from 2009 to 2013. The RWSSP-2 aims to:
        •   Improve the access to drinking water for participating communities;
        •   Improve sanitary and hygiene practices in rural areas at the individual, household and
            institutional levels.
The project consists of four components:
Component A: Water Supply Infrastructure and Equipment
Component B: Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Program
Component C: Institutional Development
Component D: Project Management


Component A. Water Supply Infrastructure and Equipment
This component provides finances to local communities to rehabilitate or expand the existing
rural water supply systems. This component will also finance (a) refurbishment or construction
of demonstration sanitation facilities in schools and medical posts and (b) equipment for
maintaining the water supply systems, (c) development of detailed design documents and
exercise of technical supervision over implementation of subprojects.
The following subprojects will be implemented under the RWSSP-2:
   i.       3 subprojects for rehabilitation of RWSSP-1 outputs ( in Korumdu, Termir-Kashat and
            Chelpek villages);
  ii.       Rectification (limited repair works) of 26 subprojects of RWSSP-1;
 iii.       Implementation of 6 new subprojects in 6 villages: Tugol Say (Naryn Oblast), Uch –
            Emchek (Talas Oblast), Jele-Dobo, Ak Kochkor, Koochy and Baltabay (Yssyk Kul
            Oblast).
 iv.        Construction and demonstration of sustainable sanitation and hygiene facilities in
            medical institutions and schools in selected villages covered by RWSSP-1 and RWSSP-2
            (budget approximates to USD 0.33 million).


Component B: Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Program


                                                                                                 3
This component focuses on improving the living standards, the environment and the public
health through arrangement of safe and reliable water supply and sanitation systems in the
village by rendering technical assistance, including construction of sanitary facilities
(rehabilitation of demo sanitary facilities in schools and medical institutions is included in the
component A as part of works for creation of infrastructure) and delivery of trainings on
sanitation and hygiene for the population.
The component provides for promoting sanitation and hygiene education among the population
through organizations of Initiative Groups consisting of members of Rural Health Committees
(RHC), representatives of schools and village activities and conducting trainings with their
involvement among the population using an interactive facilitation method engaging the
community “Joint Change of Hygiene and Sanitation”.


Component C: Institutional Development
This Project component finances consulting services meant to assist the Government to ensure
sustainability of water supply programs in rural areas, including support in (a) approving and
implementation of the Sector Strategy developed under the previous project; (b) development or
revision of the legislation to ensure collaborative work between the CDWUUs and local self-
governments, including development and institutionalization of new agreements between the
Aiyl Okmotu and CDWUUs; (c) training and assistance for CDWUUs to build on the experience
and tools developed under RWSSP, including ensuring that gender, voice, and choice in
participatory processes are taken into account; (d) strengthen the project Management
Information System by adding a GIS interface and consolidating a country-wide database on
village-level water supply and sanitation.

Component D: Project Management
The component finances the following: limited equipment and vehicles, operating costs (staff
salaries, in-country travel, and mandatory employer contributions to the Social Fund of the
Kyrgyz Republic) and training associated with project implementation; monitoring and
evaluation activities, including regular impact surveys/assessments and annual audits.


2. Project description
The Subproject “Rehabilitation of Rural Water Supply System in Baltabai Village” aims to
improve the access to drinking water for residents of Baltabai village, located in Yrdyk Aiyl
Okrug, Jeti-Oguz Raion, Yssyk-Kul Oblast. The population of the village numbers 1,006
persons, with the number of households amounting to 204.
Following the tender for implementation of this subproject, a Contract № IDA-RWSSP- CW-
2011-7 was awarded to the JSC “Yugstroiservice”. The Contract amount is KGS 20 805
733,67. Implementation of the Project is scheduled for the period from December 29, 2011 to
January 08, 2013.
As of the date of Resettlement Action Plan development, civil works for rehabilitation of the
water supply system of Baltabai village were already ongoing under the subproject (see general
plan of the Subproject in Annex 1).


Major Project Activities:
The Subproject includes works for (i) construction of a new water intake in eastern part of the
village by drilling a new well and construction of a water tower, V=50m3; (ii) construction of a
                                                                                               4
new water main with total length of 2613m; (iii) rehabilitation of the existing distribution
networks to the total length of 4690m.
(i) When implementing works for construction of a new water intake and water tower, no
private property will be affected and no impact on villagers is recorded, as the construction of
reservoirs will be completed on municipal land, which is not used by private persons for any
activity.
(ii) When implementing works for construction of the new water main and distribution networks
economic activity of the villagers will be impacted as the routes of these pipelines pass along
household plots planted with trees (willow and poplar).
(iii) When implementing works for rehabilitation of existing mains and distribution networks
economic activity of the villagers will be impacted as the routes of these mains and distribution
networks pass along household plots planted with trees (apple, willow and poplar).


1. № 1 str. (projected water main) – 10 PAPs;
2. № 2 str. (projected water main) – 11 PAPs;
3. Alkym str. (existing water main) – 15 PAPs;
4. Konutar str. (existing water main) – 5 PAPs.


3. Involuntary Resettlement under the Subproject
This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared based on the Resettlement Policy
Framework developed under the RWSSP-2, consistent with the World Bank Policy on
Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12.


During implementation of the Subproject for Rehabilitation of Rural Water Supply System in
Baltabai village, the project affected land parcels are located within the village. The impact will

4. Legal Framework

4.1 The World Bank Policy on Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12
The RWSSP-2 triggered the World Bank Operational Policy 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement as
some works may require temporary or permanent land acquisition. Project activities include
construction of rural water supply facilities, including laying of pipes to delivery water to public
standpipes or individual connections. The routes of pipelines may pass across fields, therefore
temporary land acquisition will be required with subsequent rehabilitation it to the initial state.
Pumping stations are usually installed on state owned land, however, in some cases, if no such
land is available or usable, construction of a water intake with a pumping station may require
permanent acquisition of public land.

Development of relevant impact mitigation measures and compensation for impact of land
acquisition triggered by the Project activities will be carried out in line with the Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) developed specifically for RWSSP-2.

The RPF identifies the possible impacts from project activities, describes the range of potential
impacts (temporary and permanent) to land use/access and structures, and specifies the
compensation and resettlement assistance/procedures for the same. Where there is a gap between
national and World Bank procedures, the latter will prevail for all activities financed under this
project.

The RPF is intended as a practical tool to guide the preparation of Resettlement Action Plans
(RAPs) for each subproject associated with resettlement impacts based on the guidelines and
procedures highlighted in the RPF document.

The basic objectives of the RPF are to: (i) guide ARIS, national and local self government in
properly identifying, compensating, and restoring the livelihoods of Project Affected Persons
(PAPs), (ii) serve as a binding document to ensure payment of compensation and assistance to
PAPs, and (iii) provide direction in preparing, updating, implementing and monitoring of
subproject RAPs.

The RPF includes measures to ensure that PAPs are (i) informed about their options and rights
pertaining to resettlement; (ii) consulted on, offered choices among, and provided with
technically and economically feasible resettlement alternatives; and (iii) provided prompt and
                                                                                             6
effective compensation at full replacement cost for losses of assets attributable directly to the
Project.

The RPF is based on the following principles:

         •   Involuntary resettlement is to be avoided or at least minimized;
         •   PAPs are to be suitably assisted in their efforts to improve, or at least restore, incomes
             and living standards;
         •   PAPs are fully informed and consulted on compensation options;
         •   Lack of formal legal land title is not a barrier to compensation or alternative forms of e
             rehabilitation assistance;
         •   Particular attention is paid to socially vulnerable groups, such as ethnic minorities,
             female headed households, elderly households, etc...and appropriate assistance is
             provided to help them adapt to project-related changes;
         •   Land acquisition and resettlement is conceived and executed as a part of the project,
             and the full costs of compensation are included in project costs and benefits;
         •   Compensation/rehabilitation assistance will be paid prior to ground levelling,
             demolition, and in any case, before an impact occurs;
         •   Compensation is to be paid at full replacement cost to PAPs, without deductions for
             depreciation or any other purpose.

It should be noted that according to World Bank's Policy OP 4.12, the term resettlement
encompasses more than the 'physical relocation or resettlement' of affected people. It is defined
as the social and economic impacts of a project that are permanent or temporary and are caused
by the involuntary taking of land resulting in (i) relocation or loss of shelter; (ii) loss of assets or
access to assets; (iii) loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the affected
persons must move to another location; or (iv) the involuntary restriction of access to legally
designated parks and protected areas resulting in adverse impacts on the livelihoods of the
displaced persons.

4.2. Relevant legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic

The Kyrgyz Republic's Land Code (1999) regulates all matters of land ownership. It provides for
ten cases where a private owner relinquishes rights to land (Article 62), which in turn can be
split into four categories.

First, there are voluntary transfers by owners such as sales and gifts. Second, there are transfers
dictated by change in status of the owner such as, death, revocation of Kyrgyz citizenship for
individual owners or reaching below a 80% threshold of Kyrgyz owners of legal entities owning
the land parcel (foreign ownership of land is not allowed in Kyrgyzstan), invalidation of a prior
transfer of land rights which led to the current ownership of the land, or the declaration through
court decision of land to be 'without owner' and hence reverting to the State (i.e. abandonment
by the owner). Non-Kyrgyz owners are given a one year grace period to sell land to Kyrgyz
nationals or Kyrgyz-owned legal entities. Third, land may be taken in order to cover the owner's
financial liabilities, though this requires a court decision. The fourth and final method is
expropriation by the state which may occur on the basis of one of seven possible grounds noted
in Article 66 in the Land Code:

    1. Use of land not according to its targeted purpose
    2. Land needed for state or public purposes (similar to the principle of eminent domain)
    3. Non-use of land provided for agricultural use for three years
    4. Non-use of land provided for non-agricultural productive purposes for a period of time
       stipulated in the original provision
    5. Non-payment of land taxes

                                                                                                       7
    6. Non-payment of social taxes
    7. Annulment of license for mining on the basis of Kyrgyzstan's mining law.

Decisions of court are required to effect expropriation for grounds 1 through 4 listed above.

Voluntary transfers and expropriation for state or public purposes are the methods that are
relevant to situations arising from sub-projects supported via ARIS, since the other types of
expropriation are based on problems of the land-owner which have no relations to any ARIS
sub-project. In practice, when there is need to utilize land that is privately owned for a sub-
project benefiting the community, ARIS should at all times seek to implement such sub-projects
on Government land or land owned by the village but which is not being used by any group.
When this is not possible and private land is used, or some persons suffer any restrictions in
access or resources, then appropriate compensation as per this RPF will be given.

Expropriation as per Kyrgyz legislation is very difficult and not practiced. Seeking involuntary
resettlement through expropriation for state or public purposes under Kyrgyz law is not
practical. Article 68 of the Land Code outlines the procedure for expropriation of land. The
procedures call for a voluntary agreement between the public entity and the private owner of
land whereby the former pays the later financial compensation for the land, which may include
the provision of another land parcel. In the event that there is no agreement, the state must go to
court to force the owner to provide the desired land parcel. The private owner must be fully
compensated for the market value of all of the financial interests in the given land parcel.

This procedure has never been carried out, and practitioners note that implementing legislation
is needed to clarify procedural issues such as appraisal of land values, compensation,
demonstration of public/state needs, and other matters. There has been a lack of public
investment into infrastructure in settled areas that would have require the exercise of eminent
domain in post-independence Kyrgyzstan. It would seem to be likely that there have been small
cases where de facto land was taken, but these did not occur in accordance with the Land
Code's provision. There are not many recorded cases of private citizens challenging in court a
taking of land from them (except for enterprise land sales, discussed below). It should further
be noted that only an 'authorized entity' can initiate expropriation, which means either a state or
municipal entity or an entity specially designated by the state. A Community Driven Water
User Union would not be such an entity.

 The major distinctions between the existing legislation in Kyrgyzstan and OP 4.12 is the fact that
 Kyrgyz law does not make any provisions to assist or compensate illegal users of publicly owned
 land who may be required to move in order for a sub-project to be realized. Furthermore, it does
 not take into consideration the possibility that leaseholders working on publicly owned land
 may have made investments in that land which will also require compensation.

                                          livelihood (e.g. access to schools).


In principle, the Land Code of the Kyrgyz Republic and the World Bank Policy both adhere to the
objective of compensation at replacement cost, but Kyrgyz legislation does not provide for
                                                                                               9
rehabilitation and in practice this has been left to ad hoc arrangements taken by project
proponents in order to meet international donor requirements.

To clarify these issues and reconcile eventual gaps between Kyrgyz legislation and World Bank
Policy, this RPF has been drafted for the Project, ensuring compensation at replacement cost of
all items, the rehabilitation of non-titled people and informal settlers, and the provision of
subsidies or allowances for PAPs that may be relocated, suffer business losses, or may be
severely affected.
The main provisions affording reconciliation of the differences between Land Code and World
Bank Policy include:
          • Any PAPs, regardless of title or not, will be entitled to compensation (for
               structures, crops and trees) and rehabilitation measures under the project. This
               includes land-less people using land and squatters;
          • PAPs and affected communities will be consulted on options and any impacts of
               land acquisition and resettlement;
          • If land for land compensation is not technically or sociably feasible, compensation
               will be in cash at full replacement cost at current market value;
          • Compensation for any other assets affected (structures, crops and trees, as well as
               business/income loss) will be in cash or kind at full replacement cost at current
               market value. Vulnerable and poor PAPs will be entitled to additional measures as
               relevant, and gender issues will be addressed;
          • Maintenance works will avoid or minimize, as far as possible, the need for land
               acquisition and resettlement; and
          • Compensation for temporary loss of land or assets or for temporary disruption of
               income will be provided.

 It must be especially noted that under the WB OP 4.12, status of those without legal title is
 clearly defined. In accordance with this policy, those people who do not possess official legal
 title or judicial rights for the land use, but still use the state land are entitled to receive
 compensation, taking into account the investments they made into the state land, their
 labour and lost assets, but not for land ownership as in the case of a titled owner. Instead,
 alternative sites are allocated for their use, or other forms of assistance in lieu of land
 compensation, are provided to those informally using or occupying land to the project cut-
 off date.

 In case of disparity of the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic with the requirements of the policy of
 the WB on involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12), the principles and procedures of OP 4.12 should
 be applied.


5. Eligibility
According to the WB involuntary resettlement policy OP 4.12, the following individuals are
entitled to compensation:
 (a) Those who have formal rights to land including customary/communal land, traditional
 and religious rights recognized under Kyrgyz Republic Law.
 (b) Those who do not have formal legal rights to land at the time the project or census
 commences but have a claim to such land or assets provided that such claims are
 recognized under the laws of Kyrgyz Republic or become recognized through a process
 identified in the RPF/ RAP.

                                                                                             10
  (c) Those having no recognizable legal right or claim to the land they are occupying, using or
 getting their livelihood from before the cut-off date, but are recognized under World Bank
 OP 4.12.

Those covered under a) and b) above are to be provided compensation for land they lose, and
other assistance in accordance with the policy. Persons covered under c) above are to be provided
with resettlement assistance in lieu of compensation for the land they occupy or use, and other
assistance, as necessary, to achieve the objectives set out in this policy, if they occupy or use the
project area prior to a cut-off date established by the Project in close consultation with potential
PAP, local community leaders and relevant local government bodies, and are acceptable to the
Bank.

Persons who encroach on the area after the cut-off date are not entitled to compensation or any
other form of resettlement assistance.

All persons included in a), b) or c) above are to be provided with compensation for loss of assets
other than land.

Therefore, it is clear that all affected persons irrespective of their status or whether they have
formal titles, legal rights or not, are they squatters or not, or encroached land otherwise, all of them
are eligible for some kind of assistance if they occupied the land before the entitlement cut-off
date

Eligibility for assistance under World Bank OP 4.12 also applies for project affected persons
even if it is deemed that Kyrgyz legal provisions provide for temporary or permanent acquisition
of private land immediately adjacent to existing public roads without compensation.
Compensation eligibility will be limited by a cut-off date to be set for each subproject and
PAPs who settle in the affected areas after the cut-off date will not be eligible for compensation.
The entitlement cut-off date refers to the time when the census of affected persons and their
property in the area is carried out. Persons who encroach the area after the cut-off date are not
eligible for compensation or any form of resettlement assistance. PAPs, whose right for land
ownership and use prior to the cut-off can be demonstrated, remain entitled to assistance whether
they were registered in census or not.
The cut-off date under the SP “Rehabilitation of rural water supply system in Baltabai village” is
July 19, 2012 when the general meeting of the village was held. At this meeting, ARIS
Safeguards Specialist specified measures and procedures of RPF and explained principles RAP
preparation. The Census Commission was established at this meeting. Bekboev K. (Chairperson
of CDWUU) was designated as an Authorized Project Representative (APP); and the beginning
of census was announced (see Minutes of the Meeting, Annex 2)
The Matrix below demonstrates eligibility for compensation and/or assistance in elimination of
adverse consequences/losses for various types of assets and RAP categories under the Project.

In accordance with RPF, Entitlement Matrix: Eligible PAPs, Assets and
Compensation Guidelines, looks as follows:

7.    Compensation for trees


Compensation for apple trees, poplar (construction material) and willow (firewood) is calculated
for 5 years, because time needed to grow again is 5 year.



Compensation for apple trees is calculated by the following formula:
                   I=A *U*H*P + (A*Z)
Where:
     I – Compensation amount for apple trees
     A – total number of apple trees
     U – average crop yield per one tree kg/ year
     H – time needed to grow a new apple tree
     P – cost for 1 kg of apples in KGS

                                                                                             16

8. Grievance Redress Procedures

In the course of preparation and implementation of RAP some grievance and grievances may
occur towards the process of resettlement, compensation amount, assistance and further
activities. Therefore, the following grievance redress mechanism has been prepared:


RAPs will be informed about their rights and procedures during meetings and consultations.
They will also receive a copy of RAP providing detailed description of the procedures for
handling grievances.
                                                                                       20
Process of grievance redress:
   1. First step. Verbal contact with an authorized project representative. The authorized
      representative under this project will be K.Bekboev, the Chairperson of CDWUU (tel. 0
      (556) 02 56 55). Verbal grievance should be registered in the Grievance Log. Each
      grievance should be assigned with an individual identification number. Progress of
      grievance redress should be reflected in the Log; and all the registered activities should
      be completed. The Grievance Log should also name the individuals responsible for
      redressing of each individual grievance/grievance. The ones should register the dates of
      the following events:
              •   date the complaint was reported
              •   date the Grievance Log was uploaded onto the project database;
              •   date information on proposed corrective action sent to complainant (if
                  appropriate);
              •   the date the complaint was closed out; and
              •   the date response was sent to complainant.

      If a grievance is not redressed within 5 days, the grievance should be considered at the
      further level. Grievance redress or its transfer to the further level should be registered in
      the Log.

   2. Second step. If a grieved person doesn’t receive a grievance redress within 5 days, the
      grievance should be filed in writing to the ARIS, addressing Ibraimova Elmira
      Sultanovna, the Executive Director of the ARIS at the address given below. The
      grievance letter should be signed and dated by the grieved person.
