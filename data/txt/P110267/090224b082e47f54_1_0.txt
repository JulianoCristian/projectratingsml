1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country and Sector Background. The Kyrgyz Republic is a mountainous landlocked
country in Central Asia, bordering Kazakhstan, China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. At appraisal in
2009, the country had a population of about 5.2 million, about two thirds of whom were living in
rural areas. Almost 40 percent of the population lived below the poverty line, and rural areas were
home to about three quarters of the country’s poor, many of whom live in remote and mountainous
areas. More than half of the population works in agriculture, and the sector is still the backbone of
the economy. With a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of US$600 in 2007 and US$1,080
in 2014, the country was and remains one of the poorest in the Europe and Central Asia region.

2.      Prior to independence from the Former Soviet Union (FSU), potable water was supplied
free of charge nationwide, and systems were designed to very conservative technical standards in
line with FSU engineering standards. Following independence however, the Kyrgyz Republic
faced the reality of economic constraints linked to the break-up of the Soviet economic zone and
the end of centralized subsidies from Moscow. While the country eventually registered a gradual
economic recovery due to the adoption of market-based reforms in the 1990s, sectors such as
infrastructure and social services continued to suffer from low investment and basic public services
such as water supply and sanitation suffered particular degradation.

3.      The reduction in Government subsidies to the sector resulted in a steep decline in the
quality of water supply and sanitation services, contributing to an increase in the non-income
dimensions of poverty. Access to adequate service coverage was low, with only about one third of
the national population having household water connections, another 40 percent receiving water
from stand-posts or water tankers, and the rest having no organized water service. The situation
was exacerbated by factors such as: (a) the poor physical state of plant and pipe networks, which
were in dire need of rehabilitation and replacement; (b) inefficiencies in operations, which drove
up operating costs; (c) weak institutions; (d) limited human resource capacity; (e) critical financial
shortfalls which precluded operating enterprises to cover even basic operating and maintenance
costs; and (f) and affordability constraints. Declining health indicators were linked to the
deteriorating water supply systems, and service reliability and safety had become a critical source
of discontent among the population. Problems associated with the sub-optimal water supply and
sanitation situation were particularly pronounced in rural areas.

4.      According to a Sector Review conducted by the World Bank in 1999, an estimated US$
180 - 200 million would be needed for the rehabilitation of existing facilities and system
expansions for new consumers to provide all of the Kyrgyz people with modest, but safe water
supply and sanitation services. Yet the financial situation in the country and affordability limits on tariffs
made it impossible to raise the financial resources needed in the near term. As part of efforts to fight
poverty and improve the standard of living and the health of its people, the Kyrgyz Government
identified improvement in basic infrastructure services, including water supply and sanitation as
one of its priorities, and approached the World Bank and other development partners, including



                                                      1
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and British Department for International Development
(DFID) to support the sector.

5.      The First Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSP). In 2001 the World
Bank approved an IDA Credit in the amount of SDR 12 million (US$15 million equivalent) for a
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSP) to support the Government’s efforts to
improve access to water supply and sanitation services and reduce poverty. The RWSSP, which
became effective in April 2002, was the first Bank operation in the Kyrgyz Republic and in the
ECA Region to apply a participatory community managed approach to rural water supply and
sanitation. The project’s development objectives were two-fold: (i) to improve access to potable
water from water supply systems which the communities own, operate, maintain and manage in a
sustainable manner; and (ii) to improve hygiene, sanitation, and water related practices at
individual, family and institutional levels in rural areas. DFID provided TA to finance the
components on Institutional Strengthening and Project Management in the amount of GB £ 4.5
million. The standalone Sanitation and Hygiene Project was also financed through a grant of
GB£ 3.3 million from DFID. The project focused on the three northern Kyrgyz Oblasts of Naryn,
Talas, and Issyk Kul. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) concurrently extended a Credit to the
GoKR for a Community Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project (CBISSP) in the amount of
SDR 27.30 million (US$ 36 million equivalent). The latter was implemented in parallel to RWSSP
as part of the “Taza Suu” (Clean Water) governmental program, and focused on the southern
Kyrgyz Oblasts of Chui, Jalalabad, Osh, and Batken. The ADB project closed in January 2010 and
was rated Partly Successful.

6.      The RWSSP closed in 2009. According to its Implementation Completion Report (ICR),
the project provided improved access to clean drinking water to about 340,500 people in 169
villages in the three northern oblasts. It was also instrumental in improving water quality and
hygiene in the beneficiary areas, contributing to a six-fold decrease in the reported incidence of
stomach pain and diarrhea in children. It facilitated the creation of a community-based model for
water service delivery and improved the effectiveness of institutions in managing rural water
supplies. Despite these achievements, the RWSSP experienced some problems. The project ran
out of resources before completion of all envisaged activities due to increased unit costs, and
construction works in three problem sub-projects 4 (Korumdu, Temir, and Chelpek) had to be
suspended before completion. The costs of works on the sub-projects increased mainly due to
technical factors such as unexpected ground conditions (in Korumdu) and failure of the surface
water sources (in Temir and Chelpek). Completion of these outstanding works was included in
design of the follow-on project, the Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSP2).
Another problem which emerged towards the end of the project was that, despite their efficiency,
the design standards and technical innovations introduced by the PMC (for instance the HDPE
pipe relining technology) became the subject of controversy in that they deviated from the State
Technical Engineering Standards (SNIPs) inherited from the Former Soviet Union. Although not
always technically well-informed, the controversy was amplified among certain stakeholders,
fueling criticisms of the quality of RWSSP works as well as opposition to the PMC-led
implementation arrangements. Such controversy became a serious legacy issue and reputational

    Individual sub-projects typically encompassed clusters of several villages.

risk to be dealt with under RWSSP-2. A lasting unfavorable impact on the sector was the
entrenchment of stakeholder reticence to use international consultant expertise for engineering-
design needs, or to engage in a critical review and revision process of unsustainable design
standards.

7.      Rationale for Bank Assistance for the Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Project (RWSSP2). The RWSSP2 was identified at the back end of RWSSP implementation. It
was designed as a “Repeater Project”5 with similar objectives, to scale up the latter’s development
outcomes in rural communities in the Talas, Naryn, and Issyk Kul Oblasts. A repeater project was
considered to be the most appropriate approach for two main reasons: (i) to build on the successes
of RWSSP while allowing for the introduction of important modifications to improve project
design; and (ii) to allow for quick preparation of the follow-on operation using existing resources.
The project was also seen as an opportunity to complete construction and/or rectification of
outstanding works on the problem sub-projects initiated under RWSSP. It was included in the
Bank’s Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS) Report No. 39719-KG dated May 23, 2007. The
total project cost was estimated at US$18.37 million: US$10 million equivalent was to be financed
by IDA (as a blend of an IDA Credit in the amount of SDR 3.8 million/US$ 5.5 million equivalent
and a US$4.5 million IDA grant); GBP5 million (about US$7.15 million equivalent) co-financing
was to be provided by DFID; US$1.55 million equivalent was to be provided by Government of
Kyrgyz Republic (GoKR), and US$0.49 million equivalent by participating communities as
contribution (5 percent) to civil works. The project was approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors
on April 29, 2009, and it became effective on August 19 the same year.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.     The original PDO of RWSSP2 was to assist the Kyrgyz Republic in: (i) improving access
to potable water for the participating communities; and (ii) improving hygiene, sanitation
and water-related practices at individual, family and institutional levels in the rural areas.

9.     Project outcomes were expected to be improved access, quantity, and quality of water
supply services available to rural citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic. In particular, project
performance was to be assessed against the following indicators 6: (a) the increase in number of
residents benefiting from regular availability of safe potable water; and (b) a decline in waterborne
diseases in project communities.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.     The development objective of RWSSP2 was revised in November 2012 to add a third
objective, (iii) below, focusing on the need for strengthening sector institutions. Accordingly, the


5
  According to Bank guidance documents, “Repeater Projects” are defined as projects whose basic design and
effectiveness have been proven, and which a Borrower proposes to augment and scale up.
6
  While this indicator was identified in the main text of the PAD as a key performance indicator, it was not included
in the original Results Framework. For purposes of analysis of the PDO however, it is taken into consideration.


                                                          3
revised PDO was to assist the Kyrgyz Republic in: (i) improving access to potable water for the
participating communities; (ii) improving hygiene, sanitation and water-related practices at
individual, family and institutional levels in the rural areas; and (iii) strengthening the
institutional framework and capacity for the rural drinking water supply and sanitation
sector.

11.     The institutional dimension of the PDO was introduced in an effort to address the
weakening institutional framework and capacity in the sector. Performance in respect to the third
objective was to be measured through two indicators: (i) the level of operation and maintenance
(O&M) cost recovery in utilities targeted by the project (%); and (ii) the number of CDWUUs with
sufficient revenues (from fees collection and other sources) to cover at least O&M.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     The primary beneficiaries for the water supply component were the population in
participating communities in rural villages in the northern Kyrgyz Oblasts of Naryn, Talas, and
Issyk Kul, who would directly benefit from improved access to potable water supply through the
project. According to the PAD, the project initially targeted about 100,0007 people in the three
Oblasts. However, the targeted number of beneficiaries was scaled down substantially to 60,000
when the project was restructured in November 2012, reflecting a significant reduction in DFID
co-financing. Likewise, primary beneficiaries for the sanitation and hygiene improvements
included the populations at targeted institutions such as schools where new sanitation facilities
were to be constructed, medical centers and members of the communities in the three Oblasts who
were expected to benefit from hygiene and behavior change interventions. Access to improved
water supply, sanitation and hygiene were expected to bestow multiple benefits such as improved
health, economic, and environmental outcomes.

13.     Primary beneficiaries for the institutional strengthening activities were national, local
government, and community level institutions, including: the Department of Rural Water Supply
(DRWS) within the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Processing (MAWRPI), and the
Sanitary Epidemiological Surveillance (SES) units located within the Ministry of Health8 at the
central government level; the local self-government units (Ayil Okmotus) in the participating areas
of Naryn, Talas, and Issyk Kul Oblasts; and the Community Drinking Water User Unions
(CDWUUs) at the community level, who were to directly benefit from capacity building activities
such as training and knowledge sharing, provision of equipment and facilities, introduction of
management systems for activities such as monitoring, billing and collection systems for water
operations, and other resources financed through the project, resulting in enhanced efficiency and
effectiveness in management of rural water and sanitation services.




7
    This number was used as the target in the Economic Analysis conducted at appraisal.

8
 The DRWS was later renamed the Department for Drinking Water and Sanitation and was located under the State
Agency for Architecture, Construction and Communal Services – SAACCS, also known as GOSSTROY.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.     Component A: Water Supply Infrastructure and Equipment (estimated US$ 15.25
million). This component was to provide financing to local communities represented by CDWUUs
to rehabilitate or expand existing village water supply systems. As part of the civil works contracts,
this component was to also finance the following: refurbishment or construction of demonstration
sanitation facilities at schools and medical posts; equipment supplied to selected CDWUUs and/or
their associations to maintain the water systems; and consultancy services for technical supervision
of construction activities to ensure the quality of infrastructure financed by the project.

15.     Component B: Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Program (estimated cost US$0.68
million). This component was to support village-level promotion of healthy hygiene and sanitation
practices through technical assistance. Component activities were to be coordinated with the
Republican Centre for Health Promotion (RCHP) that is working under the Health and Social
Protection Sector-Wide Approach project (SWAP; P084977) to foster health awareness
throughout the country. (The refurbishment of demonstration sanitation facilities at schools and
medical posts was included in Component A as part of the infrastructure works). Component B
was to be implemented through consulting services (to be provided by a national NGO or firm)
and in direct coordination with the RCHP.

16.     Component C: Institutional Development (estimated cost US$0.49 million). This
component was to finance consultancy services to assist Government to ensure sustainability of
the rural water supply programs, including support to: (a) endorse and implement the sector
strategy prepared under the earlier project; (b) develop or revise legislation to ensure synergies
among CDWUUs and local self-governance, including develop and institutionalize new
agreements between Ayil Okmotu and CDWUUs; (c) train and assist CDWUUs and DRWS to
build on the experience and tools developed by RWSSP, including ensuring that gender, voice,
and choice in participatory processes are taken into account; and (d) strengthen the project
Management Information System by adding a GIS interface and consolidating a country-wide
database on village-level water supply and sanitation. Detailed Terms of Reference for Component
C were to be developed during project implementation.

17.     Component D: Project Management (estimated cost US$1.95 million). The component
was to finance project management costs including: limited equipment and vehicles, operating
costs (staff salaries, in-country travel, and mandatory employer contributions to the Social Fund
of the Kyrgyz Republic) and training associated with project implementation; as well as
monitoring and evaluation activities, including regular impact surveys/assessments and annual
audits.

18.     Retroactive Financing (US$0.80 million). The Bank agreed to finance under Component
A, retroactive costs for the completion of approximately 16 sub-projects financed by Government
under the previous project, the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSP), subject to
submission of supporting documentation acceptable to the Bank.




                                                  5
19.     Project Preparation Advance (PPA), US$0.l5 million. A PPA for Components A and D
was provided to carry out preparatory activities including community mobilization campaigns and
feasibility studies.

1.6 Revised Components

20.     Several changes were made to individual components and activities as part of the Level 1
project restructuring in November 2012. Reasons for the restructuring are discussed in more detail
under Section 1.7 below. The following changes were made to individual components as part of
the restructuring.

21.       Under Component A. Water Supply Infrastructure and Equipment
         The estimated number of rural water supply schemes that the project would rehabilitate
          was reduced from 70 to 35.
         Two sub-components were merged: i.e., tasks under the detailed design (A3) and the
          Technical Supervision (A4) were merged into one sub-component (A3) to streamline
          budget use by ARIS.
         Contractor payment procedures were streamlined to allow payment directly by ARIS, as
          opposed to by individual CDWUUs; and
         The provision to extend sub-loans to CDWUUs was eliminated as it had been made
          redundant by the above streamlined payment procedures. Therefore the provisions in the
          Financing and the Project Agreements referring to Sub-Loans and Sub-Grants were
          dropped.

22.     Under Component B. Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Program. (This component
was fully financed by DFID and executed by UNICEF, which was contracted by ARIS). Changes
involved:
     Introduction of communication campaigns and advocacy activities to promote rural
        sanitation.
     Introduction of village level WASH campaigns for hygiene and sanitation awareness.
     Building institutional capacity for ARIS in the field of sanitation and hygiene.
.
23.     Under Component C. Institutional Development. This component was strengthened by
allocating an additional US$150,000 to maximize the impact on improving the institutional
framework and capacity for the RWSS sector in light of the scaled down infrastructure component.

24.     Component D. Project Management. The funding for this component was reduced and
reallocation in disbursement categories made accordingly in light of substantial savings in project
management due to the entity utilizing already existing resources (staff and equipment).

1.7 Other significant changes

25.     Project Restructuring. The project underwent three restructurings over the course of
implementation, resulting in several significant changes. These restructurings became necessary
to address several challenges the project faced, and were driven mainly by: (i) the need to
strengthen project implementation capacity in light of sub-optimal performance with the existing

                                                6
arrangements after the project became effective; (ii) a growing need to strengthen the overall
institutional framework and capacity in the sector; (iii) an increase in unit costs linked to more
robust design standards introduced during implementation; (iv) unexpected additional costs to
rectify works in several villages where rehabilitation or upgrading works undertaken under the
RWSSP were malfunctioning, these included modest retrofits in 26 additional RWSSP systems;
(v) the need for more effective implementation approaches for works contracts and for hygiene
and sanitation promotion activities; (vi) the partial withdrawal in January 2012 of DFID co-
financing, amounting to GBP 4 million, resulting in an overall reduction in the project funding
from US$18.37 million equivalent to US$13.08 million equivalent; (vii) the need to activate the
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) Safeguard Policy; and last but not least (viii) to accommodate
a request for extension of the closing date by seventeen months to allow for completion of works.
Changes made as part of restructuring in response to the above issues are outlined below.

a.          Change in Project Executing and Implementing Agencies. As part of the first (Level
            Two) restructuring approved by Bank Management on July 25, 2011 changes were made
            to the project’s Executing Agency (EA) and the Implementation Entity (IE) on October
            28, 2011. The changes were made in response to a proposal from the Government to
            strengthen implementation arrangements in light of ongoing performance issues,
            including chronic implementation delays and disruptions encountered after project
            effectiveness. Government requested the transfer of responsibilities for both the EA and
            IE, previously held by the State Committee of Water Resources and Amelioration
            (SCRWA) and the Joint Project Management Unit (JPMU) respectively, to the
            Community Development and Investment Agency (ARIS). As a non-governmental
            organization (NGO), ARIS had a good track record of executing projects funded by the
            World Bank and other donors, including the Village Investment Project, the Small Towns
            Infrastructure and Capacity Building Project, and the Bishkek and Osh Urban
            Infrastructure Project, and improvements in overall implementation were registered soon
            after the change was effected. Primary beneficiaries for the Institutional Development
            Component however remained the CDWUUs and the Department for Water Supply and
            Sanitation (DWSS), which absorbed the former Department for Rural Water Supply
            (DRWS). The DWSS is under the State Agency for Architecture, Construction and
            Communal Services (SAACCS).

b.          As part of the subsequent (Level One) restructuring approved by the Bank’s Board of
            Directors on November 29, 2012, following decisions taken during the project Mid-Term
            Review (MTR), the following changes were made:

     (i)    Project Development Objective. The PDO was revised as described in Section 1.3 above.

     (ii)   Project Components and Scope. The project components and scope were revised as
            described in Section 1.6 above. The changes mainly relate to the reduced scope of
            activities in light of reduced availability of resources and cost increases, and included,
            inter-alia, a reduction from 70 to 35 in the targeted number of rural water supply systems
            to be rehabilitated. Investments entailed comprehensive rehabilitations in six new village
            clusters, as well as in the three villages (Korumdu, Terim-Kashat, and Chelpek) which
            had suffered from unfinished rehabilitations under RWSSP. They also included

                                                    7
         rectifications on an additional 26 schemes previously rehabilitated under RWSSP that
         were experiencing no longer functioning optimally. The failures in these 26 villages were
         mostly associated with poor design of the water sources at the time of RWSSP.

 (iii)   Results Framework. The project results frameworks was revised to reflect reduced target
         values in light of the reduced funding and investment scope for water supply and sanitation
         components, and to introduce indicators to capture the new institutional strengthening
         objective. Indicators were consolidated.

 (iv)    Project Financing. Project financing was revised to reflect the reduced budget, following
         the partial withdrawal of DFID funds, bringing the available budget from US$18.37
         million to US$13.08 million equivalent.

 (v)     Reallocation of Expenditure Categories. Expenditure categories were revised to reflect
         the reallocation of DFID financing to fully fund Component B and 80 percent of
         Component C, as well as register a reallocation of funds among components and
         categories, with a substantial decrease of the infrastructure component and a slight
         increase in the institutional strengthening component.

 (vi)    Safeguard Policies. OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement was triggered on a precautionary
         basis given the nature of envisaged investments, and the potential for temporary
         expropriation or permanent acquisition of land.

 (vii) Project Closing Date. The project closing date was extended by a total of seventeen
       months, from May 31, 2013 to October 31, 2014, to allow for completion of all the works
       required to achieve the project objectives after initial implementation delays.

 (viii) Other Changes to Implementation Arrangements. Other changes to implementation
        arrangements involved a simplification in the implementation approach, with elimination
        of sub-loans to communities for contracting of sub-project works; and the inclusion of the
        United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) as service provider for implementation of
        some tasks under the Hygiene and Sanitation Promotion Component.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

26.   The project’s quality at entry is assessed as having been moderately satisfactory on balance
on the basis of project preparation and design aspects that contributed to the overall
implementation experience and outcome. Key aspects as discussed below.

27.     Soundness of Background Analysis. The PAD presented a generally sound understanding
of the challenges that the Kyrgyz Republic continued to face in providing and managing rural
water supply and sanitation services, in spite of ongoing interventions. The Bank assessed a
repeater operation as the most desirable option to maximize development outcomes based on a

                                                 8
satisfactory assessment of RWSSP’s performance. Background analysis undertaken as part of
project preparation was informed by identified lessons learned from detailed reviews of completed
and then ongoing sub-projects under the RWSSP, consultations with beneficiaries, Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Government agencies and the PMU, interventions in the
sector financed by other donors, including the ADB and DFID, and global good practice in the
sector. The project accordingly incorporated key lessons to improve important elements of design
such as sub-project selection and engineering design criteria, to ensure that sub-projects are simple,
technically sound, cost effective, demand driven, and ultimately more sustainable. For instance,
unlike the previous project which mainly offered basic service levels through mainly stand-posts,
all sub-projects under RWSSP2 were designed to accommodate demands for providing household
water connections in order to respond to future likely beneficiary needs and priorities. It is worth
noting that design of the repeater project prior to full completion of the RWSSP meant that perhaps
not all lessons that could be learned from the latter were captured at the time.

28.      Assessment of the Operation’s Design. Given the prevailing challenges in the sector,
including the need to not only scale up outcomes but also complete outstanding works from
RWSSP, the project design as a “repeater” with improved design elements was sound. The sector
was still learning and adjusting to the new approach to managing rural water supply introduced
under RWSSP, combining elements of Community Driven Development (CDD) and centralized
provision of services. A full CDD approach would have precluded construction of larger or
complex schemes, although community involvement in project implementation is considered more
suitable for enhancing sustainability of services because it better addresses local demands and
facilitates decentralized operations and maintenance. The selected delivery strategy allowed for
the implementation of larger and more complex schemes which can supply sufficient water to large
villages as well as small ones, and for community engagement in the process, increasing the
likelihood of sustainability. As noted above however, timing of the design and failure to fully
capture some critical lessons, evidence, and/or results, for instance in terms of mal-functional
systems, were factors that contributed to some design shortcomings.

29.     The ICR therefore notes some significant shortcomings in the design of (a) initial project
implementation arrangements, (ii) identification of the scope of work and subsequent assessment
of cost estimates; and (iii) the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements. M&E
arrangements are discussed in Section 2.3 below. Implementation arrangements were based on a
Joint Project Management Unit (PMU) responsible for implementation and coordination of the
current project, as well as a then recently approved Asian Development Bank (ADB) financed
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The JPMU was established in 2008 at the national
level to manage implementation of rural water supply projects. The Bank initially proposed
implementation arrangements based on a qualified Project Management Consulting (PMC) firm
similar to the model that had been used for the RWSSP. The Government however requested the
use of the JPMU during negotiations. While the approach appeared sound in principle for aligning
donor efforts, promoting consistency in approaches, and ensuring shared lesson learning across
projects, it required sound capacity within the Unit in order to be effective. Although the PAD
noted weaknesses in existing capacity as a key risk, the model was maintained, and fundamental
changes needed to be made to strengthen implementation arrangements through restructuring
during implementation. Carrying out a comprehensive feasibility study in planning the water
supply systems would also have benefitted the project. Shortcomings regarding the failure to

                                                  9
properly define the scope of sub-projects to be included was linked to the legacy issues from the
RWSSP, evidence of which was perhaps not fully available at the time of design. Addressing
these issues called for restructuring of the project during implementation as discussed below.

30.     Adequacy of Government Commitment. Government commitment to the project during
preparation was generally adequate. Overall support for the project was strong given
Government’s prioritization of provision of a reliable and well-functioning system of basic
infrastructure services. Dialogue between the Bank and Government counterparts was maintained
even where there were differences in opinion such as was the case during negotiations, in selecting
implementation arrangements.

31.      Risk Assessment and Mitigation. The risk assessment undertaken as part of project
preparation and summarized in the PAD was candid and it covered key issues that could potentially
affect implementation. Most of the risk ratings were ‘moderate’ or ‘substantial’, with an overall
project risk rating of ‘moderate’. Identified risks mainly centered around three general themes: (a)
institutional capacity constraints at central government, local government, and community levels
and their implications for project implementation and operation; (b) appropriateness of sub-project
designs and their implications on project costs and financing; and (c) ineffective management
arrangements at local government and community level, including inadequate community cash
contributions and collections, and inadequate construction, operation and maintenance of systems.
Appropriate mitigation measures were identified, with mitigation measures to address them
intertwined with design of the technical assistance and capacity building elements and
implementation support. The following section, which presents factors that affected
implementation, highlights the fact that these critical risks did in fact materialize during
implementation. While the pre-identified risk mitigation measures contributed to some extent to
addressing some of the challenges, resolution of some called for additional measures, in some
cases requiring fundamental structural changes as discussed below.

2.2 Implementation

32.     The project encountered a series of challenges that affected progress through much of its
implementation. Resolution of many of these issues called for proactive intervention by the Bank
team and financing and implementing partners. The following paragraphs summarize the main
issues it faced and describes how they were addressed.

33.     Weaknesses in implementation structures and capacity affected project performance.
Soon after it became effective in August 2009, the project begun to encounter major performance
challenges, resulting in chronic implementation delays and disruptions. These circumstances were
linked to a combination of factors, including, inter-alia, weak implementation capacity, repeated
changes within the original Ministry-level project Executing Agency, the prevailing political
instability in the country, and liabilities inherited from the previous project. The Ministerial home
of the Project Executing Agency was changed four times in the space of 18 months, and Project
Directors changed three times between 2008 and 2011. These changes affected the institutional
memory, capacity, and commitment to the project overall.




                                                 10
34.    The need to address previously unidentified liabilities inherited from RWSSP in form
of incomplete or malfunctioning systems further slowed progress and took up significant
resources. By the end of 2009 and just a few months into implementation, it emerged that in
addition to the three problem sub-projects, Koromdu, Tamir-Kashat, Chelpek pre-identified at
appraisal, water supply schemes in another 26 villages across the three participating Oblasts
required rectification, redesign and/or overhauling. The failures in the 26 villages were mostly
associated with poor design of the water sources under the RWSSP, influenced by the DRWS’
preference for gravity sources such as springs or river drainage over wells. While the latter involve
higher energy costs, the preferred gravity systems in several cases proved unsustainable due
mainly to inadequate CDWUU capacity and source yields, and led to the failure of entire schemes.

35.     Progress was further hampered by the fact that the recommendation by the Bank
team to optimize technical designs through the introduction of more efficient design
standards and materials encountered strong institutional resistance. Local engineers
accustomed to the use of technical engineering standards (SNIPs) inherited from the FSU initially
expressed very strong opposition to the adoption of alternative standards proposed as part of efforts
to address some of the identified problems. Agreement was eventually reached in 2010 after drawn
out discussions involving the Bank and a local team of technical experts on the need to adopt the
revised technical and service standards to assure the quality of rehabilitation works and enhance
the efficiency of resource use. While these measures in principle improved the technical soundness
of systems, implementation performance continued to be plagued by capacity weaknesses within
the JPMU, and finalization of scheme designs and procurement progressed very slowly. By the
MTR in early 2011, the World Bank, DFID and ADB had serious concerns on the overall viability
of the JPMU as an implementing agency.

36.     The recommendation by the Bank team during the MTR, and subsequent decision by
Government to transfer project Executing Agency and Implementing Entity responsibilities
to ARIS were instrumental in getting the project back on track, and in supporting the
turnaround from the unsatisfactory performance at its lowest point in 2011. Following the
MTR, the project was restructured, in two steps, between June 2011 and November 2012. The first
restructuring, a Level 2 restructuring, was approved by Bank Management in June 2011, and it
transferred implementation responsibilities to ARIS. The transfer became effective in October
2011 after a delay in obtaining government countersignature for the ensuing amendment. This
transfer once effective, became one of the single most important factors the contributed to the
project turnaround.

37.      Implementation of the second restructuring (Level 1), originally scheduled to be processed
in the fall of 2011 was impeded by several factors occurring around the same time. The first related
to the delay in obtaining government countersignature for the first restructuring. Second, there
was uncertainty at the time regarding DFID’s decision to continue co-financing the project in light
of changing internal priorities within the British Government. Following a review of its worldwide
portfolio in November 2012, DFID communicated a decision in January 2012 to partially
withdrawal its co-financing, reducing it from GBP 5.0 million to GBP 1 million. Finally, there
was a delay in completion of the project audit for the period August 2009-June 2011 corresponding
to JPMU operations before the transition to ARIS. A situation of non-compliance subsequently
emerged with the delayed publication of the project audit report for the period. Following the

                                                 11
issuance by IDA of a suspension threat on May 30, 2012, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
submitted and acknowledged the audit report with a "disclaimer opinion" on June 20, 2012 and
committed to a repayment schedule for ineligible expenditures (due to weak supporting
documentation) identified in the report. In a letter dated August 9, 2012 the Bank accepted the
audit report and the proposed repayment schedule. With compliance restored and the suspension
threat lifted, the second restructuring could move forward and it was approved in November 2012.

38.      As a result of the reduced funding, revised construction standards and unit costs, and
subsequent reduction in scope of works, targeted results were almost halved vis-à-vis what
had been envisaged at appraisal. Although implementation improved considerably after ARIS
took over the project, envisaged results were substantially reduced by the mentioned factors.
Following the inclusion of the 26 additional villages from RWSSP; it was determined that instead
of the 70 new schemes planned at appraisal, the project could only cover 35 schemes, serving
clusters of villages (in total 55 villages are served by the 35 schemes). Moreover, unit costs had
also increased significantly due to increases in the cost of construction material and civil works in
view of market factors such as inflation and real appreciation of the Kyrgyz Som, and the changes
in technical standards. Availability of resources for the water supply and sanitation components
was also affected by the withdrawal from these activities and subsequent refocus of DFID support
on promotion of improved health and hygiene practices (Component B) and capacity building and
institutional development at community and national levels (Component C). Responsibility for
implementation of the Hygiene Component (Component B) was contracted to UNICEF given its
comparative advantage and prior involvement in the sector in the Kyrgyz Republic. The
contracting process was however delayed by administrative complexities, as UN agencies require
particular procurement procedures and contractual arrangements to work on a borrower executed
project financed by the World Bank. Eventually all hurdles were overcome and the contract with
UNICEF was signed in June 2013. Once all three project components were up and running, the
team was able to upgrade the ISR implementation rating to Moderately Satisfactory.

39.     The project was faced with a financing gap in late 2013, requiring a further
optimization of technical designs and reduction in investment scope. In June 2013 it became
apparent based on expenditures already committed on the first 13 rectifications and detailed design
costs estimates for the remaining 13, that the funding available for the 26 rectifications (amounting
to about US$1.6 million) would not be sufficient. It was estimated at the time that up to US$2.5
million in additional funds would be needed to meet the PDO and honor the commitments made
to the villages. Government requested the Bank to consider providing additional financing to cover
the financing gap. Given the project’s performance history and status however, Bank Management
rejected the request. In efforts to address the financing gap, the task team initiated a comprehensive
technical design and cost review process with ARIS engineers. This resulted in optimized
investment scope and designs and reduced cost estimates. The process involved, inter alia, a
substantial investment scope reduction in the village of Chelpek, where it was decided that a
US$1.5 million complement of service rehabilitations and expansions be deferred. Opportunities
were also identified to reallocate proceeds from "consulting services" to "works", and to mobilize
an additional US$500,000 in GOKR co-financing. These measures were agreed with GOKR and
ARIS during a Bank implementation support mission in November 2013 and approved through a
third restructuring (level 2). In April 2014, with the financing problems resolved and the



                                                 12
perspective that the project would have achieved its objective by October 2014, the ISR PDO
rating was also upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory.

40.     Civil Society opposition initially detracted progress, but effective partnerships were
eventually formed to mutually benefit the project. The highlighted technical concerns
stemming from the RWSSP translated into a number of social concerns the resolution of which
constituted a major problem, especially earlier during implementation. Along with the ADB-
funded CBISSP, the RWSSP2 became the focus of civil society criticism and polemic as a result
of the liabilities inherited from RWSSP and subsequent complaints from some beneficiary
communities. Key issues mainly concerned the failed rehabilitation works in the three problem
sub-projects, with accusations including, inter alia, the alleged use of contaminated pipes – which
was later proved to be unfounded. Concerned communities approached civil society after
apparently failing to receive satisfactory responses to complaints filed with the JPMU. It is worth
noting that similar complaints were concurrently being raised with the ADB financed project in
the Southern Oblasts. Local civil society formed coalitions with international counterparts such
as the so called World Bank Watch and ADB Watch groups and brought these issues to the
attention of Bank Management in Washington during the Spring meetings of 2009, as well as to
ADB management in Manila. Following these actions, affected project sites were visited by the
Bank’s Executive Director and a platform for heightened dialogue between key stakeholders
including the GoKR, the Bank and beneficiaries represented by civil society established to ensure
that issues raised were resolved in a satisfactory manner. Civil society representatives were
incorporated as important partners in project implementation and an open communication channel
opened with them, enhancing transparency and allowing for knowledge exchange and greater
citizen input in critical decisions affecting them. Civil society representatives were also included
in project activities such as study tours organized for stakeholders, and as observers in contract
evaluation committees.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

41.     M&E Design. While project M&E design at approval had sound elements in several
respects, there were shortcomings. Project M&E arrangements built on practices developed under
the previous RWSSP. In addition to the regular M&E to be conducted as part of regular monitoring
of progress during implementation, M&E design envisaged the application of tools such as
Baseline Surveys and Impact Evaluations using a combination of interviews and participatory
techniques. Primary responsibility for M&E lay with the JPMU, which was also supposed to work
on the ADB financed project. Arrangements also included a role for involvement of CDWUUs at
the Oblast level. The capacity of the JPMU for M&E was assessed on the RWSSP experience,
where the team had included support from the experienced Project Management Consultant (PMC)
team. In fact, although the JPMU had inherited some local M&E staff from the PMC, its capacity
was in general far short of the PMC’s.

42.     Shortcomings with regard to M&E were mainly linked to design of the Results Framework
presented in the PAD at approval, and design of the Impact Evaluation. In regard to the Results
Framework, issues included: (i) the absence of baseline data for several indicators, including PDO
indicators; and (ii) the appropriateness of some indicators, for instance in terms of ease of data
collection. Major changes to the Results Framework, including to PDO and intermediate outcome

                                                13
indicators and targets, were made as part of restructuring in order to better capture project results
and achievements. A shortcoming in regard to design of the Impact Evaluation study was the
failure to establish a control group from the start. Control groups were in fact introduced at the
end, which precluded establishment of reliable baseline data.

43.      M&E Implementation and Utilization. Although M&E like other aspects of
implementation was initially affected by the overall performance issues faced during the earlier
part of the project, the function benefitted from the overall capacity strengthening with the transfer
of implementation responsibility to ARIS. Streamlining of key elements of M&E design such as
the Results Framework, through restructuring, were also instrumental in improving M&E during
implementation, and arrangements were later implemented as designed. The Bank team, working
closely with government counterparts, actively monitored overall implementation progress based
on achieved results or the lack thereof, identifying issues affecting the project and providing
recommendations to address issues and to steer the project towards its intended objectives.
Implementation Status and Results (ISR) reports tracked the indicators in the project’s Results
Framework and project supervision documents, including mission aide memoires reported
candidly on results. Data collected through the baseline study carried out during project
preparation informed the refinement of the project’s M&E framework in line with realistic targets,
allowing for better monitoring of project results and achievements. The Impact Evaluation Study
conducted between August and September 2014 also provided a detailed review of project results
and achievements, and highlighted important findings on management of water supply, sanitation,
and hygiene at the community and household levels in participating areas. While the Impact
Evaluation study was originally envisaged to be carried out around mid-term to be able to influence
implementation, information will still be useful for design of future interventions in the sector.

44.     The project supported the development of two MIS databases: (i) for water supply and
sanitation sector performance data collection and management within DRWS; and (ii) for
collection and management of data on parasitic diseases and water quality by the Department for
Disease Prevention and Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision. Development and utilization
of both systems represented important capacity building and institutional strengthening efforts for
the respective departments.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

45.      The project triggered two Safeguard policies at appraisal; Environmental Assessment (OP
4.10) and International Waters (OP 7.50). It was classified as Category B for Environmental
Assessment given the nature of envisaged works which were not expected to have any significant
or irreversible environmental impacts. Environmental Assessment was implemented in accordance
with required procedures and was rated Satisfactory throughout implementation. Some sub-project
activities were expected to take place on trans-boundary waterways as defined in OP 7.50, however
an exception to the policy to notify riparians of the project was granted by Bank management since
activities were not expected to modify the course of waterways, nor significantly increase the
volume of water abstraction.

46.    It was assessed at appraisal that the project would not trigger the Involuntary Resettlement
Policy (OP/BP4.12) as it was expected to deal exclusively with rehabilitation or upgrading of

                                                 14
existing infrastructure and installations on existing premises or public rights of way. The task team
later determined that the policy should be triggered and introduced it as part of the restructuring
given envisaged potential for land acquisition, temporary encroachment, damage of assets or
restrictions on access during implementation. A Resettlement Policy Framework was prepared and
disclosed together with an updated ISDS on July 16, 2012, to address any issues relating to
permanent or temporary involuntary resettlement associated with project activities. 118 Project
Affected Persons (PAPs) in ten villages were identified in accordance with the policy and
compensation, mainly affected by temporary restrictions to access or loss of trees and crops. All
PAPs were fully paid by the project closing date. It is worth noting that compensation costs were
financed by IDA on an exceptional basis. The amount of compensation payments to PAPs
amounted to KGS 1 979 254 (or about US$ 50 000).

Fiduciary Compliance

47.     Financial Management Compliance. The ICR rates Financial Management compliance
under the project Moderately Satisfactory overall, considering both project preparation and
implementation aspects throughout the project’s life. During preparation the Bank conducted an
assessment of the JPMU FM capacity and reviewed accounting, financial reporting, auditing,
internal controls, budgeting, and staff capacity. Then the JPMU was already implementing the
ADB’s CBSSIP-S and was to become responsible for implementation of the RWSSP2. The FM
system was found to be unsatisfactory because the JPMU utilized an obsolete version of 1-C
accounting software with insufficient capacity to generate Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) in a
format satisfactory to the Bank. Internal control policies and procedures were also found to be
weak, and a time bound action plan was included to strengthen FM by negotiations through, inter-
alia, update of the accounting software, addressing internal control weaknesses, and refund of
ineligible expenses incurred during the course of the first project. The overall FM risk for the
project before mitigation measures was assessed as Substantial and Moderate after mitigation.

48.     After project effectiveness, the fiduciary capacity of the JPMU remained low and concerns
were raised by the Bank in regard to its overall performance. ADB had similar concerns. Problems
were specifically flagged in respect to aspects such as record-keeping and accounting, including
occurrence of missing primary documents, un-reconciled balances, deleted records from the
accounting software, and mix-up of payments between different sources of funds. A situation of
non-compliance emerged with the delayed publication of the project audit report for the period
August 2009 to June 2011 corresponding to project operations before the transfer of
implementation responsibility from the JPMU to ARIS. After issuance by IDA of a suspension
threat in May 2012, the Audit report was issued in June 2012. Prior to approval of the Level One
restructuring in 2012, Government acknowledged the audit report and committed to a repayment
schedule for ineligible expenditures due to weak supporting documentation identified in the report.
Financial Management under ARIS was generally satisfactory through the remainder of the project
implementation period, with minor shortcomings. The final ISR rated the project’s FM
performance Satisfactory; however the ICR takes into consideration the experience throughout the
project’s life.

49.    Procurement Compliance: The ICR rates implementation of the Procurement function
under the project Moderately Satisfactory, based on its overall compliance with Bank and country

                                                 15
procedures during project preparation and implementation, with moderate shortcomings. A
Procurement Capacity Assessment for the JPMU was conducted as part of preparation, and the
overall procurement risk in regard to the project was rated Moderate after mitigation. After transfer
of implementation responsibility to ARIS, procurement was generally conducted in accordance
with the Bank’s Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated May 2004,
and revised October 2006, and specific provisions stipulated in the DCA, Grant Agreements, and
the Procurement Act. In order to facilitate the contracting of UNICEF by ARIS for implementation
of the Hygiene and Sanitation Promotion activities, World Bank Guidelines for Selection and
Employment of Consultants dated January 2011 were applied after signing the Level-1
restructuring Amendment to Financing Agreement. This change had no implications on other
procurements, and was cleared by the Bank’s Regional Procurement Manager (RPM).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

50.      Sustainable post-completion operation of water supply and sanitation facilities financed
through the project will be driven by community level (CDWUU) capacity to manage service
delivery, an outcome linked to the availability of adequate human and financial capacity and
resources for effective operations and maintenance of facilities. While there are improvements in
overall sector capacity at all levels as a result of institutional strengthening and capacity building
activities under the project and its predecessor, there is need for further institutional strengthening
and capacity building to improve or maintain capacity of the CDWUUs to deliver water supply
services in an efficient and sustainable manner. This will require sustained effective support to the
service providers, requiring commitment and engagement at multiple sector levels.

51.     It is recommended that post completion action plans to maintain progress beyond the
project be developed by Government and supported through adequate budget and other resources
if outcomes are to be sustained. In addition, the local governments or Ayl Okmotus will need to
be able to continue to plan, budget, and monitor system operation at the local level. As the
adequacy of budget provision to the sector in the Kyrgyz Republic remains in question, the risk to
development outcomes remains substantial.

52.     Results on the ground in terms of the effectiveness of different CDWUUs in managing the
delivery of rural water supply services vary. There have been some notable successes and advances
towards cost recovery in some cases. A few CDWUUs, such as Korumdu, Jele-Dobo and Baltabay
have fully installed meters and are collecting tariffs based on volumetric consumption. An average
cost recovery level of 70 percent has been achieved from participating CDWUUs. However, less
than half (only 15 out of the 37) are collecting sufficient revenues to cover their O&M costs. Fee
collection is mainly seasonal, largely based on income streams such as tourist and harvest seasons
in the rural areas. The financial sustainability of many of the systems is therefore at risk. To
enhance sustainability at the local level, the government, with the support of local parliament
representatives, should continue to advocate for payments of services with the beneficiaries.

53.     Institutional structures also need to be further supported to provide the enabling
environment for effective service delivery for the beneficiary areas and the rest of the sector. The
assets of water supply systems have been handed over to the municipal ownership of Ayl Okmotus,



                                                  16
who have signed Service Agreements with their respective CDWUUs. Performance monitoring in
respect to these Agreements should be conducted with the support of DDWS.

54.     Opportunity for a Follow-On RWSS Project: The GoKR has expressed interest in a
follow on operation to scale up the outcomes of the RWSSP2. The Government sent a formal
request to the Bank on July 25, 2014 to this end. The Bank has advised that consideration of
Government’s request would require clarification of the rationale for the intervention and
agreement with GOKR on a comprehensive re-prioritization, scope, and time-frame for IDA
support to the sector under the Country Partnership Strategy. A follow-up project would build on
the lessons and successes of RWSSP2 to achieve a sustainable transformational impact on the
sector while supporting GOKR’s strategy and reform objectives.

55.     With a US$ 1 million grant received from the Russian Federation, UNICEF will scale up
its WASH in Schools program using the methodology applied under the RWSSP2. To implement
this project, UNICEF will work in partnership with ARIS. The project will have a strengthened
focus on focus on hand-washing among children and improving civic engagement in the WASH
sector. UNICEF will use its core funds and a US$1 million grant received from the Russian
Federation.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objectives

56.      Rating. High. The PDO adequately responded to diagnosed sector challenges and
priorities for rural water supply and sanitation and remains highly relevant to the Kyrgyz
Republic’s development priorities and the Bank’s Strategy for the country. The GoKR articulated
its development priorities of ensuring the delivery of high quality water supply services through
inter-alia, an Order of the President, No. 194, dated 27 September 2013, as well as in the National
Strategy for Sustainable Development of the Kyrgyz Republic 2013-2017, dated January 21, 2013,
approved by the Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic No.11. It is also aligned with
the new Strategy for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector – the State Program for Development
of Water Supply and Wastewater Disposal in Settlements of the Kyrgyz Republic for the 2014-2024
period (hereinafter referred to as the State Program), which was developed with RWSSP2 support.
The State Program aims at improving the quality of water supply and wastewater disposal services,
addressing the main challenges to service delivery, and identifying directions for further
strengthening the sector’s institutional framework.

57.     The PDO is also highly relevant to the Bank’s priorities and development objectives. It
remains aligned with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY14-17 with Kyrgyz
Republic, approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors on June 24, 2013, which focus on three broad
areas of engagement: (a) more efficient public administration and public services-especially those
relating to lowering poverty, improving accountability, enhancing human capital, and reducing
ethnic, gender, and social disparities; (b) an improved business environment and investment

                                                17
climate; and (c) better management of scarce natural resources and physical infrastructure, while
at the same time taking into account climate change, environmental sustainability, and regional
considerations, which are deemed crucial for improved poverty outcomes, in particular for the
almost two-thirds of the population that live in isolated rural and mountainous areas. It is also
aligned with achieving the Bank’s twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and increasing shared
prosperity.

Design and Implementation

58.     Rating. Substantial. The relevance of the project design and implementation are assessed
as Substantial from a number of perspectives. The PDO and other elements of design reflected
proper diagnosis of critical development priorities for Kyrgyz Republic, which remain high on the
development agenda. Revision of the PDO to add the institutional strengthening objective is
further evidence of the project’s efforts to maintain relevance in light of prevailing circumstances.
The project design was generally technically sound, and the components well-structured for a WSS
operation of its nature. It duly considered key lessons from the RWSSP and other rural water
supply and sanitation projects. While there were a few design shortcomings, highlighted earlier in
the ICR, they were recognized during implementation and the project design’s relevance to the
context sustained through the adjustments made as part of restructuring, which aligned the PDO
and targets with changes in priorities and availability of resources.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

59.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The ICR assesses efficacy with respect to project
outcomes as Substantial, based on the aggregated achievement of the development objectives and
outcomes. This section assesses the extent to which the project achieved each objective as well as
its key outcomes, highlighting key outputs that contributed to the outcomes. Details on the outputs
under each project component are presented in Annex 2. In accordance with the Bank’s ICR
guidelines for projects whose objectives have been formally revised, the analysis of efficacy with
respect to achievement of project objectives involved an assessment of performance against
original and revised targets where applicable, weighted by the amount disbursed at the time the
targets were revised. At the time of PDO restructuring in November 2012, grant disbursements
were at 53.1 percent. Assessment of efficacy by individual objective is presented below and
summarized in Table 3.1.

Outcome 1 - Improved access to potable water supply for participating communities,
measured by the increase in the number of residents benefitting from regular availability of
safe potable water.

60.     The project achieved its objective of increasing access to potable water supply to
participating rural communities in Talas, Naryn, and Issyk Kul Oblasts in a moderately
satisfactory9 manner on balance. It was able to provide improved access to water supply of good
quality to about 83,000 people in 55 villages in participating communities, substantially exceeding



9
    Table 3.1 presents the analysis for efficacy taking into consideration the original and revised targets.

                                                             18
the revised target of covering 60,00010 people established when the project was restructured in
2012 and substantially achieving the original target of 100,000 (83 percent). About 86 percent of
households in the participating areas now have access to potable water, and the project provided
more than 3900 households with water supply connections on their premises. Facilities financed
through the project were also able to substantially improve the quality of water supplied to people
with 90 percent of tests in the service area of rehabilitated schemes meeting national standards for
drinking water, representing an improvement of at least 10 percent. Improved access to potable
water supply services is expected to bestow benefits on many levels including environmental,
social, and economic benefits. The Impact Evaluation study carried out at the end of the project
confirmed greater convenience in accessing water overall. As a result of the project over 70 percent
of households in the service areas reported distances to improved water sources at 500/1000 meters
or less. The study also revealed significant improvements in overall satisfaction among project
beneficiaries on key aspects of service delivery such as the quantity, quality, and pressure of water
supplied.

61.     Key Outputs contributing to improvements in access to potable water supply and
associated outcomes. The project, through the Water Supply Infrastructure and Equipment
Component (Component 1) financed the repair, rehabilitation, and replacement or upgrading of 37
rural water supply systems covering a total of 55 villages. A total of 226 water points were
constructed or rehabilitated and 3902 new household connections were installed through the
project. Outputs directly contributing to the improvements in access, quality and reliability of
water supply specifically involved the reconstruction or rehabilitation of production facilities and
distribution networks, as well as improvement of management efficiency and likelihood of
sustainable operation and maintenance through technical assistance and training to improve
CDWUU technical capacity. Sixty maintenance equipment units were provided to CDWUUs
and/or their associations to maintain the water supply systems in their jurisdictions. (Further details
are provided in Annex 2).

Outcome 2. Improved hygiene and sanitation and water related practices at individual,
family and institutional levels

62.     The project fully achieved its objective of improving hygiene and sanitation and water
related practices at individual, family, and individual levels. A total of over 9000 people,
including school children, were provided with access to improved sanitation facilities, almost
doubling the 5000 people originally targeted. There is also evidence that the project contributed
to positive health outcomes in the participating communities. While a range of factors, such as
access to healthcare and other services, can affect health outcomes, it may be reasonably concluded
that the improvements in hygiene and sanitation and water related practices facilitated through the
project contributed to the decreased incidence of waterborne diseases such as acute intestinal
infections, viral hepatitis, and helminthic (worm) invasion in participating communities by an
average of 62.5 percent, exceeding the targeted 60 percent reduction. According to a
comprehensive assessment carried out by the Sanitary Epidemiology Surveillance (SES) Unit in


10
   The original number of beneficiaries expected for the project was 100,000 people. While included as an indicator
in the PAD text and presented in the economic analysis, it was not included in the Results Framework.


                                                        19
the Ministry of Health, acute intestinal infections and viral hepatitis fell by 55 and 54 percent,
respectively, while helminthic infections fell by 75 percent in the project areas. This assessment
was conducted through pre- and post-intervention tests of fecal and blood samples from school
children by SES laboratory staff working with village health centers. Where infection was found,
children and their families were treated, enhancing the health outcomes of the project.

63.     There were also significant improvements in hygiene related practices such as hand-
washing with soap and management of school toilet facilities. At the end of the project an average
of almost 73 percent of people in the project areas reported using soap for hand-washing at critical
times such as after using the toilet compared to only 60 percent before the intervention. There were
variations in individual outcomes among villages and Oblasts, with Issyk-Kul Oblast registering
the highest levels (up to 91 percent) hand-washing post-project compared with the lowest, Talas
(49 percent). A UNICEF study also indicated that school expenditure on water supply, sanitation,
and hygiene was only a fraction of what was required to fulfill national standards. These findings,
as well as the variation in results among Oblasts indicate that although achievements are
commendable, there is a need for sustained promotion of hygiene and sanitation related behavior
change and for actual uptake and usage of facilities.

64.      Key Outputs contributing to improvements in hygiene, sanitation, and water related
practices and related outcomes. The project, mainly through the Sanitation and Hygiene
Promotion Program (Component B) financed by DFID and implemented by UNICEF, supported
village level promotion of healthy hygiene and sanitation practices. Similar promotions were
conducted at schools in the three Oblasts, where the project, through Component A financed the
refurbishment or construction of demonstration facilities at a total of 18 schools in 18 villages
(details are provided in Annex 2). Representatives of schools, healthcare centers, and communities
in all the 55 villages were engaged in sanitation and hygiene promotion campaigns. Two school
teachers from each village participated in an Oblast level training session based on the Water
Hygiene and Sanitation Guidelines for Teachers conducted by UNICEF, and used the Participatory
Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST)-based materials developed to work with schools
and communities in their respective oblasts.

Outcome 3. Strengthened Institutional Framework and Capacity of Rural Drinking Water
Supply Sector

65.      The project partially achieved its objective of strengthening the institutional
framework and capacity of the drinking water supply sector in Kyrgyz Republic at the
national, local government, and community levels. Achievement of this objective is assessed as
moderately satisfactory on balance. Outcomes at the national level were linked to strengthened
sector policy and planning capacity for sustainable development of water supply and sanitation
sector, while community level interventions sought to strengthen operational capacity to ensure
sustainability. Achievement of this objective is however deemed partial given the large variation
in outcomes at different levels and among communities. Measurement of performance in respect
to this outcome at the community level was mainly linked to financial sustainability indicators at
the operational level, specifically: (i) the level of operation and maintenance (O&M) cost recovery
in utilities targeted by the project; and (ii) the number of CDWUUs with sufficient revenues (from
collection of fees and other sources) to cover O&M. All thirty eight participating CDWUUs

                                                20
demonstrated their commitment to operation and maintenance of their water supply systems by
signing Service Agreements with their respective local governments. There are large variations in
performance at individual CDWUU levels. In some CDWUUs, such as Korumdu, Jele-Dobo and
Baltabay, 100% of individual water connections had installed meters by the end of the project. All
CDWUUs, with the exception of two, Chelpek and Tort Kul in Issyk Kul Oblast, and Ak Kuduk
in Naryn Oblast, had set tariffs and started collecting fees. Although an average level of cost
recovery of 70 percent was achieved, less than half (15) CDWUUs were collecting sufficient
revenues to cover O&M costs. Although there have been some successes and improvements in
cost recovery in some cases, there is still need for sustained support to the CDWUUs.

66.      The project was able to support several other activities that are expected to contribute to
improved planning and management capacity of the water supply and wastewater sector. In
addition to training for different staff for instance, the development of the new Strategy for the
Water Supply and Sanitation Sector – the State Program for Development of Water Supply and
Wastewater Disposal in Settlements of the Kyrgyz Republic for the 2014-2024 period is expected
to provide strategic direction to the sector that will enhance sector planning capacity. Similarly,
the development of Management Information System Databases for both water supply
performance and on water quality and the occurrence of parasitic diseases are expected to
contribute to improved management, including monitoring and evaluation of these sectors. While
the transfer of implementation responsibility to ARIS, a non-governmental organization, was a
pragmatic solution to the chronic challenges the project faced and played an important role in
improving overall implementation as earlier discussed, it somewhat denied Government
institutions responsible for rural water supply the full benefit of sustainable institutional capacity
building for design and implementation of investment projects/sub-projects.

67.     Key Outputs contributing to Institutional Strengthening Outcomes. Project outputs
included a series of activities focused on strengthening sector institutions at all levels to improve
rural water supply and sanitation management systems and service delivery. Activities specifically
targeted staff of CDWUUs, Local Self-Governments, and DRWS to strengthen capacity in various
areas, such as technical aspects for improved operations and maintenance, and financial
management, particularly in operation of a billing system. A total of 40 DRWS personnel were
trained in management and planning for rural water supply and sanitation, and 196 CDWUUs
trained in fee collection and management of schemes. Other notable outputs at the national level
included:

   a. Development of a Sector Strategy for Water Supply and Sanitation. The Strategy was
      before the country’s Parliament’s for consideration at the time of the ICR review.
   b. Review of legislation in the field of water supply and water disposal. Review and update
      of the existing legislation regulating the sector in order to support implementation of the
      above State Sector Development Program was conducted with engagement of key
      stakeholders at national, local government, and community levels.
   c. Creation of Management Information System (MIS) database with GIS interface.
      Two MIS databases were developed for (i) water supply and sanitation sector performance
      data collection and management within DRWS; and (ii) for collection and management of
      data on parasitic diseases and water quality by the Department for Disease Prevention and
      Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision.

                                                 21
     d. Development of a financial model for water supply and water disposal development.
        The project hired an international consultant to design the financial model for the water
        supply and sanitation sector and delivered training for DWSS staff on how to use the model.
     e. Review technical norms and standards. The project financed the review and
        recommendations on optimization of technical standards for water supply and sanitation,
        and technical advisory support of chlorination in disinfection of potable water
     f. Capacity building for LSG bodies and CDWUUs in managing and maintaining water
        supply systems to provide population with high quality potable water supply to population;
     g. Introduction and adoption of an effective billing system at the CDWUU level . To
        improve CDWUU operations, including tariff collection, 80 sets of office equipment
        (computer, printer, stabilizer) were provided through the project, and staff trained in
        operating the billing program.

3.3 Efficiency

68.    Rating: Moderate. Efficiency of the project is rated Moderate based on the results of the
economic analysis conducted as part of the ICR, as well as other pertinent factors such as per capita
investment costs and the implementation time.

69.     Economic Analysis. The project’s viability is based on the Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV) of the measurable, incremental benefits and total project costs
using actual investment expenditures as well as annual O&M costs through the asset life. Three
main sets of benefit streams were considered: (a) decreases in the time spent collecting water; (b)
welfare gains at household level associated with reduced expenditure on water storage tanks as
well as need for in-house treatment (i.e. boiling water); and (c) reduced incidence of water related
diseases such as infectious hepatitis and acute enteric infections as a result of improved access to
high quality water and decline in the reliability on standing water sources. As with all economic
analyses, the costs are perfectly observed while the benefits are not. Detailed analysis, including
the assumptions for the analysis are provided in Annex 3.

Table 3.2: Results of the Economic Analysis

                              Overall Project Economic Viability
                    ICR (at completion)                      PAD (at appraisal)
                   ERR                 NPV (USD)          ERR           NPV (US$)
                   15%                  1,890,648         32%           12.9million

70.     The estimated ERR at ICR was 15% and the NPV was US$$1,890,648, assuming a social
discount rate of 12% and 26 years of asset life, including 6 years of project implementation, with
corresponding benefits to be realized starting in 2015. The analysis reveals that actual economic
indicators (ERRs) are much lower than those projected during appraisal. Given the conservative
assumptions used (low skill wages, low number of daily trips), and the fact that no benefits could
be accounted for part of the activities of component B, and all of the activities of component C and
D, the project’s NPV and ERR are in fact expected to be even higher than those estimated.
Additionally, the project has relatively low per capita investment costs of about US$ 163 per capita,
which are consistent with average unit costs from the region12. This is considered to be reasonable
given the low population density of the project area. Based on these results, combined with the



12
     Data from similar projects supported by Oxfam had average unit costs of US$ 157 per capita.

need for an additional 17 months to complete implementation of investments, the efficiency of the
project is considered to be Moderate compared with the ex-ante analysis conducted at appraisal.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

71.     The project’s overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory considering the
aggregate of its High relevance, Substantial efficacy in achieving the PDO, and Moderate
efficiency. The project is still highly relevant and provision of potable water supply and sanitation
services remain high priorities for the GoKR. While the project has resulted in improved access to
potable water supply to about 83,000 people, improved hygiene, sanitation and water related
practices in project areas, and strengthened institutions responsible for water supply and sanitation
in Kyrgyz Republic, the risks to development outcomes remain substantial.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

72.     While there was no formal poverty reduction assessment conducted at any stage of the
project, it can be reasonably concluded that in providing access to safe water and improved
sanitation services to people in rural communities, most of whom are poor, the project improved
the well-being of these people thus contributing to overall poverty reduction. Similarly impacts on
gender are envisaged to have been positive given that women in the Kyrgyz Republic, like many
other countries, are usually responsible for managing water collection and hygiene related issues
at the household and community levels. Women are an integral part of Water Committees
established through the project, and 65 percent of CDWUUs have women occupying at least one
of the three most senior positions on their committees. Inclusion of women has not only enabled
greater gender balance, but also adds value in knowledge and management of services since
women are primarily responsible for managing WSS at the household and in often at community
levels.

(b) Institutional Change/ Strengthening

73.     The PDO aimed to strengthen the institutional framework and capacity for managing rural
water supply and sanitation services in Kyrgyz Republic in a sustainable manner. Interventions
included capacity building and technical assistance targeting institutions at the national, local
government, as well as community levels responsible for these services. The project has registered
achievements in terms of capacity built through training of national and local government staff in
subjects needed to sustainably manage water and sanitation services; and provision of equipment
and facilities to strengthen sector institutions. Key achievements in terms of institutional
strengthening are summarized under the discussion on Institutional Strengthening outcomes in
Section 3. 2 above.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
There were no significant unintended outcomes from the project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

74.   A Beneficiary Survey was not conducted for the project. However an Impact Assessment
was carried out by the Government with support from IDA. Key findings of the Impact
Assessment are presented in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

75.    Rating: Substantial. The maintenance and sustainability of the project’s development
outcomes will depend on several factors. The project’s risk to development outcome is rated
“Substantial”, based on the aggregate of technical, financial, institutional and social
considerations that could affect the sustainability of outcomes achieved under different project
components.

76.     Financial and Institutional Risks: On the financial front there is a substantial risk that
not all CDWUUs will be able to collect sufficient revenues to cover the costs of operating and
maintaining the water supply systems, and that limited national budget allocations to the sector
would not be able to adequately cover budget deficits. Similar risks exist with regard to sustained
financial support for adequate maintenance of school sanitation facilities. Actual O&M costs for
WASH facilities based on data obtained from participating rural schools and private schools in
Bishkek revealed that the rural schools were spending substantially less than is needed to properly
maintain the facilities. In the pilot schools of Talas Oblast for instance, KGS 27.5 per student per
year was spent for operation and maintenance of WASH infrastructure on average, compared to
KGS 196.6 from one the private schools in Bishkek. In contrast, according to the Russian
Federation’s sanitary standards, average annual expenses for household goods, disinfectants and
health goods as converted to KGS, were KGS 287 per student per year. Mitigation of these risks
would require a combination of political will and institutional factors, primarily involving central
and local governments, as well as school administrators, Education and Health Ministries, as
applicable, maintaining policies for sound management, provision of continued support and
allocation of adequate resources for system operation and maintenance, including cost-recovery in
the medium- to long-term supported by adequate budgetary provisions for covering deficits in the
interim. While the project has helped strengthen the enabling environment by strengthening sector
policy and capacity building for DDWS, Ayil Okmotus and CDWUUs, and there has been progress
by many CDWUUs to collect revenues, there is still need for sustained support to the sector at all
levels.

77.     Social and Attitudinal Risks: Risks from a social and attitudinal perspective are
considered Moderate. While there is a strong awareness, support, and appreciation of project
achievements by most project beneficiaries, maintaining the development outcomes achieved by
the project will require project beneficiaries to remain motivated to continue operating and
maintaining the facilities in a sustainable manner, including paying needed contributions towards
cost recovery or user charges as applicable. The provision of hygiene and sanitation education and
sensitization to beneficiaries was a first step in addressing this risk by creating a greater awareness
of the benefits of using improved sanitation facilities and services. More should be done to
maintain the engagement with beneficiary communities on these issues, including continued
sensitization of school children and adults on the proper use and maintenance of toilet facilities.
                                                  25
This will require a joint effort by relevant stakeholders, including school administration officials,
parents, and students.

78.      Technical Risk: Risks from a technical perspective are considered moderate. While the
quality of construction of investments in most sub-projects was adequate and technologies used
more efficient, particularly after revision of norms, there is evidence of some sub-projects
experiencing issues linked in part to the fact that envisaged works were not fully completed due to
resource limitations. Additionally, technical risks relate to inadequate capacity for proper operation
and maintenance of facilities in some CDWUUs, and the availability of engineers and technicians
that are adequately trained and fully understand the application of international technical standards.
The need for chlorination of water supplies for instance is an issue for much of the FSU, due to
concerns about potential over-dosing. While the new sector strategy outlines the need for
chlorination of water supplies, there is need for continued advocacy on its benefits in regard to
water quality, and CDWUUs must be trained in proper chlorine handling and dosing. Technical
sustainability of all facilities is thus closely dependent on appropriate management and
maintenance systems remaining in place, supported by the enforcement of policies to ensure
continued availability of resources, and adequate capacity and availability of tools and spare parts.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

79.      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is
rated Moderately Unsatisfactory based on its role in facilitating and supporting design, preparation,
and appraisal of the project, with some significant shortcomings. Project design and preparation
activities were consistent with the Bank’s fiduciary requirements, and appraisal took into
consideration pertinent technical, financial, and economic aspects of proposed activities. Design
duly considered lessons from RWSSP and incorporated implementation measures to address some
of the challenges and outstanding issues from that project. As part of due diligence conducted
during preparation the team identified key risks to project implementation and outcomes and
mitigation measures to address them. Shortcomings mainly relate to the Bank’s judgment in
accepting at negotiations to entrust project implementation on the JPMU, which was assessed to
have limited capacity and experience with Bank projects, as well as inadequate design of project
M&E arrangements.

(b) Quality of Supervision

80.     Rating: Satisfactory. The ICR rates Bank performance for quality of supervision as
having been satisfactory, taking account of the extent to which the Bank managed its fiduciary
and technical support responsibilities during implementation, steering the project back on track
after a very difficult start, allowing it to substantially achieve its intended objectives. Project
implementation was closely supervised by the Bank, with adequate resources allocated in terms of
budget and staff with an appropriate skill mix for supervision throughout the project
implementation period. Formal supervision missions were carried out at least twice a year by the
                                                 26
team and the locally based co-TTL followed implementation on a daily basis. Visits to
participating communities were routinely carried out implementation issues were described
candidly in aide-memoires and ISRs, and sufficient attention paid to safeguards and fiduciary
aspects as needed. To further strengthen implementation support to the project in view of the
challenges it faced, the Bank assigned a Lead Water and Sanitation Specialist based in Washington
as Task Team Leader (TTL), and stationed another seasoned co-TTL in Bishkek to provide support
on the ground to address technical issues, as well as manage the day to day dialogue on concerns
encountered by the project. The Bank exercised sound judgment in its decision to restructure the
project in light of the serious performance issues. In recognition of the positive turn-around in
project performance and outcomes, the GOKR even awarded the Bank co-TTL a rare medal of
“Honorable Builder of the Kyrgyz Republic” in early 2013. Bank Management should be
commended for understanding the importance of remaining committed to the project/sector
through the very difficult 2010-2013 period, were multiple intractable problems accumulated
against it. Bank patience, and the commitment of an unusual level of supervision resources are
among the factors that enabled an improbable project turnaround and gradual rebuild of sector
capacities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

81.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Overall Bank performance is rated Satisfactory on the
basis of the Bank’s performance during preparation and implementation, and its contribution as
discussed above to the Moderately Unsatisfactory project quality at entry and Satisfactory quality
of supervision, ultimately resulting in the overall Moderately Satisfactory project outcome.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

82.     Government performance is assessed as Moderately Unsatisfactory on balance on the basis
of the overall performance of the national government, including the executing and implementing
agencies, and of the participating local governments and the CDWUUs over the project lifetime.
The ICR would like to emphasize that while some individual entities did demonstrate good
performance at different times, this rating assesses the aggregate of performance of government
over the entire implementation period, including in light of issues the project faced at critical times.

83.     National Government. The ICR assesses the performance of the Ministry of Finance
(MoF) as the Borrower, and the line Ministries/Government Agencies in charge of rural water
supply and sanitation during project preparation and implementation, as implementers as having
been Satisfactory and Moderately Unsatisfactory, respectively, on balance, although there were
variations in performance of the different agencies and at different times during implementation.
Government commitment to the project was considered to have been adequate at the time of entry,
and part of the justification for processing the project as a “Repeater” was confirmation of the
Borrower’s interest in scaling up the existing project activities in this manner. During
implementation however, Government commitment to the project was affected by the political
                                                  27
instability in the country, and repeated changes of line Ministries/Government Agencies
responsible for the project.

84.      The DRWS was in fact transferred to different Ministries four times between 2008 and
2012, initially being transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture to the National Agency for Local
Self Governance (NALSG) as part of efforts by government to ensure closer links between the
sector and rural self-government bodies. The Project was negotiated with NALSG as Executing
Agency, when DRWS and its JPMU were then located under its supervision. However, following
negotiations, in the first 18 months of project implementation, DRWS and JPMU changed
institutional home repeatedly, moving from the NALSG to the Ministry of Natural Resources, and
then on to the State Committee of Water Resources and Amelioration (SCWRA). SCWRA was
supposed to oversee project implementation at the line Ministry level but it lacked specific WSS
expertise and it was not able to provide adequate oversight to ensure sound implementation
performance. Line agency/Ministry support and commitment to the project was further affected
by instabilities from the prevailing political climate. The Project was later transferred under the
direct supervision of the Prime Minister’s office and ARIS was appointed as both the
Implementing Entity and Executing Agency. DRWS, which had by then moved under State
Agency for Architecture Construction and Regional Development (later .and Communal Services,
SAACCS or GOSSTROY), remained the primary institutional partner of the project and was the
main beneficiary for all Institutional Development activities facilitated by ARIS. It took the
GOKR a lot of pragmatism to allow an NGO such as ARIS, – admittedly highly experienced with
implementation of Bank projects - to step in to not only take on Implementation Entity (i.e. PIU)
responsibilities, but to also represent the Government as Execution Agency (Ministry) for the
sector.

85.     After project Executing and Implementing Agency responsibilities were transferred to
ARIS, there was a significant improvement in performance. Similarly, with the transfer of DRWS
to GOSSTROY, a department with all functional responsibilities in it, stronger leadership was
established in the sector, and Government provided more effective support to the project. These
developments, combined with the strong support from MoF, which was a strong advocate for the
project restructuring within Government, were instrumental in the project’s turn-around.

86.     Local Governments/ Ayl Okmotus. Performance of the Ayl Okmotus varied considerably
among individual participating local governments, but is also assessed as having been Moderately
Satisfactory on balance. Performance varied based on factors such as capacity of individual
members and strength and independence of the individual local governments. Of the 453 Ayl
Okmotus in Kyrgyz Republic only 18 percent are independent.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

87.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The implementing agency performance rating is based
on assessment of the performance of the different agencies, JPMU, ARIS, and the CDWUUS, as
well as the project’s overall outcome.



                                                28
88.    JMPU. Performance of the JMPU originally assigned responsibility for project
implementation is assessed as having been Unsatisfactory. The JPMU was envisaged as a
temporary unit of DRWS, structured to increase the capacity of NALSG/DRWS to take over future
work. Unfortunately however the capacity of the JPMU was found to be weak and its performance
sub-optimal after the project became effective, leading to a series of implementation challenges
discussed in Section 2.2 above. Responsibility for implementation was eventually transferred from
the JPMU to ARIS.

89.      ARIS Performance. ARIS’s performance is assessed as having been Satisfactory based
on its performance after transfer of implementation responsibilities to it as part of project
restructuring. ARIS, an NGO with a good track record of project implementation, showed courage
and dedication in accepting a project with very serious implementation issues. It adequately
fulfilled its key project implementation roles in accordance with the Project Agreement it signed
with IDA, and supervision ratings for financial management, procurement, and safeguards aspects
under the Agency’s watch were generally satisfactory. In overseeing overall project
implementation, the agency also coordinated and supervised required tasks, including supporting
the engineering design and technical supervision aspects during the difficult transition from the
SNIPs to the revised standards for sub-project design. The transfer of supervision responsibilities
to ARIS was instrumental in contributing to the project’s overall outcome after the initial
challenges.

90.     CDWUUs. CDWUU performance is assessed as having been Moderately Satisfactory, on
balance, with some exhibiting exemplary or satisfactory performance while others performed
poorly. Differences in the performance of CDWUUs are attributed to various factors such as
existing capacity and commitment to the project. Some CDWUUs had relatively experienced staff,
often with a technical professional background relevant to management of water supply facilities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

91.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The rating for Borrower performance combines the
mixed ratings for the Government’s and the aggregated rating of the implementing agencies’
performance during preparation and implementation as well as consideration of the overall
outcome rating for the project in general.

6.0 Lessons Learned

92.     Design of so called ‘repeater’ or follow-on operations should involve comprehensive
consultations with various key stakeholders to capture any legacy issues and incorporate
important lessons on what has and has not worked at different stages of the original project.
The repeater project should build in arrangements to address the legacy issues and provide
solutions to outstanding challenges from the original project. Accordingly, also the timing of a
repeater project should allow for such lessons to be available.

93.     Design of project implementation arrangements should hinge on building robust
institutional structures that can withstand internal and external shocks such as the

                                                29
withdrawal of individual champions or changes in government. The project preparation
process on the part of Government was championed by strong individuals within the NALSG.
Project oversight and implementation capacity however, declined considerably following the
departure of these individuals after the project became effective, given the weak institutional
capacity within the broader DRWS and the JPMU. The frequent transfer of the project’s
institutional home from one agency to another, without strong leadership, exacerbated
implementation problems.

94.     Strengthening local engineering-design capacities and standards should be an
important element of capacity building efforts to enhance the technical sustainability of
water supply and sanitation infrastructure investments. In contexts of low local technical
design capacities as was the case in the Kyrgyz Republic, it is important to foster the acceptance
of international expertise and standards, and to mobilize it in partnership with local firms.

95.     Improved convenience in access to water through the provision of household
connections motivates payment for water supply services among rural communities. The
culture of not paying for services in many Kyrgyz villages remains a challenge. However, the
provision of yard or household connections – which really makes the difference in cold rural areas
– has proved to be an important factor in determining whether or not people pay for services.
Improved quality of water alone, on the other hand, has not seemed to influence people’s
motivation to pay as much, as villagers generally perceive their water as clean.

96.     The community-based CDWUU rural water supply delivery model is not always a
panacea for success, but requires careful design based on sector maturity and context,
including a candid assessment of existing capacity at the local level. Stakeholders must be
prepared for the fact that some CDWUUs may underperform or fail because of inadequate capacity
or financial resources to address issues, and must plan for solutions to assist CDWUUs in need.
These CDWUUs will require sustained support to ensure success. It is imperative that the next
project makes progress in developing a system to support CDWUUs effectively.

97.     Sustained Bank engagement and support to client governments in the face of serious
sector challenges can enable an improbable project turnaround and gradual rebuild of sector
capacities. Bank patience, and the commitment of a substantial level of supervision resources are
among the factors that enabled the project to be turned around. Sustained Bank engagement kept
the window for continued dialogue open to rebuild capacities and provide strategic direction to the
sector. Bank Management should be commended for understanding the importance of remaining
committed to the project/sector through the very difficult 2010-2013 period, were multiple
intractable problems accumulated against it.

98.    Turn-around of problem projects requires intensive supervision through staff on the
ground. Decentralization of staff for instance through assignment of a senior co-TTL in country
can enhance implementation support and greatly improve the effectiveness of Bank supervision
capacity on problem projects.




                                                30
99.     To achieve the full health benefits, hygiene and sanitation interventions should always
accompany water supply investments. The Synergies that exist between rural water supply and
sanitation programs and health programs, and should be exploited more. A key lesson from the
RWSSP2 was that optimal health results were achieved when water supply, hygiene, and sanitation
interventions were implemented together. For example, the identification through the project of
school children infected by helminths, and subsequent treatment for the same, had a positive result
on the project’s impact and how it was perceived by the local communities.

100. Improving sanitation and hygiene practices in schools may trigger positive changes
at home; however much more must be done to support Sanitation at the household level in
Kyrgyz Republic to fully achieve health outcomes. Using the toilet in parts of rural Kyrgyz
Republic remains a challenge, especially for women and children. Although the project focused
mostly on schools, greater promotion of sanitation at the household level using appropriate
mechanisms such as a “sanitation marketing” approach to further improve sanitary conditions in
homes would be important.

101. Bank teams should manage expectations and ensure that sufficient and meaningful
dialogue is maintained with all key stakeholders prior to and throughout project
implementation. The project implementation experience could have benefitted from better
communication with clients and beneficiaries on not only the envisaged results, but also on the
limitations and potential challenges which called from frequent adaptation.

102. Civil society can be important allies and partners to project implementation . Civil
society support to project beneficiaries to draw attention to issues that they felt were not being
adequately addressed by Government were initially seen as an unwelcome distraction to a project
already plagued by numerous challenges. However the ultimate incorporation of civil society as
allies and partners in project implementation helped to improve overall project transparency and
relationships among key stakeholders by allowing civil society to act as a bridge between
beneficiaries and Government often helping to facilitate difficult discussions as independent
parties.

103. Project implementation arrangements should always be designed to strengthen
internal Government capacity. Even where circumstances may call for non-governmental
implementation support, the selected implementing entity should work closely with the respective
government counterparts to ensure that their capacity is built. Transferring implementation
responsibility to ARIS was a pragmatic solution to chronic implementation challenges, and it
played an important role in improving overall project performance, as earlier discussed. ARIS
worked closely with DWSS, involving the latter in critical implementation steps, including
procurement and dedicated TA activities. With such approach, although the Government entity
may not have the required skills to implement a project without external support, in the long term,
their sustained engagement should progressively help develop the necessary capacity to run similar
operations.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

104. Annex 7 presents a summary of the Borrower’s ICR. The Borrower’s ICR was well
prepared and informative, and findings drew from a strong evidence base based on project
experiences. The assessment of project implementation and outcomes are generally consistent
with the Bank ICR.

105. In addition to the Borrower’s ICR, comments on the Bank’s ICR were received from the
Government, both from the Ministry of Finance and the State Agency for Architecture,
Construction, and Housing and Utility Infrastructure/ DWSS, and they have been incorporated in
the report, where possible. In particular, comments from the DWSS reflect a broad view of issues
that have affected the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector and operations financed by the Bank as
well as other donors in the Kyrgyz Republic since 2002. Some of them do not pertain to RWSSP2.
Copies of the respective Government letters providing the full list of comments are included as
Annex 8b, and footnotes have been added in that section to clarify and respond to some of the key
issues raised. Comments provided also capture important considerations for future interventions
in the sector. Comments from the Ministry of Finance on the other hand mainly relate to
clarification of outputs.

(b) Co-financiers

106. Comments to the ICR received from DFID focused on clarification of specific details in
the main text and were incorporated directly in that regard. A detailed report of the DFID financed
activities is provided in Annex 8a). The DFID ICR accordingly focuses mainly on the Hygiene
and Sanitation, and the Institutional Strengthening components of the project. The main findings
from the DFID report are consistent with the ICR lessons.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

107. UNICEF also provided comments and clarifications to the main text in regard to activities
implemented by the agency. These comments have been accordingly incorporated in the ICR text.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

A. PROJECT OUTPUTS BY COMPONENTS
COMPONENT A. WATER SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT
This component was to provide financing to local communities represented by CDWUUs to
rehabilitate or expand existing village water supply systems. The component provided a
combination of grants and credits to local communities in the participating oblasts, for rural water
supply and sanitation infrastructure and equipment required for delivery of improved and more
sustainable community water supply and sanitation services.
The project specifically achieved the following:
   a) Repair, rehabilitation, and replacement or upgrading of existing village water supply
      systems in 55 villages in participating communities; and improvement of sanitary and
      technical conditions in the villages. A total of 37 sub-projects/contracts were
      implemented for water supply improvement in the 55 villages for a total of USD
      9653448.41. Thirty seven water supply sub-projects were implemented in 55 villages for a
      total of USD 9 653 448.41. Specific investments included: rehabilitated or construction of
      a total of 40 reservoirs, and drilling of 24 wells, with installation of new water towers and
      chlorination station. Works also included replacement of old and economically inefficient
      pumps and electrical equipment with energy efficient Grundfos pumps with 3- year
      warranties and service period. Meters were also provided to several CDWUUS; 100% of
      water connections in Korumdu, Jele-Dobo and Baltabay now have meters as a result of the
      project.

   b) Rehabilitation and/or construction of demonstration sanitation facilities at selected
      schools. The project financed the construction of sanitation facilities at schools in 18
      villages at a cost of USD 263733,24. There was an overwhelming demand for facilities
      from communities, and applications were received from 49 schools in the 36 participating
      Ayil Okmotus. Selection was carried out by a committee which reviewed applications
      received from the Ayil Okmotus, accompanied by photographs of existing sanitation
      facilities to demonstrate status, letters of guarantee from the Ayil Okmotus confirming
      willingness to contribute 5% co-financing and intention to increase financing for WSS,
      existence, and operation of school parliaments and Parents’ Committees as well as
      sanitation and hygiene education plan for schools. Standard-type schools with in-door
      sanitation facilities were selected from the three pilot Oblasts for rehabilitation. Based on
      applications received and in line with the evaluation criteria, 10 schools were selected for
      construction of outdoor sanitation works and 8 schools for rehabilitation of in-door facilities
      (toilets and washstands). Accordingly, outdoor facilities were built at 10 schools and 8
      schools had their in-door sanitation facilities rehabilitated. On-site technical supervision of
      subprojects was provided by ARIS supervisors and by AO technical supervisors while AO
      (Clients) kept continuous control over the quality of civil works.

   c) Supply of equipment to selected CDWUUs and/or their associations to maintain the
      water supply systems.
       Maintenance Equipment. The Project provided special machinery for water supply
         system operation to 63 CDWUUs, comprising: 7 diggers, 30 tricycles (motor scooters),

                                                34
           60 kits of equipment and tools and 60 generators for the total of USD 298 090.
           Appropriate training was provided in their use. Meetings held with AO and CDWUU
           representatives were devoted to issues such as ensuring water economy, loss reduction,
           replacement of street standpipes by household connections, installation of meters and
           proper operation of submersible well pumps.
          Computers for CDWUUs. A total of 80 sets of computer equipment (PC,
           multifunctional devices, UPS devices) were provided to CDWUUs for the introduction
           of improved billing systems and improvement of CDWUU subscriber awareness and
           fee collection. All 80 CDWUUs provided with equipment have been trained. The
           CDWUU chairpersons and accountants received training in introducing and operating
           the billing system. Beneficiaries noted that the new billing system was very user-
           friendly and accessible to use.
          Personal safety apparel for water disinfection. 35 CDWUU were provided with
           personal protection means such as overalls, gloves, caps, masks, goggles, rubber boots
           to provide protection during the chlorination process.
          Computers and laboratory equipment for Department of Disease Prevention and
           State Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance (SES – sanitary and
           epidemiological service). Technical assistance has been provided to SES in form of
           capacity building to support improvement of Raion SES for water quality control and
           monitoring of parasitic diseases in order to improve the SES capacity and performance
           in the water supply and sanitation sector. ARIS developed a database for this purpose,
           with software that will be placed on the Department’s Web-page. Specific outputs
           provided with this capacity building included: (i) the provision of computers and
           laboratory equipment. Computer equipment comprised 30 sets of Personal Computers
           and office equipment (system block, monitor, multifunctional device, UPS) and a
           server for the database; while (ii) laboratory equipment for water tests was provided
           for 13 pilot Raion SES laboratories. The database has been introduced for the Central
           Department and its units in Bishkek, as well as for 13 target Raion (regional) services.
           Additionally, to operate the database ARIS procured and handed over computer
           equipment to the Department. All specialists from 13 Raion pilot SES received training
           in database and started introducing this system at the central and Raion level.

   d) Provision of consultancy services for preparation of design and bidding documents,
      and for technical supervision of construction activities to ensure the quality of
      infrastructure financed by the Project.

COMPONENT В. SANITATION AND HYGIENE PROMOTION PROGRAM. This
component supported village-level promotion of healthy hygiene and sanitation practices through
technical assistance. As discussed above, actual refurbishment or construction of demonstration
sanitation facilities at schools was financed through Component A, as part of the infrastructure
works. An agreement for implementation of this component was signed between ARIS and
UNICEF on June 17, 2013, and most activities were carried out after this. Activities have been
completed under this component for pilot villages at the community and school level. The focus
of work in the pilot communities mainly aimed at social mobilization in order to involve people in
improvement of sanitation and hygiene practices at the school or household level.
                                               35
Specific outputs under this component are as follows:

   a) Hygiene and sanitation promotion in communities and schools.

          Sanitation and hygiene promotion in communities. Sanitation and hygiene have
           been promoted in the communities by training of community members in PHAST
           method and training of students using UNICEF WASH in Schools methodology.
           Community training was delivered in two stages. Stage 1 covered VHC members
           during two-day training by PHAST method, 556 VHC members in total represented by
           427 women and 129 men from 55 pilot villages. During the second stage the VHC
           trained members of all households in pilot villages. A total of 30,101 participants were
           trained.
          Training of teachers and students. For the training of students in sanitation and
           hygiene by UNICEF WASH in Schools methodology, the first stage involved training
           of two teachers from each school as trainers – 87 women and 23 men totaling 110
           trainees. These trainers, subsequently trained teachers of primary classes and
           classroom teachers in their respective schools, covering 1 957 trainees in total (414
           men and 1543 women).
          In addition, extra-curricular activities have been held in each class of 1st to 11th grades
           covering all students of schools. Each school was provided with 5 to 10 manuals
           “WASH in schools” developed by UNICEF. For higher efficiency of classes and
           developing proper hygienic behavior, UNICEF also handed over a hand-washing
           demonstration kit GloGerm. Teachers and children reported continued use of the
           manual and the kit after completion of the RWSSP2.


   b) Social mobilization in pilot communities. Social mobilization in pilot villages has been
      carried out in various ways such as the following.

          Community meetings in the beginning and upon completion of project activities in
           each of pilot villages.
          Exchange visits between villages.
              -   In Issyk-Kul Oblast, an exchange visit took place on March 5, 2014 in one
                  secondary school in Tuura-Suu village of Ton Raion. It invited heads of Aiyl
                  Okmotu, Aiyl Kenesh members, school management, CDWUU, parents’
                  committees and VHC from pilot villages hosting 110 participants including 55
                  women. The visit showed that it is possible to maintain school toilets in proper
                  condition and ensure access to water for students.
              -   In Naryn Oblast, an exchange visit dedicated to World Water Day took place
                  on March 22, 2014 in Kazybek village (At-Bashy Raion) and on March 23,
                  2014 in Bash-Kuugandy village, Jumgal Raion. Exchange visits involved
                  around 100 participants.


                                                 36
           -   In Talas Oblast, an exchange visit between villages was held on March 27, 2014
               and dedicated to World Water Day. This event took place in a community club
               in Kum-Aryk village, Talas Raion. Around 160 villagers participated in the visit
               including government officials from Bakai-Ata, Talas and Kara-Buura raions,
               Aiyl Okrug, school management/teachers, CDWUU, VHC and parents
               committees etc. The participants shared their experiences of social
               mobilization, PHAST training in their villages and overcoming the emerging
               difficulties etc. almost all schools presented their wall newspapers, contests of
               paintings/essays, design sketches of school and household toilets etc.
       Parents’ conferences proved to be efficient means of outreach activity. They discussed
        the importance of S&H for child health, sanitation and hygiene status in schools,
        personal hygiene rules, frequency of changing underwear and bedclothes for a child
        treated oxyuricide, and the need for mobilization of local resources to ensure adequate
        financing of O&M costs for WASH facilities. Many parents began realizing the need
        for financial support to schools for maintaining the WASH infrastructure.
       School parliaments. Each school’s parliament was invoked to introduce WASH
        principles. This involved a series of activities, such as: revival of sanitary assistants
        elected from among students, who together with parliaments organized contests for
        “Most Clean Classroom”, monitored the appearances and tidiness of
        students/classrooms, held Saturday cleaning days around schools, and organized
        contests of paintings, essays and newspapers devoted to “Water, Sanitation and
        Hygiene”. Results of contests were recognized at school lineups.
       Raion-level round tables for discussion of O&M for school WASH facilities.
        Representatives from Raion governments, education departments, SES, Family
        Practitioners Centers, Aiyl Okmotu, school management, CDWUU, VHC, HPC, RHC
        and other stakeholders took part in these events. The participants have been provided
        with data on standard rates and actual O&M costs for WASH both in-kind and cash.
        Village-level round tables were organized with the support of Aiyl Okmotus and
        attended by school management, CDWUU, VHC, parents committees, school
        parliaments and other stakeholders. Participants have been informed of maintenance
        costs for sanitation facilities, hygienic needs (soap, toilet paper) per student per year
        and expense rates for health aids.
   Awareness campaign. An awareness campaign was implemented through celebration of
    World Water Day, release of promotional and propaganda leaflets/videos, creation of a
    Webpage, general school/classroom stands with visual information, performance by
    famous singers and amateur performances by people from pilot villages. The World Water
    Day’s celebration coincided with an exchange visit accompanied by performance of
    improvising Akyn (story-tellers) and Komuz players. Akyns are very popular and respected
    in the communities, therefore these communication channel has been innovatively used to
    convey key WASH messages to villagers and decision makers. AHP made presentations
    of the project progress followed by reports of invited Raion deputy governors, directors of
    VHC, CDWUU, schools and members of parents committees. This event made good effect
    leaving positive emotions in the hearts of the participants.



                                             37
   Promotional materials included:
       Video Production. Three videos were produced and broadcast over national and Oblast
        TV: “Always wash hands”, “School toilets as seen by children” and animated graphics.
       Posters. Three types of posters were produced and devoted to solicitous attitude to
        water, proper sanitation and hygiene at the household level and the importance of
        washing hands with soap. Posters have been distributed to all pilot communities and
        displayed in schools, VHC and other public places.
       Comic books. 20 000 copies of a comic book for children “Let’s keep it clean” have
        been distributed to all schools for reading by junior students.
       Webpage. A Web-page on basic health principles developed.
       General school/classroom health points established in every school.
c) Dehelminthization. Two laboratory studies were carried out in each school, covering 25
   school students (grades 1-4) each time. As result of the first testing, 211 children were
   diagnosed with invermination, 209 of whom received medical treatment. One child from
   Ak Olon village did not receive treatment due to his change of residence to Balykchy. The
   costs of treatment with piperazine, albendazole, and mebendazole were paid by the parents.
   All persons being in contact with the infected children (parents and other family members)
   were sent to the rayon-level sanitary and epidemiological service for medical examination.
   Local family practitioners issued prescription for medical treatment of these children. In
   addition, doctors met with parents to provide detailed information regarding the need for
   re-treatment.

d) Comprehensive needs assessment performed and annual costs of expendables and
   services required for routine and limited extraordinary maintenance of WASH
   facilities in schools estimated. The analysis was conducted based on the data obtained
   from schools in the pilot villages covered by the RWSSP-2, as well as the data provided
   by the Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Health and its local units, and
   municipal authorities. The assessment of needs/ costs for expendables and services of
   medical aid points was not performed due to the decision not to construct any sanitary and
   technical facilities of the Ministry of Health (this suggestion goes beyond the context).
   According to the data of the Ministry of Education, average annual per student costs
   planned for 2013 under the standard budget financing for rural schools were KGS 6.2.
   Since the actual funding for this category of costs was 62.7%, the actual annual spending
   per student amounted to KGS 3.89. Based on the data provided by the schools, calculations
   were made for actual spending for operation and technical maintenance of WASH facilities.
   The pilot schools in Talas on average spent KGS 27.5 per student per annum for operation
   and technical maintenance of WASH infrastructure. For the purpose of comparison,
   similar data were requested from a private school in Bishkek. According to data obtained
   a private school in Bishkek spends KGS 196.6 per student per annum. According to the
   sanitary norms of the Russian Federation, average annual costs for disinfection and hygiene
   expendables, expressed in Kyrgyz Soms, amounts to KGS 287 per student per year. Thus,
   the estimated monthly costs for purchasing cleaning/ disinfection and hygiene products per
   student (based on the current local market prices) amount to KGS 23.5 (if liquid soap is

                                            38
        used) and KGS 28.7 (if bar soap is used), i.e. the costs for nine months of school would be
        KGS 211.5 and the annual costs would be KGS 258 in 2013. This data was confirmed by
        the actual costs data incurred by the school in Tuura Suu village, Ton rayon, Issyk Kul
        oblast.

   e) Strengthening the institutional framework for sustainability of WASH infrastructure
      at schools. The following activities were carried out.
    Establishment of WASH committees composed of school management, parents
      committees, VHC, CDWUU, Aiyl Okmotu, school parliament and local Kenesh members
      to assist management of schools in identifying and planning resources for financing O&M
      costs of WASH facilities; implementing activities for changing the hygienic behavior of
      students; monitoring of WASH facilities status at schools etc. Many WASH committees,
      in conjunction with parents committees, undertook to organize supplies of soap and paper
      towels and schedules of procuring hygiene items.
       Approval of Standard Operational procedures (SOP) for O&M of sanitation and hygiene
        facilities in each school from pilot villages. SOP are meant for supervision of proper
        operation and maintenance of toilets, hand-washing facilities and garbage bins. They have
        been approved by headmasters of schools and countersigned by each person in charge of
        sanitation facilities. SOP are displayed by relevant sanitation facilities in schools and/or
        offices of respective persons in charge.
       Memoranda of cooperation have been signed for maintaining adequate level of school
        sanitation and hygiene between schools, Aiyl Okmotu, CDWUU, VHC and parents
        committees. They are aimed to ensure better cooperation and coordination in the sphere of
        S&H education, sustainability of WASH facilities operation, increased public awareness
        of S&H practices both in schools and among community members.
   f) Water connections have been built in 9 schools and 144 wash-stands installed over the
      project period as part of the Healthy Nutrition Program.

COMPONENT С. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING

The principle objective if Component C was to strengthen the institutional framework and capacity
for sustainable development of water supply and sanitation sector. A summary of key
achievements in respect to the above is presented below.
   a. Development of a Sector Strategy for Water Supply and Sanitation . A State Program
      for Development of Water Supply and Sanitation (2014-2024) was prepared with intensive
      stakeholder participation, and approved by a Government Decree dated 24 September 2014.
      The Strategy was before the country’s Parliament’s for consideration at the time of the ICR
      review.

   b. Review of legislation in the field of water supply and water disposal. Review and update
      of the existing legislation regulating the sector in order to support implementation of the
      above State Sector Development Program was conducted with engagement of key
      stakeholders at national, local government, and community levels.

   c. Creation of Management Information System (MIS) database with GIS interface.
      Two MIS databases were developed for (i) water supply and sanitation sector performance
      data collection and management within DRWS; and (ii) for collection and management of
      data on parasitic diseases and water quality by the Department for Disease Prevention and
      Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision.

   d. Development of a financial model for water supply and wastewater. The Project hired
      an international consultant to design a financial model for the water supply and wastewater
      and handed it over to the Department for Drinking Water Supply and Wastewater, and
      selected Department staff were trained on the use of this model.

   e. Review technical norms and standards. The project financed the review and
      recommendations on optimization of technical standards for water supply and sanitation,
      and technical advisory support of chlorination in disinfection of potable water

   f. Capacity building for LSG bodies and CDWUUs in managing and maintaining water
      supply systems to provide population with high quality potable water supply to population;

   g. Introduction and adoption of an effective billing system at the CDWUU level. To
      improve CDWUU operations, including tariff collection, 80 sets of office equipment
      (computer, printer, stabilizer) were provided through the project, and staff trained in
      operating the billing program.

   h. Performance Agreements. A Standard Agreement between AOs and CDWUUs was
      drafted for provisioning of rural water supply services. The AOs maintained ownership of
      the rural water supply assets. Cooperation agreements for provisioning of rural water
      supply services were subsequently signed between AOs and respective CDWUUS.

   i. LSGB and CDWUU capacity building

Exchange visits
Example of effective management of water supply system and development of CDWUU is Chyrak,
Korumdu, Orgochor, Baltabai and Jele-Dobo in Issykkul Oblast. Virtually each household has
electronic water meters and water heaters installed. In order to spread successful experience,
exchange visits to Issykkul Oblast were arranged for all ARIS oblast specialists, LSGB
representatives and region CDWUUs. The participants of the exchange visit were shown
subprojects in Korumdu, Temirovka, Orgochor, Baltabai and Chyrak villages. During the
exchange visit, the participants were able to ask questions to AO head, CDWUU chairpersons,
technical supervision engineers and other project specialists. Following the exchange visit round
tables with participation of deputies of local keneshes, LSGBs, CDWUU administration bodies,
NGOs were arranged at aiyl aimak level to discuss the mechanisms of effective management of
water supply system and the improvement of relations with consumers in collection of tariffs for
use of water etc.
TO exchange experience and practice that will be useful in CDWUU capacity building and in
indicating mechanisms of improvement of water use tariff collection process, exchange visits for
local AK deputies, AO heads and CDWUUs should be arranged.
Experience in conduction of exchange visits shows high efficiency, particularly in terms of
introduction of new approaches (individual connections through water meters), setting the system
of registering of consumers and accounting of water supply.

Training.
ARIS specialists conducted assessment of CDWUU staff needs in training and capacity building.
A total 21 trainings were conducted in three oblasts. 578 people were trained in those trainings.
The training covered 159 CDWUUs of the first and second RWSSP phases. A summary of
participants is presented in the table below.

Training in water supply, engineering, water disinfection and sanitation. In line with
recommendations provided by a WB Supervision mission, in the purpose of improvement of
further activities on building the capacity of LSGBs and CDWUUs, a decision was made to hire a
consulting firm to conduct trainings and training activities. A local consultant conducted additional

                                                 41
assessment of the needs of each 37 CDWUUs and LSGBs. To conduct training, 2 training modules
were produced. The training modules consisted of two-day trainings in administrative and financial
management of CDWUUs and in relations with consumers as well as two day training in water
supply, engineering, water disinfection and sanitation. Under these modules, presentations, prior
and post tests in water supply and water disinfection were produced. Based on the produced
training modules, trainings were conducted for CDWUU and LSGB staff, deputies of local
keneshes and village activists in all 37 municipalities.
Training in accounting and operation of billing system. A three-day training was conducted in
Issyk-Kul with participation of LSGB heads, CDWUU chairpersons and accountants in all 37
municipalities. In this training, CDWUU accountants and operators underwent training in
accounting and operation of billing system. The project also prepared video lessons on key topics
of training modules that will be recorded on electronic media and sent to CDWUUs.

COMPONENT D. PROJECT MANAGEMENT

This component supported overall Project management carried out by the Community
Development and Investment Agency (ARIS) through financing of:
       Provisioning of services of independent experts for assistance in developing subprojects
        under components;
       Creation and maintaining the system of monitoring and evaluation of project effectiveness
        and outcome;
       Operational expenses of ARIS Project Management Unit;
       Annual audit of project accounts.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Methodology. The ex-ante economic analysis included in the project PAD yielded a Net Present
Value of US$12.9 million and an internal economic rate of return (EIRR) of 32 percent. The main
differences between the ex-ante and ex-post are the assumptions related to the way opportunity
costs were measured, to health benefits, and to time spent collecting water, as well as the
consideration of reductions in the cost of potable water for the households. GDP per capita was
used to quantify opportunity cost of time spent collecting water and spent sick due to waterborne
related illnesses instead of our measurement of rural income, which should be a more accurate
approach for the villages treated by the project. Improvements in infectious diarrhea were used as
a measurement of health related benefits. It was assumed that only villages lacking water service
presented cases of this condition. In the ex-post analysis, it was acknowledged that some cases of
water related diseases still occur in treated villages after the project. Also, only infectious hepatitis
and acute enteric infections were taken into account, for which there was both more complete data
and also could be more accurately linked to water conditions. Finally, the assumptions regarding
the time spent and saved collecting water overestimated the effect of the project in this dimension
when contrasted to the assessment survey results. The ex-ante analysis assumed that collection
time was 66 minutes before the project, and that it would decrease around 46 minutes. The actual
numbers obtained in the assessment surveys showed a collection time of 17 minutes and a decrease
of 9 minutes after the project.
The ex-post economic analysis includes (a) the cost of all project components, including other
donors contributions and estimated O&M costs, and (b) all measurable benefits, including: (i)
reduced time in collecting water decreases in the time spend collecting water; (ii) welfare gains at
household level associated with reduced expenditure on water storage tanks and on water treatment
(i.e. boiling water); and (iii) and reduced incidence of water related diseases such as infectious
hepatitis and acute enteric infections as a result of improved access to high quality water and
decline in the reliability on standing water sources. As with all economic analyses, the costs are
perfectly observed while the benefits are not.
Although the project investments complement investments made under the first Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSP) the Economic Analysis considers only costs and benefits
associated to the investments financed under RWSSP-2. For the Economic Analysis the evaluation
period was defined at 26 years including 6 years of project implementation, with corresponding
benefits to be realized starting on 2015. The adopted social discount rate is 12 percent and the
standard conversation factor for the cost is assessed at 0.85. All assumptions and key results are
outlined below.
Benefits: The RWSSP-2 project benefited around 83,000 people in 55 villages, by expanding
access and supplying them with better quality and more reliable water services. The project
provided financing to local communities represented by Community Drinking Water Users Unions
(CDWUUs) to rehabilitate or expand existing village water supply systems. As part of the civil
works contracts, this project also financed several improvements in sanitation facilities at schools.
Additionally, the project supported village-level promotion of healthy hygiene and sanitation
practices through technical assistance aimed at enhancing the positive health effects of the access
to better water quality. The detailed list of benefits and main assumptions can be found below:



                                                   43
        Reduced time in collecting water: Before the project, the average household spent 17
         minutes collecting water by trip. This time was lowered to 8 minutes on average 14. It is
         assumed that households make 1.5 trips on average per day, an assumption that is in
         agreement with the lowered distance between the housing units and the new pumps. This
         was also supported by anecdotal evidence from the field. A rural average hourly wage of
         US$0.6615 is used as a measurement of the opportunity cost of this time savings. Under
         these assumptions, the project is generating annual benefits of USD 1,626,075 from
         economic gains of saving time to collect water.

        Reduced coping costs: At the time of appraisal, it was a common practice for households
         to boil water prior to consuming it. Also, a large percentage of households invested in water
         tanks for security of supply. The analysis assumes that approximately 20 percent of
         households forgo investments in water tanks following the project due to improved water
         services. Water storage tanks cost US$250 in the country and a depreciation of around 5%
         a year is assumed to calculate the future annual savings implied by not purchasing new
         tanks. Energy savings associated with reduced need to boil water due to improved water
         quality are estimated based on a 10 liters per capita per day benchmark. According to the
         household survey 42 percent of households used to boil water before consuming, this
         practice fell to 21 percent after the project. Well established benchmarks for the regions
         are used in terms of energy requirements to boil water (0.09 KhW per liter of water) and
         an economic cost of 0.27 dollars per KhW 16 . Under these assumptions the project is
         expected to generate annual benefits of USD 2,123,358 from energy savings linked to
         boiling water and USD75,000 due to reduced investments in water storage tanks.

        Benefits associated with lower incidence of water related or waterborne illnesses. Prior
         to the project the incidence of waterborne diseases in benefiting villages was high. The
         economic analysis focuses on infectious hepatitis and acute enteric infections, conditions
         commonly associated with poor water quality. The incidence of infectious hepatitis went
         from affecting 0.38% of the population to 0.22% after the project implementation. The
         incidence of acute enteric infections went from 0.20% to 0.12%, equivalent to a 40 percent
         decrease in illness incidence17. The first quantifiable benefit comes from a decrease in the
         days lost due to these illnesses. With an average of 10 days lost per person for each case,
         the reduction in the incidence resulted in savings of around US$ 14,045 (pricing each day
         using the rural wage as before). The second quantifiable benefit is the reduction in
         expenditure to treat these illnesses. Taking an average cost of treatment of US$88 before
         the project and US$92 after the project for acute enteric infections, and US$151 before and
         after the project for infectious hepatitis, give a total annual savings of US$ 33,911 due to
         the decrease in the incidence.

Direct or indirect benefits from the activities in component C and D were not taken into account,
as they are difficult to measure.
Costs: All project costs, including Components A, B, D and front end fees were applied in the
economic analysis. DFID financing and IDA credit and grant were included. It was assumed that
annual O&M costs were equal to 5% percent of the total investment costs (component A and the
sanitary facilities portion of component B), net of VAT. These costs were adjusted by a standard
conversion factor of 0.85, as mentioned above.
Results: Based on these assumptions the total estimated annual benefits of the project are
US$ 3,872,389, yielding an ERR of 15% and a NPV of US$ 1,890,648.
Efficiency: The RWSSP-2 has low per capita investment cost of USD 163 per capita. This is
particularly good given the low population density of the area.

108. The estimated ERR at ICR was 15% and the NPV was US$$1,890,648, assuming a social
discount rate of 12% and 26 years of asset life, including 6 years of project implementation, with
corresponding benefits to be realized starting in 2015. The analysis reveals that actual economic
indicators (ERRs) are much lower than those projected during appraisal. Given the conservative
assumptions used (low skill wages, low number of daily trips), and the fact that no benefits could
be accounted for part of the activities of component B, and all of the activities of component C and
D, the project’s NPV and ERR are in fact expected to be even higher than those estimated.
Additionally, the project has relatively low per capita investment costs of about US$ 163 per capita.
This is considered to be reasonable given the low population density of the project area. Based on
these results, combined with the need for an additional 17 months to complete implementation of
investments, the efficiency of the project is considered to be Moderate compared with the ex-ante
analysis conducted at appraisal.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

There was no beneficiary survey conducted for the project. However an Impact Evaluation
Study was carried out. A summary of the study, its methodology and key findings is presented
below.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY

Goals of the survey

      Assessment of access of villagers to drinking water in project impact zones (component
       1)
      Assessment of sustainability of village public unions of consumers of drinking water
       (further CDWUU) as an instrument designed to provide access to drinking water
       (component 2)
      Assessment of sanitary-hygiene practices in rural areas (component 3)

The following tasks were carried out to achieve the survey goals:

Component 1

      Quality, quantity and reliability assessment of drinking water supply based on
       consumers’ feedback .
      Assessment of satisfaction level of beneficiaries with the supply of drinking water.
      Assessment of potential project impact on the welfare and lifestyle level of
       beneficiaries, as well as on their health.
      Beneficiaries’ feedback assessment about work of CDWUU and questions about local
       water resource management

Component 2
   Assessment of management efficiency (fee collection, maintenance of water supply
     systems, staff turnover, support from Ayil Okmotu, MPs, allocation of funds from local
     budget, potential of the employees) of CDWUU in supply of villagers with drinking
     water.
   Assessment of readiness of villager to pay for good quality water and regular drinking
     water supply by CDWUU.
   Assessment of the level of cost cover of exploitation and technical maintenance of
     CDWUU water supply systems (CDWUU budgets, AO and other resources)

Component 3

      Assessment of sanitary-hygiene education in schools
      Assessment of improvements of sanitary-hygiene conditions in schools.
      Public awareness assessment about issues with water, sanitary and hygiene.


Methodology
Quantitative and qualitative survey methods were used to achieve the survey goals. They
included the following.
                                             49
3.1 Quantitative survey of households

Survey geography

   The survey area included 25 villages of Issyk-Kul, Naryn, and Talas oblasts, covered by
    the project. The list of villages was provided by the Client.
   The control included 25 villages of Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Talas oblasts not covered by the
    project. The list of non-project villages included those villages which, based on information
    from the Client, didn’t have WSS located in the proximity of project villages, and which
    are of the approximately same population. The list was agreed with Client.

Survey sample. As part of the quantitative research, 888 respondents were surveyed: 444 in
project impact villages (further project villages) and the rest in villages not impacted by the
project (further non-project villages).

Survey object. Selection of households was done using routing sampling method in accordance
with steps calculated using the formula: selection step=households number/sample size.

Survey respondents. Respondents included heads of households, or members of households that
were 18 years old and above, who are responsible for the payment of municipal services and
solving issues related to them.

Survey subjects: Subjects covered included opinions, thoughts and assessments of respondents
based on their personal experience with regard to the survey topic.

Survey duration: 20.08-20.09.14


3.2 Focus group discussions (FGDs). In order to obtain contextual information about changes
initiated by the project, 12 FGDs were conducted in participating communities. Each FGD consisted
of 8-10 people. This number of FG participants is optimal to allow all participants express their
thoughts on each question. Target groups of FG:
         Group 1 – villagers, residing in households with in-house/in-yard connections
         Group 2 – villagers, residing in households and using public water taps/no-users of
          VWSS
         Group 3 – leaders of villages and specialists: AO employees, CDWUU, educational and
          medical institutions.

66 residents of project villages and 34 specialists – employees of AO, CDWUU, MP of Ayil
Kenesh, workers of education and medical institutions, representatives of public organization,
village leaders participated in the FGDs

3.3 Expert interviews.

   Survey geography: project villages of Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Talas oblasts

       Survey objects:

    -     Executives or representatives of CDWUU executives (1 for each village, 25 interviews)
    -     Informed AO or Ayil Kenesh representatives (one for each village, 25 interviews in
          total)


                                                50
Summary of results presented in the survey report

1. Results of the research showed that in general the goals of RWSSP-2 were achieved.

2. 86% of HH have access to WSS services, 85% use it as the main source. In eleven project
   villages covered by the survey, all residents have access to WSS services. Mainly only
   those HH are not covered by the WSS services that are located in new settlements and in
   further settlements where RWSSP2 activities are not planned

3. After rehabilitation of WSS under RWSSP-2, the process of in-house/in-yard installations
   have started and are still going on. The share of HH that have installed in-house/in-yard
   connections that use tap water as the main source of drinking water, compared to 2012 has
   increased from 9% up to 43%. The main obstacle in installing in-house/in-yard connections
   is the relatively high installation costs.

4. In project villages in comparison with 2012, the share of those HH that use open sources
   of water for drinking and cooking has significantly decreased from 29% down to 5%. In
   non-project villages the share of such HH is 23% and the situation during the last three
   years has not changed.

5. As a result of RWSSP2 activities for the households residing in project villages and using
   WSS services, the distance to the main source of drinking water has significantly decreased.
   During 2012 and 2014 the share of HH – WSS service users that deliver drinking water
   from the sources that are located at distance less than 100 m has increased from 47% up to
   77%. The share of those HH for whom the distance to water pipes is more than 500m has
   decreased from 7% down to 0.3%.

6. Since the distance until the closest source of drinking water has decreased and in general
   the quality of water supply has improved (the water supply interruption has decreased and
   the water supply pressure has increased), HH-WSS service users residing in project villages
   are now spending less time on delivery of water. The average time that HH used to spend
   on delivery of water, in comparison with 2012 has decreased from 17 minutes to 8 minutes.
   Also the physical load on women and children, who are usually responsible for the delivery
   of water, has decreased.

7. The majority of HH WSS service users in project villages (77%) think that the tap water
   that they use for drinking and cooking is of good or very good quality. This is confirmed
   by the water quality checks that are conducted by sanitary-epidemiological stations as per
   agreements made with CDWUU. During 2012 and 2014 56 checks were conducted and the
   results showed that the quality of tap water meets the national norms. The share of HH that
   think that they use very good and good quality water, in comparison with 2012, has
   increased from 47% up to 77%. For comparison, in non-project villages only 19% of HH
   think that the consumed water are of good and best quality, and in comparison with 2012
   the situation hasn’t changed. 70% of HH that do not use tap water have noted that water
   they use for drinking and cooking is not clean and muddy

8. Because the quality of drinking water has improved, the share of HH that improve the
   quality of water prior to using it has decreased. 81% of HH-WSS service users who are
   residing in project villages consume tap water without pre-treating it. The share of has
   increased by 12% in comparison with 2012. For comparison, 88% of households that do

                                             51
   not use WSS services have to pre-treat water by boiling or settling it. The practice of using
   filters and disinfectant means is not popular in surveyed villages.

9. WSS services users resident in project villages note the increase of water supply pressure
   in water pipes after RWSSP2 activities were completed. The share of HH that rate the
   supply pressure in pipes as good and very good has increased during 2012 and 2014 from
   36% up to 53%. As per opinion of survey participant the main reason of decrease of supply
   pressure is the usage of drinking water for the irrigation purposes in spring and summer.

10. During 2012 and 2014 the duration of water supply interruption decreased. The share of
    HH – WSS service users – that are residing in project villages and who have access to
    drinking water 12 hours or more per day, has increased over the last three years from 63%
    to 83%.

11. Since the WSS rehabilitation works were completed relatively recently the interruptions in
    water supply related to failure of WSS occur rarely and are fixed by CDWUU employees
    quite promptly. The reasons of interruption in water supply in most of the cases have
    seasonal character. In spring and summer the interruptions in water supply occur because
    of usage of drinking water for irrigation purposes. In 2014 the problem in shortage of
    irrigation water got worse because the summer was a drought.

12. Expansion of coverage with in-house/in-yard connection, and the improved quality of
    water supply services mean that most HH have no need in reserving drinking water. In
    2012 the share of HH of project villages that reserve water was higher than in non-project
    villages – 87% and 81% respectively. In 2014 in comparison with 2012 in non-project
    villages the share of HH that reserve water and the average volume of reserved water almost
    hasn’t changed, whereas in project villages the share of HH that reserve water has
    decreased until 68% of HH. The average volume of reserved water in project villages has
    decreased from 40 liters down to 32 liters. The main reason why the majority of HH – WSS
    service users, residing in project villages (56%) - reserve water is the absence of water
    pipes.

13. Implementation of RWSSP2 has improved living quality of residents of project villages.
    Survey participants have noted that their living conditions are similar to urban life
    standards. Connection to WSS provides the possibility to install water heaters, shower
    cabins, baths, flush toilets, laundry machines and build saunas. This way the sanitary-
    hygiene conditions of HH living conditions are improving.

14. It should be noted that women, who carry most of the workload in housekeeping duties,
    had felt the impact after implementation of RWSSP2. Also, the time spent for water
    delivery has decreased. Using home appliances and existence of communal comforts
    decreases the time and physical load on housekeeping.

15. Attempts to teach sanitation and hygiene principles sometimes cause misunderstanding and
    hostility among the population because it is believed that these rules are known to
    everybody. However, the survey revealed that regardless of the fact that 100% of HH noted
    that they use soap to wash hands, particularly after visiting toilets, the share of HH that had
    no soap available by wash sinks at the time of the survey was 21%.


                                               52
16. Activities to inform the population about following sanitation and hygiene principles were
    conducted in all project villages in the form of seminars and trainings. 74% of HH residing
    in project villages, during last year received information about improving hygiene in HH.
    In all project villages village health committees deal with informing population.

17. Survey participants note that after implementation of RWSSP2, the attitude of villagers to
    sanitation and hygiene have changed – they pay more attention to cleanliness of toilets and
    using toilet paper etc. Special attention is paid to following rules of hygiene in schools: for
    instance, class meetings take place, containers with liquid soap are installed; wet wipes and
    toilet paper are purchased, etc.

18. After conducting rehabilitation of rural WSS under RWSSP2, all schools in surveyed
    villages have received uninterrupted access to drinking water. At the moment of preparing
    the report, in schools of 22 villages wash sinks were installed to wash hands, and in
    seventeen schools – water heaters.

19. Facilities to wash hands (basins and sinks) are available in all schools of project villages.
    The vast majority of them are located within the school near to canteen. Basin to wash
    hands near toilets is only available in one school for now.

20. Improved access to high quality drinking water supply services, as well as information on
    sanitation and hygiene contributed to a decrease in the incidence of infections related to
    the quality of drinking water in project villages. Thus, from information provided by Ayil
    Okmotus, there were no infection cases in 2014 related to quality of drinking water, where
    in 2012 in project villages there were 137 incidence of infecting with hepatitis A.

21. Participation in RWSSP2 allowed the strengthening of human resource capacity of
    CDWUUs. During 2012 and 2014 the staff members of CDWUU had increased by one
    third in general and have technical personnel. More than half of the CDWUU employees
    went through trainings under RWSSP2: 51% of CDWUU employees were trained in
    collection fees, technical training on servicing the system received 55%

22. Participation in RWSSP2 allowed increasing financial sustainability of CDWUU. Main
    statement of income of CDWUU budgets is collection of tariff from individuals and legal
    entities. By providing uninterrupted water supply by exploiting rehabilitated/newly built
    WSS, the CDWUU will have constant source of income of financial means.

23. Currently majority of WSS subscribers make payments per number of HH members. Only
    18HH have water meters installed in their houses. Coverage of population with in-house/in-
    yard connection with preinstalled water meters would allow measuring and controlling
    water consumption and compare with the amount tariffs. The obstacles in installing water
    meters may be the cost of water meter and fear that after installing the meter the WSS
    service fee payments will significantly increase.

24. Running WSS and installation of tariffs on WSS service would allow the setting up wages
    in 12 CDWUU, where in 2012 employees used to work voluntarily. Under RWSSP2 all
    CDWUU in surveyed villages received computers with software to keep billing system of
                                             53
   accounting payments, and they are installing the system for their practice. Beside
   advantages that this billing system has compared to manual accounting, it should be noted
   that population trusts to automated calculations more.

25. Social status and relevance of CDWUUs in village communities have increased. The
    majority of HH (89%) in project villages trust CDWUUs in solving village water supply
    issues, and 75% rate their work as good and very good.

26. Along with the achieved success in CDWUU activities, serious problems occurred. The
    main problem is the existence of debts on payment for tariffs by individuals. Twenty
    CDWUUs out of twenty five, at the time the survey was conducted, had debts from
    individuals. Consequently, CDWUUs suffer from shortage of funds for maintenance of
    WSS, purchase of tools and materials. Moreover, because of low wages and delays in
    payment, difficulties occur in attracting skilled professional and the employee turnover is
    high.

27. The stability of the water supply systems is dependent on how correctly and promptly
    CDWUUs perform technical servicing. It was found that in seven CDWUUs there are no
    plans of technical maintenance.

    I.      Project Description
    A. Background and Rationale
Kyrgyz Republic, a small and land-locked country, has a population of 5.8 million, of who 66%
are residing in rural area. Since independence the country has pursued a determined policy of
privatization and market development.
The Kyrgyz Republic faces substantial challenges in rebuilding basic infrastructure in rural
areas. Since the collapse of the former Soviet Union, there has been rapid deterioration in the
availability and quality of basic public services. Services once taken for granted (drinking water,
solid waste collection, treatment, etc.) are often available only intermittently or not available at
all. Steady deterioration in the quality of services has led to public health hazards.
Today, after more than twenty years of severe neglect, large portions of local service
infrastructure, installations, and equipment have deteriorated beyond repair and need to be
rebuilt or replaced entirely if service delivery is to be restored to minimally acceptable levels.
The capacity of local governments in providing infrastructure services is limited by lack of
available fiscal resources, weak institutions that are unable to function under such constrained
environment, and utilities that are unable to cope with the rapidly deteriorating infrastructure.
An important factor in the current conditions is that as part of the Kyrgyz Republic's move
towards decentralization, responsibility for the delivery of most basic local public services was
turned over to local self governments (LSGs) in the mid 1990's. Most LSGs were then – and
continue to be today - unable to assume the new responsibilities due to the lack of necessary
fiscal resources, technical means, and institutional capacities.
The Kyrgyz Government policy aimed at improving provision of quality infrastructure services
and decentralization of governance in the country identified the relevance of the Project.
Infrastructure facilities and services offered to the public by government agencies before
became, first, an integral part of the local authorities’ responsibility, and secondly - the critical
state of infrastructural facilities required an immediate rehabilitation and reconstruction
In this regard, improving access to quality infrastructure services and rehabilitation of
infrastructure facilities in villages has become one of the most important social tasks of the
Government. It should be noted that before the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(RWSSP-1 and RWSSP-2 none of investment projects was involved in providing access and
rehabilitation of infrastructure facilities. Four problem and six new subprojects under RWSSP-
2 plus 26 problem subprojects continuing from RWSSP Phase 1 have been selected.
Through improvement of rural water supply and capacity building, the project has created good
preconditions for sustainable development of CDWUU and further independent solving of
problems in water supply sector. The Project was the first initiative that supported upgrading
infrastructure in villages at the national level as part of the decentralized governance framework.
    B. Overall assessment of the Project objectives and tasks

The Second Rural Water Supply and sanitation Project focused its efforts in 55 villages of
Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Talas Oblasts. The Project beneficiaries were the villages’ residents, rural
water supply systems, sanitation facilities in schools, local self-government bodies, NGOs and
the Project partners.

The key Project objective was to improve access for participating communities to safe
potable water; improved sanitation and hygiene practices in the rural area at individual,
household and institutional level; strengthen institutional framework and capacity for further
sustainable development of the water supply and sanitation sector.

This objective was achieved by (a) financing the rehabilitation rural water supply systems and
construction of sanitation facilities in the schools; (b) improving sanitation and hygiene
practices at individual and household level; and (c) assisting local governments in increasing
the effectiveness of the WSS sector management.
The urgency of the key objective of RWSSP-2 did not diminish over the Project
implementation; on the opposite, given the deterioration of the existing infrastructure it became
even more important. The same is true about the tasks set for achievement of this objective.
Successful achievement of the project goals built on the following approaches:
First, decentralized approach to utilization of investment. This has contributed to increased
accountability of local self-government bodies, participation of community members in
decision making regarding the use of investments.
Second, supervision of subprojects by local governments enabled to improve the quality of
works and monitor the material investments provided.
In third, necessary trainings were delivered for local government bodies and CDWUU as part
of institutional development activities. The Project assisted CDWUU in improving their
performance efficiency in delivering local infrastructure services and contributed to
strengthening their capacity to implement further reforms.
Components addressed three critical tasks:
These included management of rehabilitated facilities, rehabilitation of water supply and
sanitation facilities, improvement and strengthening the CDWUU capacity.
The positive results achieved under the project in improving access to water supply services
were limited to zones (areas) of specific beneficiaries residence in the area of rehabilitation
works. It impeded to fully cover and solve the problem of drinking water in some villages.
There is a need for improvement of the CDWUU technical status, reconstruction of facilities
and networks, and improvement of management efficiency. This would enable to better address
the challenges faced by the Government. Given the critical state of the drinking water supply
systems in villages at the beginning of the project, the project involved villages for
rehabilitation of head water intakes and replacement of equipment. Due to limited resources,
the project did not provide for complete rehabilitation and construction of water supply systems
in villages.
The assets of water supply systems have been handed over to the municipal ownership of Aiyl
Okmotu.
    II.    Evaluation of implementation
    B. Project results by components

For instance, one of the project achievements and success is that 100% of water connections in
Korumdu, Jele-Dobo and Baltabay have meters.
Maintenance equipment
Computers for CDWUU
For improvement of CDWUU subscriber awareness and fee collection, in 2013-2014 ARIS
procured and handed over to CDWUU 80 sets of computer equipment (PC, multifunctional
devices, UPS devices) for introduction of billing system. All 80 CDWUU provided with
equipment have been trained. The CDWUU chairpersons and accountants received training in
introducing and operating the billing system. They noted that this system was very user-
friendly and accessible to use.
Personal safety apparel for water disinfection
In order to ensure safe water supply and to assist in improving disinfection of water by
chlorination, a need emerged to provide CDWUU with primary means of protection during
chlorination process. So, 35 CDWUU have been provided with personal protection means such
as overalls, gloves, caps, masks, goggles, rubber boots. In addition, each of 35 CDWUU
received 50 kg of hypochloride for water disinfection.
Computers and laboratory equipment for Department of Disease Prevention and State
Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance (SES – sanitary and epidemiological service)
Technical assistance has been provided to SES by supplying computers and laboratory
equipment in order to improve the SES capacity and performance in the water supply and
sanitation sector.
One of the areas for capacity building is support to improvement of Raion SES for water quality
control and monitoring of parasitic diseases. For this purpose, ARIS developed a database with
relevant software that will be placed on the Department’s Web-page. Also, to operate the
database ARIS procured and handed over computer equipment to the Department. The list of
equipment includes 30 sets of PC and office equipment (system block, monitor, multifunctional
device, UPS) and a server for database. The database is introduced both for Central Department
and its units in Bishkek and 13 target Raion services under RWSSP-2.
All specialists from 13 Raion pilot SES received training in database and started introducing
this system at the central and Raion level.
Equipment for water tests has been procured for 13 pilot Raion SES laboratories for the total of
59 178 USD SES specialists have been trained locally to operate the equipment.
Special machinery
The Project provided special machinery for water supply systems operation including 7 diggers,
30 tricycles (motor scooters), 60 kits of equipment and tools and 60 generators for the total of
USD 298 090. So, special machinery and equipment have been supplied to 63 CDWUU.
Detailed designs, studies, preparation of bidding documents and technical supervision
A contract with OJSC Design Institute “Kyrgyzgiprostroy” was signed on January 26, 2012 for
preparation of detailed designs for procurement of construction works for rehabilitation of 26
problem subprojects in the villages of Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Talas Oblasts. Specialists of design
institute inspected 26 these subprojects of Phase 1 in Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Talas.
An agreement between ARIS and the Department of Disease Prevention and State Sanitary and
Epidemiological Surveillance was signed and cost estimates were prepared for laboratory tests
of 16 potable water sources in 26 sub-projects.

Because of high workload for the Design Institute detailed designs for some problem
subprojects were delayed.
ARIS engineers prepared cost estimates and excluded works tables for 13 problematic
subprojects and sent to the Bank for review. During preparation of BoQ for four subprojects
(Tort-Kul, Arashan, Kalba, Yntymak) modifications were introduced according to
recommendations of the Bank’s consultants i.e. orifices were replaced by pressure reducing
valves in the design. Also, pre-bid conference was held where the bidders had an opportunity
to learn more details of bidding documents including materials and equipment to be applied for
the works.
Meetings held with AO and CDWUU representatives were devoted to water economy, loss
reduction, replacement of street standpipes by household connections, installation of meters
and proper operation of submersible well pumps; mitigation the risk of repeated bidding and
singing of agreements between ARIS and Aiyl Okmotu.
Prior to bidding advertisement and because of limited resources, upon additional review of
market cost for works the design institute together with ARIS engineers prepared detailed
design estimates and BoQs for completed 13 problematic subprojects.
Modifications to specific types of works not requiring qualification / experience were
introduced in detailed designs and BoQ for 13 problematic subprojects. In addition, agreements
were prepared and signed between ARIS and AO for performing such works.
The detailed designs approval procedure for 13 problematic subprojects brought to delay with
advertisement of biddings for works.
Designs of sanitation facilities were provided for construction as agreed with UNICEF.
Meetings were held with ARIS engineers to discuss designs of sanitary facilities to be used
under RWSSP-2.
On February 28’2014, ARIS distributed requests to 36 AO covered by the Project whether they
were interested in construction/rehabilitation of sanitation facilities at schools as part of RWSSP-
2.
As of March 14, applications were received from 49 schools of 36 participating AO. Members
of selection committee reviewed applications received from AO, documents of 49 schools,
photographs of sanitation facilities status, letters of guarantee from AO on willingness to
contribute 5% cofinancing and intention to increase financing for WSS, existence and operation
of school parliaments and Parents’ Committees as well as sanitation and hygiene education plan
for schools.
In preparation of school in-door sanitation facilities rehabilitation designs, three engineering
consultants were hired to prepare self-assessment forms for sanitation works in selected schools
of Naryn, Talas and Issyk-Kul. The Consultants prepared BOQ, technical specifications and
drawings. Standard-type schools with in-door sanitation facilities were selected from the three
pilot Oblasts for rehabilitation.
Based on applications received and in line with evaluation criteria, 10 schools were selected for
construction of outdoor sanitation works and 8 schools for rehabilitation of in-door facilities
(toilets and washstands).
As a result, outdoor facilities were built at 10 schools and 8 schools had their in-door sanitation
facilities rehabilitated.
On-site technical supervision of subprojects was provided by ARIS supervisors and by AO
technical supervisors while AO (Clients) kept continuous control over the quality of civil works.
Author’s supervision of the sanitation works construction at 10 schools was delivered by the
Contractor, Musai Ltd. who developed the detailed designs.

Environmental management
Monitoring of environmental activities has been held during subprojects implementation on a
regular basis viz. impact on land, surface/ground waters, air. Necessary impact mitigation
measures have been taken: construction sites brought to proper conditions by cleaning up from
wastes, installing garbage bins and toilets. Special areas have been arranged for construction
machinery.
Environmental preservation checklist has been developed and included activities and
requirements to contractors for avoiding, mitigating and diminishing adverse environmental
impact during the subprojects implementation.
Operational safety
Monitoring of operational safety measures showed that fire safety was secured in due manner.
Operational safety instruction logs were available at the construction sites. Workers had special
protective clothes, boots, helmets and gloves. There were also first-aid kits available at the sites.
The sites have been kept clean and safe conditions in order to avoid incidents.
Component В. Program on sanitary and hygiene education
Agreement for implementation of this component has been signed between ARIS and UNICEF
on June 17, 2013.
Activities have been completed under this component for pilot villages at the community and
school level. The entire work in the pilot communities has been aimed to social mobilization in
order to involve people in improvement of sanitation and hygiene practices at the
school/household level.
Establishing stakeholders and their involvement in the Project
    Establishing of stakeholders was at both Oblast and local level. For Oblast level, it
       included workshops in the capitals of three pilot Oblasts. Participants were represented
       by Raion governors / officials, education departments, Raion Family Practitioners
       centers, Raion SES, heads of AO from pilot areas, managers of Raion CDWUU
       associations and Raion health committees. The workshops adopted a resolution to
       support the Project activities.
       At the local level, meetings have been held in the pilot villages inviting community
        members, partners from NGO and government authorities, RHC, CDWUU, rural clinics,
        Aiyl Kenesh members Aiyl Okrug members being 2156 people altogether including
        1100 men and 1056 women.
Sanitation and hygiene promotion in communities
Sanitation and hygiene have been promoted in the communities by training of community
members in PHAST method and training of students using UNICEF methodology for WASH
in Schools.
Community training has been delivered in two stages. Stage 1 covered VHC members during
two-day training by PHAST method, 556 VHC members in total represented by 427 women
and 129 men from 55 pilot villages.
During second stage the VHC trained members of all households in pilot villages. 30101
participants have been trained in total.

hygienic behavior, UNICEF handed over a hand-washing demonstration kit GloGerm.
Social mobilization in pilot communities
Social mobilization in pilot villages has been carried out in various ways such as:
      Community meetings in the beginning and upon completion of the project in each of
       pilot villages. As a result, stakeholders were established at the village level.
      Exchange visits between villages.
           o In Issyk-Kul, exchange visit took place on March 5’2014 in secondary school
             named after K.Tailakov, Tuura-Suu village of Ton Raion. It invited heads of
             Aiyl Okmotu, Aiyl Kenesh members, school management, CDWUU, parents’
             committees and VHC from pilot villages hosting 110 participants including 55
             women. The visit showed that it could be possible to maintain school toilets in
             proper condition and ensure access to water for students.
           o Naryn. Exchange visit dedicated to World Water Day took place on March
             22’2014 in Kazybek village (At-Bashy Raion) and on March 23’2014 in Bash-
             Kuugandy village, Jumgal Raion. Exchange visits included around 100
             participants.

       personal hygiene rules, frequency of changing underwear and bedclothes for a child
       treated oxyuricide, mobilization of local resources to ensure adequate financing of
       O&M costs for WASH facilities. Many parents began realizing the need for financial
       support to schools for maintaining the WASJ infrastructure.
      Working with school parliaments. Each school’s parliament has been invoked to
       introduce WASH principles. This included revival of sanitary assistants elected out of
       students. Jointly with parliaments the sanitary assistants organized contests for “Most
       Clean Classroom”, monitored the appearances and tidiness of students/classrooms, held
       Saturday cleaning days around schools, contests of paintings, essays and newspapers
       devoted to “Water, Sanitation and Hygiene”. Results of contests have been summarized
       and highlighted at school lineups.

Laboratory tests of 25 students (1-4 grades) from each school have been taken twice under
Component B. The first testing revealed 211 children of which 209 were treated. 1 child from
Ak-Olon village was not treated due to moving to Balykchy. Treatment costs have been paid
by parents, with Piperazine, Albendazol and Mebendazole medicines. All contacted persons
(parents and members of infested childrens’ households) have been sent to Raion SES for
medical survey. In Naryn, one child was not found because of wrong personal data provided.
68 child infestation cases have been revealed during second test. Specialists of rural clinics
prescribed treatment for those children. In addition, meetings have been held with their parents
to explain the need for repeated treatment.
Comprehensive analysis of needs and annual costs for consumables and services required
for routine and limited extraordinary maintenance of proposed water, sanitation and
hygiene facilities in schools and health points
The analysis has been made on the basis of data obtained from schools in RWSSP-2 pilot
villages, Ministry of Education and Science (MoES), Ministry of Health and its local units and
from municipalities. The needs/costs analysis of consumables and services has not been carried
out for health points due to the decision not to construct sanitation facilities therein.
According to MoES, in 2013 within the standard budgetary financing, the average expenses in
rural schools consisted of 6.2 Som per student per year. Since actual percentage allocation of
these expenses in 2013 was estimated at 62.7% of this budget, the actual average expenses in
rural schools totalled to 3.89 Som per student per year.
Based on data obtained from schools actual O&M costs for WASH facilities have been
estimated. In the pilots schools of Talas Oblast, 27.5 Som per student per year have been spent
for operation and maintenance of WASH infrastructure on average. For comparative analysis,
similar information has been requested from one the private schools in Bishkek according to
which the school spends 196.6 Som per student per year. According to the Russian Federation’s
sanitary standards, average annual expenses for household goods, disinfectants and health
goods as converted to Kyrgyz Som, were 287 Som per student per year.
Thus, estimated need in cash for purchase of household goods, cleaning / disinfectant agents
and hygiene items per student per month (current local market prices) is 23.5 Som (using liquid
soap) and 28.7 Som (solid soap). With nine academic months the amount needed was 211.5
Som and 258 Som for whole year of 2013, respectively. These data correlate with and are
validated by actual expenditures of the secondary school in Tuura-Suu Village, Ton Raion,
Issyk-Kul.
Establishing institutional framework for sustainability of WASH infrastructure at schools
      Establishment of WASH committees composed of school management, parents
       committees, VHC, CDWUU, Aiyl Okmotu, school parliament and local Kenesh
       members. Objectives of WASH committees were to assist management of schools in
       identifying and planning resources for financing O&M costs of WASH facilities;
       implementing activities for changing the hygienic behavior of students; monitoring of
       WASG facilities status at schools etc. Many WASH committees, in conjunction with
       parents committees, undertook to organize supplies of soap and paper towels and
       schedules of procuring hygiene items.
      Approval of Standard Operational procedures (SOP) for O&M of sanitation and hygiene
       facilities in each school from pilot villages. SOP are meant for supervision of proper
       operation and maintenance of toilets, hand-washing facilities and garbage bins. They
       have been approved by headmasters of schools and countersigned by each person in
       charge of sanitation facilities. SOP are displayed by relevant sanitation facilities in
       schools and/or offices of respective persons in charge.

Component С. Institutional capacity building
The principle objective if Component “Institutional capacity building” is to build the capacity
of institutional framework and capacity for sustainable development of water supply and
sanitation sector. To achieve the objective, the component includes the following goals and
activities:
      Support development of the Water Supply, Water Disposal and Sanitation Sector
       Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic;
      Review legislation in the field of water supply and water disposal;
      Create database and GIS interface;
      Develop national financial model for water supply and water disposal development;
      Advisory support of chlorination in disinfection of potable water;
      Review technical norms and standards in the field of water supply and sanitation;
      Build the capacity of LSG bodies and CDWUUs in managing and maintaining water
       supply systems to provide population with high quality potable water supply to
       population.
Support of development of the Water Supply, Water Disposal and Sanitation Sector
Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic
1 June 2012, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic issued an Order No 239-p “On
establishment of an Interagency Working Group on development of a Program (Strategy) for
development of water supply and water disposal in residential areas in the Kyrgyz Republic”.
To assist to the Working Group, a draft action plan was prepared for development of the
Program together with a preliminary structure and list of matters that might be included in the
draft Program as well as proposals on methodology and approaches to Program development.
To discuss and produce proposals to be included in the draft Sector Development Program,
round tables were arranged in the regions with participation of stakeholders- LSG bodies,
CDWUUs and NGOs from all oblasts. Following the round tables, proposals were collected
and sent for review by the Interagency Strategy Development Working Group.

In the purpose of development of the Draft State Program for development of water supply and
water disposal in residential areas in the Kyrgyz Republic 2014-2024, a consultant was selected
who produced the Draft Program based on review and analysis of documents and incorporating
the results of workshops, meetings and consultations with the representatives of stakeholders.
Draft State Program for development of water supply and water disposal in residential areas in
the Kyrgyz Republic 2014-2024, produced with the Project’s support, was approved by the
Decreed Government of the Kyrgyz Republic dated 24 September 2014 and sent for the
Parliament’s consideration.
Review of legislation in water supply and water disposal sector
To support implementation of the State WSWD Sector Development Program, the Project
envisaged review and analysis of the current legislation regulating the sector. In this regard, a
Local consultant was selected. Following analysis of legislation for potable water supply, the
Consultant identified discrepancies, gaps and deficiencies in regulations. In review and analysis
of legislation, a number of meetings and discussions with DWSWD and member of the
Working Group, whereupon recommendations on improvement of legislation for potable water
                                               74
                                        BORROWER ICR

supply were provided for more effective implementation of the State Program for development
of water supply and water disposal in residential areas. Final report, based on legislation review,
incorporating recommendations on harmonization of regulations in the sector, was sent for
review to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, particularly to the SAAC and DWSWD.
With adaption of the State WSWD Sector Development Program, the activity on revision and
development of new regulations mentioned in the report started.
Development of sector database and GIS interface
International Consultant for development of the State WSWD Sector Development strategy
provided indicators of sector performance and service quality as well as a questionnaire for data
collection and the guidelines for filling the questionnaire. The indicator and questionnaire were
discussed and agreed with DWSWD and Working Group. In compliance with the
recommendations provided by the Review Mission of the World Bank, a decision was made to
hire a consulting firm for collection of data, creation of database and GIS interface. In total,
817 were collected. All of them were entered in the database. The Consultant also developed
software of the database: module for entering and displaying data through web-interface,
desktop application for data entering and GIS interface for cartographical displaying of data.
Besides, an addendum to the Contract signed with the consultant for development of similar
database for the Department for disease prevention and sanitary and epidemiological
supervision was drafted and signed in the purpose of supervision and monitoring of parasitic
diseases and water quality. Therefore, two databases and GIS interface for DWSWD and SES
were developed and introduced under the project.
Development of national financial model for WSWD sector development
To develop financial model for WSWD sector development, tender was conducted and contract
signed with international consultant company “Aspiro”. The Consultant collected information
and assessed the current situation, developed an investment plan based on the working financial
model. This financial model will serve as an objective, transparent and updatable tool to get a
plan for investment to the sector that will ensure a basis for investment in 5 and 10-year cycles
(and further) of development planning as well as of annual budgeting.
The model also reflects conclusions and discrepancies between the hands-on experience and
the consequences caused by a certain service provisioning investment strategy. Therefore, the
model serves as a prompt message to make real the improvements and upgrades in the sector in
the process of implementation at state, oblast, and raion levels.
Sector investment plan combined with the investment model may enable the water supply sector
of the Kyrgyz Republic to analyze financial consequences upon achievement of targets set forth
in the current and future strategies. Besides, there is an opportunity to get a feasible tool for
monitoring to compare the objectives with achievements in various subsectors and oblasts.
Additionally, the model may ensure the ways of mitigation of discrepancies in allocation of
funds between subsectors and categories of population (i.e. between water supply and sanitation,
or between city and village) to extend cooperation within the sector.
This financial model was provided to DWSWD accompanied with training of its staff in use of
the financial model.
Advisory support in chlorination for disinfection of potable water
To provide proposals on improvement of water quality situation and on building the capacity
of CDWUUs in disinfection, a contract was signed with an international consultant. The
International Consultant assessed the current situation and technological solutions and
produced a report and guidelines for chlorination. In Quarter II, 2014, a presentation of the
report was held with participation of key stakeholders, LSG bodies, and CDWUUs. The
presentation introduced the participants in issues identified, recommendations on improvement
                                                75
                                       BORROWER ICR

of situation, optimization of technological solutions, construction/installation and operation of
structures and equipment for disinfection of potable water. The consultant also conducted
training of trainers who, in their turn, started training of CDWUU in chlorination.
Review of technical standards (SNIPs) in water supply and water disposal
Tender was conducted and contract was signed with an international company that reviewed
the current norms and technical standards in the field of WSWD. Based on the analysis, a report
was produced with recommendations on optimization of technical standards. In preparation of
the report, consideration was given to the results of meetings with stakeholders, field-specific
state bodies, design institutes and experts. The report was cycled among all stakeholders,
following which a round table was arranged for discussion and feedback. By the end of the
project, a final report was produced, incorporating the results of round tables and all comments
and proposals received. The report was sent for consideration to SAAC and DWSWD.
LSGB and CDWUU capacity building

Agreements
Standard agreement between AOs and CDWUUs was drafted for provisioning of rural water
supply services. Cooperation agreements for provisioning of rural water supply services were
signed between AOs and CDWUUS.

Exchange visits
Example of effective management of water supply system and development of CDWUU is
Chyrak, Korumdu, Orgochor, Baltabai and Jele-Dobo in Issykkul Oblast. Virtually each
household has electronic water meters and water heaters installed. In order to spread successful
experience, exchange visits to Issykkul Oblast were arranged for all ARIS oblast specialists,
LSGB representatives and region CDWUUs. The participants of the exchange visit were shown
subprojects in Korumdu, Temirovka, Orgochor, Baltabai and Chyrak villages. During the
exchange visit, the participants were able to ask questions to AO head, CDWUU chairpersons,
technical supervision engineers and other project specialists. Following the exchange visit
round tables with participation of deputies of local keneshes, LSGBs, CDWUU administration
bodies, NGOs were arranged at aiyl aimak level to discuss the mechanisms of effective
management of water supply system and the improvement of relations with consumers in
collection of tariffs for use of water etc.
TO exchange experience and practice that will be useful in CDWUU capacity building and in
indicating mechanisms of improvement of water use tariff collection process, exchange visits
for local AK deputies, AO heads and CDWUUs should be arranged.
Experience in conduction of exchange visits shows high efficiency, particularly in terms of
introduction of new approaches (individual connections through water meters), setting the
system of registering of consumers and accounting of water supply.

Training
ARIS specialists conducted assessment of CDWUU staff needs in training and capacity
building. The International Consultant for development of the WSWD Sector Strategy proposed
training materials and tools for business planning in water utilities and investment management.
These materials and training modules earlier developed by local consultant as well as training
needs assessment have been provided by a selected consulting company that in its turn adopted
those and adjusted for more effective training of CDWUU and LSGBs.
At the beginning of implementation of the program, tender was conducted, 6 trainer-
consultants were selected (2 trainers for each oblast) to train LSGBs, CDWUUs and regional
employees of DWSWD. Two-day trainings were also conducted based on training modules
                                               76

C. Activity of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and LSG bodies


The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic in project implementation
In project implementation period, cooperation of ARIS and LSG bodies was successful. Village
LSGBs were taking active part in the process of reparation and implementation of subprojects.
LSGBs appointed subproject managers who were directly supervising contract implementation
and addressing to ARIS in case of disputes. However, it is necessary to note the following:
LSG bodies didn’t always timely fulfill their obligations on 5% subproject co-financing. Paying
out the 5% could be delayed for up to 6 months, which caused discontent of contractor
organizations that had, using the funds, to conduct mobilization for commencement of works.
The project had a number of times to address and resolve co-financing issues with higher
managerial bodies. Cofinancing delay took place in implementation of subprojects in Ak-
Kochkor, Tugol-Sai, Uch-Emchek Villages.


   D. World Bank input
The WB activity in the process of implementation of the project may be evaluated as
satisfactory. In course of implementation, the WB was actively conducting monitoring of
project progress and providing recommendations and consultations on the progress of project
activities, as needed. WB timely provided approvals on the matters related to project
implementation. WB was timely assisting in decision-making and rendering consultation
support. The WB staff was supervising project implementation through supervision missions,
meetings with the representatives of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic as well as field
visits. WB procurement review was carried out in line with the procedures of prior and post
review in accordance with approved procurement plan. Being adequate, project implementation
mechanism fosters future development of communal utilities. The project implementation
                                                     84

         mechanism proposed by the Bank was appropriate. It was necessary to create preconditions for
         sustainable development of CDWUUs. This is a transfer from unprofitable to profitable utilities
         in the field of potable water supply through improved accessibility, quality and effectiveness.
         For instance, following the project activity, CDWUUs started collecting more tariffs, which
         shows the fact that the project arrangements created preconditions for further sustainable
         development of CDWUUs.

                                Main trends of project impact

First: project impact trend aimed to improve potable water quality, access to water, water
pressure in water supply network and water supply.
   1. In investigated 25 project villages, compared with 2012, a number of households
      using open sources as main sources of water for drinking and cooking has decreased
      from 29% to 5%, which considerably reduced the risk of infectious diseases,
      especially among children.
   2. 86% households have access to WSS services, 85% use it as a main one. In eleven
      project villages covered by survey, all residents have access to WSS services.
      Mainly, households in Novostroiki and far-flung sites where RWSSP-2 works were
      not envisaged are not covered by WSS services.
   3. Following implementation of RWSSP-2, in households in project villages and
      using WSS services, the distance to main potable water source has significantly
      decreased. In 2012-2014 period, a number of households using WSS located at
      the distance at100 m has increased from 47% to 77%. The number of households
      where the distance is over 500 m has reduced from 7% to 0.3%.
   4. In general, the distance to the nearest water source has reduced and the water supply
      services quality has been improved (time of interruption of water supply has
      decreased, pressure improved). Households using WSS in project villages spend
      less time to bring potable water. Average time spent by HHs to bring water,
      compared with 2012, has shortened from 17 to 8 minutes. Physical load on women
      and children, who are mainly responsible for carrying water home, has lessened.

   5. Most HHs using WSS in project villages (77%), think that the pipe water they use
      for drinking and cooking is of an excellent and good quality. This is confirmed by
      the results of water quality tests conducted by sanitary and epidemiological stations
      according to agreements signed with CDWUUs. In 2012-2014 period, 56 tests were
      carried out, the results of which show that the quality of pipe water meets the
      national quality norms. The number of HHs that think that they use potable water
      of an excellent and good quality, compared with 2012, increased from 47% to 77%.
   6. Residents of project villages using WSS note increase in pressure in water supply
      and in pipeline after RWSSP-2 interventions. Thus, the number of HHs that
      evaluate water pressure as good and excellent has increased in 2012-2014 period
      from 36% to 53%.
   7. Following rehabilitation of WSS under the project, household/yard connections is
      continually and actively ongoing. The number of HHs having installed
      household/yard connections and using pipeline as a main water source compared
      with 2012 has increased from 9%to 43% in project villages. The main obstacle for
      installation of household/yard connections is a relatively high cost of connection
      works.

Second: project impact trend aimed to improve management system in population serving
    1. Trainings conducted for LSG bodies and CDWUU staff in operation and
       maintenance of pumps and electric equipment based on new technologies and
       opportunity to disinfect potable water, in management and maintenance of
       pumping and electric equipment.

        The indicators given in the project matrix generally allowed to reflect main results
        of project activity. In discussion with WB mission, additional indicators were
        introduced so as to cover comprehensively project benefits by separate project
        impact trends. For instance, indicator “Number of new household connections after
        the project” introduced reflects improvement of water supply system in villages,
        where project activities on household/yard connections were carried out.

                     IV.    Overall assessment and recommendations


   A. Overall assessment and lessons learnt
It stands to mention that RWSSP-2 is one the projects where an effective dialogue with
local self-government bodies was set up, where priorities on addressing water supply issues
were amicably discussed and selected subprojects were implemented.
        However one of serious problems in project implementation was preparation of
detailed design estimates and limited project funds. Remaining 13 DDEs of challenging
subprojects from 26 challenging subprojects of the phase one were adjusted in conjunction
with the Design institute “Kygyzgirostroi” OJSC.

        ARIS engineers produced and sent for review to the World Bank the cost estimates
of works under the 13 challenging subprojects. In reparation of BoQ under four subprojects
for Tort-Kul Arashan, Kalba, Yntymak Villages, modifications were introduced according
to the requirements of WB consultants, i.e. diaphragms envisaged in DDE were replaced
with pressure reducing valves. Pre-bid meeting was also conducted with bidders, which
enabled the bidders to more comprehensively study bidding documents, materials and
equipment used for the facility. Discussions with AO and CDWUU representatives on
saving potable water, reduction of water loss, replacement of standpipes with yard and
household connection, connection through water meters and appropriate operation of
submersible well pumps as well as on risk of rebidding and signing “Agreements between
ARIS and Aiyl okmotu”.
       Prior to announcing bidding, due to limited funds, design institute
“Kurgyzgiprostroi” in conjunction with ARIS engineers, having additionally studied
market prices, prepared DDEs and BoQs under completed 13 subprojects.
       Under the 13 subprojects, changes were introduced in DDEs and BoQs by separate
types of works not requiring qualification experience in construction. Agreements have
been drafted and will be signed between ARIS and aiyl aimak for some works in
implementation of subproject, not requiring qualification experience in construction.

       According to DDE under 13 subprojects, there were delays in announcing bidding
fro construction works.


Supervision
In the course of supervision of contract implementation, there were the following main
challenges:
Lack of financing of non-qualification works from AO. Weak knowledge among CDWUU
chairpersons in rectification of leakages and break downs of distribution networks and
pipelines as well as lack of knowledge of water chlorination and signing agreements with
the representatives of raion SES. Lack of specialists for operation and maintenance of water
supply system.


   B. Challenges encountered and ways of dealing with them
There were not complicated problems during preparation and implementation of the project.
All challenges regarding preparation and implementation of subprojects by ARIS and LSG
were resolved at working order. The government timely signed Project Financing
Agreements.
Regardless of achievement of goals, there are problems that occurred beyond the project
mandate and in the process of project implementation:
Rehabilitation of potable water supply facilities envisaged improvement of the activity of
main structures, repair and drilling of wells, construction of stations for disinfection and
reservoirs. Increased volume of water supply and pressure in water supply system resulted
in aggravation of poor condition of main and distribution pipelines. The poor condition
caused frequent break downs in water supply networks.
Poor condition of main and distribution networks. For a long period, the networks were
without rehabilitation. They used pies of various diameter made of various materials, which
enables to ensure required pressure in villages.
Lack of equipment for accounting of potable water in villages result in inefficient and
wasteful use both by CDWUUs and beneficiaries. This lack was related to lack of
equipment for accounting of potable water. Installation of accounting equipment would
enable to reduce water losses, enhance the efficiency of its use and increase the level of
tariff collection. This also would enable to move form old water accounting system, i.e.
from normative consumption to actual consumption. While behavior of consumers
changed in terms of payment for water, the attitude of care is still not there.
Inefficient CDWUU management resulted in misbalance between the volume of water
supply to system and the volumes of potable water consumption. Inefficient use of new
and current equipment results in unjustified increase of water supply. These are both
commercial and technical losses, which ultimately leads to indebtedness of CDWUUs to
power companies.
Lack and sometimes absence of qualified specialists able to manage not only high tech
equipment and structures but also water supply networks remains a pressing issue. Without

proper maintenance from qualified specialists, equipment, structures and networks may
get out of order. Low qualification of specialists, operators of billing system and poor
technical equipment may lead to decrease in quality of services provided. Inefficient
management will lead to inadequate collection of tariffs. This will also lead to inability to
invest in main facilities.
Active participation of civil sector (NGO) in management and quality service provisioning
is the project achievement. The results of impact assessment showed that LSG bodies and
CDWUUs carry out awareness campaign among population aimed at appropriate operation
water supply network, attitude of care to potable water.


      C. Recommendations


The government of the Kyrgyz Republic would propose the following activities for further
improvement of access, quality of infrastructure services provided:
      In project implementation in some villages, household and yard connections to water
       supply system were carried out. They installed shower cabinets, washbasins, water
       heaters, washing machines and other conveniences.
      Villages face pressing issues regarding condition of treatment facilities and
       disinfection of waste waters. Villages virtually don’t have structures for treatment of
       waste waters.
      The second priority is availability of treatment facilities, the lack of which results in
       environmental risks, epidemiological outbreaks and diseases among population.
      Currently, due to lack of sewage system and treatment facilities, population has to
       use pit latrines and cesspits. One of project approaches could be consideration of
       construction of structures in villages.
      In the field of institutional development, CDWUUs should get support in
       improvement of management system, conduction of seminars and trainings aimed at
       building the capacity of specialists. There is a need in training orienting specialists
       from quantitative indicators to qualitative indicators (achievement of targets,
       efficiency).
      In order to improve CDWUU activity, it is needed to reduce credit indebtedness
       through efficient management. It is necessary to set up billing system.
      It is needed to create material, technical and institutional preconditions for
       sustainable development of CDWUUs as well as NGOs dealing with infrastructure
       issues, particularly, in terms of information support.

Outline of programme and what it has achieved

1. The Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSP-2) is a World Bank/DFID programme which
builds on a first phase RWSSP, which was implemented in 2002-2008.

2. In the second phase, DFID contributed £1 million to a World Bank Trust Fund over five years to finance
improvements in sanitation and hygiene practices at individual, family and institutional levels in rural areas in the
Kyrgyz Republic, as well as to strengthen institutional capacity for the rural drinking water supply and sanitation
sector. The Joint WB/DFID intervention was designed to reach approximately 110,000 beneficiaries (the end target
of people trained on improved hygiene and sanitation practices).

3. In the first phase, DFID provided complementary technical assistance to the World Bank for their RWSSP project
implemented in the northern oblasts of Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Talas. This was done through two DFID projects –
RWSSP for water supply and a Rural Hygiene and Sanitation Project (RHSP) which worked with the Centre for
Health Promotion (CHP) on sanitation and hygiene in the home and at schools and medical centres, through Village
Health Committees (VHCs). At the same time, ADB was implementing a similar water supply project in the four
remaining oblasts. RWSSP-2 continued to work in the same three northern oblasts.

4. The agency responsible for overseeing rural water supply (Department of Rural Water Supply) has been moved
from one institutional location to another. Until 2011 RWSSP-2 was implemented by a joint project management
unit (JPMU) which implemented both RWSSP-2 and the ADB project (until it was halted). RWSSP-2 faced long
delays and major disruptions from the start due to low capacity and limited leadership of the water supply and
sanitation sector institutions and service providers. The revolution in 2010 and the subsequent political upheaval
was also a significant disruptive factor which caused considerable delays.

5. Following the Project’s World Bank mid-term review in 2011 the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic dissolved
the JPMU and transferred the Project to the Community Investments and Development Agency (ARIS). The first
phase of RWSSP was successful in developing a community based participatory model for service delivery, balanced
with centralised provision of services, and achieved measurable reductions in water borne diseases. It was less
successful in institution building in the water supply sector, largely due to the fact that throughout the project, the
DRWS then located in the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry, was inadequately
supported. [It has since been under the Prime Minister’s Office and is now under the State Agency on Architecture,
Construction and Housing under the Government of KR.] However, the CHP and its partner VHCs continue to be
an active partner under the Ministry of Health.

6. Despite the desperately poor performance in the first half of the project, DFID continued to support the project,
though with reduced financial contribution, partly to maintain DFID’s reputation given their support to other projects
and programmes, and to achieve the benefits of supporting the institutional and legal reforms proposed. DFID
reduced their contribution from £5m to £1m by withdrawing contributions to water supply construction and focusing
its support on promotion of improved health and hygiene practices (Component B) and capacity building and
institutional development at community and national levels (Component C).

7. The Annual Review in late-2013 suggested that despite still limited tangible progress against project indicators,
ARIS and UNICEF were in a position to achieve dramatic progress in the final year of the project. A time-bound
action plan was put in place and a mid-year review was conducted in May 2014 to assess progress. The progress
achieved in the first six months 2014 was dramatic and there was high confidence that project purpose of providing
improved access to potable water and improve water related hygiene practice in participating communities, with
associated indicators and outcomes, would be achieved. The PCR can confirm that the outcomes were achieved,
though due to the rushed nature of the final year’s programme, it will be important to ask World Bank/UNICEF/ARIS
to ensure the sustainability of the achievements. However, the continued commitment of the CHP and VHCs to
health promotion in the villages and the fact that school latrines built under RHSP ten years ago continue to be used,
in good condition and well maintained provides some reassurance.

                                                          91
8. The achievements in the last year are remarkable and due credit should go to the World Bank, ARIS and UNICEF
for huge efforts to accomplish this, and to DFID for continuing to support this project despite the challenges.



B: PERFORMANCE AND CONCLUSIONS (1-2 pages)

Performance is measured against the revised log frame – the latest revision was in October 2013 and was aligned
with World Bank’s log frame.

Overall Outcome Assessment

DFID funds are only used to support sanitation, hygiene promotion and institutional capacity building activities so
only the second indicator “Decreased rate of incidence of waterborne diseases in communities participating in this
project” is assessed. The assessment is based on tests of faeces and blood from pre- and post- project matched
samples of schoolchildren for worms, acute intestinal infections and viral hepatitis done by SES laboratory staff
working with village health centres (FAPs). Where infection was found children and families were treated in
almost all cases. Data for 2014 was only available for the first half of the year so 2014 totals have been doubled
before comparison with an average of annual totals for 2010 – 2013. Acute intestinal infections and viral hepatitis
A fell by 55% and 54% respectively whilst worm infections (including ascariasis, enterobiasis and giardiasis)
reportedly fell by 75%. Only rare helminth cases were reported to have increased, from 23 cases to 94 cases due to
non-treatment of parents, later revealed to be the main source of infection. Whilst this is not a statistically
significant study and the data may not be wholly reliable, it is certainly clear that there has been a big improvement
in participating communities’ water and hygiene related health. What is also clear from the Output reporting (in
Section C below) is that the success has been as a consequence of delivering DFID’s original aim (in Phase 1
through RWSSP-1 and RHSP) of improved health through combined improvements in water supply, sanitation and
hygiene. Results are summarised below.

Output Score and Description

Output 1 (Improved hygiene and sanitation practices) has three indicators on participation and behaviour change
which are reported on in more detail in the next section. Score = A.


                                                         92
In the log frame, some assumptions were made for this output about key factors for success. These were that: the
actual change in behaviour would be as a result of wider factors than just participation in programmes (including
availability of soap and home water management); that communities do not neglect sanitation when deciding on
resource allocation (adequate split between water supply and public sanitation) and that hygiene promotion is well
targeted with appropriate channels and tools used during the campaigns. These assumptions were borne out in this
project with major changes in soap availability and use in the home and at schools, improved allocation of
resources for sanitation in homes and schools (especially increasing salaries of staff doing the cleaning and
maintenance of sanitation facilities), and a wide selection of materials, tools and visual aids (as well as social
networking and video exercises for schoolchildren) used to emphasise the importance and effectiveness of good
sanitation and hygiene. UNICEF did a study of school expenditure on water supply, sanitation and hygiene and
overall the picture was that current expenditure was only a tiny fraction of what was required to fulfil national
standards. There is considerable reliance on parent sponsorship of classes and this seems to have been effective in
providing materials but it is inequitable with this inequality likely to be self-perpetuating with better schools visited
(such as Kazybek in At Bashy rayon of Naryn) seeming to receive much higher levels of sponsorship than
struggling schools (such as Kum Dobo in Kochkor rayon of Naryn).


Output 2 (Improved capacity of the GoK, local government and communities to develop and maintain their WSS
services in participating communities) is focussed on institutional capacity building, of the CDWUUs and DRWSS
in particular. Score = A.

The biggest indicators of success for CDWUUs relate to commitment through signed service agreements (done)
and through fee collection and management. All CDWUUs except Chelpek and Tort Kul in Issyk Kul and Ak
Kuduk in Naryn have set tariffs and started collecting fees. Seasonal collection (post tourist season in Issyk Kul
and post harvest in all three oblasts) mean that 2014 figures are currently much lower than 2013 figures. The tables
below are based on data for all CDWUUs compiled by ARIS for 2013, the year with the most complete fee
collection data.

The reported tariff charges are similar for Naryn and Talas at between 60 and 70 KGS per household. Assuming
about five people per household, Issyk Kul charges are higher at about 100 KGS per household. Some Issyk Kul
CDWUUS have already installed meters and are charging per cubic metre. This is beginning to be implemented in
some CDWUUs in Naryn and Talas too. The tariffs are reasonable and should deliver sufficient revenue to cover
staff costs (CDWUU staff members were paid between 2,000 and 10,000 KGS per month) and routine operation
and maintenance costs and to contribute to depreciation costs where higher collection rates are achieved.

CDWUUs reported collection rates of 60-80%. The analysis in the second table below would suggest that, on
average, collection rates may be lower at 30-50%. However, these figures should be treated with caution as many
schemes were not fully functioning though the whole year so revenues are not for the whole year. Nevertheless the
collection rates would seem to bear out the claims based on tariff rates that income is sufficient to cover O and M
costs so the target has been achieved.

To support this Output DFID contributed to the funding of a set of activities to help the sector more widely, all of
which are expected to be completed by project close at the end of October 2014. The World Bank is keeping a
close eye on all activities to ensure their successful conclusion before project closure. The most important
activities were: the development of a sector strategy (complete and awaiting parliamentary approval); a legal
review (needs a major rewrite before approval – World Bank will ensure its completion); creation of a water and
wastewater financial model (still in progress but due to be complete before the end of October 2014); advisory
support on chlorination (completed but see end of Section C for follow-up) and a review of technical norms and
standards (still in progress but off to a good start and expected to be complete before end of October 2014).

Lessons and how these have been shared

    1. Only when water is provided to the home do you get the maximum improvements in hygiene and only
       when water, sanitation and hygiene are all in place do you get the full health gains. These messages are
       clear to all involved but this learning needs to be incorporated in any new water supply initiatives such as
       those being considered by ADB and the World Bank. Sanitation and hygiene has so far been primarily
       grant supported by bilateral donors (DFID primarily although a Russian project under UNICEF will also
       include this) and if DFID is to cease supporting this work then any new activities need to find a way to
       support.
    2. CDWUUs are a valuable technical and management resource in rural areas, especially where they are run
       by people previously involved in state management of rural supply. There is good evidence of CDWUUs
       being backed up by Ayl Okmotus (AOs – local government) and this partnership will be a key factor for
       sustainability going forward. Many AOs have contributed to water supply construction or school sanitation

Key Points
   1. There were several reports that the residual knowledge on hygiene from the RHSP in the first phase contributed to quick
          success.
    2. The continued activeness of the VHCs 10 years on was most encouraging for sustainability.

Key Points

Summary of responses to issues raised in previous annual reviews (where relevant)

   1. One of the main concerns relates to water quality and the chlorination of water supplies. Chlorination units
      have been installed in all 37 schemes but whilst an extremely useful guide to disinfection has been produced
      by ARIS, and there was evidence of chlorination going on in some schemes visited, there is no testing of
      residual chlorine so there is no knowledge or understanding of the effectiveness (or healthiness) of the
      chlorine regimes in place. Whilst Kyrgyz standards and SES in Bishkek advocate a formula based approach
      to chlorine dosing (based on raw water quality and concentration of chlorine powder), all CDWUUs reported
      having been told to use the same dosage (3g/m3) even though raw water quality and concentration of chlorine
      in the bleaching powders used in each case was different. This is a major concern. If chlorine is to be used
      (recommended, especially for surface water supplies) then residual chlorine must be measured. SES are
      aware of this and will be promoting it with their staff and CDWUUs in the final workshop but without testing
      equipment (CDWUUs have none) the reliance is solely on SES on an occasional basis.

Recommendations for future programmes

   1. Wherever possible, incorporate WASH training for communities within existing or future community
      structures linked to state institutions to ensure sustainability. The main reason for the sustainability and
      continued support of the Village Initiative Groups (VIGs) from RHSP is that they were incorporated into the
      VHCs which work on a variety of health issues with FAPs. Without this the VIGs may well have ceased to
      function.
   2. If chlorination is to be promoted as part of water supply improvements then monitoring systems and
      equipment must be in place at the earliest opportunity.
   3. Actively engage with local government (AOs) and not just target communities to support water supply. AOs
      have a legal responsibility for water supply and have responded positively to requests for support by
      CDWUUs and strong partnerships are now in place.
   4. Use RWSSP-2 as a model for making difficult decisions up front on the most effective way of project
      management and implementation. The problems in the first half of the project came as no surprise, nor did
      the improvements in performance with the change in management.
   5. To achieve significant improvements in hygiene behaviour water must be easily to hand.
   6. There should be plans in place to follow-up outstanding activities that are part of a project but outside of the
      control of that particular project. For example, the long-term strategy for WASH has been finalised following
      government and sector review. It is awaiting partliamentary approval but this is unlikely to be achieved
      before the end of the project. Following this up is a not a time-consuming process but is important in terms
      of the project’s legacy and future sector progress.

D: VALUE FOR MONEY & FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (1 page)

Key cost drivers and performance

DFID’s contribution to this project dropped from £5 m to £1 million to focus on sanitation, hygiene and
institutional capacity building. The revised budget went to UNICEF for the school sanitation and school and
community hygiene programme in the 51 villages supplied by the 37 water supply systems, and to ARIS as
contribution to project management and institutional strengthening activities. UNICEF rates are relatively high but
economies of scale are achieved with existing work being done elsewhere and some staff supported by core
funding. The long delays and rush to complete the work quickly meant that spend occurred rapidly. All of the
funds were spent.


VfM performance compared to the original VfM proposition in the business case

The mid-term review concluded that there was poor value for money being demonstrated compared to the original
assessment in the Project Memorandum (project was pre business case process) since the number of beneficiaries
was going down and the per capita cost of water supply construction was going up two, three, even four-fold.
DFID ensured that value for money increased again by cutting support to the construction schemes and focusing
the support on sanitation and hygiene promotion. Whilst it is not possible to directly compare overall project
completion VfM with project preparation VfM as the water supply construction component was not common to
both, it is possible to compare the components on sanitation and hygiene. The costs were the same but the audience
reached by UNICEF during its hygiene campaigns was greater than would have been the case under the JPMU.
UNICEF calculated that almost 600 VHC members carried out hygiene and sanitation training of just over 82,000
people (75% of target population) of which just over 53,000 were women. Hygiene and sanitation videos were
broadcast on national TV and several regional radio programmes were broadcast.


Assessment of whether the programme represented value for money

Without DFID’s support the hygiene and sanitation components of this project would not have been delivered at all
and so many of the potential health benefits of improved water supply would not have been achieved. Many
studies demonstrate the economic and social benefits from improved health in terms of reduced expenditure on
medicines and hospital visits, increased work productivity and school attendance, particularly for girls so DFID
have delivered economic benefits. DFID’s £1 million supported successful implementation of hygiene and
sanitation programmes in 55 villages and schools, as well as a sector strategy awaiting parliamentary approval, a
legal review, a water and wastewater financial model, advisory support on chlorination, a review of technical
norms and standards and databases for all villages in the project oblasts. These short term outputs will, based on
the continuing benefits observed from the Phase 1 RWSSP and RHSP, deliver long term outcomes and represent
value for money. UNICEF’s resources and experience were used to achieve benefits far beyond the project sites
with regional and national activities on TV and radio as well as school media and social networking activities.

DFID’s profile with the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has been low over this project and it would help to
maximise value for money if the Government were to be made aware of DFID’s support for this project, though
exposure needs to be managed so as to not create expectation by the Government for further DFID support. This
will be a high profile issue over the coming months as discussions between the government and World Bank over a
further phase of work evolve. DFID had a fine line to tread. It was only in the last 18 months that this project
moved ahead at pace and was viewed most positively by the government. It might have helped for DFID to more
closely associate itself with the World Bank in meetings with the government.


Quality of financial management during programme

When it was clear that the original £5 million was not going to represent good value for money the decision was
taken to reduce the budget and transfer the money to ARIS and from there to UNICEF and consultants. ARIS were
audited and found to be sound in their financial management, so much so that high profile NGOs that were highly



                                                        99
critical of the project being given to ARIS were, by project end, effusive in their appreciation of ARIS’ financial
and technical dealings in the project.

E: RISK (½ page)
Quality of risk management over the life of the programme

The main risks identified at project outset were institutional, political and fiduciary. In the first half of the project
the risks associated with government became a reality and lack of (or confused) government leadership for or
through DRWS and poor project management by the PMU (much linked to poor project design, especially in terms
of design standards) held up the project’s progress. This was certainly not helped by the political consequences of
the revolution of 2010 which left an institutional vacuum for a significant period. The key risks identified under
Component A (Water Supply Infrastructure and Equipment) also became a reality and were fundamental to first
half project delays. These were disagreement over design standards for the water supply projects which, when
finally resolved, resulted in a doubling of the per head volumes of water supplied and significant increases in sub-
project costs and the requirement to complete sub-projects from Phase 1 of RWSSP which were either not
completed or which contained defects requiring work to ensure water supply. As a result the costs rose and the
number of schemes included in RWSSP-2 was reduced. The delays in Component A impacted upon B and C,
exclusively funded by DFID.

In agreement with the government, the risks were managed by transferring the project management responsibility
from direct government control to ARIS. This was a pragmatic and commendable decision by government which
meant that, whilst the World Bank still had to fight hard to control costs, project implementation was faster
(Components A and C) and UNICEF were able to bring their considerable experience and resources to enable rapid
implementation of Component B.

When costs spiralled and value for money was considerably reduced DFID took the decision to withdraw its
support to Component A and to support only Components B and C.

Funds were disbursed via a World Bank Trust Fund and the Bank considered financial management at ARIS during
RWSSP2 (accounting, reporting, budgeting, external auditing, contract monitoring, funds flow and staffing) to be
Satisfactory throughout.


F: COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (½ page)
Delivery against planned timeframe

The project was extended from May 2013 to October 2014 so delivery was not achieved by original timeframe.
However, DFID supported activities have either already been completed or expected to be completed by end of
project. The only outstanding activities are legal review rewrite, work on reviewing and suggested amendments to
design standards, and database completion under Component C.

Performance of partnership (s)

The partnerships improved hugely in the second half of this project. The main partnerships were between UNICEF
and villages for hygiene promotion and sanitation (and between schoolteachers, schoolchildren, parents and
communities, and medical centre staff). In all 12 villages visited these partnerships were evident and supportive.
The longevity of the VHCs and their continued work with FAPs is particularly striking, as is the continued linkage
between FAPs and the CHPs.




                                                          100
For water supply the main relationships were between ARIS, CDWUUs, communities and AOs. The good
working relationships observed between AOs and CDWUUs and between CDWUUs and communities were
encouraging to see for sustainability.

As this project was transferred from direct government control (JPMU) to ARIS, there are possible concerns about
government ownership. However, government is pleased with the oputcomes and anyway the key relationships are
at village/CDWUU/AO level. The relationship between central SES, local SES and CDWUUs for water quality
control (especially in relation to chlorination) remains a concern.

Asset disposal and value obtained by DFID

There were no assets to dispose of under this project. All of DFID’s spend went on activities.




H: MONITORING & EVALUATION (½ page)
Evidence and evaluation

The evidence base has not changed during the project. The evidence for project evaluation is not statistically
significant but is substantial and provides enough information upon which to make conclusions with a fair degree
of confidence. For DFID’s areas of support, hygiene behaviour change was a critical measure of success and this
was reported as being achieved in CHP’s impact assessment survey. It should be noted that the behaviour change
noted is only reported behaviour change, as in what answers were given by people when asked about hygiene
behaviour (hand-washing practices in particular). Research by ICDDR-B in Bangladesh seem to confirm what
many in the sector have suspected for a while - that reported behaviour change is considerably greater than actual
behaviour change (in Bangladesh 10% improvements in reported behaviour were representing an approximate 1%
improvement in actual behaviour). However, in this case, the supporting evidence on facilities (proximity of water
especially) and school and community self-monitoring programmes gives a higher than normal level of confidence
about the actual impact achieved and its sustainability.

The data on CDWUU progress and performance is internally collected and collated by ARIS but has been
independently corroborated in 12 cases through site visits by DFID and World Bank evaluation teams.


Monitoring progress throughout the programme

Monitoring of progress throughout the programme’s duration has been regular, timely and comprehensive in light
of the major challenges encountered. There have been four Annual Reviews and each of these has been closely
coordinated with the World Bank to ensure a consistent line of enquiry and recommendations for improvement.
Recommendations have been thorough and responded to by project partners and have resulted in a project which
has delivered much. DFID has engaged regularly and supportively with project implementing partners and with the
World Bank and this was appreciated by all during PCR Mission.

Having reviewed the submitted draft Implementation Completion and Results Report
(ICR) for the Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project in the Kyrgyz Republic,
we would like to inform you of the following.

1. It should be noted that, in our opinion, the Implementation Completion Report for the
   first and second phases of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project financed by
   the World Bank was prepared with due attention paid to every aspect.

2. Taking into account the difficult drinking water supply situation in the country, and
   particularly in the rural areas, in the early 2000s, the Kyrgyz Government concluded
   agreements with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank for financing projects
   implemented in the drinking water supply sector.

3. At the same time, it should be noted that during that period the Kyrgyz Government
   lacked experience and skills required for implementation of such large-scale projects
   not only in drinking water supply but also in other sectors.

  Footnotes included in this section were not part of the original comments from the Borrower, rather they
have been introduced to put in context, clarify, or comment on some of the Government comments where
deemed necessary.



                                                   90
4. Moreover, the hastily adopted Taza Suu19 National Program did not contain concrete
   goals and tasks and lacked requisite calculations and implementation action plan that
   would have outlined the development prospects for this sector.

5. Without such clearly stated goals, tasks, and calculations, the Kyrgyz Government
   undertook these broad yet unrealistic commitments and promised within 5-6 years to
   provide safe drinking water supply to over 1,000 rural communities all over the country.

6. As it is well known, the numerous attempts by international consultants and local
   specialists to design and adopt a strategy for drinking water supply and sewerage
   development were blocked by the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic.

7. Besides, local communities were not properly prepared for implementation of the
   projects and there was no improved legislation regulating not only the water supply and
   sanitation sector but also operations of local self-governments responsible for handling
   local issues.

8. For these reasons, the project was implemented by an international consulting company
   together with newly established rural drinking water user associations (RDWUAs),
   although there existed the respective laws of the Kyrgyz Republic “On State
   Administrations and Local Self-Governance,” “On Financial and Economic Principles
   of Local Self-Governance,” and “on Municipal Ownership of Property.”

9. Based on provisions of these laws, local self-governments could have established
   municipal enterprises for operation and maintenance of water supply lines, while
   creation of RDWUAs was not stipulated in the existing legislation.

10. As a result, the role of local self-governments was ignored, and they remained
    unengaged in the preparation and implementation of projects by implementing agencies
    and donors.

11. In addition, we need to acknowledge that division of the country’s regions into the
    South and North by the donors was not carefully thought-through for ethical and other
    reasons.

12. Another matter of contention under the Project was hiring an international consulting
    company20 for implementing the Project, that was not familiar with the situation in the
    Kyrgyz drinking water supply sector and in the country in general.

hired for it. Similarly, comment 13 does not apply to RWSSP2. Finally, Comment 14 highlights a general

                                                  91
13. This led to irrevocable mistakes also caused by the lack of required supervision by the
    implementing agencies at the stage of determining subsurface and other types of water
    sources. In most cases, these water sources were selected based on responses of
    residents in villages that were to be included in the project.

14. These facts demonstrate that geological and site surveys were not duly and properly
    performed.

15. The analysis held in 2012 by the State Agency for Construction and Regional
    Development under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic showed that 30% of water
    supply facilities constructed or rehabilitated under this project and recognized as
    problematic had design cost estimates that were prepared without due regard to their
    quality and the established procedures.

16. In our opinion, another mistake made in the implementation of this project was
    involvement of foreign construction companies 21 hired for rehabilitation and
    construction of water supply systems, that were selected without proper assessment of
    their competence and production capacities and that could withdraw from the project
    whenever any difficulty arose.

17. This could be exemplified by Alke Insaat Sanain Ticaret Turkish company that stopped
    construction of the water supply system in Kerben, Jalal Abad oblast, before the end of
    the construction works due to the lack of production capacity and left the country.
    Currently, the water supply facilities in Kerben are included in the list of problematic
    facilities and a part of the local population have no access to drinking water.

18. We would also like to note that the report includes well-deserved recognition for the
    Community Development and Investment Agency of the Kyrgyz Republic.

19. After ARIS was appointed as an implementing agency for water supply and sanitation
    projects in 2011, the problems existing in geological and site surveying, design and
    construction of rural water supply systems were successfully resolved as a result of
    efforts undertaken by the Agency’s competent staff and management.

20. So far, there have been no complaints from local self-governments and population
    regarding the 55 facilities constructed or rehabilitated by ARIS in Issyk Kul, Naryn,
    and Talas oblasts.



acknowledged in supervision aide memoires. Any follow on operation will have to consider strengthening
capacity in these areas.

21
   Comment (16 and 17) do not apply to RWSSP2. There were no foreign construction companies hired
for the project, and the projects did not work in Kerben or the Jalalabad Oblast.



                                                  92
21. In this regard, the Department for Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Development
    shares the World Bank’s position with regard to ARIS as an implementing agency for
    projects financed not only by the World Bank but also by other foreign and domestic
    donors and investors.

22. We would also like to inform that the submitted report was discussed at the
    Department’s meeting attended by all oblast- and rayon-level specialists who provided
    the following recommendations for the next tranche to finance the third phase of this
    project:

   (i) split the functions of an implementing agency and implementing unit to prevent
   conflict of interest, where the functions of an implementing agency should be
   transferred to another state body;

   (ii) the third phase of the project should be implemented in 62 villages in Chui, Osh,
   Batken, and Jalal Abad oblasts in order to save funds for preparing design cost
   estimates, as these documents were previously prepared and later revised by ARIS;

   (iii) abandon division of the country into the Southern and Northern parts, i.e. donors
   should cover the whole territory of the country with their activities;

   (iv) projects should be implemented in strict compliance with the Presidential Decree
   “On Amendments to the Presidential Decree ‘On the National Sustainable
   Development Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2013-2017’” and the State Program
   for Development of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage for 2014-2024 adopted by
   the Kyrgyz Government Resolution;

   (v) settlements to be included in the list of facilities to be financed by the World Bank
   should be selected by the State Agency for Architecture, Construction, Housing and
   Utility Infrastructure in its capacity of a state body responsible for implementation of
   the state policy for the drinking water supply and sanitation, with participation of the
   World Bank and Kyrgyz Government’s Designated Representatives; the list of such
   facilities should be provided to an implementing unit as per the established procedure;

   (vi) the new project should pay due attention to institutional capacity building for
   design engineers, construction personnel, the Water Supply and Sanitation Department,
   the Architecture Agency, drinking water supply organizations engaged in the project
   implementation, and other stakeholders;

   (vii) local self-governments should be the key actors in the project implementation as
   it is stipulated in the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic;

   (viii) abandon design and installation of street stand-pipes, but provide connection for
   household water supply systems;




                                            93
   (ix) provide support to the Department of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage
   Development in implementing fundamental reforms in the drinking water supply and
   sewerage sector based on the experience of other European countries in this sector.

The Department of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Development remains to be the
key institutional partner of the project and main beneficiary under all activities aimed at
institutional development and implemented in other areas within the limits prescribed by
the Kyrgyz legislation.

                    Re: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project – 2

Herewith, the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic would like to express its respect
to the World Bank Country Office in the Kyrgyz Republic and inform you of the following.

After reviewing the draft Implementation Completion and Results Report for the Second
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project, the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic
in cooperation with the Community Development and Investment Agency and the State
Agency for Architecture, Construction, and Housing and Utility Infrastructure under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic would like to submit its comments and additions to
this report.

We would like to request you to incorporate the following changes and additions to the
report as stated below:

1) Clause 55 shall be revised to read as follows:

With regard to the issues of sanitation and hygiene, the Russian Federation provided USD
1mln. to UNICEF for implementing the project to finance water supply, sanitation, and
hygiene (WASH) facilities in Kyrgyz schools. This Project is comprised of two
components: 1) Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion and Education Component; 2)
Rehabilitation of WASH Facilities Component. Taking into account the fact that ARIS has
been successfully cooperating with state bodies (the Healthcare Ministry, Ministry of
Education and Science, National Health Promotion Center, Disease Prevention Department,
State Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision Service, Department for Water Supply and
Sewerage Development) and civic organizations (rural healthcare committees, rural
drinking water user associations) in all villages nationwide and is a sustainable institution
having extensive experience of promoting WASH among local communities and schools
and mobilizing stakeholders’ support for resolving issues in this area, UNICEF signed an
agreement with ARIS for the implementation of the Russian Federation-sponsored project.
ARIS will be implementing the WASH Program in 90 selected schools all over the country
drawing on the models used together with UNICEF under the RWSSP-2. ARIS is planning
and taking active measures to replicate successes of the WASH program in additional
schools and communities through the use of best practices and for broader outcomes.




                                            95
2) Clause 64 shall be revised to read as follows:

The key outputs supporting better hygiene, sanitation, and water use practices and
pertinent outcomes. The Project, mainly through its Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion
Component (Component B) funded by the DFID and implemented by UNICEF, supported
promotion of better hygiene and sanitation practices in rural areas. Similar activities were
undertaken in schools in the three oblasts where the Project, through its Component A,
financed reconstruction or construction of demonstration facilities in total of 18 schools in
18 villages (see Annex 2 for more details). Representatives of schools, healthcare centers,
and communities in all the 55 villages were engaged in sanitation and hygiene promotion
campaigns. Two school teachers from each village participated in the UNICEF oblast-level
trainings based on the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Guidelines for Teachers and now
use the PHAST (Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation) method designed
for working with schools and communities in their respective oblasts.

3) Clause 67d shall be revised to read as follows:

d. Design of the financial model for water supply and sewerage development.

The Project hired an international consultant to design the financial model for the water
supply and sewerage sector and handed it over to the Department for Drinking Water
Supply and Sewerage with delivery of further trainings for their staff on how to use this
model.

4) Paragraphs c and d in Annex 2 “Component B” shall be revised to read as follows:

c) Dehelminthization. Two laboratory studies were carried out in each school, covering 25
school students (grades 1-4) each time. As result of the first testing, 211 children were
diagnosed with invermination, 209 of whom received medical treatment. One child from
Ak Olon village did not receive treatment due to his change of residence to Balykchy. The
costs of treatment with piperazine, albendazole, and mebendazole were paid by the parents.
All persons being in contact with the infected children (parents and other family members)
were sent to the rayon-level sanitary and epidemiological service for medical examination.
Local family practitioners issued prescription for medical treatment of these children. In
addition, doctors met with parents to provide detailed information regarding the need for
re-treatment.

d) Comprehensive needs assessment performed and annual costs of expendables and
services required for routine and limited extraordinary maintenance of WASH facilities in
schools estimated. The analysis was conducted based on the data obtained from schools in
the pilot villages covered by the RWSSP-2, as well as the data provided by the Ministry of
Education and Science, Healthcare Ministry and its local branches, and municipal
authorities. The assessment of needs/ costs for expendables and services of medical aid
points was not performed due to the decision not to construct any sanitary and technical
facilities of the Healthcare Ministry (this suggestion goes beyond the context). According
to the data of the Ministry of Education, average annual per student costs planned for 2013



                                             96
under the standard budget financing for rural schools were KGS 6.2. Since the actual
funding for this category of costs was 62.7%, the actual annual spending per student
amounted to KGS 3.89. Based on the data provided by the schools, calculations were made
for actual spending for operation and technical maintenance of WASH facilities. The pilot
schools in Talas on average spent KGS 27.5 per student per annum for operation and
technical maintenance of WASH infrastructure. For the purpose of comparison, similar
data were requested from a private school in Bishkek, according to which a private school
in Bishkek spends KGS 196.6 per student per annum. According to the sanitary norms of
the Russian Federation, average annual costs for disinfection and hygiene expendables,
expressed in Kyrgyz soms, amounts to KGS 287 per student per year. Thus, the estimated
monthly costs for purchasing cleaning/ disinfection and hygiene products per student
(based on the current local market prices) amount to KGS 23.5 (in case if liquid soap is
used) and KGS 28.7 (in case if bar soap is used), i.e. the costs for nine months of schooling
would be KGS 211.5 and the annual costs would be KGS 258 in 2013. These data were
confirmed by the actual costs data incurred by the school in Tuura Suu village, Ton rayon,
Issyk Kul oblast.

5) Paragraphs d in Annex 2 “Component C” shall be revised to read as follows:

d. Design of the financial model for water supply and sewerage development.

The Project hired an international consultant to design the financial model for the water
supply and sewerage sector and handed it over to the Department for Drinking Water
Supply and Sewerage with delivery of further trainings for their staff on how to use this
model.

We would like to note that the comments from the State Agency for Architecture,
Construction, and Housing and Utility Infrastructure under the Kyrgyz Government for the
aforesaid report were sent to you as Letter No. 18/573 dated April 13, 2015.
