The Bank received a satisfactory\n            rating for its performance while the Borrowers\u2019 performance\n            was rated moderately satisfactory. The project underwent\n            three restructurings. The first restructuring transferred\n            project executing and implementing responsibilities to a new\n            entity due to non-performance of original entities. The\n            second restructuring address a series of implementation and\n            sector challenges; changes were made to the PDO and other\n            aspects, such as scope, results framework, expenditure\n            categories, and safeguard policies. The third and final\n            restructuring optimized the scope of investments in light of\n            a funding shortfall; also to allow for reallocation of funds\n            among categories, mobilization of US$500,000 in additional\n            co-financing by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic\n            (GoKR), and adjustments to the result framework. Several\n            lessons were learned from this project including the\n            following: (1) design of so called \u2018repeater\u2019 or follow-on\n            operations should involve comprehensive consultations with\n            various key stakeholders to capture any legacy issues and\n            incorporate important lessons on what has and has not worked\n            at different stages of the original project, (2) design of\n            project implementation arrangements should hinge on building\n            robust institutional structures that can withstand internal\n            and external shocks such as the withdrawal of individual\n            champions or changes in government, (3) strengthening local\n            engineering-design capacities and standards should be an\n            important element of capacity building efforts to enhance\n            the technical sustainability of water supply and sanitation\n            infrastructure investments, (4) sustained Bank engagement\n            and support to client governments in the face of serious\n            sector challenges can enable an improbable project\n            turnaround and gradual rebuild of sector capacities, (5)\n            bank teams should manage expectations and ensure that\n            sufficient and meaningful dialogue is maintained with all\n            key stakeholders prior to and throughout project\n            implementation, and finally (6) project implementation\n            arrangements should always be designed to strengthen\n            internal Government capacity."}, "docdt": "2015-04-27T09:34:05Z"}
