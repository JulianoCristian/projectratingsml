For the\n            Hunan portion, impacts of noise pollution will be mitigated\n            by setting up acoustic barriers, building fencing walls and\n            courtyard walls. Operation time of machines with intensive\n            noise sources will be adjusted. Air pollution will be\n            reduced by spraying water on roads being constructed and\n            mixing equipment should be sealed. Ecological resources will\n            be protected by avoiding to use farmland as earth borrow\n            area. Water loss and soil erosion caused by deep-digging and\n            high-filling will be mitigated by selecting wasteland and\n            areas with sparse vegetation as concentrated earth borrow\n            points. In Hubei, soil erosion can be prevented by planting\n            grass or sod on slopes and cutting sites. Noise pollution\n            will be reduced by proper maintenance of machines. Similar\n            measures as in Hunan will be adopted to minimize noise and\n            air pollution in Hubei. Water pollution will be mitigated by\n            constructing temporary channels or conduits for irrigation\n            and drainage. Vehicles carrying hazardous materials will be\n            asked to take designated routes and parking lots."}, "vol_title": "Hubei - environmental assessment and\n            action plan summary", "docdt": "1999-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
