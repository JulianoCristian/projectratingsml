F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The aim of the project was to increase economic activity along the Wuhan-Changsha
high-priority transport corridor through relieving congestion, facilitating trade and
mobility, and helping increase efficiency and traffic safety in northern Hunan and
southern Hubei provinces. The project development objectives were as follows: (1)
relieve traffic congestion and improve the mobility and integration of inter-provincial
trade and commerce between Hunan and Hubei Provinces by assisting in the
development of a key section of Chinas National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) in the
principal Beijing-Zhuhai corridor; (2) strengthen highway institutional capacity at the
Hunan and Hubei Provincial Communications Departments (HPCD) and related sector
institutions, through policy and institutional reform, provision of training, technical


                                             ii

assistance and equipment, in planning, finance, design, construction, operation and
maintenance of highway networks; (3) develop and sustain a policy dialogue in the two
key policy areas of the commercialization and corporatization of provincial toll road
authorities and of province-wide highway maintenance management; and (4) improve the
safety of road transport.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

Comments        Except for Zhengdian-Anshan, all sections show a decrease in traffic from the

(incl. %        1999 baseline survey. Given the significant economic development in China

achievement)    over this period, this confirms that much of the generated traffic has diverted to

Comments        The improvement in speeds is somewhat counterintuitive since there were no

(incl. %        major reductions in volume. They are partially explained by trucks carrying less

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At appraisal, China was growing at 8 to 10% p.a. and continues to do so now. This strong
economic growth is generating high growth in transport demand and a rapid shift toward
highway transport. However, China historically had underinvested in transport and its
road network ranked among the sparsest in the world relative to land area or population.
Governments at all levels embarked on a major highway investment and improvement
program. At the central level, the basic strategy was and still to develop a 35,000 km
National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) ­ now called the National Expressway
Network (NEN) ­ with expressway standards1. Sector work and OED's evaluation of
World Bank assistance in the highway sector conducted between 1997 and early 1999,
identified key sector issues which provided the contextual framework for the project.
These were: (a) expansion of highway capacity to remove bottlenecks and expedite socio-
economic development; (b) improvements in highway safety; (c) more effective highway
maintenance planning and implementation; and (d) commercialization of highway
administration.

Among the 35,000 km of the NEN, the Beijing to Zhuhai expressway (Jingzhu) had the
highest priority. This North-South expressway links the capital Beijing to Guangzhou, the
biggest city of Southern China on the Pearl River Delta and Zhuhai (near Macao).
Jingzhu is 2,500 km long and serves the capitals of Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan and
Guangdong provinces. In Wuhan, capital of Hubei province and biggest city of central
China, it connects with the East-West Chengdu-Shanghai expressway which also has a
high priority in NEN. The only highway link between Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou and
Zhuhai was the National Road 107, a two-lane highway with low characteristics, bearing
heavy traffic, mostly trucks at low speed, crossing many cities and villages. Accidents
and failures of vehicles were frequent and resulted in huge bottlenecks. Safety conditions
were poor and travel time was unforeseeable. This was a great obstacle for the
development of the economy of inner land provinces like Hubei and Hunan.

The Bank had been actively involved with this highway, helping China to build sections
in Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong provinces, with commitments totaling
more than US$1 billion: three National Highway projects were already approved and
ongoing with the construction of sections in southern Hebei and northern Henan (NH1),
southern Hunan and northern Guangdong (NH2), northern and central Hubei (NH3).
NH4 covered two of the last sections of Jingzhu still to be launched in southern Hubei
and northern Hunan, linking Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, with Changsha, capital of




1As described in "China's Expressways: Connecting People and Markets for Equitable Development".
EASTR Working Paper No. 7, August 2006, the current goal for the NEN is a network of some 80,000 km
by 2020.




                                                1

Hunan province, serving also Xianning and Puqi, big cities in southern Hubei and
Yueyang, an important city of northern Hunan.

NH4 was the second highway project for Hubei and Hunan provinces. Beside the
removal of bottlenecks along NR107, NH4 was expected to extend activities already
initiated under NH2 and NH3 projects in Hunan and Hubei in highway safety, highway
maintenance, and commercialization and corporatization of high-grade highways.

Private sector development for the Wuhan-Changsha expressway was considered and
discussed at great length with the central (SPCD, MOF, MOC) as well as provincial
authorities, but was discarded for a number of reasons. The major one being that there
was a growing evidence from around the world that greenfield toll road projects were
difficult to develop and finance from private sector sources, due to the risk profiles of
such projects. Toll road projects had failed for instance in Hungary and Mexico among
others. Built in the 1990s, they did not generate sufficient revenues to service the debt
and required substantial government bailouts.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The aim of the project was to increase economic activity along the Wuhan-Changsha
high-priority transport corridor through relieving congestion, facilitating trade and
mobility, and helping increase efficiency and traffic safety in northern Hunan and
southern Hubei provinces. This led to the following project developing objectives:

    (1) relieve traffic congestion and improve the mobility and integration of inter-
        provincial trade and commerce between Hunan and Hubei Provinces by assisting
        in the development of a key section of China's NTHS2 in the principal Beijing-
        Zhuhai corridor;
    (2) strengthen highway institutional capacity at the Hunan and Hubei Provincial
        Communications Departments and related sector institutions, through policy and
        institutional reform, provision of training, technical assistance and equipment, in
        planning, finance, design, construction, operation and maintenance of highway
        networks;
    (3) develop and sustain a policy dialogue in the two key policy areas of the
        commercialization and corporatization of provincial toll road authorities and of
        province-wide highway maintenance management; and
    (4) improve the safety of road transport. Key indicators focused on improvements to
        traffic levels and speeds, as well as reducing traffic accidents.

The Key Performance Indicators adopted were traffic flows, speeds and accident rate on
the existing parallel roads.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised. In 1999 some values for the performance indicators for Hubei
were formally revised to correct inaccuracies in the original documents. These are given
in Section F of the Data Sheet.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The major beneficiaries of the project are the long distance traffic and the local traffic
through strong reduction of the vehicle operating costs and time costs on the new
expressway and also on the existing highways. As a result of this lowering of transport
costs, existing activities become more competitive and new activities can be developed.
The total affected population in the expressway corridor between Wuhan and Changsha
in an indirect sense is estimated at about 40 million (based on 1997 data), about 22
million people living in northern Hunan and 18 million people living in southern Hubei.
Both PCDs were to benefit from institutional strengthening and training activities
covered by the project. As a result of institutional strengthening activities, better traffic
safety conditions, enhanced highway maintenance and operation management, benefits
would accrue to the whole provinces of Hubei and Hunan.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Construction of expressway and interconnecting roads (US$883.0 million
including contingencies)

Sub-Component 1.1: Construction of Hunan Tucheng ­ Changsha expressway section
(US$438.2 million including contingencies)

The Tucheng-Changsha Expressway (TCE) is a 183 km divided four lane, access
controlled toll highway, with a design speed of 120 km/h according to the plain rolling
terrain the expressway crosses. It connects in Changsha with the existing Changsha-
Xiangtan Expressway and at the Hubei border to the Zhengdian-Tucheng Expressway
(ZTE), also part of the project. The connecting point between TCE and ZTE had been
fixed by the agreement reached between Hunan and Hubei in 1994. TCE includes
construction of 11 interchanges, service areas, facilities for expressway administration
and maintenance and electrical and mechanical (E&M) installations for toll collection,
traffic monitoring, telecommunications and lighting.

Sub-Component 1.2: Construction of Hubei Zhengdian - Tucheng expressway section
(US$348.9 million including contingencies)

The ZTE is a 110 km divided four lane, access controlled toll highway, with a design
speed of 120 km/h according to the plain rolling terrain the expressway crosses. In the
north it connects with sections financed under NH3 and in the south with the TCE, also
part of the project. ZTE includes construction of six interchanges, service areas, facilities

for expressway administration and maintenance and electrical and mechanical (E&M)
installations for toll collection, traffic monitoring, telecommunications and lighting.

Sub-Component 1.3: Construction of Hunan interconnecting roads (US$19.5 million
including contingencies)

The project includes the completion of four Class II, two lane, interconnecting roads
totaling some 30 km and linking the expressway to the main cities and towns of the
corridor. For serving Yueyang city, the biggest city of northern Hunan, an agreement had
been reached with the Yueyang government that a 15 km Class I new road would be built
under a separate project, locally financed, and would open to traffic before TCE. Another
similar agreement with Changsha municipality for a 1 km Class II highway aimed at
serving the Xinsha development zone of Changsha. With other existing roads, the
expressway would be linked properly to the highway network and the cities and towns to
be served.

Sub-Component 1.4: Construction of Hubei interconnecting and other roads (US$43.5
million including contingencies)

The project includes the completion of four Class II, two lane, interconnecting roads
totaling 28 km and linking the expressway to the main cities and towns of the corridor.
With other existing roads, the expressway would be linked properly to the highway
network and the cities and towns to be served. The project also includes two roads in
Hubei which needed upgrading to class 2: (i) an East-West road linking Hongan city with
Jingzhu expressway in Dawu (northern Hubei) with a length of 69 km (including 5 km of
reuse of the existing road, 48 km of existing road rehabilitation and 16 km of new
alignment), and (ii) an East-West road linking Tongshan and Chongyang cities with ZTE
in Puqi with a length of 95 km (including 16 km of reuse of the existing road, 57 km of
road rehabilitation and 22 km of new alignment).

Sub-Component 1.5: Equipment (US$10.0 million including contingencies)

This sub-component includes equipment for i) control of construction quality and
monitoring of the environment; ii) operation and maintenance of ZTE and TCE after their
completion; iii) maintenance of the provincial road network including Road Data Base
(RDB) and Pavement Management System (PMS).

Sub-Component 1.6: Construction supervision services for expressway sections,
interconnecting roads and other roads (US$22.9 million including contingencies)

This covers the supervision of civil works and E&M works for ZTE and TCE, and
supervision of the civil works of the interconnecting and other roads in Hunan and Hubei.
International consultants assisted in the supervision of the construction of the
expressways; domestic engineers, technicians and other personnel, were also involved
with the expressway supervision, as well as being responsible for supervising the
interconnecting and other roads.

1.7 Other significant changes

In 1999 some values for the performance indicators for Hubei were formally revised to
correct inaccuracies in the original documents. These are given in Section F of the Data
Sheet.

The project proposed to construct a 1.7 km Class II road linking to the Linxiang
interchange. However, the local government decided that a very wide street was more
appropriate. The Class II road was therefore cancelled from the project and the street
implemented by the local government.

Since the funds were no longer required, in 2006 US$36.5 million were cancelled, with a
further US$1.1 million cancelled in 2007 after the loan closed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

A. Project Preparation

Consistency with government priorities and CAS. The project objectives were fully
consistent with the Government priorities and the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). A
major objective of the CAS was to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks. The project also
had strong support from central as well as provincial agencies. The local governments
and people met by Bank preparation missions also expressed their full support and
emphasized the need for the project to accelerate development of the area served by the
proposed roads.

The technical analyses undertaken during project identification and preparation were
sound. The project was designed taking into account the relevant economic, financial,
technical and institutional factors. This is elaborated on below under `Project Design'.
Detailed expressway traffic forecasts were developed on the basis of origin-destination
surveys and the expected tolls that would be charged on the expressway.

Safeguard Policies. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) were prepared by both provinces for the expressway and the
other roads included in the project and were found satisfactory to the Bank. The major
impacts of the project were expected during the construction period, including noise, soil
erosion and dust. Lesser impacts included interference with local people, traffic, and
irrigation systems. Proper mitigation measures were included in the EMP. Regarding
resettlement, the project design paid particular attention to minimize the impact on
agricultural land and on communities along the alignment.

To achieve these goals, the resettlement and environment teams of the project, supported
by Bank specialists were networked with the engineering design institutes. Significant
improvements in the alignment were achieved, thus reducing the impact of relocation and
adverse environmental effect on the communities along the route. Socioeconomic surveys
of the people and communities were conducted together with census of Project Affected
Persons (PAP) and their assets. Satisfactory Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) were
prepared. The affected communities were involved in the formulation and comparison of
alternative alignments as well as the location of interchanges, under passes and grade
separation. Local people were intensively informed and consulted through meetings with
local government representatives and public opinion questionnaires were supplemented
by interviews. Resettlement information booklets were distributed to inform PAPs of
their entitlement for compensation.

Policy Dialogue. Substantial efforts were made during project preparation to engage
Hunan and Hubei PCDs in a continuing policy dialogue, which started under NH2 and
NH3. During preparation, the Bank conducted a two-day highway policy workshop in
Wuhan which brought the senior management of both PCDs together to discuss necessary



                                               7

sector reforms in the two provinces. Very comprehensive monitoring plans were prepared
for institutional development and road safety.

B. Project Design

After an early reconnaissance in July 1995, NH4 project was identified in December
1995. The appraisal took place in March 1999, meaning a preparation period of more
than three years. It was the second highway project for both provinces. Only three years
passed between NH2 and NH4 in Hunan and less than one year between NH3 and NH4
in Hubei. When NH4 was prepared, works on NH2 in Hunan were ongoing and works on
NH3 in Hubei were only starting. So the design could not fully take into account lessons
learned during implementation of previous projects.

Road Components

Attention was focused on the design of the expressway sections from the onset of the
preparation works. The improvement of design quality control started in both provinces
under the NH2 and NH3 projects. Lessons from these two projects were applied to the
preparation of this project.

For the expressway sections, the Bank carefully visited the site, reviewed the design and
insisted that more alternatives be compared and optimized. Although this process
significantly increased the time allocated to preparation, it achieved the following:

        · The final Hubei alignment minimized the impacts on the flood diversion area
             (area used for diverting water of the Yangtze river during flood periods) and
             the total cost of ZTE was reduced by 25 %.
        · In Hunan, a shift of the originally proposed alignment in the north of
             Changsha allowed for the impacts on buildings and inhabitants of the Xinsha
             development zone to be greatly reduced.
        · In both Hubei and Hunan, a systematic optimization of the proposed
             alignment was undertaken at the final design stage substantially reduced the
             resettlement quantities.

Preparation of interconnecting roads and other roads received less the attention. It took
time to decide which roads would be part of the project. For interconnecting roads and
other roads, mostly principles were discussed. It was agreed that every interchange had to
be properly linked with the cities and towns it would serve through existing roads or new
interconnecting roads to be implemented. For other roads, after consideration of several
possible roads in Hunan, it was decided to cancel the other road component in this
province. In Hubei the two proposed roads were selected rather late in the process.

Training and Equipment Components

These components were designed as extensions of similar components under NH2 and
NH3.



                                               8

Institutional Strengthening Component

Having two successive highway projects in the same provinces was a great opportunity to
develop long lasting activities. Instead of thinking activities along a three year period, it
became possible to develop a much longer plan, about six years, for strengthening the
PCDs of both provinces, develop their knowledge on new concepts and new ways of
proceeding highway projects, and improve their efficiency and organization. A formal
document showing this plan had to be prepared and updated each year in each province.
Agreed activities covered five key issues:

Road traffic safety conditions. It was identified early that any activity in this area had to
involve the traffic police department beside the PCDs. The challenge was to find ways of
cooperation between these separate entities. NH2 and NH3 projects had initiated the
process through similar actions in both provinces. The activities included: (i) yearly road
safety seminars; (ii) manual on safety at work sites; (iii) safety audit procedures; (iv) pilot
safety program on black spots; (v) accident information system; and (vi) implementation
of a road safety unit in the PCDs,

Road maintenance. Various activities were undertaken in this area including: (i)
implementation of a road data base; (ii) study on road maintenance; and (iii) development
of competition in road maintenance.

Organization of toll expressway companies. NH2 and NH3 had launched studies on
various possible organizations; recommendations from these studies would be
implemented under NH4.

Transport system in the Wuhan ­ Changsha corridor. NH4 covering the two provinces of
Hubei and Hunan was a good opportunity to consider the Wuhan ­ Changsha corridor as
a whole. This was done through a study on transport and trade in the corridor.

Quality in all actions of PCDs. NH4 included implementation of a quality management
system in both PCDs with a special unit, quality control unit, in charge of implementing
this system.

C. Project Risks

The project was given a modest risk rating, with all risks estimated as modest or
negligible. This was fully justified given previous experience in the two provinces
involved and the great commitment for implementation of similar projects in China. The
key risks, and how they were addressed in the design, were as follows:

    · Ineffective training program (M): Bank ensuring training well designed and
        prepared with regular reporting to the Bank on training effectiveness.
    · Inadequate quality of construction (M): Selection of competent contractors
        through effective pre-qualification and adequate construction supervision.




                                               9

    · Delays in preparation and implementation (M): Support and follow up by
        MOC and Bank with effective launch workshop.
    · Unsuccessful policy, reform and/or traffic safety programs (M): Proper
        component design with ownership from PCDs as well as close supervision by the
        Bank.

2.2 Implementation

The project was successful in that it met the four project development objectives of
congestion alleviation, institutional strengthening, policy dialog and improved road safety.
The two NH4 expressways carry significant volumes of long-distance traffic and has
facilitated trade links between the two provinces. Travel times have been markedly
reduced and traffic has diverted from the existing roads to the expressway, thereby
improving the overall safety of the corridor.

However, the achievements were made in spite of a number of issues which arose during
implementation of the civil works and equipment procurement, as well as the institutional
strengthening program:

Civil Works and Equipment

    · Design Changes During Construction. In both provinces the original designs
        did not pay sufficient attention to the pavement structure, hydraulic and
        geological investigations, and there was insufficient dialogue with the local
        inhabitants to better understand local conditions. This resulted in various design
        changes, some of which were significant: (i) on the TCE the four concrete
        pavement contracts were replaced by asphalt which was used on the other eight
        contracts; (ii) for both expressways the asphalt pavement was made thicker
        because of recent collapses of pavement on some newly constructed highways
        and truck overloading; (iii) soil treatments were required along 54 km of the TCE
        for crossing of weathered granite area, and at the locations of many ancient mines
        which were not previously detected; and (iv) additional culverts and crossings
        were provided for local residents.
    · Delay in E&M Procurement for TCE. Delays in the domestic approval process
        meant that the expressway opened before the E&M equipment was completely
        installed and operational. E&M equipment was fully installed and tested only in
        December 2004, that is more than two years after the opening to traffic.
    · Pavement Contracts for ZTE. Implementation of the pavement was split
        between the nine ICB contracts, some of them being only long bridges totaling
        lengths of 4.9 or 6.5 km. Mobilizing large machines for implementing short
        sections of pavement was not considered as advisable, so following highway
        projects in Hubei included separate procurement for pavement with longer
        contracts.
    · Construction of Interconnecting and Other Roads in Hubei. During the
        implementation of the 69 km long Dawu-Hongan road it was found that the
        original design was too general and unsafe and was heavily revised. This delayed



                                              10

        the implementation. Stability problems, not identified during the design stage,
        were encountered during the implementation of the 95 km long Tongshan-Chibi
        road. Management of the 25 NCB contracts for subgrade proved to be difficult.
    · Hunan Equipment Procurement. Delays in agreeing upon specifications and
        other procurement aspects significantly delayed the equipment procurement,
        requiring the loan closing date to be extended by 18 months.

Institutional Strengthening/Capacity Building

    · Number of Studies. There were 11 activities in Hunan and 10 in Hubei related to
        studies and technical assistance. It was found that this ambitious number was
        difficult to implement and to supervise.
    · Co-ordination with other Projects. Many activities were based on achievements
        expected from the NH2 and NH3 projects, where some of which faced severe
        delays. Therefore the implementation of activities under NH4 was very slow and
        also faced many delays. However, in the end satisfactory outcomes were achieved.
    · Road Database Integration. A road data base was satisfactorily developed in
        addition of the pavement and bridge data bases developed under NH2 and NH3.
        Better integration with these pavement and bridge data bases would have been a
        plus.
    · Organization of Toll Expressway Companies. This activity faced various
        difficulties and was greatly delayed. It was replaced by a study on toll rates in
        Hubei. Both provinces were considering reforms in the administration of tolled
        highways and the process had a major impact on this activity.
    · Transport System in the Wuhan ­ Changsha Corridor. Institutionally it was
        difficult for two provinces to carry out one study so it was executed by Hubei
        province on behalf of both provinces.
    · Delays in Training. Overseas training and study tours were satisfactorily
        implemented in Hubei but delayed in Hunan due to domestic process of approvals.
        Part of the overseas training and study tours were finally combined and achieved
        during the project extension period.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project design adopted a series of physical targets for measuring progress. The M&E
indicators were selected so that they were meaningful, and the data was available or
could be reasonably collected. Baseline, intermediate and end of project indicators were
collected during the project by the PCDs and provided to the Bank. The selection of
appropriate M&E indicators, supported by good baseline data, has allowed for the
project's success to be confirmed.




                                             11

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Protection

The finished products on the two expressways show a pleasant environment. Many trees
have been planted along the alignment in both provinces in part to provide protection
against erosion. Hunan province received a prize from the National Environmental
Protection Agency and is so far the only highway project in China to have been so
honored.

Some environmental problems were noted during construction. In particular, contractor
camps had poor sanitary conditions for the workers, some dumped unsightly materials
and others did not spray trucks sufficiently to minimize dust. These deficiencies were
pointed out repeatedly by the Banks missions and there were gradual improvements,
particularly in workers camps. Areas of disposed material where eventually landscaped.
Monitoring of air, water and noise pollution found levels within the contractual limits.

Land Acquisition and Resettlement

Given their previous experience with Bank requirements, the two provinces were well
prepared so that resettlement activities proceeded fairly smoothly. There were some
delays in paying compensation in Hubei, but these were promptly remedied. The local
resettlement offices were fully staffed with experienced personnel. The project affected
persons (PAPs) were generally satisfied with the process and compensation they received.
For those re-housed, the new dwellings are typically of higher quality than their previous
homes and have better access to water and electricity. Living standards increased also as
households were able to diversify their production from rice to orchard cultivation.
Others, who could not get land found good work opportunities elsewhere.

Financial Management

The Financial Management for the project was conducted in accordance with the
arrangements agreed upon in the legal agreements. No major financial management
issues were encountered in the project. Even though the Bank reminded the client about
the implications of commitment fees, the client did not cancel the unused portion of the
loan earlier.

Procurement

The full range of procurement methods were used on the project (see Annex 11 of the
PAD). The expressway civil and E&M works as well as most equipment were procured
using ICB, were procured using ICB, and this constituted the bulk of the procurements.
NCB was used for annex areas, administration buildings, interconnecting and other roads.
The Bank did not finance land acquisition and resettlement. No major procurement issues
were identified in the project outside of the procurement of equipment for Hunan where




                                              12

delays in agreeing up on the specifications and undertaking bidding necessitated in the
loan having to be extended.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Traffic volumes are in accordance with the forecasts and growing very quickly. Although
traffic volumes are still well below where congestion arises, near major cities their rapid
growth may warrant widening in the long term. No measure has been taken into account
for this future widening, in particular none of the bridges were designed to allow for
widening.

There were a few problems in operating and maintaining the expressways since their
opening in 2002:

        · The expressway in Hunan operated for two years before installation of
            permanent E&M equipment and tolls were collected at temporary facilities.
        · It appears that the service and rest areas are too small and too few. They were
            very crowded since opening, and measures are needed to increase their sizes
            and numbers. Unfortunately, this was identified by the Bank team during
            preparation but the Bank's recommendations were not fully implemented by
            the designers.

The manuals and the training provided in the areas of quality control and road safety and
their application to date are good indications that the improvements are durable. The
switch of maintenance from force account to contract is unlikely to be reversed given the
advantages that have been noted in terms of cost and quality (see section 3.2).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Government of China has continued to place importance on the development of the
NEN. During the current 11th Five-Year Program (FYP) and upcoming 12th and 13th
FYPs, a further 45,000 km of the NEN are planned to be constructed.

The PDO were clear and in line with the Bank's CAS presented to the Board in March
1997 and the Progress Report of March 28, 1998. The PDO are in line with the Bank's
FY06-10 Country Partnership Strategies (CPS), in particular in its recommendations to:
(i) reduce internal and external barriers to trade and investment; (ii) reduce poverty,
inequality and social exclusion through expanding access to basic social and
infrastructure services; and (iii) manage resource scarcity and environmental challenges.
These were addressed by the following goals of the project:

    · The Wuhan-Changsha expressway is the central element of the Beijing-Zhuhai
        Expressway (2,500 km) which is Chinas highest priority north-south highway.
        The Bank had already heavily involved in the financing of other sections in the



                                              13

         corridor through the First, Second and Third National Highway Projects (NH1,
         NH2, and NH3), which were all progressing well at the time of appraisal of this
         project (NH4).
    · Besides priority infrastructure investments, the project also pursued and deepened
         the policy dialogue, commenced under previous projects in the two provinces, on
         various sector issues such as institutional strengthening and modern management
         of the highway system. This project had one of the most ambitious institutional
         programs of any highway project in China, addressing issues in quality control,
         road safety and maintenance management. It contributed towards policy and
         regulatory reforms in the highway sector in both provinces.
    · The development of all-weather access roads to remote/low income areas in poor
         counties.

The project objectives were, and remain, relevant given the continuous rapid economic
growth of the country and the commensurate growing transport demand.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project achieved its development objective of relieving congestion, facilitating trade
and mobility, and helping to increase efficiency and traffic safety in northern Hunan and
southern Hubei provinces.

A. Relieve congestion, facilitate mobility and help increase the efficiency and traffic safety
in Northern Hunan and Southern Hubei.

The ZTE in Hubei was opened in September 2002 and the LCE in Hunan in November
2002, together with all interconnecting roads. The quality of the works is very good and
particular attention was paid to traffic safety, building on the experience of NH2 and
NH3. The objective of reducing congestion on the parallel national road was met. Of the
total 2003 corridor traffic, the expressway took 71% in Hubei and 78% in Hunan. The
diversion rate was similar to that predicted. Travel time between the two provincial
capitals Wuhan and Changsha has been considerably reduced.

The project has also made a significant contribution to inter-provincial trade and
generated much traffic. In Hubei, traffic in the corridor more than doubled since 1998 and
in Hunan, it increased by more than 50%. Such increases could not have happened on the
national road which was reaching capacity before the project. While over 70% of the
traffic is trucks, licenses were also granted by both provinces for increased bus service
and there are now 15 daily buses running between Wuhan and Changsha, increasing
mobility in the corridor.

The economic benefits of the project are considered sustainable, without any predictable
risk, as traffic has been growing steadily since opening. The accident rate has fallen on
the parallel national road, below the target set in the performance indicators of the PAD
(see Section F of the Data Sheet). With completion of this link and a few others in
provinces north of Hubei, the Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway, linking the north and south of



                                               14

China over 2,500 km, is now open to traffic. For the two land-locked provinces in the
project, this provides them rapid access to the south China ports.

B. Strengthen highway institutional capacity at the Hunan and Hubei Provincial
Communications Departments.

The project focused on improving institutional capacity in three main areas, quality
control, road safety and road maintenance, with basically the same emphasis, same
studies and supporting training programs in the two provinces. Substantial progress was
achieved in all three areas in both provinces.

Quality Control. Both provinces have established quality control units within their PCDs.
Quality Control Manuals have been prepared and are widely distributed. The manuals
include checklists and tables to ensure that all important elements are considered. They
cover the entire project cycle from planning, engineering design, construction, and
maintenance. In all these aspects, there are also indicators to be met regarding
environmental protection and road safety.

In Hubei, for example, at the design stage of high grade highways, engineering designs
are reviewed three ways; by other HPCD design teams, by third party design engineers
and by the safety audit group. This organization was applied for the design and
implementation of various highway projects including the Bank financed Xiaoxiang and
Shiman expressways in Hubei. For these projects, the quality of design has improved and
cost overruns are very limited. However, for NH4, the organization was not yet in place
and the design included various weaknesses which had to be corrected during
implementation, inducing significant cost overruns (see section 3.2). Progress made with
design quality of expressways should now be extended to other kind of roads where the
design and implementation process, although improved, still include major weaknesses as
could be noted in the implementation of Xiaoxiang project interconnecting roads in
Hubei.

Road Safety. Both provinces have made significant progress in this area also. Road safety
units have been established under the Highway Administration Bureaus (HAB). All the
manuals listed in the PAD have been prepared and widely distributed, together with
training of staff and workers at construction and maintenance sites. A safety audit manual
has also been prepared and distributed. Both provinces continued to organize annual road
safety seminars, following a practice started under NH2 and NH3. A number of seminars
were attended by Bank supervision mission which found good attendance and quality
presentation of papers prepared for the occasion.

Black spot models were developed and tested in different areas and roads in both
provinces. Priority black spots were identified and selected for treatment. For instance in
Hunan province on National Highway 107, parallel to the new expressway, 50 black
spots were treated in 2003 and another 70 in 2004. This contributed to reducing accidents
by more than the benchmark set in the project indicators.




                                             15

Safety audits of expressway design are regularly conducted and changes have been made
in typical vertical and horizontal radius to increase sight distance. Accident analysis
systems are being developed further with the cooperation of the police. For instance in
Hubei, the HPCD has contracted the development and maintenance of its accident
analysis system to the Hubei Province Police College. It is clear that safety awareness has
greatly increased over the project period among highway personnel as well as in the
public at large. In Hunan, a Highway Safety Council has been established at the
Provincial level, under the leadership of a Vice-Governor of the province.

Highway Maintenance. Both provinces completed their study of maintenance cost and
fund allocation. The study was found useful to establish minimum acceptable
maintenance cost per kilometer of road of different classes. The provinces also further
developed their Pavement and Bridge Management Systems (PMS and BMS) and their
road data base. With the study results and the analysis provided by the PMS, the HABs
can now estimate their maintenance needs better than under the central planning system,
which specified expenditures per km regardless of the particular local road conditions.

However, the funds available for maintenance remain limited and the planning exercise
above remains theoretical for the time being. Routine maintenance is satisfactory, but
periodic maintenance is typically differed. It is estimated that the funds available cover
between 50 and 70% of the needs only. MOC has recently issued an instruction that
provinces should allocate at least 80% of their road maintenance fee revenues to
maintenance. In Hunan and Hubei, the present level is 65-70%. Clearly the first priority
in China has been road construction and it is only more recently, in provinces where
noticeable deterioration of roads is taking place, that maintenance is being given more
prominence.

Another major institutional change during the project period was the contracting out of
maintenance previously done by force account. The process is somewhat more advanced
in Hubei, where only routine maintenance in isolated mountainous areas is still done by
force account. In Hunan, all medium and major repairs are done by contract. For routine
maintenance, there is presently an internal competition among HAB maintenance units
for the works. This is to prepare the units for eventual separation from the Government
and their transformation in independent contractors. The change has been found
successful with costs down between 10 and 20% and quality improved, as a result of
incentives given to the workers for good work.

Training program. The training program was carried out in line with the PAD from 1998
to 2005. Staff was trained in the fields of highway planning, design, construction,
operation, finance and maintenance. The overseas training program ran from 1998 to
2005. Training was found by the PCDs to be very useful and trainees are applying what
they learned. Examples of this are the improved quality of preparation work in Hubei for
the subsequent Xiaoxian and Shiman Highway Projects, as well the application of the
traffic safety audit manual in Hunan Province.




                                              16

Procurement of equipment. The project procured US$7.75 m of equipment to help
improve the quality and effectiveness of construction and maintenance, to help
monitoring of the environment, to help operating ZTE and TCE after their completion.

C. Develop and sustain a policy dialogue in the two key policy areas of the
commercialization and corporatization of provincial toll road authorities and of province-
wide highway maintenance management.

Commercialization and corporatization of provincial toll road authorities. Studies on
these topics were completed in both provinces according to Bank's requirements. They
were found useful; however some of their recommendations could not be directly
implemented. For instance in Hunan, the responsibilities of HAB and the expressway
company have not been clearly separated yet. Both provinces are presently experiencing
with various form of management of their expressways. There are three basic formats: (a)
a provincial expressway company; (b) an investor's company which bought the
management rights; and (c) a joint-venture between the Government and the private
sector. In Hunan, there is even a fourth model being tested, the BOT construction and
management of a new expressway section.

The expressway sections built in each province under the project are for the time being
managed by a provincial company. In Hubei, this is the same company which already
manages the section built under NH3, the Yangtze Bridge and a section built by the
province. This gives them the management of the entire length of the Beijing-Zhuhai
expressway in the province, 340 km from the Henan to the Hunan border. In Hunan, the
section built under NH2, previously managed by the provincial company, was sold to a
local investor's company. While the various expressways in a province are managed by
different companies, a uniform toll collection system has been introduced by each
province and a clearing house distributes the proceeds of toll collection to each company
according to the distance traveled on its section.

All the measures taken to improve safety under the project have been presented in B

3.3 Efficiency

Net Present Value/Economic rate of return

The economic evaluation covers the two expressway sections, including the interchanges
and connecting roads, and the other roads in Hubei. Both costs and benefits reflect
December 2006 prices. The results are summarized in the following table and the details
are in Annex 3.

In Hubei, the EIRR and ENPV are higher than estimates due to costs being lower and
traffic higher than estimated in the PAD. The situation is reversed in Hunan were costs
were higher (see Annex 3) and traffic lower. In 1998, traffic on the national road
paralleled by the expressway was lower in Hubei (5,800 vehicles/day (veh/day) than in
Hunan (7,000 veh/day) but total corridor traffic (National road plus expressway) grew
faster in Hubei to reach over 14,000 veh/day in 2005 versus over 11,000 veh/day in
Hunan. The traffic diversion is as forecast, over 70% in both provinces. It is somewhat
higher in Hunan province, possibly because no penalties are levied yet on the expressway
for overloaded trucks (see section 5.2).

Financial rate of return

Both sections of the expressway opened in the fall of 2002. Hunan and Hubei provincial
expressway companies assumed the day-to-day management, operations and maintenance
of the expressway. As shown in Annex 3, the main income of these companies is from
tolls charged to the road users. The toll rates are set by each province and are uniform for
all the expressways in the province, regardless to the form of management (public, joint-
venture or private). Based on current toll rates, the companies are generating enough
revenues to finance operation and maintenance and to service the Bank and domestic
loans, which amount to three quarters of the fixed assets.

The detailed financial analysis is presented in Annex 3 and summarized as follows:

         Component                                PAD                               ICR

Note: FCI is the Financial Cost of Capital which was used to calculate the FNPV.

Cost comparison

At appraisal, the total project cost, including contingencies and land acquisition, was
estimated at US$952 million, of which US$350 million (37%) was to be financed by the
Bank loan. The total actual project cost US$891 million is 94% of the estimate. The
actual costs were higher than estimated in Hunan, US$567 million versus US$519

million and substantially lower in Hubei US$324 million versus US$433 million.
Detailed cost tables are in Annex 3.

The civil works for the construction of the expressway, accounting for almost three
quarter of the total project costs, were 7% higher than estimated in Hunan and 28% lower
in Hubei. However, on a per kilometer basis there was only a 10% different in the costs--
US$2.1 million/km in Hubei vs. US$2.3 million/km in Hunan. Besides the fact that
Hunan adopted a more realistic cost estimate than Hubei, there were technical reasons for
higher costs in Hunan:

    · The change of the pavement design in Hunan from concrete pavement to more
        expensive asphalt pavement.
    · In Hubei farm populations live in concentrated villages, while in Hunan, farm
        houses are spread out in the fields. Therefore, to serve the more dispersed
        population, the number of overpasses and under passes was much higher in
        Hunan than in Hubei, adding to the cost.
    · The topography of Hunan is more hilly and construction is typically more
        expensive that in flatter areas.

Note:   1/ The cost of the expressway only, excluding annex areas and E&M works.

In both provinces, the cost of interchange roads was substantially higher than estimated
as these roads were usually completed at higher standards than originally planned, to
accommodate development generated by the expressway.

Given the lower cost in Hubei, the province could have cancelled part of the loan to save
commitment charges but they did not. Since the project was extended at the request of
Hunan province, the Hubei activities were completed by the original loan closing date,
eighteen months earlier than the final project closing date, and the remaining funds for
Hubei cancelled at that time.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

This assessment is based on a review of achievements of the four main objectives given
in section 3.2, and the economic and financial returns in section 3.3. Key performance
indicators benchmarks have generally been met or exceeded. Traffic diversion to the
expressway has relieved congestion on the parallel national road and accidents on this
road have been reduced more than expected. Details are in Section F of the Data Sheet. In



                                                 19

addition, the institutional strengthening activities generated the expected strengthening of
key capacities in the Hubei and Hunan PCDs.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty reduction was not listed among the major objectives of the project. However, as
indicated in section 1.4, as a result of the lowering of transport costs, existing activities
become more competitive and new activities can be developed. The total affected
population in the expressway corridor between Wuhan and Changsha in an indirect sense
is estimated at about 40 million (based on 1997 data), about 22 million people living in
northern Hunan and 18 million people living in southern Hubei. Creation of new
activities and increase of competitiveness of existing activities is a powerful tool for
increasing the GDP per capita and therefore helping reducing poverty.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional strengthening impact, defined as the extent to which it has improved the
PCD's ability to make use of their human and financial resources, is rated as satisfactory.
As described in Section 3.2, there were five main areas of focus: implementation of
quality control system, improving road traffic safety conditions, establishing competitive
maintenance, supporting training programs, and procurement of equipment. Lasting
progress was achieved in all five areas.

Quality control system and organization has been used by both provinces for their next
highway projects. Preparation and implementation of Bank financed Xiaoxiang and
Shiman highway projects in Hubei were greatly facilitated by the experiences gained
under NH4 project.

Cooperation with traffic police for improving road safety conditions is routinely
maintained, especially in Hubei where continuous efforts were developed under
Xiaoxiang and Shiman highway projects. Hubei is now establishing with the help of the
Bank a Road Traffic Safety Training Center and has become one the most advanced and
experienced province for road traffic safety in China. Hunan has continued to run the
road traffic safety seminars even after they had completed the project's requirements.

Both PCDs have shown great commitment for developing competition in highway
maintenance. Skills developed in the training programs are being used by staff. The
procured equipment is in use.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Lessons learned under NH4 project have been taken into account in other highway
projects. For example, implementation of pavement is now routinely contracted under
separate contracts with sufficient lengths in Hubei, after it was discovered that pavement
implementation requires rather different skills and equipment from the ones needed for


                                               20

subgrade implementation activities. More attention has been paid in the design of annex
areas in expressway projects designed after NH4.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible

The quality of construction is good; the rapid and continuing traffic growth in the
corridor served by the project, combined with large time-savings and reduced congestion,
indicates that the economic benefits are sustainable. Given the overloading problem (see
section 3.2), maintenance costs will be higher than it would otherwise be. However, the
revenues should be sufficient to cover the costs. The manuals and the training provided in
the areas of quality control and road safety and their application to date are good
indications that the improvements are durable. The switch of maintenance from force
account to contract is unlikely to be reversed given the advantages that have been noted
above in terms of cost and quality.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Project preparation was thorough and methodical. All Bank missions included an
expressway design specialist and a policy and institutional expert from the Swedish Road
Administration. All engineering designs and technical bidding documents, including cost
estimates for the proposed expressway and related roads, including their E&M facilities
were reviewed by international engineering consultants under grant funding from Italy
and Spain. Quality control manuals, prepared under previous projects, were also used
during construction. Substantial efforts were made during project preparation to engage
Hunan and Hubei PCDs in a continuing policy dialogue, which started under NH2 and
NH3. During preparation, the policy and institutional expert conducted a two day
highway policy workshop in Wuhan which brought the senior management of both PCDs
together to discuss necessary sector reforms in the two provinces. Very comprehensive
monitoring plans were prepared for institutional development and road safety.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision followed through not only on the physical construction aspects of the project
but also on the institutional aspects. Although there were three different task managers


                                             21

from preparation to completion, their approach was very consistent. The expressway
engineer and institutional/road safety specialist consultants, which had participated in the
preparation, remained involved in every supervision mission. These missions were
coordinated with the borrower's annual workshops on institutional development and road
safety so that the Bank's expert could take part. Guidance was provided on project
financed studies and on the management changes being introduced by the provinces, as
discussed above (3.2). The Bank also carried out close supervision of the environment
and the resettlement action plans and made many suggestions for improvements over the
course of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The preparation and supervision teams paid adequate attention to compliance with the
Bank policies on environment and resettlement. In terms of institution building, the
advice of the preparation and supervision teams, was appreciated and generally followed
in both provinces.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the Government during project preparation and implementation was
satisfactory. This was a repeater project in both provinces so the familiarity with Bank
requirements and procedures helped project preparation and execution. The Government
was fully committed to the project which was contributing to the completion of the major
north-south corridor expressway in China. All land for the project was acquired in good
time so that construction was not delayed as indicated by the early completion of both
sections of the expressway.

Internal clearance of bidding documents remains cumbersome, particularly for equipment.
Documents prepared by the provinces have to go through a number of different national
agencies, each with its own requirement and peculiarities and the process is too long.
This resulted in some slippage in Hunan on the E&M bidding documents and the
expressway had to be operated without this equipment for two years.

Overloading of trucks remains a serious problem in China. This is a national problem
which cannot be addressed separately by each province. The expressway companies have
no right to force overloaded trucks to stop and unload. The police do that for grossly
overloaded trucks, which they spot while on patrol and divert to a weighing station.
However, these stations are too few and far between to have a serious impact. They are
also too small to impound more than a sample of the violators. Some provinces have
started levying higher tolls on overloaded trucks, but even a doubling or tripling of the
toll rate does not come near matching the amount of damage done to the road by the extra
heavy vehicle, since damage increases with the fourth power of the axle load. The toll


                                             22

surcharge is already applied in Hubei and Guangdong, which border Hunan in the north
and the south. After much debate, Hunan decided to implement this policy from October
2006.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

    Implementing
       Agency                                     Performance

                          Overall, the performance of the implementing agencies in the
                          two provinces was good. Both PCDs demonstrated
                          commitment to achieve project objectives, including not only
                          construction, but also institutional development through
                          project financed studies, workshops and training programs.
                          For instance, road safety workshops were conducted annually
                          in both provinces from 2000 to 2004. Construction of the
                          expressway was completed ahead of schedule and revenues
                          generated promptly, thus making a very efficient use of

  Hubei and Hunan         borrowed funds.

  Provincial
  Communications          In Hubei the project was completed by the end of 2004, six

  Departments             months ahead of the original closing date. In Hunan, there
                          were procurement delays in E&M and in carrying out
                          training abroad. Little equipment was procured by the
                          closing date and a one year extension was requested,
                          followed by another request for six months, bringing the
                          closing date from June 30, 2005 to December 31, 2006. In
                          every province, the political pressure remains very high to
                          complete the expressways in the shortest time possible and
                          PCDs management tend to concentrate primarily on this
                          part of the projects. This seems to have affected Hunan
                          more than Hubei.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The preparation and supervision teams paid adequate attention to compliance with the
Bank policies on environment and resettlement. In terms of institution building, the
advice of the preparation and supervision teams, was appreciated and generally followed
in both provinces.

6. Lessons Learned

There is no particular advantage in combining two provinces into one project.

It would have been better to have two separate projects rather than a single two-province
project, from both a preparation/supervision point of view and in terms of
implementation. With regard to preparation/supervision:

    · There were no significant savings in effort or cost when preparing a two-province
         project compared with two separate single province projects.
    · Since supervision budgets are based on the project, and not the number of
         provinces involved, this made it more difficult to supervise the project within the
         available budget.
    · Although Hubei finished all their activities in accordance with the original
         schedule, Hunan required two loan extensions to complete the training and
         equipment procurement.

During implementation, each province was focused on their own activities. There were
few interactions or exchanges of knowledge and experience between the two provinces,
as illustrated by two examples below. The only study covering both provinces was the
Hunan-Hubei transport and trade integration study. Instead of a joint study, which would
have been bureaucratically cumbersome, the study was carried out by Hubei province,
with no input by Hunan. A traffic accident model developed by Hunan could not be
shared with Hubei, so Hubei developed their own.

Studies dealing with matters beyond the control of the PCDs have little relevance.

Studies that would require the participation and involvement of government agencies
which are not part of the project are difficult for the PCDs to carry out. Furthermore, their
recommendations have little chance to be acted upon and implemented. In this project,
this is illustrated by the transport and trade integration study, which was carried out
perfunctorily by Hubei to meet the Bank's requirement.

When reforms are incorporated as part of project preparation, it takes longer to prepare
the project

The borrowers complained that project preparation took two years despite previous
experience with the Bank. Preparation focused on developing and agreeing upon a broad
policy and institutional reform program for each province. This program, building on
previous projects developments, was extremely detailed (12 pages of Annex 4 of the
PAD) and obviously took time to prepare and agree. Clearly, the Bank still faces
difficulties in convincing its Chinese clients of the value of reforms, when compared with
the more tangible economic benefits of civil works and equipment. The Chinese prefer to
begin their reforms with pilot experiments and check their results, rather than relying on
studies recommendations to make wholesale changes upfront. This is best illustrated by
their approach to expressway management where they are testing different models as
described in section 3.2. They consider this has more value than the repeated

commercialization and corporatization studies that are standards of Bank expressway
projects.

Procurement award to the lowest bidder can create problems, in spite of the pre-
qualification process.

Given the highly competitive construction industry, bids are sometimes well below the
estimates and clearly unrealistic. The award to the lowest bidder even in such cases
inevitably leads to problems during execution, with the contractor unable to perform as
per its contract. Prequalification is not sufficient to control this problem. The Bank
should find ways to allow declaring bids unresponsive when prices are unrealistically low,
as is done in several developed countries. China should also find ways to black list
contractors who are not performing well and in accordance with their contract. Poor
performance in one province by a contractor is ignored in other provinces that can select
the same contractor team for another project.

Putting subgrade and pavement implementation in the same contract is questionable

The lengths of ICB civil work contracts were in a range from 12 to 20 km in Hunan and 5
to 19 km in Hubei. These lengths appeared too short for justifying the use of
sophisticated machinery for implementing pavement. Risks of low quality for pavement
were increased. It would have been more appropriate to have separate ICB pavement
contracts with a length between 30 to 40 km.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The award of contracts to the lowest bidder can often be problematic. As discussed in
Section 6, sometimes lowest bids are very far from the estimates and there is little chance
that the contractor will fulfill its contractual responsibilities. Prequalification is not
sufficient to cover this problem. There are anecdotal suggestions that because of this,
better contractors not bidding for World Bank financed projects in China. Many agencies
have adopted procedures to address this issue, for example, in Virginia USA when the
low bid is greater than 25% below the Engineer's Estimate and 25% below the second
place bidder, the contractor presenting the lowest bid is to be contacted to discuss his bid.
This is an important issue which is arising on numerous Bank projects and needs to be
addressed.

The number of institutional strengthening activities, and their duplication in two
provinces, was questioned by the PCDs. It important to recognize that in China, a
province is equivalent in size to many countries and so the local conditions and issues,
even between adjacent provinces, can be quite different. However, it is important to
recognize that the number of activities should be based not only on local needs, but on
the capacity of the PCDs to absorb and implement the outcomes. With the NH4 project
being done at the same time as the NH2/NH3 projects, the agencies were challenged at
times by the demands of the institutional strengthening programs.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Construction of Expressway and Interconnecting Roads (PAD estimate US$883.0
million, including contingencies; ICR actual US$769.9 million)

A. Construction of Hunan Tucheng ­ Changsha Expressway and Interconnecting Roads
(PAD estimate US$457.8 million, including contingencies; ICR actual US$488.6 million)

Works were completed some 5 to 6 months ahead of the contractual deadline. The quality
of construction was found to be very good, with a smooth pavement, and much attention
having been paid to safe design. Procurement of E&M however took a very long time.
Documents initially prepared for one step bidding had to be redone for two steps at the
request of MOC, and the software specifications had to be changed to accommodate the
unified toll collection system being introduced by the province The equipment finally
became operational in October 2004, two years after the opening of the expressway. In
the meantime, toll collection was operated manually. Because of rapid traffic increase
and the high proportion of trucks, the rest area parking spaces are becoming congested.
This has been drawn to the attention of the HNPCD. While they are conscious of the
problem, the rest stops are already at the maximum area allowed by the MOC standards,
which try to minimize the further loss of agricultural land. Negotiations are continuing
between various agencies to find a solution.

B. Construction of Zhengdian-Tucheng Expressway, Interconnecting and Other Roads in
Hubei (PAD estimate US$392.4 million including contingencies; ICR actual US$281.3
million)

Expressway and connecting roads works were completed 9 months ahead of the
contractual deadline. Additional works carried out by the contractors during the one year
liability period were limited to some environmental protection. The quality was found to
be very good by supervision missions visiting the road in 2003. This was confirmed by
the Ministry of Communications (MOC) who awarded a prize to Hubei Province for that
road. Procurement and installation of the E&M system also proceeded smoothly and in
timely fashion, so that all equipment was operational by the opening of the expressway.
Preparation of documents started early for the two stage bidding method which was used
satisfactorily. The shortage of parking spaces in rest areas is less acute in Hubei as
truckers seem to prefer to stop in Hunan.

Although works on the two other roads in Hubei started later, they were completed in
2004, well within the implementation of the project. The Tongshan-Chibi road, passing
through mountainous areas, faced some initial quality problems in the road works as well
as in the environmental treatment. This was pointed out by Bank supervision missions
and deficiencies were satisfactorily corrected.




                                             29

C. Equipment (PAD estimate US$10.0 million including contingencies; ICR actual US$7.8
million)

Procurement of equipment for Hubei province was satisfactorily completed in 2002. In
Hunan, equipment procurement ran into much procrastination and indecision. "Final"
lists of equipment were successively submitted to the Bank for approval and subsequently
revised. A first request for a one year extension of the entire project (to June 30, 2006)
was granted by the Bank, but no equipment was purchased by the revised closing date
and a further 6 month extension to December 31, 2006 was granted. Equipment was
finally bought before the end of 2006.

D. Construction Supervision Services (PAD estimate US$22.9 million including
contingencies; ICR actual US$19.0 million)

In both provinces, the construction supervision services were provided by domestic
consultants supported by small teams of foreign consultants. The international
consultants shared international experience and assisted the domestic consultants with the
application of the FIDIC standards of contract management. The performance of both
domestic and foreign consultants was found satisfactory.

2. Studies/Technical Assistance and Training (PAD estimate US$4.9 million
including contingencies; ICR actual US$8.0 million)

The studies under the project were extension of studies started under NH2 in Hunan and
NH3 in Hubei. They covered in each province: highway maintenance management,
costing and funding and expressway commercialization. A third study covered the
Hunan-Hubei transport and trade integration. It was decided that the latter would be
managed by Hubei Province and that the results would be shared with Hunan. All studies
were eventually completed satisfactorily, albeit beyond schedule, and in some cases after
much prodding by the Bank. This illustrates one more time the difficulty for the Bank to
convince its Chinese clients of the value of technical assistance and studies when
compared with the more tangible outputs of civil works and equipment. Studies are often
theoretical and offer little practical advice related to the immediate preoccupations of the
clients. Some of the recommendations are not within the competence of the PCDs to
implement. Similar studies are repeated time and again in different provinces, with no
impact on national policies set by MOC. This contrasts with the practical approach taken
with assistance in the areas of quality control and road safety (details are in section 5.1).
In these two areas, manuals of good practices have been prepared and tested over
previous projects. They were adopted in this project and widely disseminated
accompanied by training sessions, seminars and workshops.

Training activities were eagerly pursued in both provinces and the number of man-
months of training attended domestically and abroad met the targets set in the PAD. It
was completed earlier in Hubei than in Hunan, due to problems found in the latter
province with allowances for overseas travel set by the province and MOF. The financial
problem was eventually solved and training started in 2004 and was completed in 2006.


                                               30

In addition to the formal training program, the staff of both provinces acquired valuable
experiences in the construction of expressways, supervision of the works, and in the
application of the safeguard policies.

3. Front-end Fee (PAD Estimate US$3.5 million; ICR actual US$3.5 million)

4. Land acquisition and resettlement (PAD estimate US$60.6 million; ICR actual
US$82.7 million)

Tables A2.1 and A2.2 present the summary land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) data
for Hubei and Hunan. The Hubei data shows an inconsistency wherein there was a 30%
increase in the house area, for only a 2% increase in the number of households. Upon
investigation it was learned that there as data collection error in Hubei insofar as the
number of households only included those within the `red line' of the highway alignment.
However, the house area included all the houses demolished as part of the project. One
would expect the number of households to increase in a similar manner to the house
area--as was observed in Hunan where a 26.7% increase in house area corresponded to a
23.2% increase in the number of households.

    The ZTE (Hubei) opened the new toll highway in September 2002. While the total
    corridor traffic was similar to the PAD's estimates in 2003 (see Table A3.2), the traffic on
    the new highway was only about 90% of the PAD's estimates. After four years of
    operation, in 2006, both the total corridor traffic and the traffic on the new highway have
    improved to about 22-27% higher than that of the PAD's estimate. The expressway
    diversion ratio (the portion of the road users using the expressway) during 2002-2006
    also is improved. This reveals that the road users are gradually accepting the toll
    expressway concept. For the long term traffic forecast, it is estimated that the average
    annual traffic growth rate will be 4.3- 4.8% from 2006 - 2030. In the PAD, the annual
    growth rate forecast is 5.8%.

    The TCE (Hunan) opened to traffic in November 2002. The total corridor traffic and the
    traffic on the new expressway for 2003 were about 59% and 62%, respectively, of the
    PAD's estimates (see Table A3.2). However, the expressway diversion ratio for 2003 was
    estimated to be 78% which is higher than the PAD's forecast of 75%. This reveals that the
    road users of the TCE have accepted the toll road concept faster then the PAD's estimate.
    Despite the lower traffic demand from the starting, the traffic growth rate on the new
    expressway (19.7%) is higher than the PAD estimate (5.5%) during 2003 - 2006. The
    total corridor traffic growth rate (22.9%), during the same period, is also higher than the
    PAD's estimate (5.5%). The long term expressway traffic forecast (2006 - 2030) is
    estimated to be about 1.5-3.9% which is lower than the PAD's estimate of 5.5%.

Project Implementation

Project Implementation Agency

The HPCD established the World Bank Financed Project Management Office (PMO) in
June 1995 to prepare the project. In July 1998 the People's Government of Hubei
Province founded the Hubei Jingzhu expressway construction headquarters and Hubei
Jingzhu expressway Chief Engineer's Office, in charge of the implementation of each
component in this project. The Hubei Jingzhu expressway Chief Engineer's Office had
technical, engineering, financing, machine & material, and land acquisition and
resettlement divisions, as well as laboratories and an administrative office. This
monitored and managed construction, handled procurement, checked significant design
variations, and were responsible for land acquisition and resettlement.

Project Preparation

From 1994, some national ministries and commissions, The People's Government Of
Hubei Province, HPCD and other related organizations participated in formulating a plan
for highway projects in Hubei province. In July 1997 the State Planning Commission
approved in document No.1037 the project recommendation report. In 1999, the
evaluation of "feasibility study report on JingZhu NH mainline in Hubei province of
south segment" was approved along with the preliminary design. Simultaneously, in 1993,
the State Planning Commission presented options for the project as the World Bank loan
project and in April 1999, the loan negotiations were completed. The loan amount for
Hubei was US$150 million.

NH4 was designed by the Hubei Provincial Communications Planning & Design Institute.
During construction, they had a team at the site in charge of variations and adjusting the
drawings.

Project Construction

The total length of NH4 is 110 km, which was divided into nine subgrade contract
sections. Contractors were selected using ICB. Nine contract sections started to construct
in March 2000, and passed the takeover acceptance at September 21, 2002, opened to
traffics for trial circulating on the 28th, through the completion acceptance in August
2004.The quality and comprehensive mark of project have marked well by completion
acceptance committee.




                                               50

Construction Supervision

NH4 was the second World Bank financed highway project in Hubei province. As per the
World Bank's requirements, and international practice, the FIDIC Contract Conditions
were adopted for construction management. The project supervision has adopted the
three-tier structure management, i.e. the chief engineer led chief engineer's office, senior
site engineer's office and site engineer's office. A supervision team comprised of Chinese
and foreign engineers was established to supervise the construction progress. The overall
performance of the supervision team was satisfactory in the project, taking into account
the management of quality, cost, progress control, contracts and information.

Equipment Procurement

Equipment purchased for the NH4 project were divided into two batches and purchased
by the ICB. This equipment was successfully implemented.

E & M Works

The E&M component of the project was designed by Highway Research Institute of
MOC and HBCPDI. It was procured using ICB. During the pre-qualification period, 13
tenders submitted but only six passed. After bidding the system was successfully installed
and is currently operating effectively.

Project Closure

The project was closed smoothly at the planned date.

Environmental Monitoring and Acceptance

Close attention was paid to the environment monitoring during the construction period.
Monitoring of air, noise and water quality was undertaken. Periodically, based on the
monitoring results, remedial measures were adopted to ensure compliance with the
specifications. This served to minimize the negative environmental impact of the project.
After the opening of the expressway, monitoring the atmosphere environment along road,
(TSP, CO, NOx), noise, surface water environment (SS, BOD5, CODcr, petroleum
series) was undertaken which showed continued compliance. A benefit of these
monitoring activities was the increased awareness of the HPCD team on environmental
issues and better understanding the needs for environmental protection on expressways.

The NH4 acceptance check on the environment was undertaken in December 2003 by the
State Environmental Protection Agency and the Hubei Environmental Protection Agency.
The results were satisfactory. The expressway satisfied all the conditions and standards
which the state environmental protection required.

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).

The "Beijing-Zhuhai National Highway Main-line of South Section in Hubei
Environmental Impact Report" was completed in July 1998. The State Development
Planning Commission approved the environmental impact report with " No.313
document (1998) issued by environmental protection bureau " in Aug, 12, 1999. In Dec,
2003, the Hubei Beijing-Zhuhai National Highway construction headquarters compiled
the "Completion of Beijing-Zhuhai National Highway Main-line of South Section in
Hubei Project Environmental Protection Executing Report". This was accepted by the
Bank as confirming compliance with the EIA agreements.

Training

The NH4 training program was implemented and organized by the PMO. The training
activities gave priorities to the following fields: project management, procurement
procedures, contract management, environmental protection, resettlement, traffic
engineering, construction supervision, financial reimbursement, road network planning,
highway maintenance and operation, road safety, quality control, training management,
etc. These were selected after carefully considering the needs for the HPCD headquarters
and its sub-organizations. The training had played very important roles in improving the
quality of the staff in communications organizations in Hubei.

The summary of training implementation was detailed in the following table:

Land Acquisition and Resettlement

Under the guidance of the World Bank experts, before the implementation of project, the
HPCD established a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). During implementation, this was
strictly adhered to. The external monitor and the World Bank's resettlement specialist
closely monitored compliance with the RAP. The results were satisfactory. The NH4
project permanently acquired 766 ha of land, relocated 139,379 m2 of buildings, and
provided US$26.5 million in compensation. The monitors found that the project has led
to the economic development along the route, improved the PAPs housing levels and the
housing quality have been greatly enhanced. The socio-economic structure has been
optimized and upgraded; the income of peasants has kept the same level of growth with
the overall areas.

Project Achievements

Achievement of related objectives

The project was very successful through completing the expressway, interconnecting and
other roads ahead of schedule.

Quality Achievement

According to the FIDIC Contract Conditions, the construction supervision organization
was established to control the progress, quality and expenses. In the progress control the
HPCD established the detailed construction organization plan, taking the control point as
the breakthrough, standardizing management, responding scientifically, enabling the
project to be completed ahead of schedule. With regard to the quality control, strictly
carrying out three-level quality guarantee system, relying on scientific and technological
innovation, promoting the concept of project quality through project checking and
acceptance, the project quality is excellent. For expense control, according to the
technical requirement optimizing and altering the design to reduce the project investment,
as well as strictly measuring and making payments to guarantee the project continued,
resulted in much lower than forecast costs.

Financial Achievement

After NH4 was open to traffic in 2002, the HPCD established the administrative office of
Beijing-Zhuhai Highway in Hubei to be responsible for highway operation, management
and maintenance. After over four years of operation, the highway condition is still good.
Since opening, the traffic volume has been rapidly increasing with an average growth rate
was over 14; The income increased from 50 million RMB in 2002 to 664 million RMB
in 2006, an annual average growth rate of over 36. The main reason for above rapid
growth is the rapid development of the national economy and the obvious advantage of
the highway in saving travel time and operating costs when compared with alternatives,
especially NR107. An additional benefit has been the resolution of the traffic congestion
problems on NR107.



                                             53

Safety Achievement

After NH4 opened, there was a significant improvement in traffic safety on NR107.

Operation Capacity

Through the careful attention to maintenance, the pavement distress has been minimized,
and safety hazards eliminated in a timely manner. With the constant improvement in
relevant facility, the highway service has improved gradually.

Works of the World Bank

Cooperation with the Bank

It has been over 10 years since NH4 was placed to the list of World Bank financed
highway projects in Hubei. There have now been a total of four highway projects
financed by the World Bank. During this period, the cooperation between HPCD and the
World Bank was close and effective.

Due to the differences in economic development and cultural background, in the
implementation process of this project there was some different views with regard to
engineering design, construction management, land acquisition, resettlement,
environment protection, etc. The World Bank missions and the HPCD had good dialog
on these issues. This helped the World Bank to have a better understanding of actual
situation in China and Hubei and enabled a suitable operating procedure to be identified.
The HPCD also relied on the World Bank missions during the preparation and
implementation of this project, to bring in advanced concepts and scientific development
view in engineering design, construction, resettlement, environment protection,
institution reinforcement and trade policy reform.

Deeper understanding for FIDIC Contract Conditions and benefits obtained from it

Since the World Bank financed NH3, ICB was used for procurement and supervision
engineers were used to manage the project in accordance with the FIDIC Contract
Conditions. The project adopted strict technical and organizational measure for the
project management and control, as well as considering the situation of China and Hubei
province.

The procurement practice of the Bank requires that the contract be awarded to the lowest
bidder. At the beginning, HPCD held cautious attitude to the request whether it was
effective and appropriate. However, with the steady development and improvement of
China market economy, procurement regulation of the Bank and FIDIC Contract
Conditions had been widely accepted in Hubei province at present. Currently, The Hubei
provincial highway construction management was in the light of FIDIC Contract
Conditions. The award to the lowest bidder can often be problematic.



                                             54

Benefits obtained from training program

In most of the training projects, the participants were engineers and technical personnel.
The design of a reasonable training course should keep pace with foreign management
experience and practices that would be useful, especially considering the special
circumstance of Hubei Province. Through training, the new technology, new knowledge,
new approaches from abroad will be used and promulgated by person being trained. In
addition, the training plan gave the opportunity to engineer and administrative personnel
to improve upon and renew their knowledge, and expand their field of vision. This is
considered to be the key factor in the growth of intelligence.

Improvement of environmental consciousness

The environmental protection in highway construction is very important. In each step of
the project identification, preparation and implementation, HPCD strictly followed
China's and the World Bank's environmental protection law, regulation and requirements.
NH4's achievement in environmental protection at present was not only due to the
continuous development and improvement of China's environmental protection policy, as
well as the strengthening of environmental design, but also due to the World Bank
environmental protection expert guidance and strict monitoring of the implementation
phase in the project implementation stage. In the project implementation process, staff in
HPCD and relevant contractor's paid great attention to environmental protection. The
enhancement of environmental awareness is very advantageous to the implementation of
China's continual development policy and the construction of other highway project in
Hubei.

Promoting the growth of local communications and economy

The implementation of the project, regardless of politics and economy, had a great
influence on the province. The project comprehensively upgraded the network of Hubei,
and made Hubei a lever and initiative point that links from north to south, from east to
west. Speeding up the flowing freight transport, passenger transport, information
exchange, it had a very important impact on trade and communications with other
provinces in China.

                                           Hunan

The primary objective was achieved through successfully completing the various
components of the project. The completion and operation of the 183 km TCE relieved the
traffic congestion and traffic accident rate on NR107 and promoted social economy
development on the traffic corridor between Hunan and Hubei province.

The NH4 section in Hunan comprises 16 civil works contracts (in which five contracts
were for the interconnecting road), five building works contracts, one E& M works
contract. The construction of civil works commenced on May 28th 2000 and completed



                                              55

on Nov. 30th, 2002, building works commenced on Dec. 2001 and completed on Nov.
30th 2002, E& M works commenced on Mar. 2004 and completed on Dec. 2004.

Hunan Provincial Communications Survey and Design Institute (HPCSDI) designed the
project. During the course of construction, design representatives were assigned to the
sites to answer for design variation and drawing updating. Advanced design concept,
newly technology and material have been used for this project with comprehensive
quality management system making assurance of design quality. Besides, design updating
has been done during construction.

Implementation Experience

Application of World Bank's Policies

The managerial staff of the Hunan Provincial Expressway Construction and Development
Corporation were trained through implementation of the project in the application of the
World Bank's policies. The civil works were procured through ICB, and the contracts
were awarded to the bidders of the lowest price, thus the construction cost was reduced.
FIDIC was adopted which greatly helped with the general management of the project.
The Bank's policies were used in the implementation and monitoring of environmental
protection and resettlement. Consequently, the environment along the expressway was
preserved well, and the displaced persons were not disadvantaged by the project.

Implementation of the Contract, Timely Communication

The project was the first expressway along the Lakeland in Hunan Province. It was very
difficult to construct the project with very complicated geological and topographical
conditions. During the course of project management, the Hunan Provincial Expressway
Construction and Development Corporation paid great attention to performance of
contract in terms of entry of the equipments and personnel to the sites, and key steps of
technology in construction. By communicating regularly and in a timely manner with the
leaders of the contractors and local government, the project company created a positive
construction environment for the contractors.

Strengthening Quality Control

The Hunan Provincial Expressway Construction and Development Corporation adopted
several measures to strengthen quality control.

    · Quality Responsibility Agreements were signed between Hunan Provincial
        Expressway Construction and Development Corporation, Contractors, Designer
        and supervisors.
    · Strict management on procurement of the raw materials by careful testing in order
        to ensure the quality of the works.
    · Establishment of a Quality Assurance system by each contractor to ensure the
        quality of the works.



                                              56

    · The supervision consultants were assigned to the construction sites to fully
        control the construction through site supervision and site testing.

Any quality problem identified in the construction sites was solved through issuing
instructions to the constructor. It was subsequently confirmed that the problems had been
resolved.

Operational Experience

The TCE was opened to traffic on Dec. 30th, 2002. After that, Hunan Provincial
Expressway Construction and Development Corporation established the TCE
Management Division to be in charge of operation, management and maintenance of the
expressway. The TCE is in good condition.

The TCE is not only creating major economic and social benefits for the areas along the
project, but also for promoting of inter-provincial economy and trade between Hubei and
Hunan provinces.

The traffic volume and toll revenue of TCE are rapidly increasing. There was a 30%
increase in traffic from 2003 to 2006. The annual toll revenue collected increased from
RMB 490 million in 2003 to RMB 670 million in 2006.

Due to the diversion of traffic from NR107, the issue of traffic congestion on NR107 has
been resolved. The safety conditions on NR107 has also been improved.

The TCE Management Division does the maintenance work on the TCE. It is able to treat
the defects and damages in a timely manner. The Nationwide Road Database System and
Pavement Management System support maintenance planning.

Resettlement and Environmental Experience

Land acquisition and resettlement for the TCE and interconnecting road was completed in
July 1999. The land area occupied by the project amounted to 1,533 ha, and area of the
dismantled houses reached to 402,206 m2. According to the requirement of the World
Bank, a RAP was prepared and strictly adhered to. People affected along the project have
been resettled with satisfactory.

The State Environmental Protection Administration and Environmental Division of MOC
organized the Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau and Hunan Provincial
Communications Department and others to carry out an environmental acceptance
inspection on the completion of the project. After inspection, it was found qualified and
was honored with prize of "Project Friendly to Environment". This is the first time for
highway project to win the above-mentioned prize.




                                             57

Procurement of Equipment

The project procured 15 items of equipment for road maintenance using ICB. Currently,
all the equipment are in operation and have been proved to be of use of the client.

Road Safety

This component is the continuation of NH2, consisting of four parts:

    · The issue of road safety was discussed during the Annual Seminar, which was
        organized by Hunan Provincial Traffic Engineering Association, with the aim to
        exchange knowledge and experience on road safety.
    · A Handbook on Road Construction Safety was compiled. It addressed safety
        requirements for all the stages during construction.
    · A Handbook of "Examples of maintenance safety measures" was prepared. It put
        forward safety requirements in different stages of road maintenance.
    · Establish the traffic accidents information system for NR107 to the south of
        Changsha city. Based upon this system, an analysis model on the accident
        sections was established so as to find and determine the accident sections on
        NR107 to the south of Changsha city and finally formulate the implementation
        plan to delete the accident black spot.

Through the study on road safety of NH2 and NH4, a solid foundation was established
for further developing traffic safety projects, special experts on road traffic safety have
been trained, many concerned working persons are more aware of traffic safety, such as:
government officers, road design, construction, management and maintenance people. In
recent years, because people are more aware of traffic safety, the traffic accidents in our
province keep decreasing, which is a good beginning.

Institutional Strengthening

This component is the continuation of NH2, consisting of four parts:

    · Formulate a plan of institutional and policy development for the future 6--8 years,
        including institutional development plan, training plan, management system to be
        used and the equipment to be matched and to be purchased. This plan will be
        elemental document on institutional development for the two projects financed by
        the World Bank. This plan was submitted to the World Bank and will be carried
        out as schedule.
    · "Project Office" is equipped with a road safety expert. The expert will provide
        suggestions on road safety issues to the director of the Project Office from the
        design stage to the completion of the project. To further do well the work, the
        expert will be trained domestically and then will be overseas trained.
    · A total of 113 persons received overseas training under the NH4 project, 499
        persons trained domestically.


                                             58

    · Improve the quality management system. Hunan Provincial Traffic Quality
        Supervision Station will put forward an audited list of quality guarantee key
        factors on quality management system suitable for Hunan province.

A batch of specialized persons is trained on highway management, highway design and
planning, financial management, highway maintenance and traffic engineering through
this training program. The training has produced a good result. These specialists fully
meet the demands of their different posts, and have broadly used the knowledge on the
implementation of the project.

Study on Highway Maintenance

This component is the continuation of NH2, consisting of 2 parts:
    · Road data system (road databank). A road databank system was established in
        accordance with the suggestion of MOC and adapting to the requirements of
        Hunan province. By training the personnel for road databank development, the
        road databank was established and applied by the end of 2003 in different cities of
        the province.
    · Development of highway sector competition. In 2000, the maintenance companies
        are established at 60% of highway bureau at county level in all regions.
    · Implement the hiring system to leaders of highway bureau at county level.
    · Formulate the target management system of leaders.

 By this study of highway maintenance through NH2 and NH4, the solid foundation is
 laid for promotion of scientific management of road maintenance in Hunan province, a
 series of specialists are available specializing on road maintenance, and a good
 beginning is developed for the highway maintenance reform in our province.

Study on Expressway Commercialization and Corporatization

This component is the continuation of NH2. The study was done on the possible plans of
establishing tolling companies or organizations. The study report was satisfactorily
completed and the results are being considered by the HPCD.

Performance of the World Bank

The World Bank embanked on the preparation of the NH4 in 2000. The Bank Mission
reviewed the Feasibility Study report prepared by HPCD. The World Bank sent several
missions to review the technical, organizational and economic aspects of the Project and
prepared Appraisal Document. The Appraisal Document described the scope of the
project, economic benefit and organization arrangement.

During the implementation of the project, the World Bank Supervision Missions provided
practical and helpful recommendations on quality, financial management, project
organization and other areas. During the project preparation and implementation, the
World Bank provided a lot of help to the project implementation unit. There was good



                                              59

co-operation between the World Bank and the Project Office. The officials of the World
Bank understood the high demands for traffic infrastructure in Hunan and provided help
and assistance. The People's Government of Hunan province and HPCD appreciated the
cooperation and assistance of the World Bank.

Lessons Learned

As a World Bank financed project, the project cycle included project identification,
preparation, project appraisal, negotiation and approval of the Board, project
implementation and supervision, completion and evaluation. The project preparation
work include project identification, preparation, project appraisal, negotiation and
approval of the Board, which took nearly two years.

The officials involved in the project were many economists, financial analysis expert,
resettlement and environmental experts and various types of engineers. The team learned
from the World Bank how to identify the project, compare and select the alternatives,
establish the project organization, prepare Project Implementation Plan and Project
Procurement Plans, identify and manage the risks, etc. Although the preparation of a
project was long relatively to the construction time, it was a vital major long-term
investment, the time spent was well invested. The problem is how the World Bank can
coordinate closely with the borrower, project management and project implementation
unit so as to speed up the progress.

The institutional strengthening activities will produce a good result over time. The project
units profited greatly from the continuous and deep study on research of institutional
strengthening, road safety, highway maintenance, expressway corporation
commercialization under NH 2 and NH 4.
