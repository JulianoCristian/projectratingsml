The Definition of Resettlement Terminology of RAP
Acquisition of land and other assets for the project will adversely affect the
livelihood of persons who live, work or earn their living on' the land that will be
acquired for the project. PAPs are defined as those persons whose income or
livelihood will be adversely affected by land acquisition for the project. PAPs
include the following categories:
1) persons who have title, right, interest in structure(houses, enterprises, shelters,
or public building), land(including residential, agricultural and grazing land)
or any other asset acquired or possessed, in full or in part, permanently or
temporarily;
2) persons who use the structures, land or assets described abovc or persons
whose business, occupation, work, place of residence or habitat adversely
affected; or
3) persons whose standard of living is adversely affected as a consequence of
land acquisition.
A definition of PAPs is given below:
Definition of PAPs: Affected person means persons who on account of the
execution of the project had or would have their: a) standard of living
adversely affected; or b) right, title or interest in any house, land(including
premises, agricultural and grazing land) or any other fixed or movable asset
acquired or possessed, temporarily or permanently; or c) business, occupation,
work or place of residence or habitat adversely affected, and affected person
mean individually all tho,se who qualify as affected person.
PAPs may be individuals or legal persons such ad a company, a public
institution. Definition of PAPs is not limited to their legal registration or
permission to live or conduct business in the affected location, or their title to
property. Thus, it includes: a) all those affected by the project regardless of
their legal rights or absence thereof the assets being taken; and b) persons
without residential permiit to live in a certain area. Therefore all such persons
who are affected will need to considered and recorded as PAPs, regardless of
their legal connection to assets land or location.
If there are more than one person, family or household using or holding a
title to the same land or property that is acquired, they will be compensated



and rehabilitated according to the loss they suffer, their rights and the impact
on their living standards. The definition of PAPS is link directly to the
*                      adverse affect of the project, regardless of legal rights title or interest
All PAPs are entitled to the improvement or at least restoration of theiir
*                      standards of living, and compensation for the material losses they suffer.
Compensation for assets will cover replacement cost No deductions or
discounts will be applied to the compensation amount for depreciation or
other reasons. All PAPs deriving an economic benefit inn addition to the
compensation for their assets lost.
Those PAPs without title, authorization or legal permission to reside,
conduct business, cultivate land or construct structures are eligible for
rehabilitation of their livelihoods and compensation for their assets on a equal
footing with those with formal legal title, authorization or permissions to the
assets.
The term RESETTLEMENT includes: a) the relocation of living quarte:rs;
b) finding acceptable new employment for those whose jibs are affected; c)
restoration(or compensation) of affected productive resources such as land,
workplace, trees and infrastructure; d) restoration of other adverse effect on
PAPs living standards(quality of life) through land acquisition (such as the
adverse effects of pollution); e) restoration of or compensation for affected
private and ;public enterprises, and f) restoration of adversely affected on
cultural or common property.
Rehabilitation mean: the restoration of PAPs resource capacity to
continue with productive activities or lifestyles at a level higher or at least
equal to that before the project.
The objective of this RAP is to provide a plan for the resettlement and
rehabilitation of the PAPs so that their losses will be improve or at least
restored to the pre-project levels. To achieve these objectives the plan
provides for rehabilitation measures so that the income eaming potential of
individuals are restored to sustain their livelihoods. Affected productive
resources of business (enterprises including shops ) and public property.
Infirastructure and cultural property will also be improved or at least restored
to their pre-project level.

Chapter 1 Project Background
1.1 Brief Description of the Project
Jingzhu Expressway is one of the main communications trunks from nordt to
south in China, and it is also one of the key communications projects during the
period of Ninth-Five-Year Plan(9th FYP). The section of this project in Hubei
province, with total length of 339 km(including 45km of Hurong expressway),
starts at Jiuliguan of Dawu county, passing by Xiaogan city (Dawu, Xiaochang and
Xiaonan) , Wuhan city ( Dongxihu, Chaidian and Jiangxia) and XianganPrefecture
( Xianganand Cibi C), ends at Tucheng village of Cibi city where the project is
linked up with that of Hunan Province.
Hubei section of Jingzhu Expressway consists of three projects: a) the north
section, b) Wuhan Junshan Yangtze River Bridge, c) the south section(from
Zhengdian of Jiangxia to Cibi C Tucheng). Among the them, the north section (from
Dawu Chenguan to Zhengdian) and the roundabout route in Wuhan city of Hurong
Expressway compose the Project III financed by the World Bank. The south
section in Hubei Province and the north section in Hunan Province compose the
Project l\'financed by the Bank. Junshan Yangtze River Bridge will be built with
other investment form.
Mandated by Hubei Province Communications Department (HPCD), Hubei
Provincial Communications Planning and Designing Institute(CPDI) finished the
main report of feasibility study of Project IV in May 1996, and provided
recommended route and comparative route. Convened by Hubei Province Planning
Commission(HPPC) and HPCD organized some related departments to examine the
report and required CPDI to undertake the deeply survey and more compares in
August 1996. During the visit to Hubei in November. 1997, the World Bank mission
give us some opinions about the alignment studv and compares of NHIV. According
to the opinions of the World Bank mission and some native specialists. and also
takina account of the enuineerini!. environment and resettlement. CPDI conducted
the  same  deep  investigation  to  Xianganproposal 1. Xianganproposal 11
Xianganproposal IIl and Jia\u Proposal. Xian-anproposal I start at Zhenudian of
Jianoxia D. passing by Qinnianan. tea farm of Zhushan. Maanshan. Zhanggong.



Paota in XianganCity, Quankou, Zhonghuopu, Cunchuan Caanlin of Cibi County
and ends at Tucheng and connects with the north section of Hunan Province. The
total length of this aligmnent is 110Km, Most of area that this alignment will pass
are light hill. The construction condition is fairly convenient. This alignment is close
to NH107 and will attractive a lot of traffic volume and do great good to
XianganCity, so local government support this proposal very much.
The proposal II will start at Shenshan of Jiangxia D, passing by Jinshui T, Fasi,
in Jiangxia D, Dupukou in Jiayu County, Gantang in XianganC, Qu'ankou, Langqiao,
Yangjialin Caanlin, Fenghuangshan in puqi County, ends at Tucheng and links with
Hunan Province. The total length of this alignment is 1 03Km, in it, 32Kmr will pass
through the lake, the construction condition is poor.
The Proposal III starts at Shenshan in Jiangxia D. The section from Shenshan to
Beilin of Jiayu is the same as the Proposal II, from Beilin to south, it will pass
Shoujiawan of Jiayu County, Shijiawan of Xianning, Shenshan, Songjiahe,
Huanglong to Chenjiafan, the next section is the same as proposal II. The total
length of this alignment is 1OlKm. In it, 37 Km will pass through the lake.
The alignment from start point to Yinjiajiao of Jiayu of Jiayu proposal is the
same as Proposal II. After that it will pass Dupukou, Yuyue T, Guanqiao,
Fenghuangshan, Caanlin and will link with proposal II in Chenjiafan. The total
length of this alignment is 97Km. In it, 44Km will pass through the lake and 33Km
will be soft subgrade. The construction condition is poor and this alignment is far
away from XianganC. Local governmnent do not support this proposal.
Among the above proposals, Xianganproposal III and Jiayu proposal IV do not
satisfy with this project. As far as proposal I and II. Proposal II's distance is short.
but hydrology and geography condition is bad. According to the investigation
result and specialists' review'ing. Xianganproposal I is the recommended alignment.
As far as the resettlement. 8 households will not be acquired in XianganProposal 1.
The total areas of this 8 household houses is I 12OM2
Along the recommending alianment, 4 proposed connectinc roads. with the
total length of 28Knm. namel! Nlaanshan connecting road (connecting with 107 to
the east. and linik wvith a class two hiuhwav to the west connecting with provincial
hiuhwa'v namely W'upu Road). Zhanggonmniao cpnnecting road(connectina with
Zhanggong and Hengoouqiao T to the east). Gantang connecting road(connecting
,vith NH 107 in Fenghuanoshan to Xiangning C). Quankou connecting
2



road(connecting with NH107 to the east and connecting with Jiayu to the west. 10
super and big bridges, with total length of 10730m, will be built. Along the
alignment, there are 6 interchanges, 15 separate interchanges, 6 administrative
station, 2 service area, 2 rest area and 2 maintenance areas.
This project includes two other highways. One is Dawu-Hongan, the total
length is 68.9Km(15.lKm will be new constructed).The alignment starts at the
Dawu Interchange and passes by Huangtugang, Baiyuan, Xincheng, Xiadian, ]Liuji,
Hekou, Shangxinji, Dazhaojia,Zhangjiafan,Xiejiatian,and ends at Daoshui Bridge of
Hongan Chengguan. The second highway is Tongshan-Chongyan-Cibi. The total
length is 95.2Km(22.3Krn is newly constructed). This highway starts at Xinqiao of
Tongshan. It passes by Tongyang, Nanlin, Lukou, Tiancheng, Lumeng, Chunchuan
an ends at Cibi Interchange.
According to the "Highway. Engineering Technical Standards" issued by the
Ministry of Communications, the main line of Project IV will be built on the basis of
the expressway standards in plain and light hill area, with speed 120 KM per hour, 4
lanes, subgrade width 28. OM, net width of large and middle bridge floor 2X12.0m.
The interconnecting roads are built according to the standard of class 2 highway.
Two other highways also will be constructed according to the Class 2 standdard.
And 78% of this two other highway is utilized the old highway and improve the old
highway. The land acquisition is less.
The total costs of this project will amount to 4.23 billion RMBY(includes two
other highway), and it will start to be constructed in June,1999,and end in
January,2003.
Mandated by HPCD through CPDI. Xi'an Communications University
compiled EIA and EAP.

1. 4 Measures Taken to Minimize Resettlement
1.4.1 Principle:
* Avoiding the cities. townships. schools. hospitals. institutes and enterprises as
possible.
* Avoiding the scenic spots
* Minimize to acquire the cultivated land . use waste land .waste beach. and waste
hill as possible.
1.4.2 Measure:
I .At the stage of feasibility studv. important area and partial important
controlling point was determined. and aliLnment was chosen based on the



consultation with local govermnent and PAPs, CPDI determined the alignment.
Without lowering engineering standards, CPDI made the route avoid residential area,
enterprise and institution, and acquire less cultivated land as possible.
2.At the stage of preliminary design, CPDI surveyed the route. According to
the survey data, CPDI cornpare various sectional routes from the angle of
resettlement, and optimized the route.
3.At the stage of final design, CPDI conducted a detailed survey, compared and
optimized various sectional routes of the recommended aligrnient, minimized
resettlement. Comparing with XianganPropose I and XianganPropose II, 8
households will be less, and 1120 square M will be less.
4.Collecting the cultural relic material.
5.At the stage of selecting point of temporary land acquired, HPCD and the
monitoring engineer work together with related departments to have field visit in
order to minimize to acquire cultivated land.
According to survey, HPCD calculated the resettlement cost and project total
cost and analyze and compare the results.
At the stage of drawing up RAPs, when choosing resettlement sites, ROs at all
levels will consult with PAPs as fully as possible, with the presupposition of
satisfying PAPs' desires, con:rol the acquisition cultivated land and other profitable
land .
1. 5 Technical and Economic Feasibility Study
The technical and economic feasibility study report of the project will be
submitted to MOC and SPC in July, 1998, and the report is expected to be approved
before the end of October, 1998.
1. 6 Preliminary and Final Design of the Project
Mandated by HPCD. CPDI finished preliminary survey of the recommended
aliunment in January 1998. and plans to finish preliminary design in June. 1998. The
final desitn wvill be finished in March 1999 and reviewed by the highway specialists
from MOC.
1. 7 Owvnership of the Project
The ownership of the project belongs to HPCD.

1. 8 The Social Survey
1. 8. 1 The Resettlement Survey
According to the requirement of the Aide Memoir signed by World Bank and
HPCD in June 1996 and November 1997, HERO organized the several social
surveys as listed:
1.From September 1996 to October 1996, HERO undertook a social survey.
This survey involves Xianning recommended route II and Jiayu comparing
route.
2. In Feburary, 1997, HERO organized another middle route proposal survey
(passing Xilianghu proposal route) and connecting roads proposal of
XianganlIl.
3.In January, 1998, according to the change of the alignment, the resettlement
survey of the final recommending alignment, namely Xianning proposal I and
it's connecting roads has finished.
4.In March, 1998, the connecting roads and annex area survey and the other
highways was finished.
The purposes of the survey lie in:
a)In order to provide the materials to priority the alignment, minimize the
resettlement and reduce the project cost
b)In order to provide foundation for the compiling of RAP;
c)Providing basic data for the resettlement;
d)providing background data for the monitoring and evaluating.
1. 8. 2 Survey Scope
Because the preliminary desicyn had not been finished at the beginnino of the
survey. there are two uncertain factors of the survev: a) the construction red lines b)
connecting roads. interchanges and temporary acquired land. Consulted with CPDI.
HERO took measures as follows:
(a)The survey scope is each 60M for two sides from the center line of the
recommended alignment and comparing route. The affected scope is each 30M
for two sides from the center line. i. e. . drawing two parallel lines fiom i 30Nl each
side of the center line as the supposed red lines. For the connecting roads. the
surve) scope is each 30M for two sides from center line and draw two parallel
7



lines from 1 5M each side of the center line as the supposed red line.
According to the calculation of CPDI, the scope formed by the supposed red lines
almost covers the real scope of the red lines. After the preliminary design, CPDI can
take measures on 1/2000 topographic map as follows: a) conducting a sample survey
to calculate the resettlement error between the supposed red line scope and real red
line scope; b) readjusting the data of some sections that have considerable errors on
the maps.
(b)After the finish of the preliminary design, CPDI will conduct a supplement
survey to collect the data of temporary land use.
The resettlement scope in RAP includes main alignment, interchanges,
connecting road and service area.
1. 8. 3 Survey Content
The survey content includes: a) location, type and area of the land to be acquired; b)
location, type, area and construction price of the structures to be removed; c)
location, type and quantity of the attached things in the survey scope; d) location,
type, quantity and ownership of the power lines and telecommunication lines in the
survey scope; e) population, assets, house, income and expenditure of the family
household whose land, house or attached things in the survey scope; f) basic
information and affected degree of the enterprises and institutions whose land,
structures or attached things in the survey scope; g)public opinions and suggestions;
h) basic information of the affected villages; i)statistic data and relevant laws and
regulations of the affected county( district, city). So there are 8 kinds of
questionnaire designed for the survey, see attach document 1 of annex 2 for details.
The survey consists of three parts: a) material indicator survey, including
questionnaire D, E, F and G; b) social economic survey. including questionnaire A,
B. C and H; c) document survey. including statistics data and laws and regulations
document.
Each material object in the survey scope was registered by 3 sets of key code:
a)address code. it is a I 3-figure number stand for 6 levels address. i. e. . route code +
county(district. city) code +tc,xn code + village code + team code + household code:
b)stake numtber + distance from the center line. it is a I 0-figure number stand for 2
level: c)map number + map code. it is a  I -figure number for two level.
The survev indicators and survey methods can be seen in annex document I
8



and 2 of the annex 2.
1. 8. 4 The Organization of the Survey
The resettlement survey was conducted by HERO, LROs, CPDI and PSI
together.
As the lead body, HERO took charge of the organization and coordination of
the survey.
As the main executive body, CPDI was responsible for the field survey,
examining and inputting the survey data, and transfer the data to PRO.
As the coordinate bodies, local ROs were in charge of providing logistical
support for the survey, and cooperate CPDI to finish the social economic survey.
As the Independent Monitoring Organization, PSI took charge of
questionnaires and survey methods designing, training the surveyors, supervising the
survey quality and providing computer service.
During the survey, PRO, CPDI and PSI made an investigation on the execution,
and after the survey, PRO, CPDI, LROs and PSI examined the survey data.
1. 8. 5 The Result of the Survey
By the end of March 1998, the resettlement survey of three comparing
aligrnment and one recommending alignment was finished. The total length is
351KM.(including connecting roads and the two other highway). 24002
questionnaires were filled out in the resettlement survey of project IV, among them,
6749 were questionnaire A, 6749 were questionnaire B, 264 were questionnaire C,
6846 were questionnaire D. 3002 were questionnaire E, 73 were questionnaire F, 55
were questionnaire G and 264 were questionnaire H. See table 1-1 for further
details.
1. 9 Preparation of the Resettlement Action plan
From August to September 1996. HERO. PSI and CPDI worked out the perfect
program of resettlement survey. From September 24 to October 15. the resettlement
survev of XiangTanproposal 11 and JTiavu comparing route was conducted. Directed by
the PSI. HERO organized the people from CPDI and LROs to compile the
RAP(draft) in December 1996. In FebruarN-.1997. another resettlement of Xiannin-
proposal III and Xianningn proposal II (passing through the lake) connecting roads
9



were conducted and soon afterwards the survey, consultations about the
compensation and resettlement with local governments and PAPs were made. In
June 1997, the resettlement specialist from the Bank had a following-up visit to
Project IV. According to the suggestion and comments, the HERO revised
RAP(revised vision). In January and March, 1998, as the aligmnent changed, HERO
organized to undertake the resettlement survey of Xianning Proposal I(around lake)
and it's connecting roads. Based on these works, HERO compiled this RAP. In May
and November 1998, the world bank mission pre-apprise this project and give us
some comments. According to these comrnments, we compiled this RAP. The details
see table 1-2.

2. 8 Affected Collective, Enterprises and Institutions
2.8.1 Affected collectives
There are 195 affected colleclives. 139 collectives belong to team, 48 collectives
belong to villages. 28 belong to townships. The things of these collectives affected
by project are public land, such1 as public water pond, forest and cannel. The details
see table 2-8 and attached table 6.
The acquisition land of co'llective, non-cultivated land accounted to 75 per cent.
Most of them are forest and other non-cultivated land. The forest is located in
XianganC and Cibi C. The other non-cultivated land are highways and cannel.
As the duplication of Gantan interchanges and Xianpan highway and Xianpan
highway is class two highway, there is no need to acquire land.
* For public water ponds, forest and undeveloped land, sunning ground and
cannel, there is no need to employ labors.
 The employment situation is divided into two types.
A Non-operation. For example, some forest isn't enterprises operation activities.
The obligation of employees is to look after them.
B. Enterprises operations. Such as tea farm, fish pond.
The employees of collective are the local peasant. They have their own
cultivated land. The income that they receive from looking after forest is just a
small part os their income, not the main resource of their living. The project just
affects a part of their cultivated land. Most of them will continue to operate their
cultivated land which is not acquired. A small part of them will be given some
cultivated land through the land adjustment.

(b)Temporary Land Use
According to 33rd of Land Management Law of People's Republic of China, the
compensation of temporary land acquisition is calculated on the basis of the actual
duration and area. also on the basis of the annual product of last three year after
signing the land use contract.
In this project. temporary land use compensation will be calculated on the basis
cf one year's duration. and the compensation price is I time of the average annual
income in last three years of the land. If the duration excel one year and no more than
two year, the compensation will be calculated two times of the average annual income
and so on. As the temporary land wvill maybe destroy the topsoil and some irrigated
facilities. the project Ullit must recover the topsoil and facilities before return them. If
the topsoil canniot be recovered. then the compensation will be paid according to the
product loss.
Ws hen wve acquire the temporary land. we will avoid cultivated land and acquire
non-cultivated land.
39



(c)Standing Crop compensation
According to the second term of 6h of Hubei Province Land Management and
Enforcement measure, all standing crops and timber will be compensated on the basis
of their product. After negotiation, the standing crop will be compensated on I time of
average annual income of the crops.
3. 3. 2 Resettlement Subsidy
The resettlement subsidy for each affected laborer is commensurate with 3 times
of the average annual income of last three years of the land. In this project, the
subsidy for each person is 2910yuan, three times of the irrigated field compensation
base. The project will adversely affect 10486 individuals through acquisition of
cultivated land. The project will pay a resetilement subsidy of 2190 RMB to village
administrations for each of the affected persons for their rehabilitation after the
resettlement. The resettlement subsidy for each person is the same rate for all
cultivated land.
3. 3. 3 Housing Compensation
The house compensation is the most concerned problem of PAPs. Having
analyzed survey data and consulted with PAPs and related departments, PRO worked
out the compensation rates based on the full replacement value without depreciation
for all kinds of structure. The standard is 265 yuan/m2 for brick-concrete house, 150
yuan/m2 for brick-timber house, 105 yuan/m2 for earth-timber house, 70 yuan/m2 for
simple house. This standard is suit for residence house and village collective houses.
For enterprises and institutes, the compensation will be negotiation wvith these
organizations and determined. The details see chapter 5.
Besides the replacement cost. the removal fee. work-stop fee will be paid. After
consulting with local department. the removal fee will be paid 100 yuan for per PAP.
The work-stop fee will be: the net income of per person in 1997 times the actual
removal duration(] month). In 1997. the highest net income of per person in this 4
counties(districts)is 2509vuan (Jianuxia D is 2509\Vuan. Xiannirio is 2023vuan. Puqi is
2238yuan.). As far as household. it will be calculated by- labors standard.
The aff'ected household will not pay any tax.
3. 3. 4 Specific Facilities Compenisation
The aff'ected specific facilities include power line. telecommunication line.
40



broadcast line and optical fiber line. The compensation negotiated with power and
telecommunuication departnent and decided. The compensation rates for their
relocation see table 3-2.

Chapter 4 Resettlement & Rehabilitation Implementation
Plan
4.1 The Objectives and Principles of Resettlement and
Rehabilitation
4.1.1 The Objectives of Resettlement and Rehabilitation
The general objective of the resettlement and rehabilitation is to ensure the
PAPs benefit from the project and their living standards will improve or at least be
restored after the project impact. It means: a)The area and structure of the rebuilt
house of affected household will or at least be the same as that before removal.
b)Laborers have been resettled properly and reach a higher income level than
before; c) Public structures and specific facilities have been rehabilitated as fonner
standards; d)Affected enterprises have been restored , and' their production scale,
production capacity and employment have been restored.
4.1.2 The Measures of Resettlement and Rehabilitation
The resettlement and rehabilitation  consists of living resettlement &
rehabilitation and production resettlement & rehabilitation.
Living resettlement & rehabilitation mainly implies house removal and living
facility recovering. It includes:
1) the residence houses of affected household
2) the living houses of affected enterprises
3) the supplying facility of water and electricity
Production resettlement & rehabilitation mainly implies the resettlement of
laborers and production facilities recovering. It includes:
l) Resettlement in agriculture field and non-aariculture fields.
2) The production facilities recovering of affected enterprises and institutes.
Because the replacement compensation rate will be paid. the production scale and
capacity xviIi not be reduced. the workers employment will not be affected.
Resettlement and rehabilitation will be implemented through the methods of
paying compensation. resettling laborers and restoring living and production
conditions.
43



4.1.3 The Principles of Resettlement and rehabilitation
(a) Consultation
PAPs were consulted on the location of the resettlement sites, the amount of
house compensation that they were entitled, the schedule, the fund disbursement,
and employment. PAPs or representatives participated and the agreement have
been reached.
The consultation was implemented through representative meeting and village
consultant meeting.
(b)Compensation
* House, special facilities and attached things have been compensated at
replacement price. The compensation will be paid directly to the asset-holdersan
received completely by the asset-holders; and not be spent on behalf of the asset
holders by various county township of village government intermediaries.
Salvageable materials of the old house belong to the former owners. No
deduction will be made from the published rates in any form including
withholding, taxes or depreciation. Parties other than the asset holders will not be
allowed to make expenditures out of the compensation funds on behalf of the
asset-holders. The replacement price is determnined based on survey and paid at the
currently price. During the implementation. inflation also will be concemed.
Pay more attention to enterprises and vulnerable group
In order to minimize the loss of enterprises, the enterprises and institutes will be
determined the relocation and the resettlement fund be paid first. As far as
household resettlement, we will pay more attention to vulnerable group.
* Buildings and special facilities will be dismantled and rebuilt by owners.
The compensation fund must be disbursed before resettlement. For vulnerable
group. PRO will ask the local resettlement offices to give them help and
subsidy.
* Pay more attention to the surplus labors' willing
Besides carrvine out the lawN and reaulations of state and province. the willing
of surplus laborers w ill be concemed when resettling them into enterprises. When
aoricultural regi.sters transfer to non-agricultural reizister. the willing of surplus
labors and the needs of enterprises also wvill be concerned.
* Use land reasonable
44



Because a large number of buildings will be affected by this project, the plan of
using land is very important in order to acquire less cultivated land as possible.
4.2 House rebuilding
The houses rebuilding refers to affected household residence houses. The
houses of enterprises and institutes don't include. The details see table 4-1.

PAPs will be kept informed about any changes in the content of the RAP
regarding policy and compensation and schedule(in case such a change takes
place)
Fifty per cent of the housing compensation will be paid to the PAPs at the
beginning of the constructing new house, the rest 50 per cent will be paid at the
half of the construction.
4.2.1 Scheduling
* The schedule is determined and changed according the schedule of project. It
will be consulted with PAPs to ensure that thev will have 3 months to remove
and 4 months to rebuild their new house.
* Before their new houses is finished. PAPs will still live in their old house. No
one can force them to leave their house.
4.2.2 Relocation site choice
PAPs were Eiven a choice to select one among several plots that would be
available to them. The relocation sites must be:
45



* PAPs will be resettled in their original communities(if they are willing they
will be resettled in original village ). According to survey, there are no
more than 7 household will be removed in each village, it is possible to
relocate PAPs in their own village.
* The environment is good, no pollution, convenient to their living and their
work.
* Minimizing to acquire the cultivated land.
* The people are vvilling to accept these PAPs to remove into their
communities, and they can get well along with them.
The relocation houses site will be acquired waste land as possible. The village
commission will be responsible for rebuilding procedure . Acquiring the land must
be permitted by the township government.
4. 2. 3 Compensation for Working Time Loss
The compensation for working time loss will be calculated on the basis of
laborer number and their actual working time loss of the household, and
counterpart compensation for enterprises will be calculated on the basis of the time
to restore the enterprises.
4.2.4 Assistance for Vulnerable Group
The assistance vulnerable group will receive from PRO includes:
a) financial assistance provided by HPCD for their removal;
b)labor assistance organized by village for house construction and removing;
c)reducing or remitting their voluntary labor
d)having priority to choose locations of rebuilding and readjusted cultivated
land.
4. 3 Specific Facilities Resettlement and Rehabilitation
The affected specific facilities mainly include power and telecommunication
facilitates. These facilities will be compensated at full replacement price based on
the consultationi wvith relevant departments. and the relocation of these facilities
wvill he imiplemenited as soOnI as possible to satisfv the normal needs of the PAPs.
4. 4 Public Structures Resettlement and Rehabilitation
46



In this project, public structure means collective houses. Their structure are
almost the same as that of household, so they will be compensated with the same
compensation rates as that of family house. Their function and relocation site: will
be comprehensively concerned.
4. 5 Attached Things Resettlement and Rehabilitation
All attached things will by removed and rebuilt by their owner at the same time
of house removal.
4. 6 Enterprises and Institutes Resettlement and Rehabilitation
4.6.1 Enterprise and Institutes Loss Compensation
The financial compensation for enterprises' loss will be determined according
to actual situation. The compensation to Chunchuan brick works, Cibi City
Changjiang waterproof materials works, Xinghuo grain storehouse of Xinidian
Town of Cibi City will be determined based on consultation and according to their
structure and affected degree. Besides the compensation for direct loss, these
enterprises will receive compensation for indirect loss, including profit loss, wage
loss, transfer fee. For the other enterprises, the relocation doesn't affect the normal
production, so the compensation for structures and land will be paid according to
the standard of Chapter 3. After negotiation, the details of compensation are as
follows: table 4-2

In order to avoid relocating enterprises and institutions and minimize
resettlement, PRO is consulting with CPDI to optimizing the alignment. ROs at all
level will implement further consultation with affected enterprises about the
compensation rate after the determination of the alignment.
4. 6. 2 Choice of Relocation Site
When choosing relocation sites for affected enterprises that will be removed as a
whole, following factors will be taken into account:
a) The site is convenient for materials supply;
b) the site is equipped with necessary living and production conditions such as
conmnunications, water and power supply.
c) In the site, the enterprise's production will not do harm to environment and
residential population around.
For those enterprises that will only remove part of its structures, the
relocation site will be near to original place. The relocation site will be chosen
based on the consultatio:n of affected units, LROs , PROs and local land
management and planning department.
4.6.3 Laborers Resettlement of agriculture Enterprises and Institutions
All the affected enterprises and institutions will be compensated at replacement
cost. As a large number of the collective land that will be acquired by this project
is separated forest and other land, some forest with a large area and some fish pond
involves employment. And employees are just respond to look after these forest
and pond. They also have their own land to operate. After acquired a part of
collective land. employees will not be reduced and their also operate their own
land. At the same time. these laborers also will be recovered their income through
the village investment plan. PRO and IMO will monitor it.
The replacement compensation rates will be paid to enterprises and institutes
after land acquired. Using these funds. they will recover their production scale and
living condition. The employment will not be affected. During the workingI-stop.
the indirect loss will be paid to workers.
4.6.4 Schedule for Removal and Rehabilitation
The removal and rehabilitation wNill be undertaken from January 1999 to July
48



1999. Because the removal of the enterprises and institutes need more time
comparatively, so its beginning time will be ahead of that of household.
4.7 Agricultural Population and Laborers Resettlement
4.7.1 The Number of the Agricultural Population and Laborers Need to Be
Resettled
According to relevant laws and regulations of state and Hubei Province, the
formulae to calculate the number of the agricultural population and laborers need
to be resettled are as following:-'
A=[B - (C-D)] X (1+0. 00927)
A: the agricultural population to be resettled
B: the area of cultivated land to be acquired
C: the total area of cultivated land before land acquisition(mu)
D: the number of total agricultural population
In the formulae, population(laborer) natural growth ratio were taken into
account, and population natural growth ratio of Hubei Province is 0. 927 per cent.
The result of the calculation sees table 4-3.
From table 4-3, we can see that, the number of cultivated land per capita in the
lowest village is 0.71mu after the land acquisition along the main alignment. Other
two highways are 0.41mu According to the laws and regulations mentioned in
chapter 3, so all the surplus laborers will be resettled in agricultural field based on
land.

I)ata resource: Resettlement survey of project IV in Hubei Province. Cultivated land doesn't include
the land belongs to village.
4. 7. 2 Method of Agricultural laborer Resettlement
As village is the basic administrative unit in countryside, and the number of
agricultural population was calculated on the basis of village, the agricultural
r esettlement will be implemented within the village.
After land readjustment, there will be no surplus labors.
The agricultural resettlement is just the land readjustment. It means that, all the
land of the village will be gathered up, and then be redistributed to each household
based on the number of population. Through land readjustment, the laborers who
loss their land because of land acquisition will gain land again. they will go in for
agricultural production in the vrillaue.
The land will be contracted to the PAPs after land acquisition. All the PAPs
will be resettlement based on aiTriculture.
The land readjustment will be undertaken the goal of rehabilitating  lost
income and not merely of replacing a specific area of lost land. The rehabilitation
measures are:
I.ln village investment plan. it will be stated that some measures will be
undertaken to improve the planting condition of irrigated land or raise the
53



income. And these measures will be implemented.
2.Increase the area of dry land to PAPs when the irrigated land was less than
before to rehabilitate the income.
3.During the land readjustment, the land readjustment will be undertaken the
goal of rehabilitating lost income an not merely of replacing a specific area
of lost land.
4.For the PAPs who are affected by land acquired, the village will replace
their income, give them some subsidies to help them reach the living
standard.
The land readjustment will be undertaken in August 1999.The affected
households will gain land nearby their relocation sites, and the vulnerable
group will take priority to choose their land.
4.7.3 Rehabilitation Measures
After land adjusted, the average land area will be reduced. In order to testore
or improve the living standards for the PAPs after the land acquisition, the land
compensation and resettlement subsidy must be used properly and reasonable.
Generally speaking, the land compensation and resettlement subsidy will be used
for following aspects:
L Improving agricultural production conditions.
The affected area of this project has abundant natural resource to develop
economic crops. Many land are quite suit to plant tea and fruit . But the agriculture
productivity of some towns is comparatively low because of limited funds. So it is
possible to use the land compensation and resettlement subsidy to improve the
production conditions.
* Training the PAPs. improving their production skills.
91.1 per cent of the affected agricultural laborer's educational levels are lower
than senior middle school, and there are onlx' 1. 4 technical staff among 100
persons. so it is very important to use the land compensation and resettlement
subsidy to enhance their scientific quality.
* Addin- the investment of agricultural machination.
AddinQ the investmnent of agricultLral machination will raise the efficiency. So
some of laborers wvill undertake non-ariculture production to raise their
income.
(d) using the land compensation and resettlement subsidy to process the
54



agricultural and forest products extensively, enhancing the commercialization
degree of the products.
(e)bringing barren hill and waste land under cultivation, increasing agricldture
resource.
(f)using the land compensation and resettlement subsidy to establish new middle
and small enterprises that have ready market and little risk.
(g)grasping the opportunity of project construction, serving the project,
especially providing construction materials and labor service for the project. As far
as the providing construction materials and labor service, it will be arranged in
each village by the townships. In the same condition, the construction units will
give the affected village priority right and sign the contrast.
Before the payment of the land compensation and resettlement subsidy, LROs
will supervise and urge each village to work out detailed plan to use the
compensation and resettlement subsidy,
LROs will also provide valuable suggestion for PAPs to use the land
compensation and resettlement subsidy effectively. HERO will monitoring the use
of the fund and its effect all the course. According to law and regulation, the land
compensation and resettlement subsidy belongs to collective. The village
investment plan sees annex III.
4.7.4 Village resettlement funid delivery, management and monitoring
PRO will delivery the land compensation and resettlement subsidy according the
funds flowing(see the map of funds flowing). The land compensation and
resettlement subsidy belongs to collective and it will be invested to PAPs and
village development. The delivery, management and monitor will be accoeding to
next steps:
1. preparation before the funds delivery
(I )Affected village reported their affected situation to high-level Ros in order to
review their review.
(2)PRO. CIROs. COROs and IMO help and train the village government to
compile their village investment plan.
(3)Directed by ROs at all levels and ne-otiated with PAPs. village
administration committee compiled their VIP and submitted it to COROs.
They will fill the table 2 and 3 of annex 3 and state their plan in details.
55



(4).COROs review the V'IP. Any village without VIP will not be disbursed
funds.
2. Funds management and monitor.
(1) After review VIP carefully, COROs will disburse the funds according to
the plan step by step.
Village administration committee will report the results to TROs and
COROs once a month. COROs will report their result to PRO once a
season.
(2) Except this report, COROs and TROs will take field visit regularly or
irregularly to check the funds investment. Every year, PRO will choose
one village as a sample to monitor it's funds investment.
(3) IMO will investigate and field visit and hold open discussion meeting to
know the funds investment and evaluate the result of fund investment.
They also will give some comments to village committees and feedback
their monitoring result to COROs and TROs and PROs.

Implement schedule sees table 4-4.
4. 8. 2 Connection Resettlemient Implementation with Civil Works
The civil works of project IV will begin at September 1999. In order to
undertake the resettlement work well , the land acquisition and resettlement will
be implemented before the civil work. In July-August, 1999, ROs at all levels and
engineering department will check resettlement work.
4. 9 Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB)
To ensure that all affected units and person understand the details of the
resettlement program, a Resettlement Information Booklet will be prepared by
PRO. the RIB will contain the follow%ing information:
(a)Brief description of the project:
(b)Areas affected by the project:
(c)Compensation policies and rates:

(g)Institutions responsible for delivery of resettlement entitlements;
(h)Preferential rehabilitation measures for vulnerable groups.
(i) The affected number and compensation rate.
(3) Information on the impact of resettlement on each household.
(k)Detailed description of entitlements due to each household.
(l) Preferential rehabilitation measures for vulnerable groups.
(m)The affected number and compensation rate.
The RIB will be delivered to each affected household. The personnel
information about the impact an their entilement were printed out to each affected
person through the computers. The RIB will be given to enterprise and institution,
township resettlement offices and village commission in early half of 1999.

Chapter 7 Participation and Consultation
7. 1 The participation of the PAPs
(a) Opinions and Suggestions about the Project
At the stage of survey, PRO selected 15-year-old above person from each affected
household to fill the questionnaire, and the result of the survey sees table 7-1.
From table 7-1, following conclusions can be drawn: a) only 67 percent of the
PAPs are clear about the project, and 71 per cent are clear about resettlement policies.
ROs must attach more importance to the propaganda; b) 97 per cent of the PAPs agree
to build the expressway, and absolute majority of the PAPs consider that state,
collective and individual all will benefit from the project; c)Absolute majority of the
PAPs believe that government will handle the compensation issues properly, so they
support the construction of the expressway, and will agree the resettlement
arrangement; d)The PAPs attach great importance to the environmnent, they suggest to
afforest the expressway and build noise barrier; e) The PAPs want build more
passage to make the production and live convenient for themselves; f) More PAPs
want to be resettled in non-agricultural fields.
In view of the situation mentioned above, PRO decides to take some measures in
next step. On the one hand, strengthen the propaganda of the project background and
relevant laws and regulations, on the other hand, consult with design institute,
strengthen environment protective measures and pay more attention to the design of
passage.
(b) Compensation Rates
The compensation rates in this RAP are worked out based on consultation with
PAPs. having been examined by World Bank and ratified by provincial government,
they will be publicized in RIB.
(c) Relocation Site
TROs have selected relocation sites for PAPs and enterprises and institutions.
and the sites wvill be consulted further in the next step.

Chapter 8 Grievance and Appeals
Since the entire resettlement and rehabilitation program is being carried out with
the participation of the PAPs, it is expected that no major grievance issue will arise.
However, to ensure that the PAPs have avenues for expressing their grievances

The Manual For Resettlement Survey Interviewers of National
Highway Project IV in Hubei Province
The manual for interviewers includes:
- matters needing attention.
- general principles and steps of the survey.
- definitions of term and codes which will be used in the survey.
The main aim of the manual is to identify the interviewer's behavior,
make all interviewers follow the same procedures, make the results
comparable, and guarantee the quality of the survey. The interviewers
should read the questionnaire and this manual seriously before the
survey, so that they can be familiar with and understand them accurately.
If there are some problems this manual hasn't mentioned, the interviewer
should explain it in detail and get contact with the supervisor in time.
1 The General Principles of the Survey
1. In the process of the interview, the interviewer should be very
careful and patient to obtain the interviewees' cooperation.
2. Ask all questions in the questionnaires, write down the answers
exactly.  Never conjecture the interviewee's answer without asking or
without answers.
3.   In principle,  each question should have a clear answer.  If the
interviewee refused to or don't know how to answer certain questions,
and  the  answer  wasn't  clear  or  was  beyond  the  given  codes,  the
interviewer should give an explanation in the questionnaire or in an
added piece of paper.
4.   For the Factual-Questions  (for example,  age , occupation) , the
interviewer can use all kinds of ways to obtain accurate answers,
further questions can be asked according to the situation on the spot,
But the interviewer should pay attention to check whether the answers
117
t-



are consistent.
5.  For the Opinionated-Questions  (for example, B3),  the interviewer
record write down exactly what the interviewee answered. During the
interview, the interview,er must take a neutral stands. Never imply that
one answer is preferable to another.
6. There are four types of recording answers in the questionnaires:
- One-Selected Closed Questions. The interviewer should circle the
appropriate code, then enter the corresponding number in the box. For
example A2.
- Several-Selected Closed Questions. This type of questions have
one or more than one answers. At first, the interviewer should circle
all codes of the answers, then enter the numbers into the corresponding
boxes. For example B4.
- Opened-end Questions. This type of questions have no code, the
interviewer should record the answers on the line or in the box directly.
For example A4.
7.  Each box can be filled only one number, if there are more than one
boxes for a answer, the number should be filled furthest to the right,
and zeros ("0") should be entered in the unused boxes of the left.
8.   After interview,  the interviewer should check the questionnaire
again. If necessary, the interviewer should give an interview again.
2 Steps of the Survey
1. Define the affected households and units according to the affected
land and buildings in the survey scope on the topographic map.
2. Fill the cover of the questionnaires first, and the name of the
route, comprehensive code, address code, name of the head of the family
and the name of the unit should be recorded clearly, and they can't be
omitted.
3.   If  the  affected  lard and buildings  belong  to household,  fill
questionnaire A, B, D andcE.
4. If the affected land and buildings belong to public installation
(but don't belong to enterprises or institutions), fill the space of
"head of the family" with "collective" or "public", and only fill
questionnaire D and E, questionnaire A and B needn't to be filled.

5.  If the affected land and buildings belong to certain enterprise or
institution, fill the space of "head of the family" with fuLl name of
the enterprise or unit, and only fill questionnaire D, E and G,
questionnaire A and B needn't to be filled.
6. The interviewee should sign his/her name in every piece of the
questionnaire, and on the cover and questionnaire C, G, F and H must be
marked with the signature or seal of the unit.
7. Questionnaires for the resettlement of national highway project IV
in  Hubei  province  consist  of  8  kinds  questionnaires,   namely,
questionnaire A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. Among the questionnaires,
questionnaire A, B, D and E will be bond with the front cover, used as
households questionnaire; Questionnaire C and H will be filled to
village level with the cooperation of the statistics and civil
administrative  departments;  Questionnaire  F will  be  filled  to *the

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR
MONITORING RESEITLEMENT ACTIVrJES IN THE
NATIONAL HIGHWAYS IV PROJECT
IN HUBEI
Introduction
1.    National Highways IV Project will displace or adversely affect the standards
- of living of people currently living and conducting economic activities on the right of
way. To ensure that the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) maintain or improve on their
current standard of living, the Hubei Province Commuinications Department has
prepared a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The RAP will be implemented by the
Resettlement Offices of the affected cities and counties under the direction of the
Hubei Expressway Resettlement Office (HERO). The effectiveness and impact of the
RAP will be monitored internally by the HERO. HPCD has also contracted the
services of the Population Studies Institute of the University of Wuhan as the
Independent Monitoring Organization (IMO) in respective Provinces to monitor and
assist the responsible resettlement organizations in achieving the objectives of the
RAP as well as to ensure that the PAPs take an active part in the process of their own
rehabilitation.
2.    This terms of-Reference outlines the resettlement monitoring work to be
undertaken by the HERO and the IMO which have already been agreed and reflected
in the RAP.
Scope of Work: Internal Monitorina
3.   Internal Monitoring of the complete resettlement organization will be
undertaken by the HERO to ensure that all the responsible units follow.the schedule
and comply with the principles of the RAP. The purpose of this monitoring
mechanism is to maintain the satisfactory functioning of the resettlement organization
during the implementation process.
4.    HERO will develop an internal monitoring famework to supervise
resettlement activities, employing the census of the PAPs and their assets as the basis
of the framework. HERO will maintain the database and monitor the progress in
resettlement preparation and implementation through a 100 % monitoring of the
activities with the assistance of local ROs.
5.    Relevant sections of the database will be shared with the City Resettlement
Offices (CIROs). During the preparation of the RAP the staff of CIROs will be
trained in the use of the data and their offices will be equipped with necessary
equipment to process the data.
6.    During the implementation, CIROs will record implementation information on
individuals, households and units on formats prepared for monitoring and deliver the
record of the current activity (in electronic form) to HERO. In this way a continuos
monitoring of implementation will be maintained. HERO will conduct periodic
supervision of resettlement at the village and township level (and covering all
137



townships) to verify the reported progress on a random basis.
7.   Indicators to be Monitored: HERO will be responsible to monitor the
following indicators.
*  Payment of Compensation to the PAPs / units.
* Allotment of house plots.
*  Reconstruction of private housing.
*  Relocation of PAPs.
*  Land readjustmnent for the PAPs losing land.
*  Provision of employmrent to surplus labor and the adequacy of
employment in terms of security, public health, skill levels and incomes.
*  Rehabilitation of the vulnerable groups.
*  Rehabilitation of infrastructure and public buildings.

*  Adequacy of participation of (and consultation with) the PAPs during
implementation.
- Staffing, training, work schedule and effectiveness of local ROs.
Scope of Work: Independent Monioring
8.   In addition to internal monitoring, an Independent Monitoring Organization
(IMO) will undertake the Independent Monitoring of the resettlement component to
observe i) the functioning of the resettlement network including the HERO; and, ii)
the adjustment of the PAPs to their new lifestyles. The IMO will be responsible to
conduct evaluation of the implementation process and the measurement of the
standards of living of the PAPs.
9.    The purpose of independent monitoring is to provide an evaluation of
resettlement by an organization independent of the administrative branch of the
provincial government, looking at the overall implementation from a broader, long-
term point of view. Independent Monitors will follow the resettlement activity to
evaluate whether the goals of resettlement are achieved through i) the application of
the Laws of PRC pertaining to resettlement; ii) compliance with the principles of the
World Bank's Operational Directive O.D. 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement; and iii)
an improvement in the standards of living of the PAPs or at least maintaining the pre-
project levels of well-being.
10.   Responsibilities of the IMO: IMO will act as an independent advisor to the
project and the PRO in evaluating the resettlement performance and suggesting
alternative courses of action in case problems are anticipated in the achievement of
the stated goals of the RAP. Specifically the IMO will undertake the following
activities listed in this section
11. Standards of Living Surveys: IMO will develop and conduct base-line Standards
of Living Surveys (SLS) on a random sample of PAPs and a control group before the
beginning of the resettlement implementation. SLS will be repeated annually (at least
138



twice after the implementation is completed) to measure the change in the standards
of living of the PAPs. This activity will be one of several approaches to determine the
changes in the living standards of the PAPs.
12.   Open ended interviews with the PAPs and observational methods will also
be utilized to supplement and guide the structured interview format. t
13.   Public Consultation: IMO will participate in public consultation meetings
held at the village and township level on a regular basis. By monitoring these
meetings IMO will evaluate the effectiveness of the PAPs participation, and the
incorporation of the PAPs' concerns into the RAP and its implementation. IMO will
also consult with the PAPs to understand the knowledge, inclination and the wishes of
the PAPs in restoring their livelihoods and report its findings to the HERO. These
activities will continue before during and after the implementation of resettlement.
14.   Grievance Issues: IMO will regularly visit affected sites and inquire about the
grievance issues by interviewing the local ROs. receiving the grievances and also by
interviewing the PAPs. Effectiveness of the grievance resolution framework will be
constantly monitored, and if necessary, suggestions will be made for possible changes
in the procedures to make the process more effective.
15.   Other Responsibilities: IMO will also Advise the HERO during the
preparation and implementation of the RAP, preparation of village level
implementation plans for the use of land-compensation funds, and monitor the
following indicators:
*  Payment of compensation and its levels.
  Land readjustment.
- Preparation and adequacy of resettlement sites.
=  House construction.
n Relocation of PAPs
- Provision of enterprise employment, its adequacy and income levels.
e  Training.
*  Rehabilitation of the vulnerable groups.
*  Infrastructure relocation.
*  Enterprise relocation, compensation and its adequacy.
*  Compensation of lost assets.
*  Compensation for lost work time.
*  Transition allowances.
*  Payment of replacement cost for lost assets.
*  Scheduling of the above (whenever applicable).
.  Organization of the resettlement network.
Staffing
16.   The HERO will be staffed with a director responsible only for resettlement
issues related to the highway projects. The director should have prior experience in
resettlement work and have authority to coordinate among different departments and
offices involved in resettlement work. The HERO should employ an adequate number
of staff knowledgeable in data processing resettlement and social issues to be able to
139



carry out its responsibilities.
17.   The IMO should be headed by a director who has at least five years of
experience in conducting population surveys. The organizations should have the
capability of data management, statistical analysis as well as experience in qualitative
surveys.
Reporting
18.  Internal and Independent Monitoring will be regularly conducted during the
project. During the implementation of resettlement HPCD will report the results of
both monitoring activities to the Bank on a semi-annual basis (or more frequently)
starting July 31, 1999. After the implementation is completed, Independent
Monitoring on the living standards of the PAPs and the Internal Monitoring on
remaining resettlement issues will be reported annually (by January 31 of each year).
