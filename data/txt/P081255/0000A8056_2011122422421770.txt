                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The two highly interlinked project development objectives are to (i) improve farmer's livelihoods and (ii) protect the environment in poor and highly degraded
                         watersheds of the Changjiang and Pearl River Basins by promoting an integrated and replicable model of sustainable rural development.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Significant efforts have been made to complete the project implementation before closure of the project in June 2012: currently almost 90% of the restructured investment plan are
                         completed and certified. It is thus expected that the provinces and municipalities will be able to finish all the planned works in time. Similarly, the project development objectives will
                         be achieved, but not to the extent envisioned at appraisal. Farmer livelihoods have improved under the project, but the impact has been lessened by agricultural restructuring. The
                         environmental objectives will also be achieved to a lesser extent than expected, as comprehensive treatment could not always be implemented.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The task team's assessment is that it will be possible to complete the project activities before closure of the project in June 2012. However, major efforts will be required in the last six
                         months to closely monitor the reimbursement and implementation process. Implementation should focus on ensuring that the physical works meet the project standards and are
                         sufficiently integrated.
