                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The two highly interlinked project development objectives are to (i) improve farmer's livelihoods and (ii) protect the environment in poor and highly degraded
                         watersheds of the Changjiang and Pearl River Basins by promoting an integrated and replicable model of sustainable rural development.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation progress continues to remain marginally satisfactory. The project adopts integrated approach through combining erosion control measures and income generating
                         activities as a package which are mutually reinforcing. However, in some counties it is being implemented in a disintegrated manner.

                         Physical progress is satisfactory, but quality of construction and orchard plantations in some counties was not satisfactory and needs to be improved. Final batch of watershed
