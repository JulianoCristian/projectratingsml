                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The task team's assessment is that it would be possible to complete the project activities on time, however major efforts would be required. With less than a year to the project closing
                         date, close monitoring of the implementation and reimbursement progress is required. While no major issues were observed with regards to the quality of works, it would be extremely
                         important to keep the focus on the quality during last several months of implementation as well.
