the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the project was complex as it\n            involved two closely interlinked objectives. The project\n            design developed a framework of mutually supportive and\n            integrated activities, which were closely linked to the\n            project outcomes. During implementation this design\n            framework proved important to guide decision making, so for\n            example when deciding on livestock, bio-gas or fruit tree\n            planting activities the linkages to soil and water\n            conservation became selection criteria. The project improved\n            its monitoring system continuously through implementation by\n            adopting monitoring and field tracking technologies, many of\n            which did not even exist at the design stage. The smart\n            phone and tablet based field tracking system combined with\n            the Management Information System (MIS) opened an entirely\n            new dimension for a transparent and interactive monitoring\n            and evaluation (M&E). During the lifetime of the project\n            the rural environment changes markedly. The agricultural\n            restructuring in project areas involved significant\n            out-migration combined with shortage of young and middle-age\n            labor, new responsibilities of women, development of\n            cooperatives, emerging larger farms, land consolidation, and\n            in some cases even the complete abandonment of marginal\n            settlements. The implementing agencies responded to these\n            developments but generally more flexibility to such changes\n            needs to be built into the project design."}, "docdt": "2012-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
