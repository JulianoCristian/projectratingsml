                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The two highly interlinked project development objectives are to (i) improve farmer's livelihoods and (ii) protect the environment in poor and highly degraded watersheds
                         of the Changjiang and Pearl River Basins by promoting an integrated and replicable model of sustainable rural development.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is nearly completed with all the physical works completed and certified. The project development objectives have largely been achieved. Farmer income and
                         land productivity increases are reported to have significantly increased and are expected to have exceeded the revised restructuring targets. Equally the environmental objectives will
                         also be achieved as measured by the extent of soil erosion control and carbon sequestration. Both indicators suggest that the targets revised at mid-term have been exceeded.
