The lessons learned indicate that\n            institutional development activities usually require\n            considerable lead time in order to be ready for\n            implementation, especially because of the complexity of\n            assessing municipal institutional development needs and\n            consolidating municipal management instruments to address\n            such needs. Strong project ownership and commitment to its\n            objectives on the part of the Borrower, and decentralization\n            of the responsibility for the contracting of works, goods\n            and services directly to the beneficiary municipalities were\n            key elements in achieving a successful implementation of the\n            project. The engagement of a capable NGO to work on the\n            social aspects of the Novos Alagados urban upgrading\n            sub-component proved to be a major asset for its successful\n            implementation. External support for the implementation of\n            essential services in municipalities should always be\n            carried out through direct financing to the municipalities\n            concerned, on the basis of sustainable financing. Training\n            for State as well as municipal staff involved in project\n            implementation, together with systematic technical\n            assistance targeted on the municipalities were key elements\n            in ensuring that the State and municipalities acquired the\n            necessary skills to effect changes in policy formulation and\n            management practices. Low-cost infrastructure activities in\n            small towns were seen to be more successful than those in\n            medium to large cities, in view of the higher levels of\n            commitment and greater participation by the local communities."}, "docdt": "2005-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
