The project will consist of\n            four primary components: (1) the Municipal Reform component\n            will finance basic reforms to reduce the municipal\n            government's role in providing urban infrastructure and\n            social service delivery, by privatizing or using private\n            concessions; (2) the Institutional Development component\n            consists of technical assistance, training, and equipment\n            purchases for municipalities and for the state regional\n            development authority, as well as modernization and\n            administrative reforms studies; (3) the Urban Infrastructure\n            component will focus on investment projects in urban\n            infrastructure, water, sewage, solid waste, paving and\n            drainage, and complementary, and regional investments; and\n            (4) the urban upgrading component, targeted to areas with\n            average household income below a maximum income ceiling will\n            consist of a package of integrated urban infrastructure\n            investments;  to repair macro and micro-damage,\n            complementary investments, and regional investments; and (4)\n            the urban upgrading component, targeted to areas with\n            average household income below a maximum income threshold\n            level, will consist of a package of integrated urban\n            infrastructure investments."}, "docdt": "1997-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
