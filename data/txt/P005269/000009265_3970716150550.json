will\n            relieve transport bottlenecks and congestion on\n            Jordan's international trade routes.  It will thus\n            facilitate the movement of key commodities such as\n            phosphate, potash, fertilizer and cement, as well as general\n            cargo.  The project will also contribute to institutional\n            development in the transport sector, already initiated under\n            the earlier Bank-financed transport project.  The highway\n            conponent includes: (i) improvements to routine and periodic\n            road maintenance programs; (ii) acquisition of traffic and\n            payment-testing equipment; and (iii) construction of a 30-km\n            alignment on the Aqaba-Amman road and a 6-km highway\n            improvement spur from this road to the port.  The railway\n            component includes: (i) extension of the Aqaba workshop;\n            (ii) renewal of about 101 km of track; (iii) acquisition of\n            track machinery, 90 phosphate wagons, and a breakdown crane;\n            and (iv) rehabilitation of four locomotives.  In addition,\n            the project includes technical assistance and training for\n            highways, railways, and the port."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
