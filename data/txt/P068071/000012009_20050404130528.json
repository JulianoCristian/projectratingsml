sustainability, and substantial\n            institutional development impacts, accompanied by\n            satisfactory performances both by the Bank and Borrower. The\n            following lessons emerged from the experience of the\n            project. Conditionality in an adjustment operation: The\n            large number of conditions for project effectiveness and\n            second tranche release will need to be balanced with the\n            implementing capacity of the borrower. In Mongolia, this\n            presented a serious challenge to the government, and as\n            well, for maintaining the momentum and the continuous\n            attention it required, particularly in light of\n            Administration changes. This was reflected in the weak\n            capacity, and lack of information among government agencies.\n            This requires a technical assistance operation in capacity\n            building programs, to prepare the ground for, or a technical\n            assistance operation in parallel with, the adjustment\n            operation. A key to ensure fulfillment of tranche release\n            conditions is the Bank team/management's continuous\n            dialogue with the main stakeholders on the longer-term\n            benefits of difficult policy actions required by the\n            adjustment lending. In addition, an appropriate time frame\n            is required for the institution-building components,\n            particularly so in countries with weak civil service such as\n            Mongolia. The time frame required to introduce fundamental\n            changes in the financial and banking sectors, as well as for\n            institution building, requires better programming and\n            sequencing. Therefore, new institutions, once established,\n            would need continuing monitoring and improvement in order to\n            be effective in fulfilling their role in the financial sector."}, "docdt": "2005-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
