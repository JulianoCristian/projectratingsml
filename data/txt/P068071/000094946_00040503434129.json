reform, in order to achieve\n            macroeconomic stability, accelerate private sector growth,\n            and reduce poverty. The components include the establishment\n            of basic financial infrastructure, such as improved banking\n            skills, accounting standards, and clear policy framework\n            regarding bank failures; consolidation of the banking\n            system; divestiture of the Government's ownership in\n            the Trade and Development Bank; development of effective\n            regulation, and supervision of the financial system;\n            improvement of the payments system in rural areas; and,\n            confirmation of the government's commitment to honor\n            financial contracts, through a timely servicing of\n            Government bonds. Within the strategic framework, the\n            project will provide financial resources to Mongolia, and\n            avoid excessive transitional decline in consumption, and\n            investment practices, enabling a reasonable adjustment to\n            recent trade shocks. The economy will benefit from the\n            emergence of institutions, and markets, thus,\n            inter-mediation of financial resources will be ensured.\n            However, the outcome of the forthcoming parliamentary\n            elections may hinder ownership of the financial sector\n            program, and, the limitations within the administrative\n            capacity, may be further weakened by the opposition of\n            vested interests."}, "docdt": "2000-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
