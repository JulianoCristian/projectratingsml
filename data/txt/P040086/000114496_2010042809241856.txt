Re:
Ecuador- Loan No. 4277-EC (Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian 
Peoples 
Development Project) Amendment to the Loan 
Agreement
Dear Madam Minister:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement between the Republic of Ecuador (the 
Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), 
dated June 12, 1998 (the "Loan Agreement").
We are pleased to inform you that, pursuant to your request, the Bank hereby 
agrees to amend Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement, paragraph 1, by increasing the 
percentage of expenditures to be financed for Category (2) Goods to 100% for foreign 
expenditures and 90% for local expenditures; and Category (3) Consultant’s services 
and training to 100%, so as to adjust the financing to meet expenditures under the 
Project. These increases have been motivated by Resolution No.105 of the Servicio de 
Rentas Internas of Ecuador, which reduced to zero the percentage of Value Added Tax 
(Impuesto al Valor Agregado) applied to acquisitions of goods made by Ecuadorian 
Federal Agencies with funds obtained through international organizations such as the 
Bank.
We hereby also modify the definition of "CONPLADE-IN" in Article 1, Section 1.02 
(c) of the Loan Agreement, to reflect the creation of CODENPE, through Presidential 
Decree No. 386 issued December 11, 1998, to read as follows:  "(c) "CONPLADE-IN" means 
Consejo Nacional de Planificación y Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas y Negros, the 
Borrower's national council for the planning and development of indigenous and 
Afro-Ecuadorian peoples established by the CONPLADE-IN Decree (as defined below), or 
any successor entity to CONPLADE-IN acceptable to the Bank, including the Consejo de 
Desarrollo de las Nacionalidades y Pueblos del Ecuador ("CODENPE"), established by the 
Borrower's presidential decree No. 386 of December 11, 1998;" Finally, the reference 
in Article VII, Section 7.02 of the Agreement, to the Consejo Nacional de 
Planificación y Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas y Negros, shall be replaced by the 
Consejo de Desarrollo de las Nacionalidades y Pueblos del Ecuador ("CODENPE"), located 
in Garcia Moreno 1150 y Chile, Quito, Ecuador.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing and dating the form of 
confirmation below and returning the same to the undersigned. This amendment letter 
will become effective as of the date the Bank receives one fully executed original.
Sincerely,
Krishna Challa
