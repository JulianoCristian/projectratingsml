communities by providing improved access to\n            land resources and financing for investment subprojects\n            planned and implemented by local membership organizations\n            and communities. The project components are four. The first\n            strengthens second and third tier indigenous and\n            Afro-Ecuadorian membership organizations in 1) subproject\n            participatory planning, preparation, implementation, and\n            maintenance; 2) financial management and administration; 3)\n            cultural patrimony; and 4) human resources development,\n            including basic legal training. This component focuses on\n            seven small ethnic groups in danger of extinction, and also\n            finances goods and equipment and incremental operating\n            costs. The second component 1) titles and regularizes land\n            tenure rights in productive, forestry, and protected areas;\n            2) purchases land; 3) diagnoses and elaborates an action\n            plan for community-owned irrigation systems; and 4) supports\n            a program of legal reforms. It also strengthens public\n            sector agencies. The third component finances demand-driven\n            small-scale investments in natural resources management;\n            community-based economic infrastructure; social\n            infrastructure; and economic projects and micro-enterprises.\n            The fourth component provides institutional strengthening of\n            the National Council of Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Development."}, "docdt": "1997-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
