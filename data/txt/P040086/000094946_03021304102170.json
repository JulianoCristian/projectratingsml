Development Project for Ecuador was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned indicate that a project design which\n            emphasizes decentralized implementation is crucial for\n            successfully dealing with ethnic and cultural diversity of\n            beneficiaries. The mobilization of labor and capital can be\n            an effective vehicle for promoting local employment and\n            growth. Piloting procedures should speed up the project\n            implementation and improve results. Ensuring that training\n            be given to beneficiary groups will result in a successful\n            implementation of small investment subprojects. Transfer of\n            land in environmentally fragile protected areas may require\n            an accommodating legal framework which confirms the unique\n            access to those land by indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian\n            communities, based upon ancestral rights."}, "docdt": "2003-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
