F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of this project is to assist the Government of Grenada to begin the process
of modernizing its public sector. This includes building the capacity to design and
implement public sector modernization initiatives which would address "rightsizing" the
public sector and determining which services would best be delivered by an Executive
Agency or commercialization. The specific objectives of the project are to (i) improve
service delivery in those agencies designated as Executive Agencies; (ii) introduce
modern human resource management principles into the public sector; (iii) build the
capacity of the Government to lead and implement modernization efforts; (iv) encourage
sub-regional cooperation through the procurement of select goods and services; and (v)
strengthen the enabling environment for small and micro businesses.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised PDO is to assist the process of modernizing Grenada's public sector with a
focus on improving public sector efficiency in service delivery and management,
enhancing private sector collaboration in support of developing small businesses, and
promoting regionalization initiatives.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      At the time of project preparation, Grenada faced multiple development
challenges that included: finding new sources of growth; addressing high public sector
debt that reached 129 percent of GDP by the end of 2004, and protecting social gains
made in the previous three decades against changing external environment. The costs of
public services were high due to diseconomies of scale and the capacity of the public and
private sector to accelerate growth was limited. Besides, the devastating 2004 Hurricane
Ivan, followed by Hurricane Emily in 2005, caused enormous damage to the country,
estimated above 200 per cent of GDP. The Government of Grenada saw public sector
reform as a critical element needed to resume economic growth, achieve competitiveness
and improve efficiency of public services.
2.      Grenada, along with several other small island states in the Caribbean,is a
member of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), which sought and still
seeks to deepen sub-regional integration in the areas of central banking, training in public
management and other areas. The project saw opportunities to broaden regional
cooperation to encompass such other areas as: public procurement, and public sector
transformation. The diagnostic work in the area of government institutional capacity
identified a number of weaknesses, including: the lack of capacity and skills to design
and implement public sector modernization strategies; an excessive public sector wage
bill (11 percent of GDP); the lack of performance focus; and the unattractiveness of the
public service employment. In the area of procurement, initial positive experience in joint
regional procurement of pharmaceuticals held a promise of reducing the cost of
procurement through expanding regional cooperation in procurement to other sectors as
well. The growth of the local private sector, an engine for creating local employment and
revenue, was weakened by the lack of entrepreneurial skills among the population, as
diagnosed during project preparation.
3.      Bank’s involvement in supporting public sector modernization was timely and in
line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, FY06-09). This involvement followed
specific CAS directions: (i) strengthening public sector institutional capacity; (ii)
promoting transparency and modernization of the public sector; and (iii) facilitating small
businesses initiatives. These areas of engagement were seen as critical for promoting
economic restructuring and fiscal adjustment. The Public Sector Modernization Project
(PSMP) was complementary to other Bank and donor activities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
4.       The original objective of this project, as presented in PAD, was to assist the
Government of Grenada to begin the process of modernizing its public sector. This
included building the capacity to design and implement public sector modernization
initiatives that would address "right-sizing" the public sector and determining which
services would best be delivered by an Executive Agency (EA) type of organization or
through commercialization. The specific objectives of the project were: (i) to improve
service delivery in those agencies designated EAs; (ii) to introduce modern human


                                             1
resource management principles into the public sector; (iii) to build the capacity of the
Government to lead and implement modernization efforts; (iv) to encourage sub-regional
cooperation through the procurement of select goods and services; and (v) to strengthen
the enabling environment for small and micro businesses.
5.     The key original project outcome indicators, as presented in PAD, included the
following:
    a) Improved management capacity of the public sector to deliver services;
    b) More cost-effective and efficient public services;
    c) Increased capacity of the public sector to implement modernization projects;
    d) Stronger enabling environment for small business development;
    e) Sector Reform Unit: progress in staffing with adequate number of qualified
       personnel by the end of the project. Public Number of proposals prepared,
       accepted and under implementation; and
    f) Number of goods and services jointly procured.

1.3 Revised PDO, as approved by the Board of Directors, and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
6.       The revised and more specific PDO (approved by the Board in October 2010) was
to assist the process of modernizing Grenada’s public sector with a focus on improving
public sector efficiency in service delivery and management, enhancing private sector
collaboration in support of developing small businesses, and promoting regional
initiatives. The change has been made to bring consistency to the PDO statements in the
PAD and Financing Agreement, dated April 26, 2006. Additionally, changes in Key
Indicators reflected the Government’s decision to no longer pursue the establishment of
Executive Agencies.
7.      During the Level 1 (2010) restructuring the initial outcome indicators were
dropped and replaced by new indicators. In particular, the first two PDO level indicators
related to Component 1 that focused on increasing efficiencies in the public sector were
aligned and made consistent with those of the Grenada Economic and Social
Development Policy Loan (ESDPL, P117000) that was approved by the Board in June
2010. The new project closing date was set as June 30, 2012. The new outcome indicators
appeared more realistic at the time of restructuring, more specific, and easier to measure.
They are presented below.
    a) The number of days needed to register a business and receive a company
       certificate is decreased; and overall number of days to start a business decreased
       against the baseline. Target: 5 days to register a business and receive a company
       certificate and 15 days – total number of days to start a business 1.




1
  Indicators a) and b) were aligned with Grenada Economic and Social DPL (P117000) that was delivered
in June 2010. The ICR for the DPL recognized that PSMP was addressing the concerns raised with respect
to public sector constraints.



                                                  2
       b) The number of days needed to register property deeds has decreased, lowering the
          number of days to register a property. Target: at least 50% reduction in the
          number of days to register property deeds; number of days to register property
          decreased by 39% (or 47 days).
       c) Number of small businesses started. Target: total of 30 GIDC trainees
          commenced new businesses, or 50% increase from the February 2010 baseline of
          20 new businesses opened by trained entrepreneurs.
       d) Economies of scale explored at OECS regional level through pooled procurement.
          Target: initiated activities to strengthen the capacity and collaboration to
          operationalize pooled procurement with St. Vincent, building on 2009 MOU on
          Pooled Procurement.
       e) Revised Indicator for Public Sector Reform Unit (PRSU): progress in staffing
          with adequate number of qualified personnel by the end of the project.
8.      The driving reason for the adaptive restructuring was that the activities of
Component 1 of the original project, aimed at the establishment of Executive Agencies,
could not be implemented as planned. According to the Attorney General’s letter to the
Bank, dated February 25, 2010, the Executive Agency Act of 2008 (section 11(1)) was
found in contradiction with the Section 84(1) of the Constitution 2 . Specifically, the
provision to decentralize the human resource management authority from the Public
Service Commission 3 to the Chief Executive Officer of an agency was found
unconstitutional. The World Bank sought and received an independent legal opinion on
the legitimacy of the decentralization or delegation of personnel management from the
Public Service Commission to public entities. This opinion confirmed the view expressed
by the Attorney General of Grenada.
9.      Originally, approximately 40 percent of the Credit proceeds were allocated to
support the establishment of two Executive Agencies. When this became legally
untenable, in 2009 the Government pursued, through amendments to the legislation, the
separation of the Deeds and Land Registry from the Supreme Court Registry, which
opened the way for setting up a separate Enhanced Department 4 responsible for Deeds
and Land Registry. Additionally, legal separation of the Corporate Affairs and
Intellectual Property Office (CAIPO) from the Supreme Court Registry enabled the

 Art. 84.1 of the Constitution of Grenada vests powers to appoint, exercise disciplinary control, remove
persons from office and grant leave in the Public Service Commission. However, Art. 84.2 allows the
Public Service Commission to delegate in writing, with the consent of the Prime Minister, any of its powers
defined in 84.1 subject to such conditions, as it thinks fit.

  On February 11, 2008, the Chief Personnel Officer of the Public Service Commission sent a
Memorandum of Understanding to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Human Resources,
indicating its willingness to delegate the human resources function to the Chief Executive Officer of the
planned Executive Agency. Source: Aide Memoire of February 20-23, 2008

    Enhanced Departments conformed to the Constitution and included performance management elements.

Government to create a second Enhanced Department. These legal changes and
Government’s expressed commitment to pursuing the establishment and institutional
strengthening of the two registration services were the grounds for project restructuring.
These legal changes were also among the prior actions under the ESDPL. Through this
restructuring, which was closely aligned with the ESDPL, the resources for implementing
the revised Component 1 were increased from $1.5 million to $1.73 million by means of
funds reallocation from lower priority activities in other components.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
10.     The project targeted several internal beneficiaries and the ultimate beneficiary –
the people of Grenada. The primary beneficiaries were: various institutions responsible
for land and deeds and intellectual property registration services; the Small Business
Development Center of the Grenada Industrial Development Corporation; the Public
Sector Reform Unit of the Public Administration Department; and the Public
Procurement Office (although the latter was not explicitly mentioned in the PAD). The
list of beneficiaries for Component 1, titled Executive Agencies and Performance
Management, included several responsible ministries: the Ministry of Legal Affairs
(responsible for Supreme Court Registry), the Inland Revenue Division of the Ministry of
Finance (responsible for Land Valuation), the Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, Forestry,
Fisheries, Public Utilities and Energy, the Ministry of Finance (responsible for physical
planning). The Grenada Industrial Development Corporation was responsible for
Component 2. The Department of Public Administration (former Department of Human
Resources) was an implementing agency for the project.
11.     The general public was expected to benefit from better access and efficient
registration of property deeds and land registration services. Indirectly, the general public
was seen as the ultimate beneficiary of the pooled procurement, which was aimed at
improving efficiencies and reducing the cost of procurement. A group of future
entrepreneurs were expected to benefit from business development training, as well as
from streamlining of business registration procedures. The Public Sector Reform Unit
was expected to benefit from new knowledge imparted through training and advisory
support from CARICAD in the area of designing and implementing reforms aimed at
improving public services effectiveness and efficiency.
12.    During the restructuring the beneficiaries of the projects remained the same.

1.5 Original Components

13.    Component 1 – Executive Agencies and Performance Management: This
component sought to support the preparation and creation of two Executive Agencies
through the reorganization and merger of a number of government functions. The project
assumed that through Executive Agencies the efficiency of resource management would
improve compared to the quality of services delivered through fragmented institutional
arrangements in various ministries and departments. Two new agencies were identified as
a target for the project: (i) Grenada Land Agency (GLA) and (ii) Companies and




                                             4
Intellectual Property Office (CAIPO). The estimated original cost of this component was
$1.635 million (47 percent of project cost) 5.
14.     Component 2 - Strengthening the Grenada Industrial Development Corporation
(GIDC): The component was planned to support the strengthening of a Small Business
Development Center of GIDC through technical assistance and training to the small and
micro segments of the business community. The component also envisaged remodeling
of the premises, acquiring a mini-van to commute to remote parishes, implementing the
train-the-trainer program, logistically supporting the provision of training to future
entrepreneurs, and technical assistance in private sector development. The original size of
Component 2 was $550,000 (16 percent of project cost).
15.     Component 3 - Regional Initiatives: Component 3 included two parts: (a)
preparation and implementation of pooled procurement with at least one OECS member;
and (b) technical assistance to PSRU to support regional integration efforts in the area of
public sector management transformation, to be provided by CARICAD. The original
budget for regional initiatives was determined at the level of $490,000 (14 percent of
project cost).
16.     Component 4 – Strengthening the Public Sector Reform Unit and Project
Administration: The dual purpose of this component was: to (a) support the PSRU in
managing public sector modernization program; and (b) support project management and
project audit. The PSRU was expected to receive technical assistance and training in the
public sector modernization, project management, monitoring and evaluation,
information technology development, human resources management and communication
strategies, as well as to provide basic office equipment. The Project Coordination Unit
was expected to receive technical assistance and training in procurement, records
management, annual audits, and basic office equipment. The amount allocated to this
component was $815,000 (23 percent of project cost).

1.6 Revised Components
17.    Project components were revised and amended (adapted to the new circumstances
of project external environment) during the Level 1 restructuring in October 2010. The
following changes were made:
18.     Component 1 - Enhanced Departments and Public Sector Performance
Management: This component no longer pursued the creation of Executive Agencies.
Instead, the project aimed at conversion of selected Government functions through the
establishment of two new Enhanced Departments – (i) Deeds and Land Registry and (ii)
Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Office.

 The amounts presented in this section reflect the provisions in the PAD. These differ from the
amounts for the initial allocation to components, as presented in table 1 below. This reflects
differences in information presented in various Bank documents.



                                                5
19.     Component 2 - Strengthening the Grenada Industrial Development Corporation
(GIDC): This component did not change, as it was nearly completed at the time of
restructuring.
20.     Component 3 – Regional Initiatives: Given the completion of the CARICAD
Diagnostic Review to guide public sector modernization reforms by the time of
restructuring, the component was refocused on implementation of a regional pooled
procurement scheme. The new activities included: (i) analysis of training needs; (ii)
training to facilitate regional pooled procurement implementation; and (iii) design of a
regional pilot procurement payment and inventory management system.
21.     Component 4 – Capacity Building for Public Sector Reform Unit and Project
Administration 6: Component 4 was scaled down by removing the following activities, for
which grant financing (IDF) became available: (i) consultancy services of a local IT
specialist in the PSRU; and (ii) consultancy services for monitoring and evaluation. The
funds for the cancelled activities were reallocated to finance the project administration
function in view of the project extension for additional 18 months (and the subsequent
extension for additional nine months).
22.    The project proceeds were reallocated to increase funding for the establishment of
the Enhanced Departments and implement improvements in procedures and digitalization
of maps and records, computerization of record making, and providing on-line services.
The reallocation of funds is presented in Table 1.

Administration”.

land, companies, and intellectual property registration. The project budget was adjusted
accordingly, considering that some activities were eligible for financing under the IDF
grant operation. The project was extended originally for 18 months, setting a new closing
date of June 31, 2012. Subsequently in June 2012, during the third restructuring the
project was extended for an additional nine months to enable completion of the initiated
activities under Component 1, including those of civil works, and development and
implementation of the information system for land and property registration, among the
most important.
24.      During the second Level 2 restructuring in October 2011credit proceeds were
reallocated again, as presented in Table 2. The reallocation was necessary to finance key
activities supporting the proper functioning of the new Enhanced Departments.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

25.      Following the approval of the Project Concept Note (PCN) on April 18, 2005, the
project was negotiated six months later and approved on December 15, 2005. In line with
the CAS 2001-2004 priorities, the project design had a dual focus: one – on strengthening
public sector management; the other – on exploring and harnessing opportunities for
economies of scale through sub-regional cooperation. In the absence of a national
strategy document at the time of preparation, specific areas for technical assistance were
evolving since the first project identification mission in June 2004. At PCN stage, the
preliminary project design was somewhat broader than that at approval. It was focused on
(i) strengthening human resources and financial management (including rightsizing of the

 The presentation of the change of allocation of the credit by component was done in XDR, rather than in
US Dollar equivalent, to reflect the allocation in XDR presented in the Financing Agreement of April 26,
2006.



                                                       7
public sector and strengthening expenditure management), (ii) improving selected public
services through establishing executive agencies and strengthening performance
management, (iii) reducing the size of the public sector through commercializing services
by means of contracting out; (iv) strengthening Public Sector Reform Unit in designing
and coordinating reforms; and (v) exploring efficiency in procurement through
implementing pooled procurement of selected goods and services with at least one of the
OECS countries.
26.     During the quality control at PCN stage, peer reviewers’ comments supported the
focus on service delivery improvements and private sector development as opposed to a
“whole of government” approach to public sector modernization. The Public Sector
Reform Unit (PSRU) was not considered as capable of leading a comprehensive public
modernization effort, as it lacked capacity and clout due the relatively low hierarchical
status. The reviewers cautioned against mainstreaming performance management from
the initial pilot too quickly, as these reforms usually take many years to accomplish.
While admitting desirability of the regional integration of OECS states in pooled
procurement, the review identified the need for influential leadership to bring about such
a change. Finally, it was recognized that the Ministry of Finance, by the virtue of having
much more clout than the PSRU, should be mobilized to drive the change.
27.     At the design stage, the Bank team engaged with the client in discussions on key
reform areas, e.g., setting up Executive Agencies (EAs) and implementing pooled
procurement. The discussions highlighted some areas of concern with regard to
establishing executive agencies. Permanent Secretaries pointed out legal and regulatory
constraints related to the proposed delegation of managerial autonomy to Chief Executive
Officer of an agency, highlighted the need to resolve personnel management and pension
issues in cases of termination of posts or separation of public officials from the office,
and suggested to define clear reporting mechanisms between the agency’s CEO and the
responsible minister. While these concerns were documented in the mission’s Aide
Memoire of May 2005, they were not substantially addressed in the project design.
28.     At appraisal, the project identified three major risks: (i) weak implementation
capacity of the PSRU (understaffed, lacking skills, and lacking political clout); (ii)
potentially unfavorable political economy context; and (iii) weak capacity of GIDC to
build constituency within the private sector in support of reforms. The project offered
mitigation measures, such as technical assistance, political commitment of the Prime
Minister, a communication program, and targeted engagement with the private sector
through a Chamber of Commerce. The overall risk of the project was rated as moderate.
29.     The PAD has not reflected the concerns, expressed at the Quality Enhancement
Review stage by Sr. Legal Counsel, related to the consistency of the establishment of
Executive Agencies with the country’s public administration and legal framework. Prior
to the submission of the Minutes of Decision Meeting, held on October 6, 2005, the Bank
has obtained a report by a PHRD project preparation grant consultant 9, in which potential

                                                      8
constitutional problems with establishing the Executive Agencies were highlighted. The
report suggested that the Executive Agency Act could help resolve the issue of delegation
of the human resource management function to the Chief Executive Officer, and advised
to support the Government during implementation in resolving the issue of termination of
public office position during the establishment of Executive Agencies. These
recommendations, including the review of the constitutional and legal issues, were
subsequently included in the Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement (description of the
project Part 1).
30.     The obstacles to achieving the original development objective materialized in the
areas that previously were not identified in the PAD as risky. Specifically, the project
design assumed legal feasibility of divesting personnel management authority from the
Public Service Commission (PSC) to CEOs of Executive Agencies (EA). However, the
delegation of the human resource management function was contested by the Attorney
General (AG) 10, which led to the suspension of the implementation of Component 1 for
over a year. As a result, the Government decided to find alternatives to an EA status and
set up government departments, further referred to as Enhanced Departments, with PSC
in control of human resource management. One way of avoiding such complication
during project implementation was to reach an agreement with the Borrower on the
constitutionality of the proposed institutional change during the design stage. This had
not been done.
31.      With regard to pooled procurement, the recommendations for strengthening the
institutional system to manage pooled procurement, developed under the PHRD grant,
were not addressed in the design, possibly due to budget constraints. This may have
contributed to the lack of drive and ownership of this objective at the technical level
during the implementation. Following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding
on pooled procurement between Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines in October
2009 and identifying suitable goods and services for such pooled procurement, further
activities were suspended in the face of legal obstacles, as Public Procurement Acts in
both countries required amendments, which had not been enacted during the project
lifetime. While the legal obstacles were not insurmountable, the Government did not
pursue this issue with required vigor and determination. Also Parliament prorogation in
July 2012 prevented any legislative action prior to the project closure. At the time of ICR
mission, the new Public Procurement Act was still being finalized by the Government.




10
  The legislative review of constitutionality of delegating human resources management authority
to agency’s CEO was lengthy. It was carried out by the AG and three constitutional lawyers. The
official legal opinion, issued by the AG on February 25, 2010, stated that the Executive Agencies
Act was incompatible with the constitutional provisions (Art.84.1) in relation to the legality of
delegation by the PSC of its functions to Agency CEO. Such ‘blanket delegation’ through a law
would contradict the constitutionally, provided discretion of the PSC to decide conditions of
delegation. During the ICR mission, interviewed officials were of a view that the legal opinion
was only one interpretation of the intent of the Constitution.



                                               9
32.     During the implementation of Component 1 after project restructuring, a need for
modernizing the core registration and data management instruments, not recognized at
the design stage, was identified. During the early implementation stages, the focus was
solely on institutional and management aspects of public services, while technical studies
on requirements for effective registration were postponed. Such technical studies were
realized only after project restructuring of October 2010. To deliver efficient services, the
new Grenada Land Agency required updated and digitalized maps, digital land parcels’
and deeds records, application software for storing and retrieving information, and a
geodetic system to build a national cadaster, none of which had been identified during the
design. Additional technical assistance, unforeseen and not budgeted in PAD, was
required to enable effective and efficient land registration services.
33.     Design omissions caused implementation delays, led to the examination of
legality of the proposed delegation of personnel management responsibility to agency
chief executive officers, necessitated restructuring of the project to align objectives with
the constitutional provisions, required reallocation of resources to Component 1 from
other Components, and caused significant reduction in the scope of results achieved.
However, the appraisal summary had not identified any of those technical issues that
almost derailed the project implementation.
34.     In summary, the general choice of key project areas was justified by the need and
an opportunity to improve services and reduce costs for the government and the public.
However, implementation challenges, risks, and performance indicators were not
sufficiently analyzed. Design omissions presented serious challenges and demanded
strategic decision making during implementation to avoid dropping the project.

2.2 Implementation

35.     During 2006-2009 the project implementation status gradually regressed from
satisfactory (S) to unsatisfactory (U) rating passing through moderately satisfactory (MS)
and then moderately unsatisfactory (MU) phases. The departure of the Project Manager
(consultant) in June 2008 left a void in project management for 19 months. This was an
especially critical period in project implementation, as the Trade Unions and then the
Attorney General initiated legal contestation of the legality of the Executive Agency Act.
This period was marked by the deepest plunge in ranking of the project implementation
status and the ranking of likelihood of attaining the development objective. As early as in
May 2007, a project consultant produced a legal opinion on the introduction of Executive
Agencies in Grenada. This opinion advised that Executive Agencies should be part of the
public service, as the Constitution allowed for the Delegation of the authority over the
management of public servants to a public official, which should itself be appointed by
the Public Service Commission. Another issue reflected in the opinion was that the
transformation of the Government Department into an Executive Agency would not
imply that the public officers of the Departments were to change their legal status unless
found insufficiently qualified and could not be employed in the public service elsewhere.
The opinion on the latter issue had important fiscal implications, as the Government
could not afford paying severance payment to all public officers of the Departments
during the organizational change following the establishment of the EAs.


                                             10
36.     The Bank team closely followed the formation of the official opinion regarding
the constitutionality of the EAs. Following the Consultant’s opinion of May 2007, the
Bank formally asked the Government to make a decision and submit to the Bank a
Government Legal Opinion and identify the way forward. The October 2007 Aide
Memoire, Team Leader’s Letter to the Minister of Finance in December 2007, Aide
Memoires February 2008, and of October 2008, the letter of March 2009 reiterate the
Bank’s request to issue an official Legal Opinion by the Government, that have not been
done until February 25, 2010. Meanwhile, the Bank team tried to share experience of
Executive Agencies from other countries through a presentation to the Government
(August 2008), a study visit of the Grenadian government delegation to Jamaica to visit
the Land Agency, a visit of the Bank’s Sector Manager in October 2008 who presented
lessons from international experiences more broadly. In spite of these efforts, the
Government was divided on the issue of Executive Agencies, with part of the
Government not accepting the idea of delegation of managerial responsibilities in the area
of human resources management to Chief Executive Officers. Although the Public
Services Commission did not raise issues on delegation, the legal community in Grenada
seemed to be strongly opposed to that. Political support of the new Government, sworn
in in July 2008, did not back up the EA issue with determination, which caused delays
and eventually a search for alternative solutions to the original objective of improving
performance of the government regulatory services.
37.     On October 2, 2009, the Government submitted a request for project restructuring,
confirming its commitments to the development objective and suggesting changes in
project strategy and implementation, as approved by the Project Steering Committee.
38.     Unable to legally establish new Executive Agencies due to the declared
constitutional restrictions (see Paras 29, 30, and 35), but still committed to improving
public sector management, the Government opted for establishing Enhanced Departments
(EDs) that would still be part of the Government (without separate legal personality),
with centralized appointment of agency personnel by the Public Service Commission, and
with the authority to charge fees for registration services. While new EDs envisaged
reduced managerial flexibility, compared to that of EAs, performance improvements
were expected to be achieved through consolidation of related functions under a single
management, thus enabling streamlined and faster service delivery. The Government’s
restructuring proposal included details of the functional allocation, information
requirements related to a cadaster, and other information.
39.      A few months after the receipt of the restructuring request, the Bank received the
legal opinion from Grenada’s Attorney General along with a confirmation that a new
Project Manager had been appointed. A new Team Leader was also assigned to the
Project shortly thereafter and a Bank mission was deployed to Grenada in March 2010 to
assess the feasibility of turning the project around and achieve positive impact. The Bank
team and the Borrower conducted a detailed analysis of the progress, challenges and
opportunities for attaining intended results of improving public sector performance and
facilitating growth of small businesses in Grenada. The Bank team strengthened its
technical team by hiring an urban specialist to review the feasibility of, and technical
requirements for, the establishment of Grenada Land Agency. Based on detailed technical


                                            11
analysis and responding to Government’s request to save the project, the Bank team
decided on project restructuring. In October 2010, the Bank approved Level 1 project
restructuring with modifications in: (i) the development objective; (ii) key results
indicators; (iii) the allocation of funds among components; and (iv) the closing date. The
project was extended for 18 months with the new closing date of June 30, 2012. Before
the restructuring, the project disbursed approximately $1.02 Million and committed $0.62
Million, in total less than half of the Credit.
40.     The most important reason behind the first restructuring was an effort to
overcome constitutional challenges that first interrupted and then prevented the
establishment of Executive Agencies. Upon revising the plan for establishing government
departments instead of the EAs, the estimated total cost of implementation of Component
1 increased above the original estimates. The revised cost covered updating maps,
digitalizing paper records, designing geodetic network, procuring equipment for GLA,
and purchasing and refurbishing new premises to house both EDs 11. In order to finance
new activities, funds were reallocated from other components, considered less critical to
PDO. Following the first restructuring, project implementation ratings moved to the
positive MS territory again, only to be followed by a drop to moderately unsatisfactory
(MU) status due to the lack of measurable progress, especially with regard to pooled
procurement activities that were stalled. Despite delivery of the useful outputs, e.g., (i) a
review of the Public Sector Reform Unit’s job descriptions, competencies, and (ii)
training by CARICAD, the capacity building of PSRU was undermined by staff turnover
through mandatory rotation administered by the Public Service Commission.
41.      In April 2012, only about two months within the project closing date, the progress
with attaining results was still behind expectations. The information technology services
(for (i) establishing a data center for the land registry and (ii) developing an application
for capturing and search of registered deeds) were not yet procured. The committed and
disbursed amounts totaled 59 per cent of the project proceeds, indicating a strong need
for an additional project extension. In June 2012, the project was extended for a second
time from June 30, 2012 to March 31, 2013, the extension totaling 27 months from the
original project closing date of December 2010.
42.     The project closed on March 31, 2013. In spite of considerable work done to
implement the two Enhanced Departments, the latter have not been formally established,
albeit these are presently functioning as de facto Enhanced Departments (led by the
acting management team). The enabling bills establishing Grenada Land Agency and the
Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Office had not been passed by Parliament due
to its prorogation since June 2012 until the general elections in February 2013.
Consequently, the organizational and staff remuneration structure, although developed,


11
  Initially, the Government wished to house both EDs GLA and CAIPO in new premises.
However, the Government was able to purchase only one building, that for CAIPO. The
constituent departments of the GLA are expected to be housed in separate locations, with
information exchange network. This is a suboptimal decision, which may be reconsidered in the
future, especially when GLA is legally established.

could not have been approved and implemented. Hiring Directors and key personnel of
the new Enhanced Departments could not have been done pending the approval of the
legal and regulatory framework. The acquired building that would house CAIPO had not
been fully refurbished, preventing department’s move to the new premises. These
shortcomings in achieving results warranted the final rating of the Implementation Status
and Results Report (ISR) as Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU). Regretfully, the project
suffered from an inactive Parliament, resulting in the laws defining new Departments not
having been enacted at the time of ICR mission. Thus project objectives under
Components 1 and 3 (Executive Departments and Pooled Procurement) could not have
been fully achieved.
43.    In the area of promoting Small Business Development by Grenada Industrial
Development Corporation, a policy and strategy on supporting small businesses, training
in entrepreneurial skills to potential entrepreneurs, and business development were
provided, resulting in opening new small businesses by trained persons (41 in 2009 and
25 in 2010). Other results, related to renovation and refurbishment of the Small Business
Center and purchasing a vehicle, were delivered, thus facilitating the provision of training
by the GIDC trained staff and international experts.
44.     Project delays resulted in some activities being completed just before the closure,
which reduced opportunities for early post-implementation support, as in the case of the
new information system for land registration. Luckily, the project financed an IT
consultant 12, whose contract ended in March 2013, still continues voluntarily supporting
information system’s development for the future Grenada Land Agency (GLA). The
proposed organizational, management and personnel changes for GLA have not been
implemented either, as described in paragraph 40. Consequently, planned performance
improvements through a more efficient organization and management of Enhanced
Departments still remain the goal to be achieved. The project has not been able to utilize
all the credit funds: an estimated amount of $0.748 million remains undisbursed, as of
September 17, 2013 (the disbursement period ended on July 31, 2013).
45.     In retrospect, the fact that the project was saved from the 2008-2009 stalemate is
positive, as the project has created a foundation for improvements in property and
business registration, supported small business development, and contributed to capacity
building in public sector management. Managerial improvements that were expected to
lead to better public service delivery still are to be addressed, when the two EDs are fully
established, both legally and organizationally. The foundation for improved public
service delivery is still delicate, requiring support for full institutionalization and
integration of separate outputs into a measurable and sustainable impact. Both Bank
investment operation 13 and a proposed Development Policy Operation support the

Minister 14 to public sector modernization agenda gives hope that the Government will
build upon project contributions to achieve more effective and efficient public sector
management.



2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

46.     The originally approved performance indicators for the development objective
were characterized by being very broad, general, ambitious and difficult to measure. An
example of such indicator could be ‘increased capacity of the public sector to implement
modernizations projects’. The indicator of capacity to implement reforms was expected to
measure the progress in increasing staffing with adequate number of qualified personnel.
This indicator could be used to demonstrate Government’s commitment to the public
sector reform; however, can hardly be attributable to the project. Some of the outcome
indicators for components were input-oriented, for example, ‘amount invested in training’.
During Level 1 restructuring, the PDO indicators were amended to align them with the
refocused components and make them more measurable.
47.     The original intermediate indicators in most cases lacked the baseline, making
progress measuring difficult. Selected indicators were difficult to interpret, e.g.,
‘satisfaction levels from results of customer surveys undertaken at end of each year’. The
indicator omitted to identify the area in which satisfaction would be measured. As a result
of such deficiencies in the result framework, during the first phase of the project, the
Bank and the government measured the progress in implementing activities against the
project implementation plan, rather than results.
48.     The introduction of revised monitoring indicators at restructuring allowed for a
more meaningful monitoring of the progress toward achievement of development
objectives. Only a limited number of the original indicators proved to be useful for
monitoring the progress toward a revised development objective. Following the
restructuring, the project’s progress toward achieving PDO, based on Project Manager’s
reports and mission findings, was duly captured in Bank’s Aide Memoires, recorded in
ISRs, and filed. The analysis of the project ratings in ISR suggests that they represent an
adequate assessment of project performance.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

49.     No applicable safeguards or fiduciary compliance issues were identified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase


14
  The Prime Minister Hon. Keith Mitchell was reelected for the third time in February 2013 after
his two term service as Prime Minister during 1999-2008.



                                               14
50.     Although the project is closed, there are a number of post-completion activities
that the Government is planning to undertake. Some of these will be supported by other
ongoing Bank financed operations, especially related to Component 1.

   a. Establishment of Enhanced Departments and Performance Management:

   •   The proposed Policy Development Operation may support the following
       measures:
          o Parliamentary approval of a legislative package that includes the Grenada
              Land Agency Act, technical regulations, amendments in laws related to
              land regulation and registration; and
          o Approval by the Cabinet of a regulation, developed under the project, on
              the organizational structure, job descriptions, remuneration scale for
              public servants and contractual employees for the new Grenada Land
              Agency.
   •   The ongoing Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project, APL 1, will
       support:
          o Developing capacity for maintenance and upgrade of the information
              system for land management; and
          o Implementing a geodetic system and creating a National Cadaster.
   •   The Government of Grenada with direct involvement of the Public Service
       Commission will oversee and support the following activities:
          o Competitive selection and appointment of the key managerial staff,
              including the Head of Agency and directors of departments;
          o Implementation of the new organizational structure, hiring of staff,
              introducing performance management practices; and
          o Integrating business processes of the land survey, physical planning,
              valuation, recording proprietors in the tax database, property registration
              and information search, and integrating respective information subsystems
              into one system.

   b. Strengthening the Grenada Industrial Development Corporation

   •   The GIDC is contemplating the upgrading of the approach on stimulating
       development of micro and small enterprises, developed under the project.
       Presently the GIDC is developing a proposal for a follow up program, which is
       likely to include:
           o Implementing an integrated information management system to support
               business processes aimed at business development;
           o Introducing training for potential new entrepreneurs in technical areas that
               would support business start-ups in creative and transformational sectors;
           o Competency training for GIDC staff targeting strategies to create
               employment opportunities for young workforce, especially university
               graduates;
           o Providing advisory services and support for young business start-ups;
           o Establishing funds accessible for the potential business start-ups; and



                                           15
             o Developing a network of regional service centers to support entrepreneurs.

     c. Regional Initiatives

     •   Finalizing the Public Procurement Bill and submitting for Government approval
         and adoption by Parliament; and
     •   Developing a process and institutional capacity for pooled procurement for
         identified goods and services.

     d. Strengthening Capacity of Department of Public Administration and its Public
        Sector Reform Management Unit

     •   The Government requested Bank assistance in supporting, among other issues, the
         following:
             o Developing a National Performance Framework and Strategy;
             o Streamlining staffing and conducting job evaluation; and
             o Developing service standards for selected service areas.

51.    Presently, the ongoing Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project
(P117871) could build on and advance in further use of the tools developed under the
PSMP for the GLA. During the Bank mission for the preparation of ICR, the team met
with the Prime Minister, who confirmed his Government’s commitment to public service
modernization and targeted strengthening of the entities charged with designing and
coordinating the implementation of public sector reforms. Moreover, the Prime Minister
expressed a request for continuation of Bank support to the public sector modernization
agenda.



3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

52.     Project objectives have been and continue to be highly relevant to the country and
regional priorities. Likewise, they are well aligned with the Bank’s assistance strategy.
The current Regional Partnership Strategy for the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States for the Period 2010-2014 15 defines two development assistance pillars: (i) building
resilience; and (ii) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating sustainable growth. Project
has contributed to both pillars. Under the first pillar, the project objectives supported the
Result Area 1 of promoting debt and fiscal sustainability through supporting growth of
micro and small businesses under Component 2. Component 1, in turn, contributed to the

Result Area 5 of Pillar 2 improving access to quality public services through improving
the performance of the Grenada Land Agency and Corporate Affairs and Intellectual
Property Office.
53.     Project design was targeted at (i) improvements in public sector management and
service delivery and (ii) facilitation of private sector development. However, the design
could have benefited from a more detailed analysis of potential implementation obstacles
– legal, cultural, managerial, or technical – that caused problems and impacted outcomes.
Specifically, some important inflection points that undermined the progress toward the
development objective could have been identified and analyzed at the design stage. The
necessary but overlooked enabling factors include: legal viability of Executive Agencies;
enabling legislation for pooled procurement; critical technical instruments for efficient
service delivery by GLA; or more strategic public servants’ rotation that would not have
undermined capacity building efforts.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDO)

54.     The revised project development objective was to assist the process of
modernizing Grenada’s public sector with a focus on improving public sector efficiency
in service delivery and management, enhancing private sector collaboration in support of
developing small businesses and promoting regionalization initiatives.
55.     Under Component 1, representing approximately 60 percent of IDA
disbursements, the project planned to achieve efficient service delivery and management
through creating two Enhanced Departments, as approved at Level 1 restructuring in
2010, and to implement efficient organizational management systems, including
introduction of performance management procedures. The outcome was expected to be
measured by a reduction in a number of days needed to (i) register a company, (ii)
register property deeds, and (iii) complete property registration. At exit, the target values
of these aforementioned PDO level indicators have been achieved, as described in the
Datasheet, albeit sustainability concerns remain. With regard to a reduction of time spent
for business registration (link: http://www.caipo.gov.gd) the outcome should be attributed
to two sources of support: the PSMP and WIPO (World Intellectual Property
Organization). The former, PSMP, initiated separation of CAIPO from the Supreme
Court Registry, procured a building for CAIPO, and partially completed building
refurbishment. All the functional and technical advice was provided by WIPO, which
strongly contributed to improvement of the time needed for improvement. Yet up until
the ICR mission, the CAIPO was physically housed in the premises linked to the
Supreme Court, and its legislation was pending approval by the new Parliament.
56.     With regard to Grenada Land Agency, considerable contribution was made by the
project to improving the registration of deeds and land through digitalizing maps,
designing a geodetic system, computerizing the processes at valuation department and
registration department, providing necessary equipment for land survey and preparation
of digitalized survey plans and digitalized registration records. The bulk of some 170,000
registration documents dating from 1930’s has been digitalized and is made available on
the internet as a customer service. The new application for Deeds and Land Registration


                                             17
uses a search engine for scanned documents by name, number of deed for viewing (free)
and/or printing (for a fee). A newly established Data Center administers digital records
with the web access provided internally for relevant staff and externally to the public.
57.      Modern equipment procured under the project, office equipment, survey scanners,
big laser printers, etc., enabled producing digitalized information Geo Node, as usual
business practice. All Departments that will constitute the Grenada Land Agency have
been connected through fiber-optic connection to enable information sharing and to
facilitate future streamlining of business processes related to and preceding the
registration. All this presents a significant transformation in functioning of the relevant
departments, which has an additional positive impact on spatial planning and efficient
control of land use. Statistics on land use has become available, which enabled more
effective zone planning. This has a positive impact for planning of commercial and
residential zones, allowing for better assessment of investment opportunities. Basic paper
maps of the GLA have been replaced by satellite imagery, which helped to monitor data
for Regional Disaster Office on inland flooding (drainage channels), coastal erosion, and
landslides. The latter activities were closely coordinated with the other Bank supported
operation – Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project, APL1 (RVDRP).
Specifically, the RDVRP will support development of Local Area Plans with zone
specific design.
58.     A website of the Grenada Land Agency (GLA) has been created
(www.gov.gd/landagency), still waiting to go live, as the adoption by Parliament of GLA
Act and Regulations are still pending. The website has links to services to be provided on
line; an option of face-to-face service provision continues to be available. All these
important developments contributed to service improvements, even though not originally
envisaged by the project. Yet the legal establishment of two Enhanced Departments with
strengthened management systems is pending. The organizational design, staffing,
management structure, job descriptions, hiring requirements, remuneration framework
were developed and will be put in place after the approval of the GLA Act. The Cabinet
at the time of the mission was preparing to table at the reelected Parliament the
reconfirmed package of legislation on establishing the Enhanced Departments, which
may be further supported by the Development Policy Operation.
59.     In the area of small business development, which accounts for 13 percent of IDA
disbursements, the outcome was expected to be measured by a number of new small
businesses established as a result of training in entrepreneurship and business
development. At exit, the target value of 30 GIDC trainees commencing new businesses
was achieved. However, in the absence of an information management system, and only
relying on the feedback from the former trainees, the Center for Small Business
Development reports that the conservatively estimated number of businesses opened by
trained entrepreneurs was 41 in 2008 and 25 in 2010. The latest numbers are not available,
as these have not been monitored by GIDC.
60.     In the area of regional initiatives, which account for 3 percent of IDA
disbursements, the target value for demonstrating the desired outcome of economies of
scale being explored through pooled procurement was the initiation of activities to
strengthen the collaboration to operationalize the MOU on pooled procurement with St.


                                            18
Vincent. Beyond the signing of the MOU in October 2009, no further progress was made
under the project. No activities were undertaken to implement the MOU, as it required
the enactment of a procurement law, which was expected as of the restructuring in
October 2010, but never materialized in the end.
61.     With respect to the PSRU and Project Administration component, which accounts
for 24 percent of IDA disbursements, the desired outcomes were achieved. However, the
capacity to design and implement reforms by the Public Sector Reform Units, later
renamed Reform Management Unit (RMU), has been constrained by staff rotation 16to
other departments. Although staff was trained and a PSRU strategy developed, the
current RMU capacity is still insufficient to drive public sector modernization activities.
62.    Taking into consideration the achievements of most of the target values of the
PDO-level indicators and the amount disbursed against the components that related to
these achievements, it is reasonable to conclude that the project generally achieved its
desired outcomes at exit. However, given the shortcoming mentioned and remaining
sustainability concerns, the outcome rating is hereby rated as moderately satisfactory 17.

3.3 Efficiency

63.     As it is often the case with the majority of projects supporting institutional
reforms, the assessment of efficiency is a challenge, compared to assessing efficiency of
a production cycle, which lends itself to the cost-benefit analysis more readily. Yet,
cumulatively, the relatively small investment of approximately $3 Million under the
project is likely to cause future savings offsetting the expenditure in the medium term
through higher efficiency of registration services.
64.     Importantly, the quality of services provided to the citizens, when the
restructuring of the two Enhanced Departments will have been completed, will be
substantially higher (due to electronic access, improved accuracy or records, shorter
response time), as the on-line access will have been fully implemented. Also, better
designed processes will help link property records with the Inland Revenue database,
improving the reliability of taxpayer records. All these service quality improvements,
achieved thanks to implemented technological advances, have already radically
transformed the efficiency and reliability or recording and retrieving information that due
to improved interconnectivity can be accessed and used by private citizens and businesses,
as well as government agencies for a variety of purposes. Therefore, the benefits will be
higher than simple cost savings for both the government and the society. The Grenada


16
  This rotation is consistent with the law and the role of the Public Service Commission, but its impact on
achievement of PDO and the lessons for aligning personnel management with the needs of the public
service have not been taken into consideration.

17
  This MS rating is better than the MU rating for the outcome in the last archived ISRs #12-14, and is
based on improved prospects of sustainability given the commitments to continue public sector reform
expressed by the new Prime Minister (letter to the Country Director of June 12, 2013).



                                                    19
Land Agency through introducing a fee structure for electronic services is hoping to
compensate the cost of producing information and partially compensate operating costs
of the agency. Investment in people – business training – will result in increased
employment, economic activity and tax revenue.
65.      It is challenging to measure efficiency of investment in cases when the planned
reforms have not been fully accomplished to yield the efficiency savings for the
government. More accurate estimation of efficiency would be possible when the speed,
costs and quality of the registration services could be measured. Given that the reform is
still unfolding such measurements are not possible to make.
66.     Unfortunately, protracted delays in project implementation have somewhat
negatively impacted the efficiency of the investment by delaying results. Challenging
political situation in the country, discussed elsewhere in this report, to a large extent had
significant impact on overall efficiency of the project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.      As discussed in paragraph 62, it is a challenge to assign an adequate rating for the
PDO because the progress under various objectives was uneven. Yet the project
unmistakably has created an excellent basis for better quality of two important
government services related to property rights and business development. Grenada
Investment Development Corporation developed capacity to promote small business
development through developing entrepreneurial skills. Capacity in public sector reform
management was improved, although low staffing (during the new hiring freeze) and
staff in the end constrained government ability to effectively pursue public sector reform
initiatives without external support. While pooled procurement has not been realized, the
Government progressed to this goal in two important ways: (i) signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with St. Vincent, (ii) conducted a revision of the procurement act to
enable such practice.
68.     Considering the obvious positive outcomes – (i) establishing core capabilities for
modern business, deeds and land registration processes, and (ii) creating opportunities for
entrepreneurial training and creating new small businesses – the achievement of the
project development objective is rated as moderately satisfactory (MS). The argument
against a moderately unsatisfactory (MU) rating, in spite of the failure to initiate
implementation of regional pooled procurement, is that the bulk of project disbursements
of 73 percent supported the important results achieved under Components 1 and 2.
Expenditure on other objectives, related to regional pooled procurement in particular,
amounted to only 3 percent (approximately $0.1 million) of the credit. Project
restructuring of October 2010 placed priority attention and caused priority effort under
components 1 and 2, which have delivered moderately satisfactory results.
69.     Finally, considering the high relevance of the PDO and expected efficiency gain
and improved service delivery, the MS rating gives a more appropriate reflection of
overall project outcomes.


                                             20
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

70.      The overarching themes of the project are: improved government services,
facilitated small business development, and capacity building. The small business
development contributed to poverty reduction and social development by creating new
employment and generating revenue for the government in the form of taxes.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

71.      Establishment of enhanced departments, strengthening management systems,
using new technology and upgraded procedures – all that represents significant
institutional change that is expected to lead to better performance and more effective and
efficient services to the population. While the full institutional change has not been
achieved, the foundation for it has been laid.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

72.      Strengthening of the technological tools for the Grenada Land Agency was not an
intended outcome. However, when identified as a critical factor of improved performance
during the project, some of the resources were allocated to development of these tools
related methodologies, and capacity building. As a result, positive impact of the new
tools (digital maps, digital deeds and land registration records, on line services) is already
felt as processes are being modernized and the quality of services is improving.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

73.      There is high likelihood of approving the Grenada Land Agency (GLA) Act and
CAIPO Act by the new Parliament in 2013. The Prime Minister is supportive of these
initiatives and Parliament has a strong pro-government majority. Implementation of
institutional changes upon unification of various departments into a single GLA may
require additional technical assistance, as the capacity of the new management team is
not known. Sustained small business development would require expanding the focus of
training from general entrepreneurial skills to technical areas that would support a more
diversified distribution of businesses among sectors, more toward innovative sectors.
Also the lack of start-up capital and collateral requirements significantly restrict a number
of new business start-ups. The Government does not have resources to support financing
through a grant scheme; external financing is required. In the area of pooled procurement,
the risks are higher, as the Government needs to finalize the Procurement Act that
enables pooled procurement and ensure strong leadership during implementation.
External assistance may be required.
74.     There are several risks to Development Objective, as analyzed in Table 3. The
risks vary in severity. The overall risk is assessed as Moderate because it mostly reflects
the risk to the main project outcome – establishment of Enhanced Departments and


                                             21
improving performance management. While the improvement of performance in the two
new EDs definitely requires time and ideally consultancy support, the gradual
introduction of performance management culture by the Cabinet Office through
monitoring performance indicators and performance agreements with Permanent
Secretaries and Directors of departments provides an important enabling environment for
strengthening performance of the new EDs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

75.     While areas of Bank engagement were relevant to the Country Strategy and
Bank’s CAS, the analysis of future implementation challenges for achieving results under
Components 1 and 3 during appraisal was insufficient. The risks to achievement of
development objectives were not adequately identified due to incomplete analysis of
legal feasibility of the proposed institutional changes (decentralization of the human
resource management practices, or introduction of a pooled procurement practices). The
impact of the less than satisfactory performance at the design stage was that the project
entered an impasse in 2008, causing implementation delays, low disbursement rate,
radical project restructuring, and in the end failure to achieve originally approved
development objectives. Additionally, the original performance indicators were not
sufficiently outcome-oriented and the baseline for measurement was not established. This
led to the major overhaul of the project in October 2010.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.     Two Team Leaders (TLs), other than the TL responsible for project design,
supported project implementation. During the first phase of the project (before
restructuring), the Government initiated activities under all components, while the Bank
team closely monitored those and facilitated progress to achieving the PDO. When it
became clear in 2009-2010 that the establishment of Executive Agencies was not feasible
because of the identified constitutional constraints, the new TL, who assumed the
responsibility for project supervision in early 2010, mobilized necessary consultancy
(Land Consultant to advise the Bank on GLA establishment) and engaged with the
Government to confirm its commitment to project objectives and find a realistic path for
achieving improved performance in the land, business and intellectual property
registration within the constitutional provisions. The project experienced a remarkable
turnaround following the 2010 restructuring, when stagnation in implementing a new
organizational form (EAs) was replaced by a renewed purpose of consolidating separate
departments under two Enhanced Departments, and by enriched context of
transformation based on the use of modern technologies for efficient service delivery.
Bank responsiveness to Government requests, proactivity in restructuring, and
implementation support contributed to substantial achievement of the revised PDO in the
subsequent phases.
77.    From the fiduciary perspective, the project financial management was satisfactory
to the Bank, which was reflected in unqualified project Audit Reports. Similarly, no
major issues were identified in supporting project procurement, as Bank’s prior
procurement review was conducted in a timely fashion.



                                           23
78.     The Bank team kept a record of implementation progress and progress toward
achievement of development objective in a timely manner. Missions’ Aide Memoires and
Implementation Status and Results Reports provide a clear picture of the progress in
project implementation.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     Although Bank’s performance was mixed – weaker at the design and quality-at-
entry stage, and stronger at the implementation stage – the project laid a good basis for
strengthening service delivery in business and property registration, and facilitation of
small business development. The Bank acted proactively in finding solutions to emerging
problems that had not been identified at the design stage. Also critical was the
restructuring of the project, as well as supporting the Government in achieving important
outputs that set in motion public sector modernization in selected areas. While the PDO
has not been fully achieved, to a large extent this was caused by the complex situation in
the Government that was beyond Bank team’s control. Following the change of the
Government in 2008, the constitutionality of the approved Executive Agency Act was
challenged. During the last 12 months of the project implementation, Parliament
prorogation prevented the approval of the laws that would establish the new Enhanced
Departments.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.      Overall, the government was committed to improving the quality of services and
facilitating private sector growth. However, the project was implemented in a challenging
political environment that limited the support to the reforms, especially by the legislative
branch. From the beginning, the Government was strongly committed to the project
objectives, and implementation proceeded as planned. With the 2008 elections, the
project experienced a number of leadership changes, including those of the key officials
responsible for project implementation. The new administration challenged the
constitutionality of the action undertaken by the previous administration in relation to
establishment of Executive Agencies, causing implementation delays and project
restructuring. Parliament prorogation in July 2012 prevented the project from establishing
Enhanced Departments – Grenada Land Agency (GLA) and CAIPO – despite the efforts
of the Executive to implement necessary legal reforms that would have enabled the
establishment of these departments. As a result, the project has been more successful in
achieving technical improvements that did not require political and legislative decision-
making. Although pooled procurement has been already successfully implemented by
Grenada with other OECS countries in the pharmaceutical area, this process was not
institutionalized due to the failure to enact the new Procurement Act. Given that the
Executive did not have control over the political situation and had to focus on what could




                                            24
be achieved within the existing legislative framework, the overall rating for government
performance is MS.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

81.    The Department of Human Resources, later renamed as Department of Public
Administration (DPA), was the project implementing agency. The role of DPA was to
drive the project, proactively address emerging issues and facilitate their resolution
through the Project Steering Committee. During the implementation of PSMP, DPA was
also involved in implementing an IDF grant on Strengthening Personnel Expenditure
Management, which fully achieved its objectives.
82.     Other implementing/beneficiary agencies included the following: Grenada
Investment Development Corporation (implementing small business development),
Ministry of Finance (pooled procurement), and various departments related to land
registration (Lands and Survey Division, Valuation Division, Physical Planning Unit, and
Supreme Court Registry). The Public Sector Reform Unit (later renamed Reform
Management Unit) of the DPA was also one of the beneficiaries. Given the variety of
stakeholders, effective implementation depended on coordination and effective
monitoring from DPA.
83.     Reportedly, DPA played a strong role in the coordination of activities, and
anticipation, identification and resolution of emerging issues; however, the role of DPA
in the second part of the project was not sufficiently proactive. There is no strong
evidence that the Project Steering Committee, which according to the Financing
Agreement was responsible for oversight of the implementation and ensuring the delivery
of the Project outputs and attainment of Project outcomes, fulfilled its role effectively.
84.     As a result, the focus on project performance shifted from the Implementing
Agency to the Project Manager, the Project Coordinator and the Project Coordination
Unit. During the critical period for the project in 2008-2010, the Project Manager’s post
was vacant for almost two years, creating an impasse and severe risks for project
continuity. The bulk of responsibility for moving project forward was placed on the
Project Coordination Unit in addition to its core role of administration fiduciary functions.
Insufficient communication from the Implementing Agency with the stakeholders on
project implementation procedures, as specified in the Financing Agreement, negatively
impacted the performance of beneficiaries during the preparation of the consultant’s
Terms of References and technical specifications for acquisition of goods under the
project. At project exit and at the time of ICR preparation, the Implementing Agency did
not have a clear plan for sustaining the project outcomes that would lead to better public
service performance. Notwithstanding these shortcomings, the Prime Minister has
expressed commitment to continue pursuing public sector modernization.




                                            25
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

85.     Moderately Unsatisfactory rating reflects significant shortcomings in the
performance of the Implementing Agency as well as the lack of strong leadership from
the Steering Committee. Such Borrower performance resulted in failure to fully achieve
project outcomes, in spite of the total extension of the project implementation period for a
cumulative 27 month period (from December 31, 2010 to March 31, 2013). The lack of
proactivity on the part of the Implementing Agency and beneficiary agencies, weak
central leadership and coordination caused delays that ran into the political deadlock in
mid-2012 and made approval of enabling legislation unattainable.

6. Lessons Learned
86.    The following lessons represent a summary of insights shared by the Borrower
and observations made by Bank staff.

   •   Implementation of institutional reforms, related to the change of legal status of
       government entities, needs assessment of the constitutional and legal provisions,
       specifically if related to personnel management, at the design stage. This is
       especially true in countries with central personnel management. Failure to do so
       may lead to impediments to achievement of goals. Similarly to the lessons learned
       under the Structural Adjustment Lending, this project confirms that operations
       that require legal action have much higher risk of failure, as the legislative process
       is by and large outside of the control of the Executive. In Grenada, only few
       officials fully accepted the introduction of the managerial discretion in hiring,
       firing, promoting and disciplining employees of the proposed Executive Agencies.
       For the majority of the public service such change was too radical to contemplate
       at this stage of development. The Constitution, which some external legal experts
       interpreted as allowing such delegation of managerial discretion, was found by the
       local distinguished lawyers (former and current Attorney Generals) as prohibiting
       to divest the authority of the Public Service Commission to Chief Executive
       Officers of Executive Agencies.

   •   Institutional changes in government entities aimed at improvement of service
       delivery require an assessment of legal, organizational and technical issues related
       to the business processes. Achievement of service performance by only
       concentrating on organizational form and managerial arrangements without
       attention to the business processes is unlikely to result in improved services. As it
       happened during PSMP implementation, the PAD did not clearly reflect the need
       for technological and information management improvements, nor did it identify
       the costs for such procedural and technological upgrade. This led to the
       restructuring of cost allocation among the components to enable the
       improvements in the quality of services at the Grenada Land Agency.




                                            26
•   Political commitment to project objectives is important to facilitate a legal reform
    that underlies institutional changes. Following the change of the administration,
    the commitment to the project at the highest levels of authority has weakened.
    Indecision on the part of the Government in relation to establishment of EAs
    resulted in the stalemate during June 2008 – February 2010.

•   The leadership and commitment to project development objectives on the part of
    the implementing agency is the critical factor of success. However, if the
    implementing agency shows little interest and is not proactive in driving project
    performance in areas not directly under its organizational purview, the
    implementation process will be challenged, even in the presence of an active
    Project Manager and/or Project Coordinator. The doubts over the appropriate
    allocation of responsibility for project management to the Department of Public
    Administration were voiced during the QER review of the project. The reviewers
    saw potential risks in ensuring decisive and effective management of the project
    with multiple stakeholders by the Public Sector Reform Unit (PSRU, later
    renamed as Reform Management Unit). This unit has a relatively low hierarchical
    status needed to command discipline during the implementation. The author of
    this ICR agrees with the suggestion, which has not been realized, that the
    responsibility for project management should have been placed with the Ministry
    of Finance. The PSRU could still have been actively engaged at the technical
    level and support overall decision making with technical expertise.

•   All project beneficiaries need to have a good understanding of project
    implementation procedures, which may differ from those of the government. The
    Bank could reach out to beneficiary entities by helping them understand and
    comply with project implementation procedures. As pointed out by the Project
    Coordinator, beneficiary entities had been slow to provide inputs to the
    procurement process and were not sufficiently knowledgeable in Bank
    procurement guidelines regarding the selection of consultants or vendors. This
    contributed to procurement delays.

•   In the circumstances of limited financing and constrained administration,
    coherence in Bank interventions, particularly in small and capacity constrained
    countries, could improve synergies and development effectiveness of the Bank in
    those countries. In Grenada, this was demonstrated through coordination among
    the PSMP and two other concurrent projects: E-Government for Regional
    Integration Program (approved May 2008) and Regional Disaster Vulnerability
    Reduction Project (approved June 2011), and the Economic and Social DPL
    (approved June 2010).

•   Bank procurement rules do not work well in small island states, e.g. in the
    Grenada’s small labor market, where specific skills are scarce in the local labor
    market to allow for effective competitive selection process. In several instances,
    the PCU reported difficulties in identifying sufficient number of contenders to
    comply with rules set in the Consultant Guidelines. The procurement team in
    coordination with the CMU reviewed the rationale for potential exceptions that



                                        27
       can be applied when appropriate justification for inability to comply in full with
       the procurement rules have been provided by the Borrower.



7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

87.     In OECS countries Bank procurement rules may be difficult to comply with in
case of selection of local consultants with specific qualifications. Given the small size of
the labor market, flexibility in procurement may be warranted to avoid delays in selection.
88.     The delays in procurement were partly due to the beneficiary agencies’
insufficient understanding of Bank procurement rules. More support to implementing
agencies was required to define technical specifications for procurement of new
equipment. The Bank team offered advice on technical specifications upon Borrower’s
request.
89.     With respect to the Borrower’s criticism of the Bank’s slow response to the
restructuring request submitted initially in October 2009, it is true that the restructuring
was approved by the Bank only a year after. The Bank, as conveyed to the Government,
had to fulfill its due diligence responsibilities before the restructuring could be approved.
Moreover, at the time of the request, there was no Project Manager. The new Project
Manager was only hired in February 2010. Furthermore, the legal opinion on the
constitutionality of the Executive Agencies from the Attorney General was received only
in late February 2010. Immediately thereafter a restructuring mission was deployed by
the Bank to assess the feasibility of resuscitating a problem project. Furthermore, since
the restructuring request also included an 18 month extension, certain pre-conditions had
to be fulfilled by the Government before the restructuring could be fully appraised and
presented to the Bank’s Board for consideration and approval.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
The following outputs have been achieved by component:

1. Executive Agencies and Public Sector Performance Management
          a. Analysis to enable Land and Deeds registration as a one stop shop has
             been done.
          b. Draft Law on Grenada Land Agency (GLA) and amendments to other
             laws that would enable setting up GLA.
          c. Draft Law on CAIPO developed.
          d. Partial refurbishment of a building to house CAIPO completed.

          Explanation: initial assessment of the scope of refurbishing has been
          incomplete; the government identified additional electric wiring works to be
          completed outside the project, using government funds.

          e. Organizational structure, job descriptions and internal management
             processes have been developed.
          f. Data Center in Deeds and Land Registry was established, server installed
             and operational. Additional equipment purchased includes: PCs, laptops,
             scanners, printers, photocopier, and GPS system. Physical fiber optic
             connections for distributed network architecture have almost been
             completed among the relevant GLA departments: Lands and Survey,
             Valuation, Registration, and Physical Planning.
          g. Records of land titles (deeds) have been largely digitalized and are
             accessible on line through a search function. Access to the web site
             www.grenadasites.gov is enabled, both internally and externally.
          h. Maps have been digitalized.
          i. Equipment has been purchased to support daily operations: conducting
             land surveys, creating (digital) land survey plans.
          j. Property Valuation Department has been computerized (software and
             hardware procured and installed).
          k. For Physical Planning Department the following improvements achieved:
             data sets for planning have been updated; general use equipment (GPS,
             computers and software) and specific land survey equipment procured.
             Training on surveys conducted and training on digitalizing records also
             delivered.




                                           30
       l. Website for GLA has been created allowing for reviewing property
          registration documents on line.
       m. Capacity has been built: training materials for maintaining the website
          www.eLandsells.gov prepared.
2. Strengthening GIDC
       a. A Training Center in GIDC has been established, including construction
          and equipment purchase.
       b. A vehicle for transporting trainees from distant parishes to the Center was
          purchased.
       c. Training for prospective entrepreneurs has been developed, including
          training materials.
       d. Small business strategy has been developed and adopted.
       e. Training has started and continues. Training program varies by objective
          and can last from 1-2 days to 2-3 weeks. The project supported training for
          the total amount of US$ 85,256. The total number of trained persons is
          1,261 during 2008-2010. In 2010 – 25 persons trained started their
          business. The lack of information system and a follow up mechanisms
          does not allow assessing the total cumulative impact of training on starting
          of new businesses.
3. Regional Initiatives
       a. Analysis of the items for pooled procurement has been conducted.
       b. Memorandum of Understanding with St. Vincent on pooled procurement
          has been prepared and signed.
       c. Pooled procurement was not implemented, as Procurement legislation
          (adopted in 2010 in Grenada) in neither of the two countries had
          provisions for pooled procurement. Procedures for pooled procurement
          have not been developed. The revision of the Procurement Law in
          Grenada had started, but has not been enacted by Parliament.
4. Capacity Building for the Public Sector Reform Unit and Project Administration
       a. With the support of CARICAD a strategy of public sector modernization
          has been developed and staff of the PSRU trained. Training in project
          management and monitoring and evaluation was delivered. Staff turnover
          has not contributed to sustaining the PSRU capacity to implement reforms.
       b. Support to project management has been provided through training and
          financing the key fiduciary personnel, equipment and incremental
          operational expenditure.


                                       31
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
    1. The economic rate of return for this project was not calculated at the appraisal
stage, referring to the difficulty to quantify project benefits and exact rates of return. The
PAD refers to positive fiscal impact that the project would generate through improved
quality of services.

    2. Gains were expected from streamlining government functions converted into
Executive Agencies, including improving effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery
to citizens, strengthening business skills of entrepreneurs in small and micro enterprises,
value for money in government procurement through pooled procurement, and building
capacity of the Public Sector Reform Unit.

    3. The assessment of the project achievements and impacts suggests that only once
Grenada Land Agency and CAIPO have been fully established, some reasonable
efficiency improvement will have been detected. However, the project does not have
right indicators to measure economic efficiency and impact. It is difficult to appraise the
financial impact of the improved service response times. Qualitatively, it is reasonable to
assume that the project has contributed significantly to improving the quality of services
of the Grenada Land Agency through digitalization of its intermediate and final products,
making records available on line for viewing and printing (for a fee).

    4. Creating a training center in Grenada Investment Development Corporation
(GIDC) has helped selected persons to set up their own business. The GIDC was only
able to confirm that 25 trained persons have opened their businesses. This contributed to
increasing employment, as well as increasing revenues through taxes. The consolidated
financial impact of these activities cannot be determined, as GIDC has not monitored the
numbers of new entrepreneurs after their having received the project supported training.

   5. As expected regional pooled procurement has not been realized, no savings from
procurement of scale have been gained.

  6. The capacity of the Reform Management Unit to lead the public sector
modernization remains limited, as explained in the main text.

    7. In conclusion, the project contributed to improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of the public sector management. However, since not all the planned results
have been achieved, the real project impact has been lower than expected.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
    1. The Borrower’s ICR lists project achievement, challenges and reasons for the
failure to achieve planned results.
Assessment of Results
    2. Regarding the establishment of the Enhanced Departments, the ICR notes that the
separation of land function and the Registry, and Corporate Affairs and Intellectual
Property functions was performed promptly and led to considerable efficiency gains in
service delivery times. However, the ICR mentions challenges in amalgamation of the
various land functions that stemmed from the approach taken at the design stage.
Attention was focused on institutional form, at the expense of designing a program of
developing critical “tools, processes and resources that were necessary to enable the
modern conduct of the mandates of the land functions”. The omissions during the design
led to project restructuring in 2010.
   3. The abandonment of the goal of pooled procurement was explained by the legal
constraints that precluded from implementing an MOU with St. Vincent on pooled
procurement of selected goods and services.
   4. The ICR supports the relevance of the objectives of component 2 by the need to
support growth of employment through creating micro and small businesses. The
Borrower assesses the achievement of objectives under this component at 95 percent.
    5. Concerning component 4, the project lists completed activities to strengthen the
capacity of the Reform Management Unit, including a strategy for RMU development
until 2016. Knowledge events to build capacity have been also delivered. The
Government ICR though does not assess the impact of these activities on the capacity of
RMU to develop and lead initiatives in public sector modernization.
Government Performance
    6. The ICR mentions high level government commitment to the reform agenda, but
notes bureaucratic inertia as a factor delaying the implementation. The departure of the
former Project Manager and lengthy procedures to replace him was seen as a factor
undermining the implementation momentum during 2009-2010.
    7. More timely inputs and specification for procurement processes from the
beneficiaries, and better monitoring of activities would have prevented implementation
delays.
   8. The ICR acknowledged that 2008 general elections contributed to delays in
implementation as the Government assessed the legality of establishing the Executive
Agencies.
Bank Performance
    9. Bank’s performance was criticized for the design that set goals (setting of
executive agencies) that could not have been implemented due to the constitutional
challenges. Besides, the lack of attention to the needed technical and procedural
improvements to enable effective and efficient land management and registration is seen
as a substantial shortcoming of the design.


                                          37
    10. The Bank was also criticized for the slow response to restructuring request
(2010) 19 , and requests for no objections. The procurement practices are perceived as
inflexible at times, and not attuned to the actual labor market realities of the small states.
Lessons Learnt
    11. The focus on institutional aspects at the designed stage proved to be inadequate
without due attention to digitalizing maps, establishing geodetic system, or digitalizing
registry records, etc. Ensuing redesign of the activity resulted in implementation delays.
    12. Implementation progress is predicated on seamless coordination of the Project
Manager, Project Coordination Unit and the Bank. This coordination was not effective,
often ensuing delays, inter alia, due to excessive response time from the Bank in selected
cases.
Results Sustainability
    13. The list of actions expected by the Government to improve results’ sustainability
includes:
     •   Approval of the GLA Act by Parliament and related legislation;
     •   Appointment of the Director of the GLA to lead and manage the transition and
         amalgamation process; and
     •   Launch of the available e-services in land registration (eLandGrenada, eLandMap,
         eLandRegistry, and eLandSales). Future expansion of the digitalized services
         includes: eLandPermit and eLandPlan.
Borrower Comments on ICR
    14. The Borrower was asked to provide comments on the draft ICR following the
virtual QER review. The ICR was shared with the Project Coordinator on August 9, 2013.
No comments were received by the Bank as of September 17, 2003.




19
   With respect to the Borrower's criticism of the Bank's slow response to the restructuring request
submitted initially in October 2009, it is true that the restructuring was approved by the Bank only a year
after. The Bank, as conveyed to the Government, had to fulfill its due diligence responsibilities before the
restructuring could be approved. Moreover, at the time of the request, there was no Project Manager. The
new Project Manager was only hired in February 2010. Immediately thereafter a restructuring mission was
deployed by the Bank to assess the feasibility of resuscitating a problem project. Furthermore, since the
restructuring request also included an 18 months extension, certain pre-conditions had to be fulfilled by the
Government before the restructuring could be fully appraised and presented to the Bank's Board for
consideration and approval.
