2.      Following the restructuring in September 2010, implementation performance has
improved albeit slowly. Prospects for achieving the revised project development
objective by closing date of June 2012 remains positive given continued Government
commitment as demonstrated by the Cabinet approval of the Framework Document to
guide the implementation of the Grenada Lands Agency. In terms of disbursement, total
disbursements to date are equivalent to 40% of the IDA Credit with the balance expected
to be disbursed during the remaining implementation period and following this proposed
reallocation.

3.       The proposed reallocation is necessary to finance the key activities that will
facilitate the proper functioning of the two Enhanced Departments (Corporate Affairs and
Intellectual Property Office and Lands Agency) following their amalgamation under the
project which are critical to achieving the revised project development objective.
