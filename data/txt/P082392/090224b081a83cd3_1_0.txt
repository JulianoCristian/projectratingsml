                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this project is to assit the Government of Grenada to begin the process of modernizing its public sector. This includes building the capacity to design
                         and implement public sector modernization initiatives which would address "rightsizing" the public sector and determining which services would best be delivered by an
                         Executive Agency or commercialization. The specific objectives of the project are to (i) improve service delivery in those agencies designated Executive Agencies; (ii)
                         introduce modern human resource management principles into the public sector; (iii) build the capacity of the Government to lead and implement modernization efforts;
                         (iv) encourage sub-regional cooperation through the procurement of select goods and services; and (v) strengthen the enabling environment for small and micro
                         businesses.
