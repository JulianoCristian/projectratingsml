                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         -The restructuring of component one reflects the support to enhanced departments (formally called executive agencies) to remain within constitutional restrictions and project
                         development objectives. The restructuring package was completed in September, 2010 and was approved by the World Bank Board on an absence of No-Objection basis of October
                         9, 2010.

                         - The remaining budget for the component of approximately of approximately USD1.5millionequivalent will be sufficient for the proposed outputs. The extension period will
                         accommodate the time needed for completion of the diagnostics prior to the physical amalgamation of agencies, as well as provide time for the agencies to demonstrate
                         improvements in service delivery.
