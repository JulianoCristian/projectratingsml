                                  Restructuring Paper


1.      The proposed restructuring would extend the closing date for the Grenada Public
Sector Modernization Technical Assistance Credit, Cr4137-GD, by nine months from the
current closing date of June 30, 2012 until March 31, 2013. The original closing date of
the Credit was December 31, 2010 which was previously extended by 18 months to the
current closing date of June 30, 2012 in October 2010. Accordingly, this restructuring
would cumulatively extend the Credit closing date by 27 months from the original
closing date. The extension through March 31, 2013 was requested by the Minister of
Finance of the Government of Grenada in a letter dated April 6, 2012.

2.      The Project’s Development Objective (DO) is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory
due to delays in implementation that does not allow for any change in results indicators to
be attributed to the Project. However, the Project’s Implementation Progress has been
recently upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory given significant advances under
Component 1 (Enhanced Departments and Performance Management), the major
component of the project that accounts for 60% of total Project cost.

3.      The satisfactory achievement and sustainability of the Project Development
Objective (PDO) would only be possible with the completion of all activities under
Component 1 as these would be necessary for modernizing the public sector that would
then contribute to achieving efficiencies in the delivery and management of services with
respect to registering property and starting businesses which are PDO-level outcome
indicators. Completion of Component 1 activities would require an extension of the
current Closing date of June 30, 2012. The proposed extension would enable the Project
to complete critical activities and thereby enhance the prospects for achieving the PDO.
Accordingly, with the approval of the closing date extension, the team would be able to
upgrade the DO rating.

4.     This would be the second and final extension of the Credit closing date.
