as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: implementation of institutional reforms,\n            related to the change of legal status of government\n            entities, needs assessment of the constitutional and legal\n            provisions, specifically if related to personnel management,\n            at the design stage. Institutional changes in government\n            entities aimed at improvement of service delivery require an\n            assessment of legal, organizational and technical issues\n            related to the business processes. Political commitment to\n            project objectives is important to facilitate a legal reform\n            that underlies institutional changes. The leadership and\n            commitment to project development objectives on the part of\n            the implementing agency is the critical factor of success.\n            However, if the implementing agency shows little interest\n            and is not proactive in driving project performance in areas\n            not directly under its organizational purview, the\n            implementation process will be challenged, even in the\n            presence of an active project manager and or project\n            coordinator. All project beneficiaries need to have a good\n            understanding of project implementation procedures, which\n            may differ from those of the government. The Bank can reach\n            out to beneficiary entities by helping them understand and\n            comply with project implementation procedures. The\n            procurement team in coordination with the country management\n            unit (CMU) reviewed the rationale for potential exceptions\n            that can be applied when appropriate justification for\n            inability to comply in full with the procurement rules have\n            been provided by the Borrower."}, "docdt": "2013-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
