to contribute\n            to the modernization of Grenada's public sector and\n            enhance service delivery. The restructuring will extend the\n            closing date for the Grenada Public Sector Modernization\n            Technical Assistance Credit, by nine months from the current\n            closing date of June 30, 2012 until March 31, 2013. The\n            original closing date of the Credit was December 31, 2010\n            which was previously extended by 18 months to the current\n            closing date of June 30, 2012 in October 2010. Accordingly,\n            this restructuring will cumulatively extend the Credit\n            closing date by 27 months from the original closing date.\n            The extension through March 31, 2013 was requested by the\n            Minister of Finance of the Government of Grenada in a letter\n            dated April 6, 2012. The satisfactory achievement and\n            sustainability of the Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            will only be possible with the completion of all activities\n            under component one as these will be necessary for\n            modernizing the public sector that will then contribute to\n            achieving efficiencies in the delivery and management of\n            services with respect to registering property and starting\n            businesses which are PDO-level outcome indicators.\n            Completion of component one activities will require an\n            extension of the current closing date of June 30, 2012. The\n            extension will enable the Project to complete critical\n            activities and thereby enhance the prospects for achieving\n            the PDO. Accordingly, with the approval of the closing date\n            extension, the team will be able to upgrade the DO rating.\n            This will be the second and final extension of the Credit\n            closing date."}, "docdt": "2012-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
