It would support new\n            plantings of 6400 ha per annum, maintenance of about 160,000\n            ha of existing plantations and expansion of rural\n            afforestation activities, particularly nurseries. The\n            project would also support the improvement of forest roads,\n            the construction of forest stations, the replacement,\n            operation and maintenance of vehicles and the provision of\n            specialist staff. The project would increase wood production\n            and reduce pressure on Kenya's fast depleting\n            indigenous forests. It would also lead to public savings in\n            national afforestation programs and prevent disruption of\n            water flow and soils in densely populated areas."}, "docdt": "1982-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
