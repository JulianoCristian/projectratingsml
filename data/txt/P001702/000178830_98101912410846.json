The project would (a) establish 3,400 ha of\n            industrial rainfed tree plantations near Bamako; (b)\n            establish on a trial basis 60 ha of rainfed tree plantations\n            near Segou and 70 ha of partially irrigated tree plantations\n            near Mopti; (c) apply modern forest management techniques on\n            a trial basis; (d) establish three rural forestry nurseries\n            and rehabilitate an existing one; and (e) execute studies to\n            investigate more efficient wood uses, to examine\n            possibilities to set up rural forestry activities that would\n            generate participation by the local population and to\n            examine the scope of the follow-up project."}, "docdt": "1979-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
