The project\n            includes a program of credit for the sale of STWs to\n            individual farmers and farmers' groups, under the\n            Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP) and through two\n            commercial banks (Janata and Sonali Banks). The project\n            would also improve BADC workshop facilities for maintenance\n            of all irrigation equipment (some 5,000 low-lift pumps,\n            20,000 STWs and 4,000 deep tubewells) in the northwest\n            region. Private workshops for irrigation equipment are\n            assisted under the project, with spare parts, machinery and\n            equipment. Vehicles and office equipment would be provided\n            to the various implementing agencies to help them execute\n            the project. The project also includes consultants'\n            services to help the Government (i) prepare irrigation maps\n            and carry out hydrological investigations, (ii) evaluate the\n            results of various project components and (iii) manage the\n            operations of the workshops."}, "docdt": "1977-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
