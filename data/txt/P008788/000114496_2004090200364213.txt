Bucharest, Romania
Re:
Loan Number 4319 RO Telecommunications Reform and
       Privatization Support Project 
Amendment to the Loan Agreement and Notice of Cancellation
Dear Mr. Fodor:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement) between us for the 
above-mentioned project, dated May 29, 1998, and to our discussions concerning a 
proposed amendment to the same.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees to make the above amendments.  
Accordingly, the Loan Agreement is proposed to be amended as set forth below.
1.
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement, is amended to read 
as shown in Attachment 1 to this letter.
2.
Paragraph 2 of Part B of Schedule 2 is amended to read:  “Support to (a) the 
independent regulatory agency through the provision of technical assistance, (b) the 
installation of a national spectrum management system; and (c) modernization of 
electronics workshops and regional laboratories.”
These amendments will become effective upon receipt of a countersigned copy of 
this letter.  Disbursements, at a percentage rate amended with this letter, shall 
apply for expenditures made on or after March 1, 2000.”
Further in reference to your letter dated February 22, 2000, received by the 
Bank on March 1, 2000, and pursuant to Section 6.03 of the General Conditions, the 
Bank hereby cancels, as of March 1, 2000, the amount of US $7,000,000 equivalent from 
the loan and the commitment charges on such amount cease to accrue from March 1, 2000.  
The table in the Attachment 1 to this letter reflects that cancellation.  Schedule 3, 
the Amortization Schedule, is being revised by the Bank as a result of the 
cancellation, and the revised figures will be sent to you shortly.
Please confirm the agreement of the General Inspectorate of Communications with 
the foregoing by having an authorized representative sign, date and return to us the 
enclosed copy of  this letter.  
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 
   RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
