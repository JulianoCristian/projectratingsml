Support Project for Romania were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was negligible to low, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) in the telecom sector and in the\n            Romania Telecommunication Reform and Privatization Project,\n            where the frontier of technology is moving at a rapid pace,\n            it is advisable to build a degree of flexibility into\n            project design and supervision to accommodate at least some\n            of the new applications that may become possible during\n            implementation; 2) project design of telecom projects such\n            as the Romania Telecommunication Reform and Privatization\n            Project involving equipment procurement and installation\n            should give more attention to risks in project cost\n            estimation and assessment of bidders for the supply and\n            installation of telecom equipment. Supervision should help\n            ensure that appointed project management consultants are\n            fully utilized; and 3) while it is important for the Bank to\n            focus on technical assistance aspects of telecom projects,\n            such as support for training and for the development of the\n            policy and regulatory frameworks, it is also essential to\n            ascertain potential support for such components from other\n            international financial institutions and agencies to\n            eliminate duplication of resources, as occurred in the\n            Romania Telecommunication Reform and Privatization Project."}, "docdt": "2009-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
