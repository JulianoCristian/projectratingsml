sustainability, and substantial\n            institutional development impacts, achieved through\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower.\n            Regardless of success, the following are some lessons\n            experienced through the project implementation. It is\n            reinforced once again that stability of policy, and agency\n            structure contributes to project achievement. Despite a\n            seemingly country policy development structure at appraisal,\n            the subsequent government's different arrangements,\n            were a contributing factor for considerable time and\n            momentum losses. The issue of suitability of new agencies to\n            perform regulatory functions is one of the lessons that, in\n            retrospect, the project should have given equal\n            consideration to the establishment of a new agency - which\n            would work in close collaboration with the technical agency\n            - to perform those functions. It is important to note that a\n            competent spectrum management, and monitoring system is\n            necessary for an expanding, modern telecom sector, since it\n            provided support to the expansion of wireless services,\n            essential during a period of rapid growth in the use of the\n            spectrum. Another reinforcement is the importance of close\n            donor coordination, key to reform progress, ensuring that no\n            duplication of effort occurred, and facilitating provision\n            of timely advice. On the other hand, the availability of\n            grant assistance from the other agencies reduced the\n            utilization of the project's technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2004-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
