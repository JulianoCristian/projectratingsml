Dear Sir:
Re:   INDIA -  Hyderabad Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(Credit 2115-IN) - Amendment of Schedule 1
      We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Hyderabad Water
Supply and Sanitation Project) dated May 23, 1990, as amended, between
India and the Association and to the discussions with the Andhra Pradesh
authorities on the implementation of a personnel training plan under Part
A (v) (d) of the Project. We have now received an acceptable training
plan which includes, inter alia, recurring costs for salaries for the
proposed staff training center.  In order to disburse said expenditures,
we propose to amend Schedule 1 to the Development Credit Agreement to add
a new Category (7).  Accordingly, the table set forth in paragraph 1 of
Schedule 1 is amended as per attachment to this letter.
      Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing the form
of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to
us.
                                Sincerely,
