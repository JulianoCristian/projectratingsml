1.08 Previous ~issiQn£. This mission follows a 10-25 Jan-92 suporvlSlOn
mission whose purview included tho RRP, and a ohort 20-25 Hay-92 mission of
more limited scope. Doth of these missions produced an aide-memoirc in the
field and discussed the main findings and recommendations at ~rap-up meetings
at the State and Central level. By way of follo~-up, the Bank sont a letter
of 6-Mar-92 after the Jan-92 mission and a letter of 19-Jun-92 after the Hay-
92 mission.

1.09  The aido-momoire of the Hay-92 mission, in S0ction II tharoof, contained
a list of 20 ~ctions recommended by or agreed ~ith tho misoion;   four of these
actions ~ere ''carried for~ard~ from a list of 10 such actions contained in the

1.10 The action "g?\..r.L.QQM" ~as the prov1s1on of a response by GOAP to tho
Bank's letter to GOAP of 5-Dec-92 concerning the RRP. A letter dated
21-Aug-92 from the Medak District Collector to the Bank did not respond fully
to all matters raised in the Bank's letter and, in any event, took some eight
months to prepare. Given the difficult, sensitive and complex nature of RRPs
generally, the aspects of flexibility embodied in the original RRP as

3.01 Apart from the RRP and the Dam Review Panel <DRP>, which are Part B of
the Project and the agreed direct responsibility of GOAP, HHWSSB is
responsible for all other aspects of the project.   In fact, HHWSSB han
provided considerable and valuable assistance with Part B of the Project.
However, there are two particular aspects of HHWSSB's organization and
staffing which are the subject of explicit covenants in the Project Agreement.
Sections 3.04 and 3.05 of this agreement provide respectively that HHWSSB will
maintain a »Project Cell" and ''an organization under its Director of Finance"
organized and staffed in a manner satisfactory to th~ Bank.

3.02 However, before reviewing these aspects, the mission notes with regret
that the former Managing Director of HHWSSB haa resi~ned during Jul-92 to
permit his undertaking further post-graduate studios. Tl1is regret ic baood on
the mission's recognition of his dynamism and management skills which wore
instrumental in the successful launching of HMWSSB, as a now organization, and
this project. Moreover, his previous career experience as a Collector in
Medak District, the site of the RRP, and his keen interest in the RRP were
clearly extremely helpful to those directly responsible for the RRP.

3.03 Unfortunately, oome two months later, an appointment of his replacement
has not yet been made. While HHWSSB's other senior management staff arc ~all­
experienced, well-motivated and capable, this situation is nonotholoco
undesirable and must inevitably hamper tho coordination of policy deliberation
and decision-making. The Bank's letter to GOAP by way of follow-up to the
previous May-92 mission states (p2):

      "Tho mission has advised me that some personnel changes, duo to
      retirement and transfer, can be anticipated in HHWSSB in tho near
      future. We trust that all care will be exercised in the
      appointment of replacements, such that tho momentum achieved to
      date can be sustained."

The Prolect Management Group <PHG>

3.04 The term "Group" rather than "Cell" (para 3.01) has come to be adopted
with the concurrence of the mission. Its organization structure and staffing
have been adjusted from time to time to suit the evolving needs of the project
at that time; this process continues and such adjustments will be appropriate
from time to time in the future. Meanwhile, this mission considers the
present organization and staffing satisfactory for the present 'project
circumstances. The details are being reported in HMWSSB's quarterly reports
to the Bank.



3.05 This Unit is a "wing" of the PHG which has been recently organized and
staffed to manage the recently-launched LCS program. LCS is in its initial
                                                               --   7 --

  be filled.   The positions h()ve no\-J been filled and the unit is fully staffed
  as planned in the project report. However, HHWSSB additionally rl~ns to
  recruit work inspectors for quality surveillance as needed.

  the monitoring meetines as ns.,.dod.  Ths rnonitorin.e m0etings will rGviow
  progress, identify bottlenecks and issues, and provide solutions and
  guidelines for smooth and eff9ctivq implementation.



  3.10 HHWSSB faces tho organi::.ation, staffine and tz-;:linine ch.;:d longos which
  arise from the need to off~ct a major chanae in t:he corporate culture. This
  is particularly t;rlAG in the Finance and Accounts Dopartmont -with changAr;
                                     - 8 -

from government "vote book" and cash accounting systems to commercial accrual
accounting systems; introduction of computerized accounting systems to enable
commercial decision-making to bo more ro3ponsiv~; ar1d th~ nPod for commrrrinl
viability.

3.11 In July,1992 HHWSSB produced a Training Plan Yith tho assistance of
Oamania University. This is a most useful documont, covering broad
organization policy and staffing issues a~ a background to specific training
proposals. For the Finance Department specific position descriptions have
been prepared for the senior non-unionized personnel from the Director of
Finance to three levels below.

3.12 In particular, three senior positions at the "General t1anager" level
have been identified which are presently vacant. These individuals would
respectively be responsible for:

  {a) Revenues, Collections and Tariffs (including tariff design) and
      initially responsible for coordination of the implementation of the
      computerized Revenue Billing system;

  (b) Management Information and Cost Accounting systems and initially
      responsible for implementation of the Materials Control system, and tho
      Fin~ncial and Accounting system;


  (c) Cash management and Funds Flow management.

Al.l of those individuals are urgently required, nnd tho Hission strongly
supports their recruitment.

3.13 An additional senior position hao been identified in tho Training Plan-
namely, an Internal Auditor. Although this could bo a difficult position to
fill, it is most desirable that this individual also be recruited.

3.14 Actual training under the Training Plnn is not scheduled to commence
until early 1993. However, before it can bo implemented for tho unionized
majority of Finance Department employees, it will be necessary to resolve one
of the transitional personnel issues remaining from the Board's establishment.
This relates to the fact that clericDl employees Yero previously recruited
into tho "Personnel and Administration" stream (which inc1udod finance and
accounting) as general clerks. Limited skills were needed for advancement,
which was essentially dependent upon seniority. As increasing skill levels
are required in accounting and related functions, it is necessary for such
employees to opt either for a career path in Finance and Accounting or for a
cl~reer path in Personnel and Administration, before an investment is made in
their training. The Director of Finance has advised that there are Staff
Rules to deal with this situation which need to be implemented.

3.15 Another organizational issue is tho need to replace tho government-
seconded Divisional Accounts officers with tho Board's own employees. Such
replacements must either be recruited or trained; the present situation is
undesirable because the individuals tend to lack a sense of long-term
commitment to the Board and also to lack commercial accounting skills. It is
                                             -   9 -

recognized that a transition period, of           s~y   two years, may be necessary in
this conne.:tion.

3.16     In summary of tho precodin_g, tho <>ctions requiroJ         <:~n::


  {a) the appointment of three senior qualified accountants (para 3. 12l;

  (b) the appointment of a qualified accountant as HMWSSB's internal auditor
      <para 3.13 l;

   (c) tho application of existing staff rulos to uopar~to, in a porsonnol
       administration sense, the personnel and administration functions from
       the financ~ and accounts functions <para 3.l~l;

3.18 Th~ preparation of a Training Plan has boen the subject of intensivn
efforts by HMWSSB si.ncn. tho projF.>ct incoption. V,;riour: vorsi0ns \./Oro produc<:rl
and were the subject of B.;:lnk comments, HMWSSB obtained valuable assistance in
these efforts from Dr. V. Lakshmipathy of the Regional Canter for Urban and
Environmental Studies CRCUESl at Osmania University, Hydorabad, and from tho
Human Resources Development <HRDl specialist in RWSG-SA <para 1.02). The
matter of finalization of the Training Plan was the subject of intensive
attention during the May-92 supervision mission, ar1d a final version \.Ia&
furnished to the Bank in early Jui-92.

3.19 This final version of the Training Plan, intor alia, indicates the
appointment of an HHf..JSSB "Training Coordinator" at the level of a
Superintending Engineer. Such an appointment has not, as yet, been made but
the mission considers this essential for the effective implementation of tho
Training Plan.  Accordin.tl'lv, this mission urz~s a_£romot a_ppointmf.tnt to this
posit:ioQ.

 3.20 The Training Plan al~0 ~ontains proposals on the basis for Credit
 disbursement against t:hf.t trainins exp~nditures.                These proposals are currently
 under r~=Jvie\.1 by th~=J B.ank' s I <:>g.a I ~nd I o:)n dr,.p;Jrtmnnts, ;Jnd COI, GOAP .;Jnd

3.23 The day-to-day manae'i'mli?nt of thG> RRP implementation is tho desiEn<ltod
responsibility of the Collector- Hodak District, who is tho chief COt\P
r&presont.ativo- at tho District lr;;.vel.     His immGdi.Llto r.::ubordin<:~tos .aro: < i) tho
ensin&;)!Zilr responsible for the resett il<:•mQnt infr.a;:;tructure- <~nd hO\Al>ing pro)!ramc;
and (ii) tho rehabilitation officer responsible for the oconomic and social
rehabilit<~tion of the affected people.          Unfortunately, all the incumbents of
thos'e three koy positions have ch;:~n.ged sinco the provious Jan-92 mist:ion.
Moreover, the support of the previous Hanasing Director of HMWSSB, which has
been valuable, is no longer available (para 3.02>. Thus, almost the entire
accumulated institutional memory related to this difficult anrl consitivo
program has boon wiped out in a short period.             If thoro is 3n olomont of
continuity, it iz in the Center for Economic and Soci<'l Studios <CESS) who
conducted studios leading to tho initially agrood RRP ~nJ who l1avo boen oince
engaged to conduct independent monitoring and 0v~luation.

3.24 However unfortunate tho facta roportod in para 3.23, it cooms to bo the
case that nothins can be done to restore tho institutional memory refe.·rred to.
Bt,1t t;hero is a clear ont;s on COAP to onsure that ft~ll zupport and assit:tanco
is extended to the n~w incumbents rospon&iblo for PPP implemontation.

3.25 Tho rocontly-~ppointod infr~structuro onginoor haG tho rank of Exocutivo

and ~xperionc&;) to p!Zilrform the required ta;:;ks but of authority to take various
kinds of decisions.      In recognition of potential problems, HHWSSD has offored
assistance through one of its own very oxp~rionced superintending onginoors
and this offQr h.as bel'fn w9lcom<;;>d by both tho offidals concornod with RRP <lnd
this mission.

 3.26  Fortunately, tho design, procurement and construction work related to
 the resettlement infrastructure is well along <see Section IV) and.although
 works additional to those already contracted are indicate-d to be required,
 there are now established standards and procedures for such works which also
 reflect tho Bank's requirements, as agreed.

 3.27 The recently-appointed rehabilitation office-r has a substantial
 challenge before him. Progress to dato in thiD aroa is much loss than in tho
 construction of resottlomont infrastructure, and managing such activity for
 offoctivenoss involves considorablo dialogue with and sonsitivo understanding

3.28 The Singur Dam was constructed apart from this project by GOAP's
Irrigation Department. However, GOAP agreed to appoint a Dam Review Panel
<DRP> to, inter alia, review aspects of this dam's dosi?,n and construction
which have potential implications for its safety. This is an element of Part
B of the project (para 3.01) and the formal rospon::;ibility of GOAP.

3.29 However, HHWSSB has again played an important role in coordinating the
convening of meetings of the DRP and the related discussions botweon tho DRP
and GOAP's Irrigation Department staff. HHWSSB has also produced (but not, of
cour:Jo, written} tho minute:s of DRP meetings, for :::i?,n.:lture of th0 DRP

 4.01 This component mainly comprises the works to transport and treat somo
 135 Hld of water from tho Singur dam to the Hyderab~d water distribution
 system. It involves some 60 km of pipeline, of various materials and sizes,
 with a water treatment plant, clear water storage and pumping en route.   It
 twins the Manjira Phase III scheme which was completed in 1991 apart from thic
 project. These works were finally designed and, for the most part, ready for
 tender invitation at the time of Credit approval. This component was reviewed
 in some detail during the Hay-92 supervision mission.  In particular, the
 matter of materials and construction quality and the rolated management and
 records were reviewed and found very satisfactory.

 4.02 This mission has only reviewed the matters of general progress and a
 couple of minor elements of this component.  It is now expected that this
 component will be ready for commissioning by Aus-9~. The water treatment
 plant and the pumps and motors for the main pumping plant were earlier judged
 t:o be on the critical path. With this in view, a "bonus/penalty" clause was
 included in the water treatment plant contract and it now appoars some ''bonus"
 will be payable.

 4.03 The mission has reviewed proposals, in faxes to the Bank dated 27-Aug-92
 a.nd 19-Sep-92, for ~il:_Q_J_Q_~.Jl__9_QJ1Jffi!,UJiS:.JlJ:j_o_ll_9_quj_p_l'[l_?nt to permit communications
 and coordination of operations over the ~Janjira Pha!le IV (and III) schemes.
 Tw~nty-three fixed stations and four stand-by units ore proposed; and
 application of the required licenses has been made and no difficulties are
 expected in this regard. The estimated cost5 are Ro 2.5 million or about
 US$85,000; this is below the threshold for ICB and prior review <US$200,000>.

4.05 Physical investments in this Component are being preceded by two
detailed surveys-studies-final design endeavors. However, both are being
undertaken with assistance from the same consulting engineering firm - TATA
Consulting Engineers of Bombay, in association with Binnie and Partners and
Thames Water, UK. HM\.JSSB holds monthly meetings with the study team; there is
additional ad hoc liaison, as required. The mission has hold diocussions with
HM\.JSSB and the consultants; each of the two studies is considered in turn

The pattern of generally declining growth rates seems reasonable.  However,
the indicated growth rate for "adjoining municipalities" in the period 1991 to
2001 seems extraordinarily high and should be examined further during the
review recommended in para 4.09.

 4.11  Yater Demands.  Studies are ongoing on existing water consumptions, by
 various classifications of users, in arc.:1s 'l-lhoro there in roanon to bolio'le
 that demands are fully met.  The objective is to form a basis, together with
 the population projections (above), for the estimation of future water demands
 both for the system as a whole and for local distribution areas.

 4.12  The mission has no particular comments on the figures derived to date.
 However, the mission suggests that for domestic consumers, tho consumption
 from public standposta should be disaggrogated from that from private
 connections.  The mission has also requested that in th~ reports~ there be
 some comment and evaluation of the impact on demand of price (the price
 elasticity of demand) bearing in mind the prospective high cost of Hyderabad's
 future supplies.

 4.13  In the discussion on water demands, it was notod that some examples have
 been encountered of industries having developed private borewell supplies to
 reduce or eliminate the costs of water supplied by HHYSSB. Additionally, it is
 known that some domestic consumers have supplementary private groundwater
 supplies.  It was also reported that, in the opinion of the AP Groundwater
 Board, groundwater in the Hyderabad Metro area is being abstracted at a rate
 greater than the natural recharge, and therefore is not sustainable.  Such
                                                                       1
 factors should also be assessed in tho work on futuro water domandD.    /

       /     A press report <Hindu 23-Sep-921 has indicated GOI's Ministry of
 Yater Resources intention to introduce legislation to sot up a Ground Yater
 Authority in each of the States and Union Territories which would regulate
 groundwater use.

4.14 Future ~ 9 ter Supply Avai~9b~.   A table <Table IJ-2) giving estimates of
existing a.nd future supplies was presented for rcvie\..1 and discussion. From
the discussion it was concluded that:

 (a)    the estimates of the supply available from <the existing) Himayat Sagar
        and Osman Sagar should be reviewed carefully; it is suspected that
        because of increasing upstream irrigation usc~ in the tributary bacins,
        the actual supply available may be different and nignificantly lower
        than the nominal supply from theso sources;

 (b)    the estimates should include           HH~SSB's     groundwater supplies;

 (c)    the table should separate the supplies from tho Hanjira Barrage <Hanjira
        Phases I and II) from the supplies from the Singur Dam <Hanjira Phases
        III and IV>; the estimates of supply from those sources, with a 92t
        reliability, and the operating rules to ensure this supply, wore tho
        subject of detailed studies preceding this project's approval by tho
        Bank;

 (d)    tho estimates of future supplies from tho Krishna lor other) sourco
        should be adjusted aosuming satisfaction of tho octimatcd futuro demands
        (paras 4.11 to 4.13).

 4.1'7 These studies are closely linked to those described above and are being
 conducted with assistance from the same consulting engineering firm. They are
 considered very important, having regard to the prospective high cost of
 future additional water supplies for Hyderabad.

 4.18 The study team tabled a note "Status of                  ~ork   as on 15-Sep-92''.         The

        the PSP consumer was "satisfied" with tho level of service. Tho avorago
        supply duration at a PSP is 3.2 hrs per day and the average daily PSP
        delivery is about 3,000 liters.

        most of the major consumers are located. The major consumers are: (i)
        industrial enterprises; (ii) commercial enterprises; and (iii) domestic
        agglomerations such as adjoining municipalities and industrial housing
        colonies.     Tho total number of such consumers and tho number whore tho

       summary these findings are concerned with:

       <1) the distribution of copies of the Rules to Section offices;
       {2) the need for standards for meter installations;
       (3) the need for prompt actions (per Rules) in case of non-functioning
             meters;
       (4} the observation of "good practice" in joining connections to mains;
       (5) the need for standardization of disconnection notice formats;
       (6) the enforcement of tho correct tariff <twice tho motored rate) in
             the case on non-functionine motors;
       (7) the need for independent surveillance of meter reading, billinz and
             rule enforcement procedures;
       (8} the recommendation that HHUSSB assume the responsibility of repair
             of service connections for the sake of "safo water supply".

 (f)   Operational Practices at Treatment Plants. HHUSSB should consider these
       recommendations for improvements and how they may be implemented in the
       near future. HM~SSB should also consider how such recommended practices
       may be embodied in "Operational Manuals" which have been discussed with
       Bank missions from time to time.

Consumer Metering - Service Connections - Ownm-_J>bj_p

4.21  The principle and practice of a volumetric water tariff have been
accepl~edin Hyderabad for many years and have the strong support of this
mission. However, its effectiveness as a means of promoting water
conservation and as a means of equit~ble cost-recovery clearly depend~ on
maintaining a very high level of effective motoring. From the preceding, this
is clearly not the case at present.

4.22  A related matter is the ownership and maintenance reoponsibility for
service connections as well as the material specifications therefor.

4.23   At present, there is in Hyderabad <and reflected in HM~SSB's Rules) the
perception that the service connection and the meter are "owned" by tho
consumer. This concept of "ownership" confers a responsibility for repair and
maintt9nance but clearly cannot confer any of the other normal "rights" of
ownership. ~hatever may havo been the arguments in favor of such an
                                                       ,-,

HHYSSB would desirably assume responsibility for the construction,

justification. However, the paymont of such charges should not be porceivod
as conferring "ownership" of the connection and the motor to tho consumer.

4.25      While the above has been agreed in principle, it is recognized that
there are a number of aspects to managing the transition.           These include tho
de)velopment of sound standards c:~nd specifications for: < i l the dotc:~ils of

'.JC)tAld have to ba reflected in aml?nd!lle>nts to the "R1;les" and there >.~ot;ld b';:. a

4.36 The method of treatment proposed as montionod in 4.JS<cl above io
selected as the least-cost solution after con~idor~tion of four alternatives.
However, the cost of land was not considered in the comparison and shotJld havr:-
been,  Accordingly, this comparison should bo redono.

4. 37 The report (page 105) contains the statement: "The ::>ito for the propose-d
treatment plant has to be located near Prakash Nagar where about 5-6 ha of
land may be possible to find." Clearly, some more thorough appraisal of land
availability must precede any final judgements as to the acceptability of thn
proposals.   At th~ same time, •):<isting <~nd prospor.tive fut;up~ land u;;;~;; in tho
immediate area ~lso needs to be reviow~d in tho cor1text of tho acceptability
of such a ce~-Ja~.G tre~tm'l>nt work<> in tho nc:;.i,ehbor·h,:•t;>~.l,

4,38 Apart from the observations above, the mission finds it difficult to

c'ompr~;~hensive sewera_g€< m;;.str,.r pl;;n and th.:;. "Phas8 1" p<•rt therc·of, ;::.s

4.39 The mission would also like to make somo observations on tho
presentation aspects of the report.   In our opinion, tho "readability" of tho
rQport would have been enhanced if some of the considerable technical and
scientific detail had been presented in Annexos to tha main report and the
main conclusions only drawn into the main body of the report.       Additionally,
the mission observes that some propi?r m~ps and dr«~-Jing:::, rather than thQ
sketches presented, would have enhancod tho roport.

4.40 The discussion with the mission also involved a review of some
preliminary tables and other material intended for use in an impending general
report on sewage treatment.  The mission sensed that there was a certain
amount of confusion on the important distinctions between:

 (a)   "potential sewage flows" (the flow which would result from adequate
       water supplies, and a full Bewerage collection ~ystem of adoquato
       capacity with full connections thereto>;

 (b)   the sewage flows resulting in practice based on the capacity of existing
       pipes in the system {often the present "actual" flows since the system
       is commonly of inadequate capacity); and

 (c)   the probable "actual" flows to emerge over time given the prospective
       areal coverage of the system, the probable level of connections thereto,
       and the probable level of water supply.

Subject to the application of peak to average ratios and allowances for
infiltration, (a) will often represent the appropriate basis for tho design of
at least local collection sewers whereas (c) will represent the appropriate
basi~ for planning tho provision of sewage pumping and oowa~o troatm0nt
capacity and possibly also certain trunk sowers.

4.41 These distinctions are of critical importance.   It appears to tho
mission that the impending report on sewage treatment wo~ probably premature,
given the need for considerable information on population distribution, water
supply and sewer connections for the derivation of the flows described in
4.40(c).

4.42 Accordingly, the mission recommends that HH~SSB and AIC carefully review
together the terms of reference <TOR> for this assignment and, as appropriate,
redesign the study program with the above observations in view.  The mission
also notes the importance of close liaison with the consultants concerned with
water supply who, as noted above, have done considerable work on population
projections and water supply demand criteria.

4.43 In any event, the mission wishes to confirm that the Bank will need a
comprehensive report, as described in the TOR, in order to consider with
HMYSSB the details of proposed sewerage investments.  This is not. to say that
some interim reports on specific aspects are not helpful but only that their
sequence of preparation, leading to the comprehensive report required, will be
critical to meaningful review of their contents.

4.44 In Annex 2 hereto, wo have presented the consultant's proposed reporting
nchedule which was revised on tho baBio of the above comments during
discussions.  However, as noted above, further revision may be appropriate
after consideration of the comments in 4.42 and 4.43 above.

Detailo of the actiono taken are provided in [\1)!1e_x __ 3 hereto.

4.46 In particular, the mission is also pleased that tho requirements of
effective supervision and quality control have been adequately addressed by
HM~SSB.  FHU has been strengthened, workshops and training cour~es for FHU
personnel and NGOs have been organized, supervision and quality control
responsibilities have been allocated to FHU personnel and detailed guidelines
provided to thorn to exercise quality control checks at tho pro-construction,
component manufacture, construction and post construction stages. Monitoring
systems have been designed and are in place.

4.47 Contract documents for program implementation, surveys and evaluation
services have also been revised by HHWSSB and approved by the Bank. Work
orders for the construction of the first batch of 328 latrines in Hafeez Baba
Nagar have been given by HHWSSB to three NGOs who are ready to start
construction once the problem (which has now surfaced) of non-availability of
ceramic pans with the prescribed slope of 25 - 30 degrees is resolved.

75 latrines using ceramic pans of 20 degree slope will be constructed
initially and the water requirement for flushing and overall performance of
these pans will be monitored closely by HHUSSB.           If the test results are
satisfactory, these pans will be used in further constructions.                   If not, other
appropriate steps will considered by HHWSSB. It was agreed that: (i) the
construction of 75 latrines will be completed by 15-0ct-92; {ii) HHWSSB
performance monitoring will be completed by 01-Nov-92; and (iii) tho
monitoring results and conclusions will be conveyed to the Bank before 15-
Nov-92.

4.55 The work of thin ~linnion on thin cornpon!"nt included a three day field
visit by Hr.Babbar, during which he visited 11 new resettlement villages and
two submerging villages. Many useful discussions were held with R&R official~
and CESS representatives before, during and after the field visit, mainly with
the intention to identify problems and generate alternatives, and to obtain
gre!tter role clarity for the various organizations involved in R&R activities.
The Mission included a review of tho contento of tho DnnY.'o Sth Docombor, 19()1
letter to the May, 1992 supervision mission. Further details of tho
mission's findings and recommendations on the RRP arc in Annex 4.

4.56 The original, January 1992, and current target completion schedules for
the agreed RRP are:

                                            Original        Jan-92        Current

Co•pletion of Econoaic Rehabilitation       ~arch,   1992   Harch, J~m    Dec, 1993

Thus, since the January, 1992 Supervision Mission, there has been a further
completion delay of about one year. The reasons cited are: (a} the 5
additional submerging villages for which the structures and houses have oti11
to be acquired; and (b) the delay in implementing the Horticulture Schemes
because of delayed procurement of Irrigation Borewell~ <para 1.10, Annex 4 of
this Aide Memoire).

4.57 The delays by CESS in bringing out the Half-yearly Reports were
discussed in detail with HHWSSB, R&R Officials nnd CESS. It was decided to
red,~ce procedural delays by finalizing tho draft reports within 15 days and
CESS need not wait further for remarks from R&R officials and the District
Collector. CESS has agreed to bring out Report No.3 (duo in March, 1992) by
lOth October, 1992 and Report No.4 (duo in September, 19921 by October end,
1992 ~nd Roport No.5 by H~rch 1993. Thin Hiceion noted thnt CESS ha3 gained
expertise in interpreting the perapoctive of tho PAFs, articulating their felt
needs, and agreed to make their reports less voluminous and more action-
or i ,en ted.

4.58 The civil work contracts were reviewed in detail and it was observed in
the field that the new practice of consolidating small works and inviting
offoro per Bank'o guidelines has resulted in providir1g qu~lity civic ~m0nitin~
and infrastructure in tho new reoottlomont villngnn.

4.59 Tho Miooion haa boon ploaood to noto now and innovative ouzgootiono from
the current R&R staff concerning the best ways to implement an effective and
economic rehabilit~tion program. However, R&R staff have still a long way to
go in achieving the targets for self-employment, employment training and
borewell irrigation. Tho job of successfully completing those taska
effectively and within tho time frame, will be tho major challenge of the
comin,g months.

4.60 Progress had been achieved in tho compliance of recommendations givor1 by
previous Bank's Supervision Missions, though not enough perhaps duo to staff
changes and inadequate follow-up.     It is necessary that greater attention is
now paid to all outstanding issues and R&R officials take a proactive stand on
pending and unresolved issues. This Mission has reviewed tho response to tho
Bank's letter dated 5-Dec-91, and has recommended that GOAP should provide a
more detailed responl!e to thi::~ letter to tho B;:wk. Thir~ t1isoion has Dttcmptcd

4.62 This component includes all technical assistance and HMYSSB'~ porooni!Ol
training program. Ho~ever, technical assistance in relation to Components 2
and 3 ~ere revie~ed above under those heads (paras 4.05-4.20 and 4.28-4.44
respectively) and the personnel training program ~as revie~ed above in paras
3.17-3.21. Accordingly, the text belo~ reports the re~iew of the ~ork of tho
four consultant-assisted studies and related implementation support in the
areas of:

      Financial Accounting and Management Information Systems
      Revenue Billing and Collection Systems
      Stores Management and Inventory Control Systems
      Project Management Systems

Schedules of the various consultant's reports I including those related to
Components 2 and 3) are in b.n!J_~x_z_ hereto.



4.63 This system is being designed with assistance from A.F.Ferguson <AFfl.
The mission met ~ith concerned HMWSSB staff and this consultant for a briefing
on the status of development and implementation of thi~ system. Essentially,
there has been limited progres:; on this ayatcm ainco tho last rnir:sion':.J
review, as the consultants have concentrated their effort:.; on the Eo·;onuo
Billing system for which they are also providing assistance. The consultants
acknowledge that they are behind schedule, and have requested an extension of
time. The mission recognizes that there have been delays which will require
an extension of time to the contract. However, it is also the mission's view
that a sufficient extension of time should be sought to fully allow adequate
time for implementation assistance of the caliber called for in tho contract.

4.64 The mission's limited review of the system indicated that the system has
been designed for implementation at each of 19 division offices, each of ~hich
~ould produce its own trial balance for consolidation at the Head Office
level. Given the number of divisions and tho lack of qualified accounting
personnel at the divisional level, this is not likely to be feasible in the
near term, having regard to the related personnel issue {para 3.14). The
consultants and the Director of Finance confirmed that in fact the system
would be introduced on a centralized basis for Head Office accounting only
initially. Later, it would be extended to the divisional level, but with thQ
divisional accounts being prepared centrally bQfor0 tho oystcm in nvontually
decentralized.

4.65 The mission confirms the advice of previous missions concerning the nocd
for a detailed, ~ritten implementation and training plan. Hoanwhile, the
consultants' timetable is:
                                      - 26 -

 (a) acquire necessary hardware (in accordance with hardware sizing proposal
     of 19-Sep-92> prior to 31-Dec-92;

 (b) commence software tcritinz/ implementation trnining by 31-Jan-93;

  (c) implement now systems effective 1-Apr-93 for !lead Office accounting.

4.66 A ~enior qualified accountant needs to be recruited urgently to hood up
implementation of the new 3yntem on behalf of the Donrd. Exlnting Hnnd Offic~
accounting personnel will be trained in the use of the new hardware and
systems (para 3.12>.

4.67 In aummary, tho ~~~jQQ to be taken is that a revised contract is to be
forwarded to the Bank, containing tho roviocd contract completion d~to, an
well as a detailed implementation plan for the remaining work.

Revenue Billing and   Collecti£n_syp~~m


4.68 The Revenue Billing and Collection System for which AFF are also the
consultants is recognized as the priority system for implementation by tho
Board, and is the syotem on which the consultants have concentrated ainco tho
previous mission laat Hay.

4.69 Since May, the noftware han been to5ted in ono office using hiatoricol
dat11, and rl!lplicating all the trant~llctiona which occur in that office. Tlli!>
process han been completed.

4.70 The next stage in implementation is to actually implement tho system in
three or four offices. This is designed to test:

  {a} software;
  (b) hardware selection and performance;
  (c) personnel/ management issues.

HHWSSB proposes to purchase only 3-4 sets of hardware initially for this
phase. Once the hardware has been tested and proven, they would propose to go
to tender for the balance of 45-50 sets. Agreed procurement procedures must
be followed. As necessary, Finance and Accounts should consult the Project
Management Group, who are informed on such procedures. However, the time for
commencement and completion of this phase remains to be determined.

4.71 Given the design of the system <which this and previous missions
endorse) as a decentralized billing and revenue system to be installed at each
of approximately 50 section offices (each serving approximately 5000
customers), the installation of this system will be~ substantial undertaking.
It is also a task which must be accomplished in its entirety quickly
(over,say, 12 months at a maximum> in order to achieve its principal
objectivoo of improved collectiont~, Improved management information for
tariff-setting and rovonuo enhoncem~nt, and improved oervice to the customer.
It is essential that tl1o consultant!! and HHYSSB draw up a specific written
implementation plan.

4.72 Tho mi!lsion di:Jcu~ood tho foaturo:J of tlli:-~ in.plorncnt.:ltion plan with thr:-
con!!ultant!l and the Director of Finance. Tho accompli3hment of tho convor5ion
of 50 offices over a 12-month period will clearly involvo a taok-forco
approach requiring a temporary commitment of rosourco5 beyond tlto Board'o
normal capability.    It wa~ agreed that th0 immc-di<~te critical !:'tt:po inclurf,-,
the following:

  (a) immediate recruitment of a Gonior qualified accountant to coordinate and
      manage this activity on behalf of the Board.

  (b) revision to the AFF contract to provide supervisory and clerical effort
      over a 12-month period to convert tho office!!. <AD:JUming that up to
      seven or eight offices muut be converted in each 2-month period, acvert
      or eight supervisors will be required of which threo or four could b0
      provided by AFF and three or four by tho Board. Tho supervioors could
      be trained by converting the first three or four offices mentioned
      previously>.

It is suggested that both these initial ctops bo completed by 1-Jan-93.

4.73 While tho minsion agr(le>d in principle to th0 pr0cecling, formal B.1nlr
approval to tho proposed AFF contr.Jct revi:>ion is required prior to exocutine
a contract revision. This roquost for Bank approv~l should bo accompanied Ly
a specific implementation plan (time and resources) covering both AFF's and
the Board's responsibilities.

4.74 The mission also recommended additions to tho reports to be produced by
this system:

       a) The frequency of each type of report to be produced should be
       specified.

       b) An additional consolidated report be prepared showing, within oach
       incremental band of 1000 liters/month consumption, tho number of
       consumers and the volume consumed. This information will bo oxtromoly
       helpful in tariff design.

The consultants and the Board agreed with those changes.



 4.75 The mission met with Tata Consultancy Services <TCS> who are assisting
·the Board in this assignment. The design and implementation of the system is
 based upon a two-stage approach:

   (i) Introduce a Manual System
       Manual procedures have been completed and documented in two volumes
       (using improvements to tho previously existing system>.
       This system is ready to be implemented; but implementation has not yot
       actually commenced (expected to commence October 1 >. TCS have requested
       HM~SSB to provide poroonnel for training.  Th~co aro in procoss of baing
       identified.
                                            - 28 -


 <i   i > :f_b_Qn_.___J_nJ;:_r_Qgy_o;_~_!:_hEl._~_Q!1IP.\!_t:9Li~9c:i__ S.Y n t~m.
          The functional specifications have been completed ~ith a draft nystcm
          de!!ign document completed at the end of Augunt; n prototype to tc!:t tho
          system has been dovolopod and some feedback has boon received.

4.76  A documented implementation plan should be produced and sent to the
Bank.  However, the plan is to commence implementation of the computerized
system in Dec-92. The critical deadline, accepted by the consultants and the
Board, is to have a functioning computerized system in place by April 1,1993
(in order to start with agreed inventory balances resulting from the year-end
stocktaking).

4.77   This is not a large or difficult system to implement.  There are only
about 800 types of items in the stores; there are only about 15 people
direc1~ly affected at the 3 stores locations plus the central office purchasing
and stores. The principal problem in implementation ~ill be user training; a
user manual and documentation will be provided.




4.78     The consultant's here have developed a complex system which              link~:


      (a) network planning <PERT or CPH> of project         activitie~;


      (b) procurement activity monitoring and contract         a~ards   including Bank
          approvals, as and if required;

      (c) contract expenditures with the accounting system;

      (d) related disbursement applications with the accounting system;

      (~)the  movement of materials in and out of stores (if materials are
          supplied to contractors) with the stores accounting system.

4.79 The design of the system and the development of the softwar~ has been
substantially completed and it will be ready for trial operation soon.   The
missi<>n requests that the output formats, as presently designed, be carefully
compared with that now used by HHWSSB in its progress reporting to the Bank.
Both HMWSSB and the Bank have found this present format very satisfactory.

                               Various Procurement Matters

4.80  Tender advertis~g.    HHWSSB, at the request of the mission, furnished a
written statement (in the form of a FAX to Bank headquarters dated 19-Sep-92)
its present tender advertisement practices for both LCB and ICB procurement.
These are considered satisfactory.

 4. 81 Two-envelope Proce_g_l,l[~_f_9.1:_1J~~LET2<::_1.lf.E'.lrnE'.lnY.. Tho mission discus sod
 HMWSSB's FAX to the Bank of 24-Jun-92 after reference to Bank headquarters.
 This FAX seeks the Bank's permission to adopt a two-envelope procedure
 according to which the first envelope to be opened at a tender opening would
                                              - 29 -

contain the tendcron:; post-qunlification de>cumontntion and tho .second 11o~tld
contain the tender proper. Only if tho contents of tho first envelope mot
requirement~ wo~ld the second envelope bo opened.    Tt1is proposal wns mndc by
HHWSSB in an attempt to resolve certain problems beir1g exporionced rolntod to
incomplete post-qualificntion documentation often baing received with
tender:s.




4.83 Discussions during project preparation and during appraisal led to the
inclusion, in the project, of consultant-assisted studies on HMWSSB's
operation and maintenance practices with a view to developing manuals of ''good
practice'' for use in the training of staff and their and their supervizor's
reference. Subsequently, HMWSSB advised that they would like to at least
initiate such studios with their own resources.

4.84 HMWSSB furnished to the mission a draft of their "Manual of O&M for
Water Supply and Sewerage System" of some 64 pages and dated 19-Sep-92. While
this document contains useful information and ideas, th~mission is of tho
opinion that a document which is much more specifically related to tho
articular features of HHWSSB's water supply and sewerage systems and much more
specifically related to the duties and responsibilities of particular staff
will be required for maximum effectiveness. Furthermore, to the extent that
improved record keeping is required, then specific formats for such record~,
and administrative procedures for the approval and filing of such records need
to be established.

4.85 Presently working on this project, through their Indian principals, are
.two UK water authorities - Thames and Severn-Trent. The mission has suggested
 that these organizations be consulted regarding their operation and.
maintenance practices and the related forms and records, manuals and training
 programs for different levels of staff. Depending on the outcome of those
consultations, a further consulting assignment for one or both of thoso
 organizations could bo considered. The mission also wishes to suggest that
 the experience of other large water and sewerage organizations in such matters
 be ascertained.

                             )he Operational Action Plan <OAP>

 4.86 It has been agreed that HHWSSB will prepare annually, soon after 31-Har
 each year a two-year operational action plan <OAP>. This has boon done and
 the action plan and tho etatu9 of o~ch action are roportod in HHUSSD's
 quarterly reports to the Bank. On tho whole, this is achieving the objectives
 of the action planning process; however, a mission review with HHWSSB of tho
 OAP in the report for the period ending 30-Jun-92 indicates th4t in tho caso
 of some action itom~. th~ atatus (or rnvl50d target dnt"l hnn not brrn

                                  Monitoring    Jnciic<"~tor~


4.87 The concept of monitoring indicator2 has been discussed by provio1u:;
missions but, oo far, propooalo ~rom HHUSSB hav~ not h00n r0ceJvcd.
Accordingly, thia miaaion has again discussed this matter ahd elabo~ated on
the concept. Basically, the idea is to record readily measurable and
quantifiable "indicators" which are indicative of HHUSSB's progress and/or
institutional performance in relation to its key objective2. This the process
of developing such indicators starts with the definition of such key
objectives (in terms of project progress, financial performance, level and
quality of service to consumers, personnel management and training, and so
forth) and then identify conveniently measurable "indicators" of progress
 towards such objectives.

4.88 HHUSSB has agreed to incl1,1de a draf..L.Q.UJJ£h~.;l-~_!;_gf___:~m_gnitcu:J..M
indiclltors" for incl1,1sion in the guarterl_y report t<?_____!:_h_~_fl_M!.l< for__the period
ending 30-Sep-92. The mission has suggested that all of these key indicators
should fit on a single page and comprise from say 10 to 30 elements.

                           Quarterly Reporting to the _Ba!J.k

4.89 HHUSSB has furnished promptly to the Bank its quarterly reports as
agreed. The format and content have been discussed and agreed from time to
time. On the whole, the procedure is working well and the reports and the
preparation process is acknowledged to be useful to HHUSSB. However, this
mission has noted that:

 (a)   some of tho annex tDbles have boon roducod to tho point that              lo.~ibility
       is threatened;

 (b)   e~ome changea have boon mado to tho agrcod format for rl"'porting on tho
       RRP which do not appear to be justified;

 {c)   the report would be more conveniently "readablo" if all tables arc
       viewed ~ither from tho bottom or from tho right; nnd

 (d)   "monitoring indicators" should be added (paras 4.07-4.00).




4.90 HHWSSB has furnished to the miasion a copy of tho minutes of the Eighth
Meeting of the Dam Review Panel <DRP> held in Hydorabad 2-4 Scp-92. Section
II of these minutes gives in summary format a list of 33 recommended actions
which is cross-referenced to the remainder of the minutes. Action ha~ boon
and is being taken on many of these recommendations by tho AP Irrigation
Department. However, this mission feels it would be unoful to now develop a
dated action plan with respect to each of these 33 recommendations. ~-9.8E.._h;,t.!?.
agreed that this will be done and a copy fur~_ishQd_1~__tb§_~~n~. A further
copy should, of course, be furnished to the DRP Chairman.

5.01 ;>tatus of A~s:ljJ;_~g_A~~-Q_u.at.~_, The mission recorded its concern ovor tho
lateneas in the finnlisntion of tho audited accounts for 31-Mar-91, ~hich woro
due in the Bank by 31-Dec-91 (per FA 4.01 ), and for which tho Audit
Certifi6ate was not issued until 11-Hay-92.

5.02 For the year ending 31-Mar-92, the Director of Finance indicated that it
is expected that the accounts will be finalised and provided to the State
,Accountant General for audit by 15-0ct-92 so as to provide audited accounts to
the Bank by 31-Dec-92. He indicated that the audit of expenditures from tho
IDA Credit should be completed on a timely basis, ~ith information having been
provided to the Accountant General in Jul-92.

5.03 Issues arising from Review o_f__ill_L_ll_udit_~c!__8<:;.Gou_nj:;_~~-- The 1991 audit
report indicates that the assets are understated as "identification and
ascertainment of extent and value of some of those asseta is still in
progress", which is stated as note 2 Cbl to tho accounts. Tho assets
concerned include the Osman Sadar reservoir, the Hamayae Sadar reservoir and
distribution pipeline in the older part of the city. Although tho rooorvoirD
represent two out of three existing sources of water, they arc ~t lc3st 40
years old and would be subst;Jntitdly depreciated. Thus their omic:sion do"':::
not materially affect tho fianancial results.

5.04 There is also a note to the 1991 Account::; which reflects an audit
qualification to the 1990 Accounts concerning the liability for pcnoion
provision with respect to past service of employees taken over upon formation
of the Board in 1989.  It was apparently not possible to quantify this
liability until the period for employees to commit themselves to the Board had
elapsed. This has now occurred, and it is necessary that this matter now be
resolved between the Board and the Government, failing which it would be
necessary for the Board to make provision for the funding of this liability.
This issue was raised by the mission with the Government.

5.05 In its review of the Accounts, the mission observed that tho provision
for Depreciation was unrealistically low, amounting to less than 1.01 of Gross
Fixed Assets in service. ~hile the understatement of depreciation for 1990/91
is in the order of Rs.5 million, the understatement will become very
significant with the coming into service of Hanjira III and Hanjira IV. Two
factors have contributed to the understatement of depreciation expense:

   (a) tho computation method prescribed by tho HMWSSB Act, Section 14; in
       particular, this results in an average 3.0t depreciation rate being
       reduced to only about 0.8t in tho early yc~r5;

   (b) the use of an inappropriate 50-yonr lifo for such agocto as pumping
       otation5 and powor generation oquipmont.
The Board has agreod to initiate a change in Section 14 of tho Act, oo as to
allow for the use of the strnizht-lino or declining-balance mothodz of
                                                     -   32 -

Tho Board has agreed to initiat~ a chanae in Soction 14 of tho Act, ~o a~ to
allow for the uso of tho straight-lino or doclining-b.:>l;:.nco rnothodc of
depreciation.  The Board hns alr,o agrood to a technic;~! revir:~-J of tho
proj~ct~d lives of its major asset classes, as a basis for tho adoption of
more realistic lives for depreciation ourposos.

5.06 Tlw miauion also ob&orvod that .Sun.Jry DF.>bt<nc ;Jt: 2')7 days' billings <.~I;
year~nd 1992'was virtually unchanged.from the 259 days outstanding at the end
of March,1991.  This appears to have twd causes:
                                    r

  <.o)   Covornmont of Andhr<~ Pr-.;,~dor;h is;; ill d,>f.;,~ult C·ll itt: r:ovr.Hl.;lnt <Af' 2.10J
         pay down the outstanding arn1ars of tho ~~~wicip;)l ity of Hyderabad at thr)
         rate of Rc.lO million per ye3r prior to Jun9 30 P.ach ye;)r.                     Out of Rs. 30
         million due by .Junl') 30,1992, only Fs.l6.7 million h::ld boon r·;:~id.

   (b) all revenue billings, regardless of collectibility ~re dobited to
       Debtors.  No provision is made for bad debts.  Thus, tho age of
       receivables will continuously increase.  The mission requested tho
       Board to prepare an ae~d listing of its major receivablos.  It will be
       necessary under the accrual accounting syctnm for tho Board to adopt a
       clear policy with respect to the recovery of Debtors, and with respect
       to the provision for bad debts or doubtful accounts.

 5.07 As an initial stop to~-J;:~rds m;:~king tho fin.-:>nr::i<d :::t.-:>tnrnontr; moro
 informative to the Board, as wall as to other interested re~dors, the previous
 mission had requosted tho Board to include a Statement of Sourcos and Uses of

5.09 The results for 1992 indicate th~t HMUSSB was not in compliance with its
financial covenant lPA 4.02>, insofar as its ratio of Ravanue to Total
Operating Expenses was 0.951. This m.;~rkod a d'ftorior'Jtic•n from th<:> prPvict)::;
year's 0.976, notwithstanding a significant tariff increase effected on
·1-Aug-91. Civen the contint~inB general inflation of costs, and of power and
petroleum products in particular, it is apparent that a further tariff
 increase is immediately required, in the order of approxima~ely 15~ ..
 Furthermore, tho Board had agreed with the Bank that tariff adjustments wotJld
 be considered on an annual basis, having regard to medium-term finalncial
 projections. Such an in~rease ts now overdue .
                             .~


5.10 The comparative Revenue and Expenditure statemont also indicates tho
beginning of a significant change in tho Board's cost structure, relating to
tho coming into service of Manjira Phase III. This appears to be tho cause of
a significant increase in the ratio of Po\.ler Cost to 0pl"'r:ltine Rovonuo, which
wac 39.:37. in 1992 voroun 34.91. in 1991. Thr:> mis!:don If:•quostr:>d, <Jnd tho £3o<Jrd
agreed, to conduct an analysis of the costs of power, chemicals and salaries
resulting from the operation of Hanjira III.      In particular, it is necessary
to clearly identify how much of the power cost increase resulted from an
increase in power tariffs, and how much is attributable to changing power
consumption, This is likely to have a significant impact on tha assumptions
for the financial model, and hence for future tariffs.

            Status of Accounts and Audits- GOAP CRRP and DRP- Part Bl

5.11 The audited accounts for the years ending 31-Mar-90 and 31-Har-91
were certified on 24-Jun-92. The mission expressed its concern at the
acco1.mt:lng dG>l<lys which wer€' th~;~ c;::~usf? of dl')f;::~tdt <Jg<>inst the provision of
AP3.0l<b)(ii) which reqtAires audited ;:~ccounts to be .:?t the Bank by tho
following 31-Dec.

5.13 Yith respect to the accounts for the year ending 31-Har-92, the
engineering component has been completed, but the books have not been posted
due to a lack of skilled staff. The mission ~pproved a request to engage
outside accounting staff at an estimated cost of Rs.S,OOO. The mission
requested that an appointment letter specifying fee and responsibilities be
issued to such an accountant. The accounts must be ready for audit by 15-0ct.


               Medium Term Financial Projections -Tariff Adjustments

5.14 The Consultants <Aff) responsible for Revenue Billing and Financial
Systems are responsible to d&,velop a computerised Medium Term Financial
PlanninB Model designed to a~sist in the development of annual tariff
revisions or r~structuring. The previ,ous mission had anticipated that th~
Fin~nci;,l Model would be available in July for us9 in d~voloping a revisod
tariff for introd\Jction in' Au.gu~;t.

 5.15 The mission wen;) providG>d with hard copy from a prelimin4ry run of th€1
 Hodel. While the Model appears to bQ UJ;able, its ~omplicatod dosign involved
 the interaction of numerous separate files, rather tl1an a simplo two-
 dim~?nsic>nal spread sh.;G>t; tho mission made a numbl:~r of S1Aggostion:; for its

improvement in terms of the layout of schedules, functioning of the Hodel and
output from the Hodel.

5.16  An prour>ntod,.!) '(umbor of r:h.ongou to illpllt rL•ta oliO (l<oCOG!hllY ~_ ..._,(r:.r•-· ''!\"
can have confidence in the resulting modium term projection.             Tho dala for
Revenue ~nd Expenditure, Balance Shoot and, to the oxtont available,
Production and Sales for 1991/92 need to be verified.           Tho implications of
Hanjira III for staffing and power costs in particular need to be analysed and
incorporatod into the Hodel's assumptions.        The level and anticipated futuro
increases in electricity power tariffs should be very carefully reviewed.
Also, insofar as thoro will be a major impact on costs resulting from Hanjira
IV, its impact on costs should be identified.

5.17 Nevertheless, in addition to the immediate tariff increase indicatod in
paragraph 5.09 above, tho Hodel indicat&.H> that ( svbjn.ct to tho commr:mts in
para_graph 5.14) it will be broadly necessary for ann1,.;d tariff increasP.s to
keep pace with general inflation with a larger tariff increase required in thP.

      xi)        casting of RCC rings by NGOa has started; nnd

      xii)       monitoring and review meetings have commenced.

2.     Simultaneously, HM\.JSSB haa. completed, with the help of consultantn., the
detailed survey of 596 households in Hafee2 Baba Nagar <Phase-1, \.lard 18,
Block 12). \.Jerk orders have been given to 3 NGOs to construct a total of 328
latrines in those households which have given their consent to participate in
1;he project..

:~.      Casting of RCC rings has commenced and 320 have been produced so far by
the NGOs. The mission was informed that the NGOs are ready to start
construction, beginning with the construction of the sample latrines, as soon
as the problem (which has now surfaced} of the availability of ceramic pans of
1;:.he prescribed slope is resolved.

                                  Availability of Pans

·~.      The beneficiary households have to procure and provide the pans, among
1:>t-her items, as their share of the cost of the latdne. The pans to be
provided by them have to conform to prescribed designs of pour flush latrines,
:if they are to provide. satisfactory service. An important design requirement
prescribed by the UNDP/\.Jorld Bank/TAG Manual on Pour Flush Latrines is that
the pan should have a slope of 25 - 30 degrees which is steeper than the slope
in the conventional pans. The steeper slope is to facilitate excreta to be
flushed with low volumes of water <2 - 3 liters). The pour flush latrine is
designed to conserve water and is appropriate for water ecarce areas. Also,
low water use will not strain the leaching capacity of the soil around the
pits. The steeper slope prescribed for the pan is therefore crucial for the
efficient long term functioning of the technology, besides water conservation.

5.     The May 1992 mission had suggested (para 4.06 (c) of that A-MJ that
HMIJSSB will do a market survey and assist with the availability of the correct
pans. HMIJSSB reported in its fax of 29-Aug-92 that the market survey had been
done and that a ceramic pan of 28 - 30 degrees slope to horizontal
manufactured by two firms had been selected. However, during the current
mission, HMWSSB clarified that the firms had since discontinued the production
of these pans due to lack of market demand. The firms are inclined to
recommence production only if HMIJSSB agrees to place special orders with them
for a minimum of 6,000 nos. Since the pans are to be procured by the
beneficiaries themselves, HMIJSSB is unable to procure the pans directly from
the manufacturers.

 6.      The question of using fiberglass pans, which are available in the market
 \·lith the prescribed slope, was discussed with Hl1\.lSSB. The mission was informed
 1~hat the people were not willing to use fiberglass pans and preferred ceramic
 pans which they are used to and which they consider to be longer-lasting.
                                                                     AlltiEY. 3


7.    The minsion was informed thnt ll stalcmatf' situntion hnd thur: nrir.cn:
people whose houses had already been surveyed were prossing for construction
to start without delay, whereas the NGOs were unable to start the construction
because of the non-availability of ceramic pans of the prescribed slope.

8.     The minsion was further informed that ceramic ponD of 20 degrees slope
we.re available in the market. These pans had also been used in other projects
involving conntruction of pour flush latrines and the experience was that
excreta in tho::;o pans could be flushed with lo\.J volurnec of \.Jater (about 3
liters), probably becaune of the smo,other and polished ceramic surface. mws:::.n
added that, according to studies made by them earlier, the leaching capacity
of the soil in the projebt areas \.J88 good and could absorb higher volum~s of
water < > 2,000 liters/day).

9.      To resolve the stalemate and commence construction quickly, HtWSSB hnl!
agreed that tho 3 NGOs who have b€-on given rwork order r '.J i 11 initially
construct 75 latrines C 25 per NGO ) using ceramic pans rwith 20 degrees ulope
to be procured by the beneficiaries. HMlJS.SB would closely monitor the
performance of the pan&, particularly the volume of ~-Jat~r needed for flushing.
If the performance is satisfactory, construction would continue using these
pans. It was agreed that the NGOs \.Jould complete the construction of these 75
lat:.rines by 15-0ct-92 and that HMIJS.SB would complete the performanc~
monitoring exercise by 01-Nov-92. The monitoring ret"ultc and the further
action proposed would be conveyed to the Bank befor~ 15-Nov-92.



10.    HMWSSB proponcG a gnp of about 2" between cnch RCC ring to fncilitotc
leaching of liquids from the pits to the surrounding ooil. The miosion
believes that there is a possibility of the surrounding soil entering the pits
through such a gap, and recommends a smaller gap. Tho misaion was further
assured that adequate supports rwould be provided bet~-Jecn the rings to ensure
that the gaps arc retained and that the rings do not collapne over each other.
St:one ship~ were Buggested.  In any event, the mission img&ests thn.t at leas.t
eight such supports be provided between each set of rings.



11.   The mission was pleased to observe that the trwo rema1n1ng positions of
AEEIAEs in FMU have now ooen filled. Three work inspectortl' are nlso propo&ed
to be appointed based on implementation requirements. The mission rwas also
informed that all existing personnel of FMU, except one recently positioned
AEE, have been provided training in LCS. Training will soon be organized for
this staff member, as also for tho work inspector~ on nppointment.

12.   FMU is now staffed by one part-time Executive Engineer, one full-time
Deputy Executive Engineer and four full-time AEE/AEn, bcnidez the LCS Adviser
(part-time) and the LCS Assistant Adviser <full-time). One AEE/AE in
exclunively responsible for quality control of componPntu like RCC ringn. The

                                                                    Page 4 of      I,


question of allocating adequate space and budget for efficient functioning of
FMU wan discussed with HM~SSB. The mionion wan aenured thGt opace would be
provided before 31-0ct-92. Budget has already been allocated.

13.   FMU has already commenced periodical reviews of progrecs and problems.
The Superintending Engineer had also convened a meeting to take stock of
progress and issues. Regular meetings are scheduled once construction starts.



14.    Monitoring formats and procedures are in place. The format for reporting
of progress to the Bank each quarter was discussed with HM~SSB. The format
nlready proposed provides for physical and financial progress in absolute and
percentage terms. The mission suggested that the percentage project time
E~lapsed may also be indicated in a new column, to enable easy COmparison
between physical, financial and time flow indicators.

15.     The documents for inviting proposals concurrent evaluation services are
ready and the institutions to be invited have also been shortlisted. HH~SSB
1-1ill proc17ed to invite proposals before 15-oct-92. It was clarified to the
mission that the evaluation indicators, formats and methodology will be
:e;uggested by the institutions and finalized by HH~SSB in consultation with the
Bank.



16.   The Adviser <LCS) was of the view that, from the longer-term angle, it
would be worthwhile identifying a training institution to provide training
services on a regular basis to HM\..lSSE personnel as well as NGOs, masons etc.,
involved in LCS implementation. Refresher courses as needed could also be
provided by this institution. In fact, it is envisaged that this institution
in due course could meet the training needs of all institutions in the State
implementing low cost sanitation. The proposal was discussed further with
HM~SSB which clarified that the longer-term training needs of LCS were already
included in the overall training plan of HM\JSSB. It was also noted that, so
far as the immediate training needs in LCS are concerned, they have already
been provided.

                                   Study Tour

17.   HM~SSB felt that it would be desirable to expose FMU personnel and NGOs
involved in LCS implementation to experiences (both good and not so good} of
LCS programs in other States of India. The mission supports the proposal. It
was agreed in principle that study tours may be underfaken to LCS programs in
the States of Gujarat, Bihar and Tamil Nadu. The details will be worked cut by
HHWSSB and furnished to the Bank.

1.01 The objective of this Annexure to the Aide Memoire is to review the
progress in the implementation of the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan
CRRP) and to identify pending 3nd unrcoolvcd !neue~, all witl1 a view to
bringing the RRP to a timely and successful completion, having regard to the
agreed RRP objectives. The mission examined (a) the organization, management
and staffing requirements to ensure effective implementation; <b) the pace of
implementation and prospective timing of completion; (c) findings and
recommendations of the Centre for Economic and Social Studies <CESS>; and (d)
the accounting, audit and financial management aspects of the RRP.

1.02 The Mission members were of Mr.Chris Couz~ns, Senior Sanitary
Engineer and Mission Leader, Mr.Harry S.Horrin - Bank Consultant and
Financial Analyst, and Mr.Vinod Babbar- Bank Consultant. Mr.Babbar
visited 11 new resettlement sites and 2 submerging villages, and he was
accompanied by R&R officials and a representative of CESS. The mission
takes this opportunity to thank the District Collector Hr.D.R.Garg and his
staff of Medak District, the Director and staff of CESS - the Monitoring
and Evaluation Agency <M&E> and the Hyderabad Metropolitan Yater Supply and
Sewerage Board CHHYSSB> for their o~pport and co-operation.

1. 03 F_~~!\',t_tl~lllQIJ.!!_JH)Q __ Rehabil i t;a_t ion Program ( RRP); Tho R&R comronont WLH>
appraised on the basil.' of th!' Gove'rnmpnt of Andhrll Prndet~h <GOAP) report "
RRP for Project- Affected Personz under the Singoor Project'', dated Harch
1989. The results of this appraisal and the agreed RRP are in Annex 7 to
the January, 1990 Bank Staff Appraisal Report <SARl for tho overall
project. The contents of this Annex are also referred to in and appended
to the Agreed Minutes of Negotiations. Thiu original RRP planned for
completion of all the R&R activities in a 3 year period ending March 31,
1992. The RRP had four main elements < l l Land Acquisition <2)
Infrastructure (3) Economic Rehabilitation and (4) Independent Monitoring
and Evaluation for which CESS was selected (para 1.02).

1.04    The RRP had four agreed objectives (para 10, Annex 7, SARl: "The
objectives of the RRP are that project Affected Families <PAFs>, after a
rE~asonable transition period, shall:


( i)   improve or at least. regain, the standard of 1 i ving which they had
       prior to displ~cement, through the restoration of their economic
       productivity:

(ii)   be relocated in village units, village sections or families in
       accordance with their preference;

(iii) be fully integrated into the community to which they are resettled;
      and

(iv)   be provided with appropriate compensation and adequate social
       community services and facilities."

1.05 Tho concept bohind tho agreed independent Monitoring & Evaluntion Ag0ncy
was that depending upon the findings and recommendations of such an agency,
GOAP would promptly revise, as necessary, the Resettlement and Rehabilitation
Program on the basis of the M & E reports, in consultation with the Bank
{Section 2.07 {d) of the agreement between GOAP and the Bank). Thus, there is
a clear case to revise the RRP in light of the M&E findings and
recommendations and the agreed RRP objectives <para 1.03).

1.06 The affected villages are divided into two categories Ia) fully
submerged villages and {b) partially submerged villages. Fully submerged
villages refers to those affected villages where the village site (residential
area) is going under submergence.   'Partially Submerged Villages' refers to
those villages where only the agricultural land is being submerged and the
village site {residential area) is not affected.

1.07 I~evised RRP. November 1990:     Subsequently, on the basic; of more
detailed physical, engineering and social data which had accrued during
implemEmtation, the RRP waa revised in November 1990.  Inter alia, the number
of affected families <PAfs) changed as follows:
                              No.of PAFs        No.of PAFs

Partially submerged villages            2000          3673

                     TOTAL:             6120          92-59

This document did not update the implementation schedule for the
infrastructure works {i.e. completion date remained 31 March, 1992) and it
proposed that the economic rehabilitation work would be completed by December
1993. It also left the total estimated co•t unchanged at Rs.16.9B millions.

1.08 The October 1991 Supervision Mission, ~n its consolidated findings,
                 ·' to GOAP by the Bank'~ l~tter dated 5 December, 1991,
which were conveyed
prepared revised time schedu~e formats for the completion of various
activities. These have now been incorporated in the June 1992 Quarterly
Progress Report. HMWSSB has now rectified some errors in filling up these
formatf~ <Attachment Nos 1 to 3, Bank's letter dated 5 December 1991) and
agreed to prepare the Quarterly Progress Reports in tho prescribed formatz.
The October 1991 Supervision Mission also made a number of changes in the
content, schedules and costs of the RRP. The GOAP response to the Bank's
letter dated 5 December 1991, is given in the District Collector's letter
dated 21 August 1992. This response is incomplete in a number of aspects and
it is recommended that GOAP furnish a more detailed recponee to the Bank.

1.09 Organization C. Staffing for Management of RRP: The RRP is directly
supervised by the District Collector <Hedak District), who reports to the
Principal Secretary to GOAP, Hunicipal Adminintration and Urban Development

Department for all activities concerning R&R. The Diztrict Collector is
as5isted by one Rehabilitation Officer and One ExecutiVe Engineer. The
Rehabilitation Officer is responsible for Economic Rehabilitation, Employmc11t
Training, Street-lighting, forming bore-well irrigation blocks, liaison with
other district officers etc. The Managing Director, BH\JSSB and hin stllff arc
not directly involved in R&R activities but are able to give valuable advice
and assistance to R&R officials, especially in Civil Engineering matters.
Since the last Supervision Mission <Hay 1992), the former Managing Director
has proceeded on study leave and HH\JSSB's affairs are now looked after by an
acting Managing Director. Since the January 1992 Supervision Mission, the
District Collector, Rehabilitation Officer and Executive Engineer have all
changed. This wholesale change of key personnel has compounded the difficulty
of effective management of the RRP and is clearly inconsistent with the Bank's
advice, as given in various aide memoires and letters, from time to time since
inception. This is a matter of concern to this Mission.

1.10   Need to up date RRP. This mission was informed that there has been
increase in the number of eligible beneficiaries espec~ally under the economic
rehabilitation schemes, as shown below.

Although the figures given for current estimates are the best now available,
it is recogni2ed and agreed that further detailed estimating is required to
refine these figures. This Mission was also informed that the number of
affected villages and new resettlements has changed as follows:

CAgain, further checking for these current estimates is nececsaryl. The Bank
in its letter dated 6 March 1992 has also commented that the estimated
completion dates were ambitious, that there is a need for particular emphasic

schemes. This Mission was made to understand that the likely dates of
complet-ion would be as follo>fs:

It is necessary now to fix a realistic time schedule for all R&R activities in
an updated RRP. It is recommended that the updated RRP be finalized by 15
Novem~~r 1992.  It is suggested that the RRP be based on the original RRP
which is at Annex 7 to the January 1990 SAR, and include the following:

0}     Scheduling the land acquisition for the five additional villages and
       updating the list of PAFs.
(2)    Clarifying the specific eligibility criteria for beneficiaries under the
       various schemes.
(3)    Expediting the economic rehabilitation schemes in those affected
       villages, where 30'7. and more of the agricultural !and is being
       submerged.
(4-)   Prepare work-plans for allotting house p~ots to the remaining PAFs.

1.11 Implementation Sta~~~ Sum~ar~. Overall, progress in providing civic
amenities (infrastructure.) in the new resettlement sites is being
achieved,albeit the original target completion date of 31 March 1992 has not
be-en realized. The recent practice of consolidating various civil works and
inviting tenders as per Bank's guidelines is proving very effective in
providing quality civic amenities to the PAFs and can be considered as a model
for other projects. However, the time schedule of the earlier RRP will not be
adhere~d to as only recently it has been decided to acquire structures and
houseu in 5 submerging villages.

 1.12 The Mission has been pleased to note new and innovative suggcations from
 the current R&R staff concerning the best ways to implement an effective
 economic rehabilitation program. One necessary condition for successful R&R
 is the preparation of tailor-made self-employment schemes, so as to meet the
                                                                      ANNEX _4_ ·-
                                                                      PDgc 6 of      1t,

PAF's felt needs.   It is only recently that the preliminary demand survey <by
seven rsurvey teama) han been otarted in right earnc!::t. Th<:.' ta::;k of
succesrsfully initiating Self-Employment Schemes and Borewell Irrigation will
be the major challenge of the coming months. It ia necessary that additional
support staff be provided and greater attention paid now to all outatanding
issueu.

1.11 CESS has started to re-orient its working and field exercises both in
form and content.   It has gained expertise in interpreting the perspective of
be.neficiaries and in getting greater role-clarity. However, there has been
much delay in bringing out the Half-Yearly Reports. This has undermined the
very purpose of the concurrent evaluation as it is important that GOAP
initiate action immediately on the various findings.

1.14 Progress was made on recommendations given by previous Bank Missions,
though not enough-perhaps due to staff changes and inadequate follow-up.
There is also a need to respond quickly to Bank's requests for clarification
and informat.ion.




2.01 Choice of relocation sites & PeQ~s Partj_£.ipa_tLon. All the new
resettlement sites are wit~in 2 kilomet~es of the old villages except for
Cha1krial. T~ere have been informal discussions l,./i th the PAFr; about the choice
for the new resettlement sites. No ~omplaints have been received about the
location of the new sites but it is recommended that the participation of the
PAFs in the decision making and choice of relocation site is further
encouraged. The October 1991 Hission had recommended formation of village-
level 1,./orking committees <Bank's letter dated 5th December 1991} and so far
compliance has not been made.

2.02 LaYout & PhYsic~_LE.1~n.!liDS· So far the normal erid type of layout has
been planned and on the 1,./hole PAFs are hnppy 1,./ith the wide ro.ads and the
location of the public buildings. Hol,./ever, it is rruggcl!.tod tbnt for tho
future villages, layouts planned in a cluster formation should be conclderrd
so that common space can be utilised to strengthen community ties.         In some
c.as.es it may be advisable to loc.ate the public buildings in such a •..;ay that
the' host community can also be benefited. This 1,./ill bring about social and
economic integration of the PAFu in the new environment.

2.03   tlouse Plots. Supervision mission No.4 (January 19921 has pointed out
the shortfall in the allotment of house plots in the ncl,./ cettloment sites and
the need to make arrangements to provide house plots to all the pending PAFs.
GOAP in its HUD G.O.Hs.No.297 H.A doted 2nd June 1989 has clearly decided that
atleast one house site for each of the PAFs irrespective of their financial
status be allotted and also that a minimum of 201. of extra sites are
                                                                       AtlNEY.   I,
                                                                       i't"f!" 7 r,f   Jl,

kept vacant for .future expansion. It ~ill also be nccer,snry to rermit chanzec
from one resettlement site to another so that PAFs can be reallotted in
village units, village section or families, in accordance ~ith their
preferences.

2.04- .Q.Qn!r~~.t1. M· The earli~r practice ~ns to invite tender!! from clar::::
2/class 3 contractors. Ho~ever, as they quoted much belo~ the estimated rate~
the work was often delayed and ~as of poor quality. Moreover, in nome caneD
the agreements could not be signed as the Bank guidelines had to be met.         In
December 1990 the civil works were consolidated and tenders ~ere invited and
the contracts were awarded in March/April 1991. At the same time a separate
engineering Sub-Division for quality control and monitoring ~as sot up. Thio
has resulted in quality civic amenities being made available to the PAFs
within a reasonable time and can be considered as a model for other projects
to emulate.

completed as on August end 1992. <December 1991 progress ~as 6 km and June
1992 was 33kms). 70t of the estimated cost has been incurred. There has been
a slippage of 3 to 6 months and out of 10 contracts, 4 ~ill be completed by
December 1992 and 6 by March 1993.

1993.

2.07 Drinking WaterS~. The work load ~as 66 bores ~ith hand pumps and
the achievement was 78 as on August 1992 <Progress ~as 75 in December 1991 and
75 in June 1992). For all 24 resettlement sites, it is reported thot hnnd-

2.08 p_r_g_tect;~d   Water fu!Eili. Qut of 24 resettlement sites, in 20 siton tho
bores have been      drilled and platforms are being constructed. However,

and delivery is      expected by September end 1992.

2.09 Irrigation borewells.    Against the total work load of 315 boron 94 han

very well in providing housing input to SCIST PAfc to build o houec of
approximately 30sqmts.  However, GOAP needs to clarify whether BC/OC PAFs from
economically weaker sections are eligible for this scheme.  It has been noted
that there has been a rather large increase in the number of beneficiaries.
Further increase may occur if some families who have shifted before March 1989
i.e., before the RRP was implemented, come back and seek their entitlement.

2.13 Social Int~Latioo.        Even in the planning of new resettlement
villages it is necessary to keep in the mind the carrying capacity of the new
area so that already scarce resources are not further shared so as to create
friction between the PAFs and the host villages.   For example if for
a new resettlement. site located in a no-source area, the water has to be
brought by pipe line from an existing well in the host village, the reduced
supply may create resentment amongst the host villages and prevent the social
integration. In such cases it is recommended that efforts are made to eecure
an independent source of water or to nharc some of tt.c community benefits with
the host villages.

2.14  ~biftiO!L...~.Jt<LII:_911~JL!3bec!~.  There ic no proviuion to transport the
household goods to the new resettlement siteu.          Some of the villages,
especially those which have moved to diutant sites have complained about tl1c
lack of assistance.       However, thiu i~ not a coriouc problem ond the majority
of the PAFs have already shifted.          In a few caaeo PAfs hnvo remained in the
old submerging villages and have agreed to shift once tl1o moncoonD nrc over or
are content to stay in the old village sitoc. Tho PAFo oopecially those from
the economically weaker sections have built their own transit shod using local
materials such as dry rice leaves, stems of various pulses and neem tree
branches.  Some of the PAFs have stayed in the transit sheds for as long as 3
years and after building tpeir pukka houses have used these transit sheds for
storage, rearing cattle or as kitchens.·

2.15   Maintert~nce a~g~9j_:c_~.  Even though GOAP is providing quality civic
amenities in each of th~ resettlement sites, the iscuo of maintenance and
repairs of the civic amenities and drinking water cchcmes ncedc to be examined
in detail by GOAP.    It is suggested that most of the civil worY. rcpnirr: be
don,e by the local Panchayata and GOAP could consider the ;:osr~ibility of
asa:isting these Panchayats by providing maintenance grants for 2 to 3 years.
It is envisaged that some of the PAFz interested in !:'elf !"mploymcnt achcrncr:,
could be trained to repair irrigation and drinking water borcwells and be
provided with necessary tools and kits so that they can generate sufficient
income from repairing pumps in the resettlement sites and neighbourin2
villages.

3.01 Qbjec!;ives. Self employment schemes and the irrigation bore<,.~ell ~>chemes
are envisaged to provide livelihood to those PAFs t,.~ho are nmoll nnd mnrginnl
f~rmors or t,.~ho llro l.nndl..-r:n. Th"' Hir.tdon notrd t·httt In NH'h of lhr
resettlement sites PAFs belonging to the economically <,.~eaker nections demanded
employment facilities as the existing <,.~ages were low <Rs.l2 to 15 and in some
cases as low as Rs.6). The number of landless PAFs is estimated to be 1124
and the population of SC/ST families is estimated to be 11522/248. Moreover,
the present practise of categorising the villages as fully affected and
partially effected is misleading. This it> because there aro eome villages
where the village site is not affected but more than 30t of the agricultural
land is being submerged. <In PAMPAD village, 567. of the agricultural land in
submerged and therefore could be considered as severely affected).

3.02 CESS <March 1989 report) h<l8 commented that lllndlears and other
agricultural labourers hardly received any compensation and are the <,.~orst hit
as the land on which they depend are subr11erged. CESS <October 1991
report) has aJso pointed out that land availability is a serious constraint
and this necessitates alternative non'-lapd based otrategies for come of tho
displaced families.  In mpst R&R projects it can be seen that successful
rehabilitation will only occur if (a) there are tailor-made schemes so that
they meet the individual requirements of PAFs, <b) implementing institution is
competent and motivated and (c) people's participation is encouraged in the
various stages of decision making. Economic rehabilitation package and the
absence of NCO's are difficulties which will make Economic Rehabilitation a
challenge to the R&R officials. Much ground work has already been done.
However it will be necessary to ensure that additional staff support is in
place at the earliest and the present survey of beneficiaricc ic completed on
top priority. The identification of resource inputs for fine tuning of the
various schemes will also be necessary. GOAP's response to the Bank'c letter
dated 5 December 1992, regarding replacement farmland for the erstwhile
marginal and small farmers is still awaited.

3.03 Employment Training.       At precent 184 PAFs out of 1238 PAFs, have been
given employment training. This is 1St of the total work load and at present
t-here. is no training programme being conducted. The duration of such training
is as long as one year. Moreover, unless such training is completed it may
not. be viable to embark on self employment schemes in a big way. District
Collector, Medak has proposed a Rural Technology Training Centre which will
provide training in appropriate rural technology to PAFs as well as persons
from neighbouring villages on dry land farming, training for rural
technicians, masonry, plumbing , seri-culture, bee-keeping, Jarm forestry etc.
Thin proposal is in lieu of the cold ~torage unit proposed earlier and has an
outlay of Rs.27.50 lakhs. This innovative idea of the District Collector has
been discussed with GOAPi and GOAP has agreed to examine the proposal at the
earliest.

3.04 Self Employment Schemes. This envisages that landless labourers will
chooGe occupations which is not bas~d on land, and will be able to improve,
                                                                                 Atlt!EX_,! __ _
                                                                                 Page 10 of Jt,

or atlcant regain the ctondnrd of liviri& which they l1ad prior to dioplo~cmcnt,
through the restoration of ~he economic productivity. At present the survey
is being carx:.ied out under 7 different teams to identify the demands for
various nchemos. There is a need to'wor.k out th~ economics of various schemes
and ensuring that all po~sible assistance from existing Government sources is
made available. The revised November 1990 RRP envisages different quantum of
grant depending on the scheme chosen by different PAFs.              It is normally
advisable to provide grant on an equitable basis and consider a lo~n component
for schemes requiring a higher initial investment. Different grant amounts
may also cause resentment among some PAFs. The horticulture schemes covering
750 beneficiaries at the first instance was to be completed by December 1992.
However, at present only 44 beneficiaries have been covered and the remaining
beneficiaries could possible be covered after the irrigation borewell scl•emec
are completed. Thus there is a need for dcvclo~ing linkages between the
employment training, self employment and irrigation borewell schemes. The
role of the different Government agencies at the district level is also not
c le<l'lr and this could be rectified in tl1(' ~ropo!l-ed rev i r::ed PP.P by <.:'nr::ur i ne tbnt
each such agency completes its workload in the stipulated time. U~ to Jlut
Aug1Jst 1992 only 176 out of the 4-100 b-eneficiaries have been covered. This is
just~ 47. achievement.


3.05 The Mission has examined the project report on Match Box Making complex
and observed that it will achieve break even point after the first year if 70~
of the efficiency is achieve. The Mission realises the im~ortance of
considering the above project as an em~loyment generating scheme as the profit
margin is extremely less. However with improved efficiency and assure
marketing, the project is likely to provide employment to l38 PAFG in the
first production society. The Mission noted that the building is already
completed and production can start once the e~cise license is obtained. The
Mission was made to understand that GOAP is taking appropriate action to
expedite the grant of license. In the meantime it could have been possible to
initiate other income generating schemes in the same premises such as
Agarbathi etc.

3.0& The Mission strongly recommends that GOAP issue instructions to
different district agencies, that Government developmental schemes (such as
IRDP, ICDS etc.) are extended to cover all the PAFs on a priority basis. This
will facilitate the early rehabilitation of PAFs belonging to the weaker
sections <Bank's letter dated 5 December 1991 ).

3.07   Irrigation Borewell. The issues raised in the Bank3 letter 5th December
1991 were discussed with the District Collector and HH\.lSSB and it was decided
thalt lift irrigation schemes will not b-e implemented and each irrigation
bor4~well will be sanctioned only after taking the appropriate permission of
the Government Hydro Geologist. In the field visit& it wae observed that a
large number of PAFs complained about the delay in starting the irrigation
bor4~We11 scheme. As stated earlier only 15 borewells have been energised and
only preliminary work has \:)een initiated to set up irrigation user£!.

associations so that internal -rift is avoided and the benefits arc shared
equitably amongst the eligible beneficiaries. The His~ion observed that there
are a number of Government Agencies such as APSC Co-operative Financial
Corporation which are engaged in installing minor irrigation projec~s and
which also look after the maintenance of the borewellz. If these agencies
cannot be made to implement the ~chemes for PAFs, nt leoet their c;{perir.nce
and expertise could be availed. ~crk Plan, as recommended by October J??l
Mission, is still net prepared and it is recommended that this is prepared by
October end 1992.



4.01 Coordination. The Bank in its letter dated 5th December 1991 has sought
clarification whether the State and District level committees were functioning
as envisaged. The Collector has clarified that as many as 19 meetings have
been held up to August 1992 at the District level. GOAP has agreed to
reactivate the state level committee and consider all pending issues and
provide support and guidance to district officials so that implementation can
be achieved as per schedule <Bank's letter dated 5 December 1991 ). At the
district level it is recommended that the monthly meetings scheduled for the
first Saturday of every month are expanded to include all R&R officialn,
officials from the irrigation department and the varlouz implementing agencies
and preferably include a rcprcGentation from CESS and atl0nct 2 PAFc.

4.02 Staffing.    At present there is little support staff available to the
rehabilitation officer opecially at one love! below. Looking to tho
specialized nature of the job and need for fr·equcnt touring it iz recommended
that 2 Tehsildars be provided to this unit to assist in implementing the self
employment schemes. GOAP has agreed to examine if additional resource input
can be made available to the R&R officials by seeking assistance from
Institutions engaged in Gocio-economic studieo <or by contracting out the
resource input) The resource input should also include agricultural extension
work.

4.03 Two computers are to be installed at Sangarcddy and it is recommended
that at least one computer is installed in the office of rehabilitation
officer <RO> so that data collection and data proce~sin& as well as
prepara,tion of monitoring reports can ,be dono oxpeditiou1dy.

4.04 Looking to tho specialized nature·of the jobs and lack of experience
especieklly among new officers, it ma,y be necessary to initiate •.wrk-shops at
the district level so that the new RRP tan be prepared with the involvement of
all the concerned institLtions including CESS and experience of similor
projects can be shared.

4.05 Y~hicle~.    Looking to the scattered nat~re of the resettlement sitoc
and the need to contact the PAFs on a regular basis it is recommended that at
least one additional jeep and possible two bo made available to the R&R staff.

These vehicles will be required for the 2 Tehsildan: and DEE Qunlity control.
The Bank had recommended provi~ion of motorbikes to extension workers <Bank's
lett-er dated 5th December 1991 ). Response of GOAP is still awaited.

4.06 Looking to the nature of the self employment schemes it would be
necessary it evolve a financial system which ensure that the grants are
readily available to the R&R staff whenever it is required. To ensure this it
is recommended that the present system be simplified and the unnecessary
stages deleted.

4.07 Happing. To be able to carry out micro planning at the village level,
maps showing the old and new sites, submergence area, proposed construction
and existing facilities in the villages need to be prepared. All such maps
will be useful in planning the different irrigation blocks and ensuring that
each resettlement site is covered by the Government health centres, FPS etc.

4.08 Audit and preparation of Accounts. Though 9 months are envisaged for
preparing the final accounts it is possible to substantially reduce this
duration by appointing an external accountant for finalising the accounts.
Past delays have been caused by inexperience staff and staff changes. This
issue was discussed by this Mission with GOAP, and HMWSSB has agreed to take
the necessary action.



5.01 Role of CESS. GOAP have now discussed with CESS about the inputs
required by them in the half yearly reports. CESS has agreed to emphasis the
social and economic aspects of R&R and will make special efforts to monitor
the standard of living of the PAFs so that it can be known whether they have
improved or atleast regained their standard of living. CESS has build up
sufficient expertise in interpreting the beneficiaries perspectives and
understanding the dynamics of R&R. CESS has also agreed not to concentrate on
the internal monitoring requirements of the R&R Officials, but to reorient its
working and field exercises both in form and in content. The Mission expects
CESS to play a more important role in the coming months in articulating the
PAFs preferences and expectations.  It is suggested that CESS keeps the family
as the unit in the data collection survey and not the household as initially
done. This Mission also suggests that CESS half yearly reports should be less
voluminous and more action-oriented. COAP is also requi~ed to furnish its
response to the contents and recommendations of the last M&E report.

 5.02 Inter__na_l_tjQDj_t;_Qx:._toLansi_J::y_aJJJiltton. The Bank in its lr:-ttor dated Sth
 De•cember 1991 has made 11 number of r~commendat ions re-gard i ne r-rogrNl!:'
 monitoring and reporting. The Mission noted that come of the information
 requested in its letter is not being reflected in the quarterly progreso
