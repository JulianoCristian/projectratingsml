Mr. V. S. Oberoi
Deputy Secretary

Government of India
Dear Mr. Oberoi,
INDIA:    Hyderabad Water Supply and Sanitation Project
          Changes to the Legal Agreements
     The purpose of this letter is to ask you to obtain such authority
as may be required to indicate the concurrence of the Government of
India, the Government of Andhra Pradesh and the Hyderabad Metro Water
Supply and Sewerage Board to certain changes to each of the Development
Credit Agreement, the Andhra Pradesh Agreement and the Project Agreement
respectively, as negotiated for the above project.  The need for these
changes arises from the delay in Board presentation, now planned for
March 27, 1990, from the date anticipated by all concerned at the time of
negotiations.  The changes proposed, as discussed with you, are indicated
below.
1.   Development Credit Agreement Section 2.07(a): This section now
reads:
     "(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) below, the Borrower shall
     repay the principal amount of the Credit in semi-annual
     installments payable on each January 15 and July 15 commencing
     January 15, 2000 and ending July 15, 2024.  Each installment to and
     including the installment payable on July 15, 2009 shall be one and
     one-fourth percent (1-1/4%) of such principal amount, and each
     installment thereafter shall be two and one-half percent (2-1/2%)
     of such principal amount."
We propose to change the three dates given in this section as follows:
     From January 15, 2000to  July 15, 2000
     From July 15, 2024       to   January 15, 2025
     From July 15, 2009       to   January 15, 2010
2.   Andhra Pradesh Agreement Section 2.10:  This section now reads:
     "Andhra Pradesh shall remit to the Board the arrears in payments in
     respect of standpost charges due from the Hyderabad Municipal
     Corporation to the Board, in five equal annual installments, the
     first installment to be remitted not later than March 31, 1990."
We propose to change the date given in this section from March 31, 1990
to June 30, 1990.
3.   Project Agreement Section 4.03:  This section now reads:
     "The Board shall, not later than March 31, 1990, establish and,
     thereafter, levy a sewerage service charge as a surcharge of not
     less than twenty percent on charges for water service, to be
     payable by all water consumers who are served by a private water
     connection and whose property abuts a street at a point along its
     length at which a public sanitary sewer is provided."
As discussed, we will change the date given in this section from March
31, 1990, to September 30, 1990.
4.   Project Agreement Section 6.01:  We need a cable address for the
Hyderabad Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) to complete this
section.  We would also appreciate confirmation of HMWSSB's telex no. 953
425-6325.
