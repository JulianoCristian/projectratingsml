"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project ratings gave mixed results, for\n            although the project outcome is satisfactory, sustainability\n            is unlikely, and institutional development impacts are only\n            modest; similarly, while the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, the Borrower's performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory. Project experience provides several lessons.\n            1) Project preparation should ensure buy-in by all\n            stakeholders, and provide appropriate incentives for\n            behavior change in project implementation: much effort was\n            expended during implementation to explain project reforms to\n            the municipal authorities and get their acceptance, and, the\n            Government was, and remains, reluctant to accept delegated\n            contract management, despite proof of its effectiveness\n            during the project. 2) Institutional strengthening measures\n            should be tied to a specific investment activity to enhance\n            learning by doing, and prove the applicability of the tool\n            or skill being transferred. The resource mobilization\n            component of the project, and training, were not directly\n            linked to improved investment and/or maintenance. Such a\n            linkage would have provided incentives, and a practical\n            opportunity to utilize newly acquired skills. 3) The\n            promotion of small and medium enterprise (SME) development\n            requires provision of practical, and theoretical training\n            for enterprises and engineering offices early on, and\n            continued efforts towards advanced training throughout the\n            project: SMEs involved in the project encountered\n            difficulties in drawing up their bids, and in carrying out\n            the work. 4) Community development activities must be\n            accompanied by timely support, with provisions made for\n            regular awareness-raising actions, and a financial\n            motivation in this area. Further lessons address the need\n            for adequate assessment of counterpart funding capacity; to\n            support decentralization, even in a centralized governance\n            structure, by involving local governments in project design,\n            and implementation, creating a link between local\n            communities and local government; and, the use of outside\n            implementing agencies, should not substitute, nor detract\n            from the necessary, concomitant strengthening of government institutions."}, "docdt": "2003-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
