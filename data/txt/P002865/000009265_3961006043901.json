through: a) the execution of\n            priority urban works having optimal impact on the employment\n            and incomes of the poor; b) the promotion of small\n            contractors in the construction sector; and c) the active\n            participation of local residents, community groups, and\n            non-governmental organizations in neighborhood environmental\n            improvement activities. The longer term objectives are to:\n            a) strengthen the ability of local Government to administer\n            the city; b) lay the groundwork for innovations needed to\n            reform the management of urban development in Togo; c) bring\n            about progressive and permanent improvement in urban\n            environmental management; and d) contribute to urban poverty\n            alleviation. The project consists of: 1) a city-wide program\n            to improve transport and traffic conditions; 2) a program to\n            improve environmental and sanitary conditions of the Be\n            lagoon and its surrounding neighborhoods; 3) a program to\n            support community development and the execution of community\n            works in the Be area; and 4) a program to promote\n            institution and capacity building in the area of urban management."}, "docdt": "1994-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
