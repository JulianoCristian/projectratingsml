enhance the performance and effectiveness of priority\n            research programs and of scientists in responding to the\n            technological needs of farmers; and iii) develop models that\n            improve the effectiveness and financial sustainability of\n            the technology dissemination system with greater\n            accountability to, and participation by, the farming\n            communities.  The project components are: 1) Development of\n            the ICAR's organization and management systems; 2)\n            Support for agro-ecosystems research through sponsored and\n            competitive grants program; and 3) Support for pilot program\n            to test support for innovations in technology dissemination."}, "docdt": "1998-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
