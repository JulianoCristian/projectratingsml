Lessons cited included: Decentralizing control\n            in a research organization increases efficiency providing it\n            is accompanied by systems of accountability. Organizational\n            and management changes should be introduced with a clear\n            communication strategy and guidelines for their\n            implementation. For public-private partnerships to flourish\n            in research and development, an enabling environment,\n            private sector participation in project design and\n            implementation, and broad dissemination of success stories,\n            are important. Linkages between research and extension need\n            to be strengthened and flexibly linked with private sector\n            marketing networks. Research impact can be accelerated by\n            consolidating participatory research skills and focusing\n            more resources on training of researchers and extension\n            workers.  Monitoring and evaluation, and impact assessment\n            is best outsourced to external agencies, and project design\n            should focus more on reflection and impact assessment than\n            action. Regarding flexibility and accountability in\n            extension funding, one key factor that contributed directly\n            to the success of the ATMA model was to shift\n            decision-making responsibility for program planning to those\n            people who were responsible for program delivery.\n            Convergence of line departments is needed to increase the\n            cost-effectiveness of extension. A fundamental limitation in\n            the current extension system is the distribution of free\n            inputs and services to farmers. This creates a dependency\n            relationship on government and many farmers look to\n            extension for a \"hand-out\" rather than as a\n            reliable source of technology and information."}, "docdt": "2005-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
