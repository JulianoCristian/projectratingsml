environment\n            for financial intermediation and financial access, and\n            increase private participation in the provision of financial\n            services, through a strengthened bank and non-bank financial\n            system. This operation supports the government's second\n            generation Financial Sector Reform Program (2009-2012),\n            aimed at building a financial system that is more inclusive,\n            competitive and effective in financial intermediation. This,\n            in turn, will contribute to the sustained growth of the\n            Egyptian economy and combat the adverse consequences of the\n            global economic crisis. The operation is aligned with the\n            strategic objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)."}, "docdt": "2010-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
