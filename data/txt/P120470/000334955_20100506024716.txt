Operation Type          A single-tranche Development Policy Loan (DPL)
Main Policy Areas       The operation would support policy reforms in the following areas: (i) financial and operational restructuring
                        of state-owned banks; (ii) strengthening the regulatory and supervisory architecture of the banking sector;
                        (iii) reforming the non-bank financial sector; (iv) strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework of
                        the non-bank financial sector; and (v) improving the financial institutional infrastructure.
Key Expected Outcomes    Profitability and efficiency indicators of state-owned banks on par with leading private banks, with
and Indicators             widened access to finance through bank branch networks (decline in NPLs-to-total loans, improvement in
                           coverage ratio, and decline in SOEs' NPLs)
                         Progress in building a credible, risk-based regulatory and supervisory framework for banks (banks adopt
                           the Basel II framework, and publication of a Financial Stability Report)
                         Progress in developing the non-bank financial sector, evident in improved performance, transparency, and
                           access indicators (gross non life premium to GDP, and increase in new bond issues)
                         Strengthened regulatory and supervisory framework for the non-bank financial sector, providing a basis for
                           expanded access to financial services (microfinance, leasing, and factoring companies licensed)
                         Improved financial infrastructure and legal framework , supporting the expansion of access to finance
                           (individuals receiving government payments through financial institutions, and mobile phone payments
                           transactions)
Program Development     The main objective of the operation is to assist Egyptian authorities in further developing the enabling
Objectives and          environment for financial intermediation and financial access, and increase private participation in the
Contribution to CAS     provision of financial services, through a strengthened bank and non-bank financial system. This operation
                        supports the government's second generation Financial Sector Reform Program (2009­2012), aimed at
                        building a financial system that is more inclusive, competitive and effective in financial intermediation. This,
                        in turn, will contribute to the sustained growth of the Egyptian economy and combat the adverse
                        consequences of the global economic crisis. The operation is aligned with the strategic objectives of the
                        Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
Risks and Risks         Potential risks associated with the Financial Sector Reform Program and the proposed operation can be
Mitigation              divided into: (i) country risks, including political risk, stakeholders' opposition, and fiscal sustainability; and
                        (ii) operational risks, including governance issues associated with restructuring and recapitalizing state-
                        owned banks, and the possible non-sustainability and reversibility of the reform program. Measures to
                        mitigate such risks have been considered under the reform program supported by this operation. While any
                        potential change in government may delay the implementation the reform program has been cemented to the
                        fabric of the sector with very specific measures taken to ensure irreversibility. With regards to fiscal costs of
                        the reform program, settlement of the remaining outstanding NPLs of SOEs owed to the state-owned banks
                        would not have fiscal implications as it is done through a debt-asset (mainly land) swap. Moreover, the risk
                        of retaining a financial institution in public hands would be mitigated through further strengthening the
                        credible and independent regulatory authorities, which is part of the reform program supported by this
                        operation.

I.       INTRODUCTION
1.      Egypt has made substantial progress in the development of its financial sector. The
reformist cabinet, that took office in July 2004, set a major agenda of macroeconomic and
structural reforms. An integral component of this comprehensive reform program was a
financial sector reform program that was endorsed by the President in September 2004. This
program aimed at increasing private sector participation, diversifying intermediaries and
saving instruments, and attaining a more efficient and sound financial sector, that can, in the
medium term, contribute to sustained economic growth, poverty reduction, and overall
prosperity for Egypt. It represents one of the most far-reaching and comprehensive reforms to
have been launched in Egypt and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
2.      The first generation of the Financial Sector Reform Program (2004­2008) focused on
attaining financial stability and soundness. For the first time in recent history, the banking
sector is now majority-owned by the private sector and open to competition--through the
privatization of the fourth largest state-owned bank, divestiture of public shares in joint
venture banks, the consolidation of the sector through mergers and acquisitions of small and
weak banks, and the operational, institutional and financial restructuring of the remaining
commercial state-owned banks. The reforms led to a substantial strengthening of the banks'
balance sheets which was validated by the bank system's resiliency throughout the global
crisis and an improvement in returns on capital and assets.
3.       Achievements were not limited to the banking sector, as non-bank financial
institutions (NBFIs) also saw some developments. The state-owned insurance companies
underwent a comprehensive restructuring program and the third party motor vehicle books
improved financially. Both the private pension and the capital market sector were also the
subject of a variety of reforms that enhanced their overall performance and efficiency. All
these reforms were accompanied by major improvements of the legal framework and
institutional financial infrastructure. This was achieved through establishing a private credit
bureau, developing the payments system, and creating specialized economic courts with
judges trained in economic issues. All this was underpinned by a strengthening of the
financial sector's regulatory and supervisory authorities.
4.      First generation reforms opened the way to increases in access to finance, but from a
very low base. Between 2006 and 2009, the number of deposit accounts grew by 15 percent,
and the number of loans by 165 percent. Despite progress made in the first generation
reforms, access to finance in Egypt lags behind other emerging economies, as related to Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (see Annex 13 for a more detailed access to finance
analysis). Credit to the private sector in Egypt remains very concentrated on the largest and
well-established enterprises. The central bank estimates that only 6.7 percent of total bank
credit goes to micro, small and medium enterprises. Banks are increasingly investing in
treasury bills and government bonds. The 2009 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) found
that only 13.4 percent of firms have loans, while small firms have the least access.1 Access is

even more constrained for microenterprises. Moreover, non-bank financial institutions play a
limited role in financial intermediation.
5.      In response, the second generation reforms (2009­2012) focus on improving financial
intermediation and access to finance with the objective of building a more diversified and
inclusive financial system. The aim is to develop a system capable of providing a broader
range of financial services to a wide range of clients while managing risks effectively.
Reforms envisioned to further strengthen the banking system include continuing the
operational and financial restructuring of state-owned commercial and specialized banks;
settling the remaining non-performing loans (NPLs) of state-owned enterprises (SOEs);
providing adequate provisioning for any outstanding NPLs; as well as scaling up banker-
training focused on serving small and medium enterprises (SMEs). These reforms will create
a banking sector that will be well-placed to provide access to a broad set of financial services
especially in underserved areas.
6.      Reforms in the non-bank sector encompass a wide range of initiatives including
reforming the insurance and pensions sector; increasing the efficiency of the capital market;
setting the regulatory framework for microfinance; financial leasing and factoring; fostering
the development of micro-insurance; and developing a sustainable banc-assurance model to
enhance access to insurance products. The program is underpinned by the strengthening of the
regulatory and supervisory framework as well as developing the institutional infrastructure
needed to lower the cost and risk of expanding access to financial services. Such a framework
would enhance branchless banking through mobile phone payments and extend financial
access to recipients of salaries and pensions through basic banks accounts and debit cards.
7.      The government's achievements under the first generation reforms supported by the
Bank are sufficiently encouraging for the Bank to prepare a follow-up operation in response
to their request of February 3, 2010. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Country
Assistance Evaluation (1999-2007) indicated that the financial sector reform supported by the
Bank has been highly satisfactory.2 In this context, the proposed Developmental Policy Loan
(DPL) of US$ 500 million would support the authorities in the implementation of the second
generation reforms, and would partially fund the costs of the reform program. Supporting the
government in completing these reforms will provide major benefits to Egypt, and will ensure
the irreversibility and sustainability of the comprehensive reform program. The proposed
operation is consistent with the strategic objectives of the 2008 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) Progress Report and is aligned with the Bank Group's 2007 Strategy for the Financial
Sector, which emphasizes the use of Bank policy-based lending in support of market reform
and the strengthening and expansion of access.
8.      The Bank has been supporting the government's ambitious reform program over the
past five years. The main pillars of the program were largely based on the recommendations
put forward in the 2002 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), the 2007 FSAP
Update, and the 2008 Access to Finance and Economic Growth in Egypt. A strong partnership
was established based on effective policy dialogue and technical assistance through various
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) initiatives, and DPLs I and II to support
the implementation of the first generation reforms. The 2009 IEG report documents the
substantial progress in the Financial Sector Reform Program in Egypt and commends the key
role the Bank played in supporting the program.

II.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

A.     RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

9.      Over the last five years the government has implemented structural reforms, including
trade liberalization, an overhaul of the tax system, and restructuring of the financial sector.
This led to a friendlier investment climate which, supported by a favorable global economic
environment, yielded a strong private-sector supply response. Real GDP growth increased
from an average of 3.5 percent during FY01-04 to around 7 percent between FY06 and FY08
(see Table 1). Moreover, for the fourth year, Egypt has been ranked among the "Top 10"
reformers in the Doing Business Report for 2010.
10.    In late 2008 the global financial crisis and the ensuing economic slowdown changed
the supportive external conditions for growth. However, Egypt's relatively unleveraged
banking sector was little affected by the financial shock, as a result of the first generation
financial sector reforms that resolved NPLs, raised provisioning, and improved regulation and
supervision. The banking system has remained largely liquid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of
52 percent in FY09. Moreover, the banking sector has had only a limited exposure to troubled
financial institutions or to risk derived from the financial innovation and unmonitored risk-
taking of intermediaries in developed economies.
11.      In contrast, the real sector of the economy suffered from a slowing aggregate external
demand and the retrenchment in foreign direct investment (FDI). In FY09, real GDP growth
declined to 4.7 percent, from 7.2 percent in FY08. In the first semester of FY10, growth
inched upward to 4.8 percent, and is expected to be about 5 percent for the full year. At the
same time, in FY09 the unemployment rate increased to 9.2 percent from 8.2 percent at the
end of FY08. The current account registered a deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP, following a fall
in service receipts (from 16.7 percent in FY08 to 12.6 percent of GDP in FY09) and a slight
fall in remittances (from 5.3 to 4.4 percent of GDP). Nonetheless, the latest current account
outturn has registered a surplus of US$ 0.2 billion. FDI, another important source of foreign
exchange, dropped by 3.9 percentage points of GDP over the same period. Portfolio
investment outflow was relatively rapid during the first half of FY09 (3.9 percent of GDP),
but eased in the second half (1 percent of GDP). By the first semester of FY10, capital
inflows had resumed a level moderately above the same period of the year before.
12.     Consequently, official international reserves declined by almost US$ 3.2 billion in
FY09, to US$ 31.3 billion in June 2009. The decline in international liquidity during the
crisis was compounded by the loss of foreign currency deposits of the central bank in
commercial banks (not computed officially as international reserves) by almost US$ 10
billion over the same period. Both effects add up to a total decline in international liquidity of
US$ 14 billion in FY09. Since June 2009 international reserves have increased to US$ 34.3
billion at the end of February 2010. The Egyptian pound (LE) depreciated by 5.7 percent
between September 2008 and March 2009, when it stabilized and reversed its trend to reach
LE 5.47/US$ in mid-February 2010, close to its level a year ago.
13.     This limited exchange-rate flexibility contrasts with adjustment in other emerging
markets with fully operational and transparent monetary policy rules, such as Brazil or
Mexico, where international liquidity of the central bank remained stable but the exchange
rate acted as a buffer to mitigate international shocks. As Egypt advances in its monetary
management, it is expected that the exchange rate will better reflect the interplay of market
forces. This is especially important in case adverse external shocks reoccur in the future.
                                                           -4-

Given the limited liability-dollarization adjustment would be more effective if the exchange
rate, like any other price, reflected scarcity more accurately.
14.     In response to the global crisis, the government adopted fiscal and monetary stimulus
measures and postponed some key fiscal reforms. The government initially adopted a LE 15
billion (US$ 2.7 billion or 1.4 percent of GDP) temporary fiscal-stimulus program to support
economic growth in FY09. The package consisted of: LE 10.5 billion to accelerate
infrastructure investment projects; LE 2.8 billion in export subsidies; and LE 1.5­1.7 billion
in lower tariffs on imported intermediate and capital goods. To maintain the growth
momentum, the government included an additional LE 8 billion to continue the infrastructure
projects of the first fiscal-stimulus package. Additionally, the Parliament approved additional
infrastructure public spending of LE 10 billion as a third fiscal-stimulus package. The second
and third stimulus packages added up to 1.5 percent of GDP. In addition, the government
planned for another LE 15 billion in investments in infrastructure, but to be funded through
public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements.3 Consequently, the overall fiscal deficit is
expected to reach 8.4 percent of GDP in FY10.
15.    The government also temporarily suspended major fiscal reforms: the energy-subsidy
phase-out plan for energy-intensive industrial users, the introduction of a property tax, and
expanding the coverage of the sales tax. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE)
provided a monetary stimulus, easing monetary policy by cutting the overnight lending rate
and overnight deposit rate six times between February and September 2009 (by a cumulative
325 bps and 375 bps, respectively). Moreover, the discount rate was cut by 250 bps by the
end of 2009. To facilitate finance to SMEs, the CBE eased reserve requirements for
commercial banks by waiving the 14 percent reserve requirement on loans to SMEs, and
Egypt's two largest state-owned banks launched a LE 10 billion retail banking initiative to
stimulate private household consumption.
16.     The government's initial fiscal response to the external shock was possible because of
the fiscal consolidation achieved in previous years. Fiscal reforms starting June 2005 had
contributed to reducing the overall general government4 budget deficit by 2.2 percentage
points to 7.0 percent of GDP by the end of FY09. The reduction, however, was lower than
originally planned, mainly because of rising public spending in subsidies during FY08 to
accommodate increases in food and fuel subsidies.5 In spite of the above, Egypt's fiscal
position in 2010 compared to the year prior to the crisis shows an increase of the fiscal deficit
of 1.5 percentage points of GDP, significantly lower than the 4.7 percentage points average
for emerging economies across the world.6
17.     The effect of the global crisis on Egyptian growth was not as large as originally
expected, or of the magnitude as experienced in some countries in Europe, Latin America, or
East Asia. A number of factors contributed to this: (i) the current account was balanced before
the crisis, limiting the need for external funding; (ii) the Egyptian economy is diversified in
terms of destinations of exports and sources of FDI; (iii) the Egyptian financial sector is not
well integrated into the global financial system; (iv) private investment is still relatively
small; and (v) the construction sector has proven resilient, due to the tendency of people in a

B.          MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK

18.      The government faces the challenge of managing a large fiscal deficit and a sizeable
public debt stock, in an uncertain global environment and with a still-underdeveloped
domestic capital market. Egypt's medium-term economic prospects, stabilization challenges
and debt sustainability analysis, show that macroeconomic risks are manageable, and that
authorities have adopted, in the Bank's staff view, prudent risk mitigation measures even
though the political cycle gives limited head room to maneuver should volatility increase due
to unexpected shocks. Real GDP growth is expected to recover in tandem with the rest of the
world, particularly in the United States and in Europe. GDP grew 4.7 percent in FY09 and it
is projected to increase by around 5 percent in FY10. Assuming that the global economy will
continue gradual recovery in 2010, Egyptian growth should stabilize around 6.0 percent, close
to its potential growth rate, starting FY12.
19.     The current account is expected to gradually attain balance in the medium term, after
registering a deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP in FY09. Due to the growth slowdown, imports are
contracting in FY10, and hence the trade deficit is narrowing. Consequently, we expect the
current account deficit to reduce marginally this year (Table 1). Afterward, as the global
economy picks up, Egyptian merchandise exports are expected to increase, as will
merchandise imports, widening again the trade deficit. However, the services and remittances
accounts will gradually return to their historical behavior and the current account deficit is
expected to decline gradually over the forecasting horizon. International reserves are
projected to increase in US dollars (from US$31.3 billion in FY09 to US$44 billion in FY14),
but will decline in terms of months of imports of goods and non-factor services (from 6
months to about 4, over the same period). However, these reserves will remain fully able to
cover any potential short-term foreign currency drainage. The level of the foreign debt is
projected to decline as a share of GDP, but increase in terms of volume.
20.     One of the main negative effects of the global crisis has been, so far, on the capital
account of the balance of payments. Not only has the magnitude of the capital inflow
diminished, but its composition has changed. FDI fell from a peak of US $12 billion, or 7.5
percent of GDP, in 2008, to around US$ 6.5 billion, or 3.6 percent of GDP in FY09. This
year, we expect this capital flow to remain around that level due to the Dubai World debt
restructuring and the continued volatility in the financial markets as a result of the sovereign
debt problems in the other side of the Mediterranean. Portfolio investment inflows, however,
have increased recently, after registering a US$10 billion net outflow in FY09. Portfolio
flows are more volatile than foreign direct investment, and, hence, entail higher risk. We
expect both types of flows to increase as the global environment continues stabilizing in the
medium term, and to return to the magnitudes and composition registered by before the crisis
by FY12. However, normalizing external capital markets might not be sufficient for FDI to
return in the desired magnitudes, as investors require a stable and predictable domestic-policy
environment. Hence, to support adequate external financing of productive investment, it is
important to return to the long-run growth agenda the n government has followed since 2005.
21.    In spite of a downward trend in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation starting
September 2008, Egypt's inflation remained in the double-digit range7 for most of FY09. In
the medium term, we expect inflation to gradually decline to around six percent by the end of
the projection period. This is based on the assumptions that global commodity prices will

                                                          22.      Notwithstanding       the     expected
                                                          downward trend in inflation, the government
                                                          still faces the challenge of high inflation
                                                          volatility. The core inflation index, which
                                                          removes the effect of the most volatile items
                                                          such as fruits and vegetables, as well as some
                                                          administered prices, shows significant
                                                          oscillation: currently it stands at seven
                                                          percent, while at the end of 2008 it was over
                                                          20 percent. This volatility reflects underlying
                                                          structural problems such as the lack of
                                                          domestic competition in the goods markets,
                                                          and lack of mobility of goods and factors
                                                          across the country. Volatility of inflation
                                                          could also reflect the inability of some agents

  calculations.                                           plans because of lack of access to financial
services. This operation supports policies that will facilitate financial development and
diversification of instruments for firms and households to hedge these risks in a more efficient
way.
23.      The crisis and the government's response changed the balance sheets of the central
bank and the banking sector in important ways. These changes are relevant for both anti-
inflationary policy and financing of the private sector in the future. From the central bank's
perspective, to the extent that capital flows remain subdued and the exchange rate is allowed
more flexibility, it means that the driver of changes in the monetary base will be domestic
credit rather than changes in the central bank's foreign assets. With international reserves
stabilized, monetary growth has picked up.
24.     The balance sheet of the banking sector has also changed, reflecting a potentially
imperiled financing situation of the private sector in the future. The composition of domestic
credit of the banking sector (Figure 1) shows that, by December 2009 the government's share
had increased to 44 percent of total domestic credit, after reaching a low of 30 percent in June
2008. This was the result of both a subdued demand for credit from the private sector, and
increased demand for funding from the government. Though the current loans-to-deposit ratio
indicates there is ample liquidity in the system, the excess liquidity is being used by
commercial banks to increase their holdings of government securities. Further concentration
of bank portfolios on government securities might imperil financing of the private sector as
the economy recovers from the external shock. Though it is not uncommon in emerging
markets for banks to hold relatively high portions of domestic public debt, as discussed later
on, international experience shows that the potential growth impact of fiscal policy diminishes
as the share of public debt held by commercial banks increases.8

25.      The fact that bank credit to the private business sector has fallen recently as a share of
total bank credit needs several qualifications that lead us to believe that it is not a structural
problem. First, the behavior of credit has an important cyclical, and hence transitory,
component as it's due to the activity slowdown since 2008. Lending to the private business
sector is directly related with investment, and there is a long run relationship between both
variables. As investment grew during the boom years, so did credit to private business sector
(Figure 2). As a result of the crisis, private investment fell by about 4 to 5 percentage points
of GDP. Hence, demand for credit should naturally fall, though it is expected to return to its
predicted long-run trend.          Second,            Figure 2: Fluctuations of Real Bank Lending to the
Egypt's level of credit to the private                Private Business Sector around a Long-run Trend*

26.     Given the observed GDP growth
slowdown and the pro-cyclical nature of tax revenues and interest payments, the government
will be unable to meet its target of cutting the fiscal deficit by 1 percent of GDP per annum
before FY12. Our public-debt simulations, described in detail in the next section, assume that
the primary deficit for the general government, currently exceeding 3 percent of GDP, will
start declining very gradually in FY11 and reach a primary surplus of 2 percent of GDP only
by 2016.10 The government submitted to Congress the draft budget law for FY11, which
estimates a small deficit reduction of 0.5 percent of GDP, which is a prudent exit from the
crisis-related intervention, so as to ensure that recovery from the external shock is not
jeopardized.
27.     The cabinet approved a fundamental pension reform that will result in substantial
savings. This reform will enhance the government's long-run solvency position by reducing
the buildup of contingent liabilities, and hence it deserves full support. However, in the short
run it will not mitigate the government's financing requirements. Improvement in the fiscal
stance is necessary in the medium term for the government to generate the domestic saving
needed to finance productive private investment.

  The Government's plan targets the overall fiscal balance, and the announced target is an overall deficit of 3 percent of
GDP to be attained in 2015, down from 8.4 percent programmed for this fiscal year. An overall fiscal deficit of 3 percent of
GDP is consistent with a primary surplus of 2 percent of GDP, given the projected path of interest payments.

28.      In addition to controlling the pressure on domestic saving, public finances can affect
savings mobilization through the debt-management strategy; in fact, this strategy is an
integral element of a broader strategy to develop capital markets in Egypt. This will enable
public-debt managers to extend maturities and diversify the base of debt holders. Of the total
public debt, 76 percent is domestic and 24 percent is external. Within the domestic debt, the
marketable component (T-bills and T-bonds) has increased from 69 percent of gross
consolidated government domestic debt in June 2008 to 76 percent in September 2009.

29.     This progress is welcomed and allows more market determination in public-debt
prices. However, the marketable debt is relatively short term, and holding is concentrated in
banks. In terms of maturity, the T-bills' relative importance within the marketable portfolio
has been increasing, reaching 52 percent of total marketable securities by September 2009,
compared to 34 percent in June 2007. In terms of the investor base, in September 2009, public
banks held 49 percent of outstanding T-bills, up from 36 percent in 2007 (all banks ­ public
and private ­ hold 88 percent of outstanding T-bills, up from 63 percent in 2007).
Diversification of the public-debt investor base is essential to reduce rollover and
concentration risk. High levels of bank holdings of public debt are not uncommon in
emerging markets. For instance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reports that about 40
percent of domestic public debt is held by banks.11 In Brazil, where banks are allowed to
compute part of their debt holdings as reserve requirements, this proportion reaches about 50
percent of total T-bill holdings. Policies supported by this operation, such as the development
of private pension funds, regulation of mutual funds, and the activation of the corporate bond
market, as well as the planned pension reform that will establish individual retirement
accounts, should contribute to achieving this long-run objective.
30.     Overall, reform policies adopted over the last five years have contributed to a more
flexible and diversified economic structure. Consequently, indicators of vulnerability (Table
2) reflect the increased flexibility to accommodate the external shocks. However, a potential
source of vulnerability is the fall in national savings, which is reflected in the increased

C.              DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

32.     During the past few years, the public-debt-to-GDP ratio has declined significantly as a
result of high GDP growth rates that exceeded the real interest rate. Similarly, the real
exchange rate has appreciated since 2005, making the dollar-denominated debt less onerous in
terms of domestic product. In our projections, Egypt's debt outlook remains robust under
various sensitivity tests. The baseline case of our simulations shows that, over the next two
years, the fall in the public-debt ratio will slow due to a combination of factors: (i) the growth
slowdown expected to last until 2011; (ii) the delay in the fiscal consolidation program due to
the global crisis; (iii) slowdowns in the nominal appreciation of the Egyptian pound due to
subdued capital inflows and reduced demand for Egyptian exports; and (iv) higher
international cost of financing debt roll-overs. Improvement in the debt indicators is expected
to continue after 2012, when GDP growth should stabilize at a higher plateau. Under the
baseline scenario net overall public debt declines to about 50 percent of GDP in FY15 (Figure
                                                          - 11 -

over 80 percent of the public debt is in domestic
currency. The primary deficit is assumed to
decline gradually until it reaches the surplus level targeted by the government though we
assume this will happen only in 2017. Our fiscal projections assume a slightly slower
adjustment of the primary fiscal deficit than the government's plan, especially in 2011 and
2012, owing to the effect of the political cycle in the budget management.13 The primary
balance is a policy variable that can be adjusted depending on the medium-term fiscal
framework adopted by the government. In the other scenarios described below, this policy
instrument adopts different values, with a corresponding impact on the debt level.

34.     In addition to the baseline case, which the team attributes to a subjective high
probability of occurrence (60 to 70 percent), we included two extreme cases to examine the
sensitivity of the projected debt path to alternative configurations of growth, depreciation,
inflation, and interest rates. Egypt's debt dynamics are vulnerable to a combination of
negative shocks, as illustrated in the "negative-shock scenario" in Figure 5. On the other
hand, the "positive-shock scenario," which is the least likely (5 to 10 percent probability of
occurrence), reflects the favorable conditions prior to the international crisis. While the debt-
to-GDP ratio increases in the first case, it decreases rapidly in the second one. The main
assumptions of each of the scenarios are described in Annex 14.
35.     Summing up, and as required by OP 8.60, our analysis indicates that macroeconomic
risks are manageable within the existing policy framework. However, in the short term the
growth slowdown, the volatile international liquidity environment, and lower inflation tax

13
   At the time of writing this document, the Government presented to Parliament the draft budget law that includes a
reduction of half a percentage point reduction in the overall deficit, similar to the one incorporated in our baseline case.
                                                         - 12 -

resources will exert pressure on the debt-to-GDP ratio, while the political cycle will impose
limits on the room for maneuverability. To mitigate risks arising from this environment, the
government already announced a fiscal adjustment program of reducing the deficit by five
percentage points of GDP over the next five years. The government presented to Parliament a
draft budget law for FY11 with a reduction of half a percentage point of GDP, indicating the
policy direction. Though a more front-loaded consolidation program could have had benefits
in reduction of interest costs, the government's choice indicates its preference to ensure that
recovery from the crisis would be self-sustained.

III.     THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM

A.       OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR PRIOR TO THE REFORMS

36.     The main elements of the Egyptian financial system are a deep and well-diversified
banking system, a sizable stock exchange, and a relatively small insurance, mutual fund and
contractual savings sector. Ancillary financial firms such as stock brokerages, specialized
non-depository lenders (including leasing companies and micro-finance lenders) and rating
agencies are present, but remain rather undeveloped. It is the banking sector that dominates
the overall financial system, as banks account for 130 percent of GDP and 95 percent of
financial sector assets. Promote the growth of non-bank institutions is importing in ensuring a
more balanced financial sector, capable of performing all the intermediation functions and
diversifying risks, and a solid domestic institutional investor base that contributes to the
sound development of securities markets.
37.     Egypt's financial system has historically been dominated by the banking sector, with
the state playing a large role in banks. At the start of the reform program in 2004, the banking
system had 57 banks, of which seven were state-owned, namely, the four largest commercial
banks--National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, Banque du Caire, and Bank of Alexandria;
and three specialized banks--Egyptian Arab Land Bank (EALB), Industrial Development
Bank of Egypt (IDB), and the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit
(PBDAC). In addition, the state also owned substantial shares in 23 joint-venture banks that
accounted for around 20 percent of the system's deposits and assets. Although bank assets
and deposits were large, large public sector deficits and debt, pervasive state ownership of
financial institutions, heavy intervention in money markets, weak creditor rights, a
compliance-based regulatory and supervisory framework, resulted in relatively low and
unproductive credit, negligible competition and innovation, and the emergence of a large
stock of NPLs mainly in the state-owned banks.
38.     Prior to the reforms, specialized banks operated in an ambiguous policy framework--
financial institutions versus development agencies. Specialized banks accounted for about six
percent of Egypt's bank deposits and about 45 percent of Egypt's branch network (with
PBDAC accounting for almost all of these). The three banks were used to channel subsidies
to agriculture, housing (to both developers and households), and SMEs, through both ceilings
on interest rates and non-recovery of principal.14 All three specialized banks were
significantly overstaffed, even when taking into account the small size of its individual
deposits and loans. In addition to its banking activities, PBDAC was an implementing agency
for the import, distribution and marketing of inputs and products, and crop purchase for the
Ministry of Agriculture.

14
   The subsidies were covered by injections of government funds from time to time, and external loans that were repaid by
the government.
                                                          - 13 -

39.     Egypt's non-bank sector was very small and underdeveloped before the launch of the
program. The insurance sector's assets accounted for less than three percent of GDP in 2004.
Although the sector was opened to foreign competition in 1998, the absence of appropriate
regulation, the necessary capacity building and the presence of a dysfunctional state-owned
insurance sector, these reforms yielded limited benefits. The private pension sector was also
small, with assets of less than three percent of GDP. Private pension funds were mainly
voluntary occupational schemes primarily covering public sector workers and operating on a
defined benefit (DB) basis with weak governance, regulation and supervision. Financial
leasing was underdeveloped15 - hampered by an unsupportive institutional environment - and
investment fund assets were negligible. The limited size of these non-bank intermediaries
contributed to the lack of long-term savings and the overall limited access to finance.
40.     Egypt's capital market was thin before the launch of the reforms in 2004. Out of the
1,000 companies listed in the stock exchange half of these companies were not traded, market
capitalization amounted to 35 percent of GDP, and the turnover ratio was very low at 10
percent. The share of government debt issued at market prices and traded was very small. The
average maturity of traded government debt was very short and the long term government
bond market was very small and illiquid. Private fixed-income instruments were negligible.
41.     The legal and information infrastructure for the financial system was deficient. The
credit information systems were very poor. The legal framework did not allow for the
establishment of a private credit bureau, and the information was restricted to banks only.
Non-bank financial institutions did not share, nor had access to clients' creditworthiness
information located at the Credit Registry Department at CBE. Overall, there was lack of
transparency in corporate accounting and auditing standards. All this made lending and
investment decisions very limited and highly risky.
42.     However, the issuance of the Central Bank, Banking System, and Money Law 88 of
2003 set the ground for the ambitious reforms. The new law introduced several critical
improvements, including complete independence of the central bank, stronger prudential
regulations and enforcement powers, higher minimum capital requirements, and principles for
loan settlements and workouts. It also discontinued the special treatment of state-owned banks
to enhance competition, and asserted the right of private sector parties to own shares in state-
owned banks. Nonetheless, these measures were insufficient to address the effects of
pervasive state ownership and inefficiency of the financial markets.

B.       THE FIRST GENERATION OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM (2004­
         2008)

43.     Following its appointment in 2004, the new government designed and implemented a
far-reaching and comprehensive financial sector reform program (2004-2008) that was a
central component of a broader reform program.16 Its objective was to foster the emergence of
a sound, efficient, and diversified financial system, increasingly private sector-led, that could
contribute more effectively to Egypt's growth performance. The newly established Ministry
of Investment was given oversight responsibilities for the non-bank financial sector. In


15
   Out of the 144 companies registered only the largest seven were the most active, and the majority of these were controlled
by banks or bank-affiliates.

16
  The program can be conceptually divided into two phases: Phase I, from July 2004 to June 2006; and Phase II, from July
2006 to June 2008 (see Annex 3).
                                                          - 14 -

parallel, a new Governor was appointed at the CBE, with a reform-oriented vision. These
measures lent credence to the authorities' determination to carry out reforms.
44.     In the banking sector, the reform program led to significant reduction in public
ownership and management of banks and increased competition in banking by privatizing one
of the four state-owned commercial banks;17 divesting state-owned banks' shares in joint-
venture banks;18 and consolidating the system through mergers and acquisitions of small and
weak banks, by enforcing stricter prudential regulations.19 The remaining commercial state-
owned banks underwent a financial, institutional and operational restructuring. This included
the settlement of more than 60 percent of the SOEs' NPLs in state-owned commercial banks,
reaching settlements of 90 percent of private sector NPLs, and recapitalization through
retaining capital gains realized on the sale of non-core assets and investments. In parallel,
there was an in-depth program of improvement in information technology, risk management,
governance, and staff skills that allowed these banks to operate on a commercially viable
basis in increasingly open and competitive markets, without running the risk of incurring new
NPLs. The result of these reforms was a substantial strengthening of the balance sheets of
these banks, validated by the resiliency of the system throughout the global crisis and an
improvement in returns on capital and assets.
45.     In the insurance industry, the main focus of the first generation reforms was rebuilding
the balance sheets of the state-owned insurers20 and restructuring them so as to generate
operating efficiencies and eliminate unsustainable price-based competition. An Insurance
Holding Company (IHC) was created, and the two major direct insurers and the state reinsurer
were merged, leaving the smallest direct insurer independent in order to facilitate future
specialization into life and non-life. Substantial efficiencies have been generated, reserves
have been significantly strengthened, and a new generation of management introduced. In
addition a strategy to deal with the property portfolio was agreed and directed investments
realized or transferred. The state-owned insurers' (SOI) total market share, as measured by
gross premium, fell from 83 percent to 53 percent during the restructuring while profits
increased in nominal terms by 67 percent, assets under management increased by 64 percent
and three new life and two non-life takaful insurers were registered (Table 4).
46.     Concomitant with the restructuring, action was taken to staunch huge real losses being
incurred in the compulsory Motor Third Party Liability (MTPL) portfolio and to convert the
insurance supervisor and industry association from control entities to, respectively, a modern
risk based supervisor and a proper industry representative body. The financial performance of
the third party motor vehicle market was significantly improved through actuarially
determined price increases and claims capping. Other parallel developments included the
development of a strategy to build relevant human capital, including in the actuarial

17
   The first generation reforms included the privatization of Bank of Alexandria through sale of 80 percent of the equity to
Bank San Paolo (later merged with Intesa to form Intesa San Paolo). Although the privatization of Banque du Caire was not
part of the reform program, the government decided in early 2007 to privatize the bank. The government's commitment was
evident in completing all the necessary steps for a strategic sale. Specifically, in July 2007, the government had announced
that 70 percent of the bank would be sold to a strategic investor, and in October 2007 the government selected JP Morgan as
sales advisor. The government received three bids in May 2008. However, the sale transaction was not completed, mainly
due to the fact that the price was much lower than that estimated by the evaluation committee headed by the Central Audit
Agency (CAA), and the global financial crisis paralyzed the bank privatization world-wide. The government maintained the
sales adviser until the environment is more conducive to the privatization of the bank.
18
   More than 94 percent of the state-owned banks shares in joint venture banks were divested.
19
    Consolidation of the banking sector was through higher minimum capital requirements and stricter prudential rules
resulted in the exit of small and weak banks through mergers, acquisitions, and closure of foreign bank branches, which
reduced the overall number of banks from 57 in 2004 to 39 in 2008.
20
   In excess of LE1.5 billion of non life reserve strengthening occurred over the 3 years to June 30, 2008.
                                                           - 15 -

profession. Overall market performance was improved through a 50 percent reduction of
stamp duty on non-life insurance premiums, an increase in minimum capital levels and the
authorization of corporate brokers. Reflecting these policy actions relevant metrics were
sustained or improved (see Annex 3) in the face of high inflation rates, which are inimical to
insurance and pension sector development.

47.      Deepening and strengthening the efficiency of capital markets was a key objective of
the first generation reforms. Reforms since July 2006 included measures to improve liquidity
in the equity market,22 create a sound basis for securitization, build the institutional investor
base through separate reforms of insurance, investment funds and pension funds, and further
strengthen the supervisory framework (Tables 5 and 6). Other measures included the
introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for listed firms and
securities companies in 2007, as well as international auditing standards; the issuance of
regulations improving capital adequacy and risk management standards for securities firms;
approval of Capital Market Law amendment by the Parliament in 2008; simplifying the
fragmented Egyptian Stock Exchange (ESE) listing schedules and abolishing the special
treatment of SOEs; and the issuance of a decree on takeovers and public tender offers. In
2008, a stock exchange for SMEs was established, the NILEX. The securities regulator made
gains in terms of building its own capacity to supervise and monitor financial intermediaries
and market activity. Regulatory obstacles to the establishment of investment funds were also
eased.

48.     The government debt market also developed, as indicated by the increase in tradable
debt from 20 to 36 percent of total debt, and the increase in average maturity from 120 days to
2.1 years. The debt management unit created in 2001 has followed a strategy that entails an
increase in the share of tradable debt and increases in debt maturities; it has published an
auction calendar and conducted its issues through the primary dealer system introduced in
2001.

21
   This partly reflects realized gains on unlisted holdings.
22
   The upward rise in liveliness reflects sustained efforts to de-list companies that do not trade or do not meet corporate
governance requirements. The number of listed companies steadily declined from 795 at the end of 2004 to 373 at end of
2008. The delisting of small companies contributed to a rise in average market capitalization, from LE 294 million in 2004 to
LE 1633 million at the end of 2008. Moreover, whereas only 53 percent of listed firms traded in 2004, 94 percent traded in
2008. Also the retail domestic investor base expanded from 0.5 million to 1.6 million people through initial public offerings
(IPOs).

49.    Underpinning the program was a major effort to strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory apparatus and the financial infrastructure. The CBE intensified its strengthening
of regulation and supervision substantially under the new Governor. This strengthening
included not only higher minimum capital requirements and other measures that led to the
consolidation of the banking system into fewer, stronger banks, but also improvements in on-
site and off-site supervision, movements toward risk-based supervision, and efforts to
improve banks' risk management and governance. Regulation and supervision were also
improved in the non-bank sector, beginning in the insurance and pensions sectors and
preparing the legal and institutional setup for the creation of a single regulatory agency, the
Egyptian Financial Supervisory Agency (EFSA).
50.     Significant improvements also occurred in the institutional framework and financial
infrastructure during the financial reform program. The legal framework for a private credit
bureau was established. A law was passed for specialized economic courts and a substantial
effort was made to train the judges in economic issues. Moreover, the CBE appropriately
began its efforts to modernize the payments system with changes in policies, regulations and
oversight and improvements in existing arrangements that reduced processing times for
payments. The CBE also purchased and launched a real time gross settlements payments
system (RTGS).

C.       THE SECOND GENERATION OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM (2009­
         2012)

51.      After the success of its first generation of financial reforms, the government launched
in January 2009, the second generation of the Financial Sector Reform Program (2009­2012),
that focuses on access to finance, for which it is seeking World Bank support. The objective
of this reform program is to build a financial system that is more inclusive, competitive and
effective in financial intermediation, with sound banking and non-banking financial
institutions and that is led by the private sector. This also encompasses continuing some of the
reforms initiated under the first generation as outlined in the government's Letter of
Developmental Policy.
52.     The program includes five mutually enforcing pillars which build on major
improvements in soundness, stability, access, and risk management. The first pillar contains
measures to enhance the efficiency of state-owned commercial and specialized banks in
financial intermediation and widen access to financial services through extensive branch
networks. The second pillar includes actions that strengthen the resiliency of the financial
system through improving the regulatory and supervisory architecture of the banking sector.
The third focuses on reforming the insurance and pension sector, and improving the efficiency
of the capital market to expand the reach of the non-bank financial sector to remote and
underdeveloped areas. The fourth includes measures that strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory framework for the non-bank financial sector and enable further expansion of
access to finance through non-bank financial institutions. The fifth comprises measures to
improve the financial infrastructure and the legal framework, with the objective of enhancing
the financial stability and safety of the payments system, and extending access to payments to
                                                        - 17 -

low income and rural households.
i.       Policy Area I: Enhance the Intermediary Role of State-owned Banks through
         Operational and Financial Restructuring
53.     A major part of the second generation reforms is the continuation of the operational
and financial restructuring of the three state-owned commercial banks (National Bank of
Egypt, Banque Misr, and Banque du Caire). The restructuring process began in 2005 and
focused on three critical areas: (i) risk management functions, including NPL management;
(ii) human resource functions, and alignment of organization and general management
functions; and (iii) information technology and management information systems. While this
process will continue, the second generation reforms will also include setting profitability,
efficiency and corporate governance benchmarks by the CBE to be revised quarterly, to
assess the three banks' management performance.
54.    The financial restructuring program will also ensure full compliance of state-owned
commercial banks with prudential requirements. This will include the full settlement of SOEs
NPLs, through an agreement between the holding companies and National Bank of Egypt and
Banque Misr to settle remaining outstanding NPLs through a debt-asset (mainly land) swap.
In addition, the financial situation of these SOEs has been improving steadily, as a result of
the Ministry of Investment's Asset Management Program (Annex 12).
55.     Furthermore, the second generation reforms put special emphasis on state-owned
specialized banks. The approach to the specialized banks is similar to that for the commercial
banks: independent audits; in this case initially for EALB, IDB and PBDAC; a conversion of
the legal framework for PBDAC so that it operates under the same improved legal framework
and governance structure that was applied to the state-owned commercial banks in 2003; and
operational and institutional restructurings of EALB, IDB and PBDAC to improve their
efficiency and effectiveness while ensuring the sustainability of these changes.
56.      Given the fact that PBDAC has the largest branch network of all banks operating in
       23
Egypt , converting it into a sound, retail state-owned bank is vital to the success of the
overall financial sector reform program. The first steps in this process is submitting the
Egyptian Agriculture Bank Law (replacing Law 117 of 1972) to the Cabinet of Ministers,
converting PBDAC into a state-owned bank regulated by Law 88 of 2003 and the issuance of
a Ministerial Decree separating non-bank activities from commercial banking. PBDAC also
has a key role to play in increasing access to finance. No other bank in Egypt provides SME
finance on such a notable scale or offers such a range of financial services in rural areas. The
bank's 2009 Annual Report outlines its recently adopted strategy to further enhance access to
finance for micro and small enterprises.24 PBDAC has also attempted to mainstream gender in
its operations and has prepared a program to facilitate access to credit to rural women that is
to be implemented in collaboration with other relevant government entities.

ii.      Policy Area II: Strengthen the Regulatory and Supervisory Architecture of the
         Banking Sector
57.    The strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework in the banking sector
remains a critical part of the second generation financial reform program. A credible and

23
   PBDAC has more than 1,200 branches and 23,000 employees throughout the country and outside of Cairo, providing
deposit services, payments services, foreign currency services, and passbooks as well as lending to the agriculture and
agribusiness sector.
24
   This is especially important as the agriculture economy accounts for the majority of employment in Egypt, and the
overwhelming majority of rural employment, as well as a considerable portion of GDP.
                                                         - 18 -

independent regulator is the necessary anchor of an effective and resilient financial system
that is able to prudently expand access to finance, especially in an environment where Egypt
will be more integrated in the global financial system. The global financial crisis
demonstrated the need for strong micro and macroprudential surveillance capacity to preserve
the improvements many countries have achieved in access to finance; within this context and
in parallel with improving the efficiency of the banking sector through the financial and
operational restructuring of state-owned banks, the CBE is making substantial improvements
to microprudential and macroprudential regulation and supervision to support the stability of
the financial system. These efforts focus on two main areas: (i) strengthening the risk-based
supervision of banks in implementing Basel II framework; and (ii) enhancing macroprudential
analysis by conducting regular stress tests and preparing a Financial Stability Report which
will be the first report of its kind in the MENA region. In the long run, these actions aim at
putting Egypt in line with the best practices regarding regulation and supervision in banking.
58.      Initiating implementation of the Basel II accords at CBE is of primary importance to
the second generation of reforms. CBE is planning to maintain the momentum in further
strengthening its capabilities to perform effective risk-based supervision. A new Euro system
technical assistance program on banking supervision was launched in early January 2009.
This new program aims at supporting the CBE in designing a Basel II framework customized
to the banking system through a long term strategy. To this end, the CBE benefits from the
expertise of various European Central Bank (ECB) experts who are managed by a Resident
Program Coordinator. The program encompasses Pillars I (capital adequacy); and II
(supervisory review process). The plan towards Basel II is divided into three phases, where
the first phase focused on gaps identification and finalizing CBE Basel II Strategy; the second
on discussion papers, quantitative impact study (QIS) for regulations guidelines, and a data
reporting scheme; and the third on drafting the newly proposed regulations, and preparing the
Basel II framework implementation.
59.     The first phase has been achieved successfully. A diagnostic of the needs of the
Egyptian banking system has been conducted and has identified a set of strategic themes 25 on
which the program will focus in the months to come. An intensive program of knowledge
sharing and capacity building along these themes has been performed with experts coming
from the euro zone national central banks partners. The CBE's report on a strategy for Basel
II implementation in Egypt was presented to the banking community on October 14, 2009.
60.     The second phase, which has already begun, is dedicated to elaborating on guidelines
for drafting new regulations, running simulations, and building a new data reporting scheme.
Working groups involving the banking and financial community will be set up. Working
groups will meet regularly for reviewing "discussion papers" on the key themes (operational
risk, credit risk, market risk and own funds) prepared jointly by the ECB and CBE experts,26
but they have a broad mandate to examine and advice on all implementation issues. National
Central Bank (NCB) experts will also help the CBE prepare a QIS for banks which aims at
evaluating the implications of the new regime in terms of capital requirements. After
reviewing this impact study, new regulations in line with the basic Basel II regime would be
prepared based on guidelines elaborated along this second phase of the program. One of the
main deliverables of the second phase is also the design of a new data reporting scheme to
support the implementation of these new regulations.

25
   There are nine strategic themes, namely: own funds, market risk, credit risk, internal control, credit risk mitigation,
operational risk, credit rating systems, pillar II issues, and accounting issues.
26
   To this effect six study visits have been scheduled to meet experts in NCB.
                                             - 19 -

61.     The third phase will last six months and provide support to enhance the
implementation process for the new regulations and data reporting scheme. This will include
knowledge sharing and capacity building to all CBE staff on how to monitor the compliance
of the Egyptian banking system with these new regulations. Finally, this phase should set up
the organization of the implementation of the new data reporting scheme.
62.     The CBE is developing an action plan to prepare a Financial Stability Report with a
macro prudential risk focus. The CBE is also taking steps to strengthen the macroprudential
analysis and supervision of the Egyptian financial sector. Improved macroprudential analysis
entails two major elements: (i) annual stress tests by the CBE on the aggregate balance sheet
of the banking sector and on the balance sheet of individual banks; and (ii) beginning the
process of producing periodic Financial Stability Reports that are increasingly being used by
central banks world-wide in their macroprudential supervision efforts (Annex 8).
iii.   Policy Area III: Reform the Non-bank Financial Sector
63.     The government's second generation reforms are designed to create markets that are
diversified and well-balanced, show healthy growth, display resilience when faced with
shocks, and offer increased access. For insurance, key measures include enactment of
Insurance Law 118 of 2008 separating the life from the non-life insurance portfolio, putting
compulsory motor third party insurance onto a sound long term financial basis, developing a
sustainable banc-assurance model, fostering the development of micro-insurance (largely
working with MFIs) and increasing public awareness of the role and value of the insurance
sector (Annex 9).
64.      The enactment of Insurance Law 2008 involves transferring the run off non-life
portfolio in National Insurance Company (NIC) to Misr Insurance Company (MIC) and the
reciprocal transfer of the MIC life insurance portfolio. Both under Egyptian law and by the
International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) prudential standards, the separation
of life and non-life insurance activities is necessary and the means by which IHC's insurance
activities can be strategically developed. This reform will also ensure more effective
asset/liabilities management, more efficient use of capital and more efficient and specialized
provision of insurance services. Developmental benefits from the creation of two large
specialized financially sound insurers include their transformation into increasingly valuable
assets for the government, reduced fiscal exposure to non performing state owned entities and
the introduction of new business models that will lead to increased access opportunities for
underserved sections of the population.
65.     Second generation MTPL reforms involve the establishment of an independent,
transparent and objective rate setting entity to ensure the long term viability of this class of
insurance and to develop supporting infrastructure to ensure the effective policing of
compliance and claims management. In particular it is proposed that a motor bureau be set up
to gather data and prepare rating recommendations; a proposal will be submitted by the end of
2010. Infrastructure options will be determined after an examination of regional best practice,
for example, Tramer in Turkey and Najam in Saudi Arabia.
66.    Banc-assurance has already become a potent distribution strategy in Egypt, primarily
through two internationally affiliated life insurers and has become a major life channel in
other countries in MENA. It is likely to become even more important as mortgage and retail
credit markets develop and banks require collateral protection. To apply a banc-assurance
model in Egypt an insurer needs approval both from EFSA and CBE and following some
consumer complaints CBE proposed rules that effectively prevented any new banc-assurance
                                                          - 20 -

agreements from being entered into. A CBE/ EFSA committee is currently preparing a set of
operating rules (with the benefit of current international and regional best practice) that will
protect banks from reputational and legal risk and ensure transparency to bank customers
while allowing reputable and well capitalized insurers to participate. Experience elsewhere
has demonstrated the positive impact that banc-assurance can have on sustaining bank branch
networks.27
67.     Micro-insurance is also being encouraged under the access element of EFSA's initial
three-year strategic plan. EFSA is currently reviewing international regulatory practice for
micro-insurance and is planning to work with the international Access to Insurance Initiative
(A2I)28 to better understand opportunities in this market. A leading international NGO has
already conducted a comprehensive needs survey and subsequently partnered with two
international insurers and two local micro finance institutions (MFIs) to provide credit life
coverage. A second phase will see product offerings being expanded, and savings products
will be offered in the final stage. Tanmeya, a recently established micro finance provider
controlled by a leading regional private equity firm has also agreed to distribute micro-
insurance in association with a recently formed domestic insurer.
68.     A significant increase in access to insurance should follow the entry of National
Insurance Company (NIC) into the micro-insurance market. NIC has full coverage of the
country through its branch network and has conducted a comprehensive survey of MFIs to
determine how it can best build on this opportunity for increased penetration of the micro-
entrepreneurial and working poor sectors. Current plans see rapid development in Upper
Egypt and the Delta. NIC already provides credit life coverage to approximately 280,000
rural operatives through PBDAC under a scheme operating since 2006. Other NIC initiatives
will include the design and distribution of investment linked and pension products. In
addition, new branches will be opened in areas that have in the past been underserved, well
trained and experienced sales teams are being acquired,29 and internet marketing and banc-
assurance opportunities explored.
69.     The government, in partnership with the sector, has begun implementing a public
education and awareness program, an important requirement to improve access. The Egyptian
Insurance Federation compromising all insurance companies and EFSA have designed a
campaign to: (i) disseminate information to promote and facilitate understanding of the
concept of insurance coverage and risk management; (ii) promote confidence in the financial
sector as a whole and in the insurance sector specifically; and (iii) create a solid image of
insurers, entailing professionalism, public-mindedness, and efficiency. The campaign is
divided into three stages: the first two were completed in July 2009 and the third is expected
to be launched in mid-2010. An independent evaluation has been carried out showing
increased trust of and access to insurance products since the campaign began.
70.    The second generation reforms will also focus on developing the capital market which
will contribute to enhancing both access and stability. It will promote competition between
banks, encouraging them to go down market, and will make new information and instruments
available allowing for further gains in long term financing. The government is committed to
improving the regulatory regime for investment funds and other collective investment
schemes (CIS). The Reforms will also provide additional protections to investors' investment

funds by issuing EFSA Decree 88 which requires investment funds to use an independent
fund services company to perform back-office functions.30
71.     Bringing Egypt's CIS regulations closely in line with those of the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is a key objective of the reform program.
An EFSA working group has made draft recommendations to achieve this. Before mid-2012,
it is expected that CIS improvements will include a code of ethics for investment managers
and higher standards for the marketing of investment funds to investors. In addition, the
relatively new development of real estate investment funds (REIFs) and other CIS vehicles
warrant a regulatory response. This is expected to result in a new chapter in the Capital
Market Law (CML) that provides more consistency with IOSCO best practices.
72.     Legal reforms to strengthen the efficiency of capital markets include Law 123 of 2008
to increase the reliability and soundness of financial intermediaries. Specifically, Articles 26
and 69 of Law 123 address market manipulation by financial intermediaries, improve the
reporting on capital adequacy of brokerage companies, and increase the capital required for
intra-day trading activity. Enactment of the law will also reduces the number of listing
schedules at the ESE from four to two: one for securities issued by institutions incorporated in
Egypt, and another for securities issued by foreign institutions. The amendments also
strengthen regulation of the auditing profession. A registrar was established at EFSA for
accredited auditors, and a mechanism has been set up to supervise auditors. The definition
and scope of insider trading violations has been broadened, and the maximum penalty for
insider trading violations has been increased from LE 100,000 to LE 20 million (Annex 11).
73.     The Egyptian government has adjusted the regulatory framework to facilitate
corporate issuance of fixed-income securities. Ministerial Decree 1 of 2010; (i) sets standards
for public agencies and international financial institutions to issue bonds in the domestic
market; (ii) requires corporations to only provide the regulator with projections of cash flows,
capital structure, liquidity ratios, and profitability ratios for the bond's tenure (rather than
complete audited sets of forward-looking financial statements); (iii) gives the regulator more
discretion in deciding whether to delete (or add) documentation that public juristic entities
(such as a municipal authority) must provide in order to proceed with a bond offering (which
should make it easier for such agencies to raise debt financing for investment in needed
infrastructure projects); and (iv) allows for shelf registration of corporate bonds that will be
issued in multiple tranches. New bond issuances by public agencies and international
organizations will give domestic investors (mainly institutional investors) more of an
opportunity to diversify their fixed income portfolios. Additionally, EFSA Board Decree 71,
issued in December 2009, increases the number of authorized international rating agencies
from three to ten companies. These measures should also make it less expensive for
corporations to issue fixed-income instruments.
iv.      Policy Area IV: Strengthen the Regulatory and Supervisory Framework of the
         Non-bank Financial Sector
74.    Underpinning the non-bank financial sector reforms is the strengthening of its
regulatory and supervisory framework. The aim is to ensure its soundness and lay the basis
for broader access to finance through non-bank financial institutions including the capital
market, the stock exchange, insurance services, mortgage finance, financial leasing, factoring

30
   Prior to the issuance of this decree, investment funds were required to hire an independent fund administrative company to
perform such key functions as the calculation of net asset value, keeping of records on unit-holders and investment
transactions, and calculation of fund managers' fees and performance bonuses. By taking these activities away from fund
managers, protections to public investors are increased.
                                                         - 22 -

and securitization. The first step in this program is the issuance of Law 10 of 2009 which
regulates non-banking financial markets, institutions and instruments and has consolidated the
regulatory bodies of non-bank financial sector through the establishment of the EFSA--the
integrated non-bank financial supervisor. EFSA will strengthen the legal framework for non-
bank financial institutions and markets and will also implement a relatively advanced risk-
based supervision system for insurance and pension funds.31 The unification of these
regulatory and supervisory objectives under the EFSA, coupled with unifying the Auditors
Oversight Board to cover all non-bank institutions, will enhance the transparency and
reliability of financial reporting in the non-banking sector.
75.      EFSA, which became operational on July 1, 2009 replaced the three authorities
regulating the main non-bank financial services, namely the Capital Market Authority
(CMA), the Egyptian Insurance Supervisory Authority (EISA), and the Mortgage Finance
Authority (MFA). Its main objective is to ensure market stability as well as to regulate the
relevant activities, and boost competition and attract more local and foreign investments to
the Egyptian market. Its mandate also includes limiting systematic risk, realizing financial
discipline and protecting rights of investors. The new entity is also well placed to support
capital market development through its oversight of both the markets and the main long term
institutional investors.
76.     EFSA has issued a decree, unifying the Auditors Oversight Board to cover all non-
bank financial institutions. This will build on the experience of the capital market's auditors'
oversight board that was established in July 2008, and apply it across the board to all non-
bank financial services. The new board's mandate is to foster the transparency and enforce
proper governance of the auditing profession through ensuring the proper implementation of
the Egyptian auditing standards. This is in addition to setting rules and procedures of the
registration in the auditors' register at EFSA. The board would also set mechanisms for
periodic inspection of registered auditors, and guard against conflicts of interest between
auditors and audited institutions to protect investors' rights. This is in addition to developing
measures for suspending or canceling registrations in case of violation non-compliance to
codes of conduct.
77.     A major milestone for the second generation reform agenda is the issuance of a law to
harmonize the supervision over the non-bank financial sector, including allowing the
establishment of and supervision over microfinance, leasing and factoring institutions. The
Cabinet of Ministers has approved a new Non-bank Financial Institutions Licensing and
Regulatory Law that will set the regulatory framework for all non-bank financial institutions
including micro finance, leasing, and factoring institutions, as well as standards in accounting,
transparency and corporate governance, and lay the foundation for a new category of non-
bank microcredit companies. The purpose of the proposed law is to harmonize and unify
EFSA's regulatory approach and tools in supervising non-bank financial institutions, which is
currently fragmented between several different laws. The law, when adopted, will set the
rules for: (i) licensing of non-bank financial institutions; (ii) empowering the EFSA Board of
Directors to issue prudential and capital adequacy standards for licensed institutions;
(iii) empowering the EFSA Board to issue rules for licensing individuals working in NBFIs;
(iv) harmonizing EFSA's procedures and rules with respect to inspection and discipline of
Licensed Companies; (v) regulating the professionals associations that represent licensed


31
  The system will draw from both the US ratio and risk based capital approach and the more subjective Canadian risk ladder
approach.
                                                  - 23 -

firms; and (vi) improving EFSA's capabilities to require better disclosure by licensed
companies.
78.     Following approval of the law, regulations will be issued by the EFSA Board to set
out the provisions for each type of NBFI covered by this law. The law will allow the
establishment of microfinance, leasing and factoring companies that can operate sustainably
and access commercial funding to operate at scale. Microfinance provisions will be issued by
the EFSA later in the year, and would allow microfinance companies to provide loans
directly, and to act as agents or distribution channels for insurance, payments services, and
deposits. Leasing and factoring will allow SME finance risks, related to deficiencies in the
legal and institutional framework for secured lending, to be managed. Leasing not only
complements traditional banking services, but can enable financial institutions to be more
efficient and responsive to customer concerns in order to remain competitive. The
development of factoring is a priority area for the government given its value as a tool for
encouraging Egyptian production, export and SME development.
79.    Regulating pension funds is also one of the main objectives of the reform program.
This includes the issuance of the Private Pension Funds Law, which was submitted to the
Cabinet of Ministers on November 9, 2009. While the law has high priority for the
government, a number of more urgent draft laws (including the reform of public pensions)
need to be approved before, and the treatment for the Private Pensions Law would take place
in the next Parliamentary sessions. The cabinet is expected to submit the draft law to
Parliament for approval by the beginning of the parliamentary session in early November
2010. The law will promote higher professional standards for private pension provision and
management by providing a comprehensive regulatory framework. This framework will
include mandatory registration, investment guidelines, funding requirements, governance,
accounting, reporting, audits, supervision and sanctions.
80.     The law will specifically improve the enforcement capacity of EFSA, especially in the
cases of underfunded schemes. At present, around 47 percent of the 177 pension funds that
applied the new valuation criteria are underfunded, as shown in Table 7. EFSA has limited
capacity to enforce corrective measures other than limiting benefit adjustments. The new
regulatory framework, instead, will provide EFSA with the authority to oversee more closely
the situation of unfunded schemes, impose corrective actions and sanctions.
81.     While strengthening the role of EFSA as a supervisory authority of private pension
provision, the law will also include incentives to members and fund managers, such as tax
exemptions. Sound regulation, supervision and incentives are among the key enabling
conditions to support an important expansion of long term retirement savings that is expected
to happen as public pension reform takes place. By improving the quality of information and
transparency, on one hand, EFSA will be in a better position to require the unfunded schemes
to take corrective actions. Moreover, better information and well-supervised companies will
increase the understanding and confidence of the population in private retirement products.

82.     Additionally, the creation of EFSA and the role of the private credit bureau, I-Score,
will foster efficiency and confidence in leasing. EFSA supervision of leasing activities will
ensure market stability, increase efficiency in enforcing property rights and facilitate the legal
processes that enforce foreclosures and legal protection against contract default. I-Score will
not only list credit information on the leasing companies themselves, but also on Micro and
Small Enterprises (MSEs) and eventually will even include a unified movable collateral
registry, reducing risk in contract leasing and increasing confidence of lessors in contracts and
SMEs. The combination of these new institutions will reduce the individual registration and
capital requirements that are currently such a disincentive in financial leasing.
v.      Policy Area V: Improving the Financial Infrastructure
83.     Fostering greater access to financial services requires improving the institutional
environment that supports financial intermediation. An enabling institutional environment
will allow the emergence of an efficient, increasingly private-led financial system that will
provide more access and better serve Egypt's development and growth objectives. The second
generation reforms include key measures related to the payments system, including a (RTGS)
and an automated clearing house (ACH); the new regulatory framework for mobile phone
payments; the database and credit information system at the private credit bureau; and
capacity building for MSMEs and financial institutions active in lending to them.
84.    The payments system will be further strengthened, which will enable the inclusion of
a much higher proportion of Egypt's population in the financial system. The government's
Payroll and Pensions Initiative uses the ACH to extend financial access through making
pension and public sector salaries through financial institutions, through debit cards linked to
ATMs and bank accounts. Making the RTGS and ACH fully operational, following the
launch of the RTGS in March 2009, will enable direct credit and direct debit processing. A
national inter-bank switch system would provide connectivity for retail payments between
banks and lower the costs of card-based payments.
85.     Regulations would be issued for licensing payment services and for payment systems
oversight. The CBE will make concerted efforts to promote better payments services for small
users, beginning with regulations for mobile phone payments and for licensing payments
services. Issuance of regulations on mobile phone payments and electronic money is an early
priority in order to provide a legal framework within which private sector solutions can start
to meet the large potential consumer demand, including from low income individuals, MSEs,
and other financially-underserved groups. Mobile phone payments can extend access
significantly into low income and rural populations, as illustrated in countries such as Kenya,
South Africa and India.
86.     The further development and strengthening of I-Score will contribute to better
information dissemination. I-Score had 5.8 million clients and a total of 14.6 million facilities
(credit files) at the end of 2009. It has expanded to include 16 non-banks, such as retailers,
leasing companies, and mortgage finance companies. I-Score includes both banks and non-
banks, and has developed credit scores for consumers. Credit scores for SMEs, SME ratings,
and the inclusion of microfinance borrowers into a credit information sharing system, are next
steps being considered by I-Score. Overall, strengthening the credit information system and
widening the scope will contribute to enhancing access to finance.
                                                          - 25 -

87.     The CBE plans to adopt and launch an initiative to encourage the extension of banking
services and finance to SMEs. This will include three components, the first of which was to
launch a nationwide SME census in January 2010 to build a comprehensive SME database.
Secondly, the CBE issued a decree in 2008 establishing a specialized SME Unit at the
Egyptian Banking Institute (EBI) in order to build the capacity of SME bankers necessary for
establishing specialized SME departments for providing lending and wider banking services
to SMEs. The SME Unit at EBI has piloted a training program for bankers in SME finance,
and is also developing a course for entrepreneurs wishing to access finance.32 Thirdly, the
CBE will also eliminate reserve requirements on deposits that fund loans to SMEs.
88.    The Ministry of Investment, through its Business Development Center at the General
Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) would also facilitate services to improve
SME capacity and business practices. SMEs are constrained by a lack of adequate business
services, information, advanced technology, and skilled labor, all of which affect their ability
to access finance. Support to SME clustering and to training and advisory services could
improve SME competitiveness and creditworthiness through access to expertise, technology,
services and information. SMEs would therefore be able to make more productive use of an
increased supply of financial services, and generate increased incomes, employment and
competitiveness.
89.     In addition, EFSA's planned program of financial literacy would improve public
awareness of the EFSA's role, understanding of financial markets, and consumer appreciation
of opportunities and risks involved with financial services. Financial literacy is an essential
complement to financial access, as it enables individuals and firms to benefit fully from
improved access, selecting products and terms that best meet their needs and avoiding over-
indebtedness, unsafe investments, and other potential pitfalls. The new Anti-Money
Laundering Unit also constitutes an important defense against the potentially harmful impacts
to society of financial intermediation and systems.

IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

A.       LINKS TO THE CAS
90.      The proposed operation addresses key strategic objectives of the CAS, namely to
enhance the capacity of the financial system and facilitate private sector development. The
proposed DPL III is fully consistent with the strategy articulated in the CAS and further
confirmed in 2008 in the CAS Progress Report (one of the main thrusts of this strategy is to
help "further implement reforms in the financial sector, including to broaden access to
finance"), including with regard to the CAS and the CAS Progress Report results framework
(which explicitly mentions access to finance issues). Moreover, the CAS Progress Report
lending program was indicative, with an explicit mention that it would be implemented with
flexibility. The CAS Progress Report (paragraph 36) mentioned criteria that would be used to
select operations going to the Board, namely: (i) priorities expressed by the government--
DPL III is a priority to the Egyptian government at the highest political level; and
(ii) financial exposure consideration. While the DPL III was not explicitly mentioned in the
CAS and the CAS Progress Report, it fits within both the overall engagement strategy and the
current IBRD envelope.
32
  EBI launched the first SME banking specialized certificate that comprises 5 modules for 150 training hours. The certificate
tackles topics related to strategic planning, operational issues, product development, risk and profitability, marketing and
delivery of SME products. The expected number of trainees in SME Banking by May 2010 is 450, while 150 entrepreneurs
are projected to be trained in the same period.
                                                         - 26 -

91.      Under the CAS and CAS Progress Report, support to the financial sector reform
program was provided through two DPLs. DPL I, supporting the first phase of the first
generation reforms, was approved by the Board in June 2006, successfully completed, and
rated satisfactory by Quality Assurance Group. The second, DPL II, further supported the
implementation of the second phase of the first generation reforms and was approved by the
Board in April 2009 and successfully completed as discussed in its Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR). Triggers for the high case scenario under the CAS
have been met. These triggers were: (a) clear signs of implementation of substantive financial
sector reforms, including significant restructuring of state-owned banks, and the privatization
of the Bank of Alexandria; and (b) the adoption of a financing plan under which at least 10
percent of the financing needs of the financial sector restructuring program were to be met
from non-debt creating sources (including grants from donors and proceeds from
privatization). The recent developments on the economic and financial fronts in Egypt have
heightened the importance of reforms in the financial sector. Thus, it is necessary to maintain
stability, in addition to expanding access to finance as a key element for recovery, to ensure
irreversibility and sustainability of reform.
B.       COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
92.     To carry out the program, the authorities have also sought financial and technical
support from the IMF, the US, the European Union (EU), and the African Development Bank
(AfDB).33 At the request of the government, the Bank is playing a coordination role among
donors in the financial sector through a Financial Sector Donors Group that it chairs in the
field. There is also good collaboration between the World Bank and the IMF in Egypt in the
financial sector,34 through the joint FSAP program and coordination of technical assistance as
indicated in the IMP Relations Note in Annex 15.
93.     Among the bilateral donors, USAID has provided technical assistance in many areas,
including debt and financial management, a legal framework for secured lending (movable
assets), credit bureau regulation and data management, and the payments system (the latter in
coordination with the EU and the Bank). USAID has a broad capacity-building and technical
assistance project with the EFSA, and provides technical assistance to EISA focusing on
transforming supervision from compliance based to risk-based. In addition, work with the
Ministry of Finance on pension reform is ongoing. USAID is also funding a project
supporting the development of the mortgage market through advisory services for
strengthening the supervisory authority, securitization, and property registration.
94.    The EU has also been actively involved in the financial sector over the past few years,
supporting analytical work on reforming and restructuring the financial sector. The ECB has
been providing technical support in the area of banking supervision. Several US regulators
including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve, and the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have been providing training in this field as
well. The first phase of the ECB's large assistance and training program for banking

33
   Support provided by USAID for the Financial Sector Reform Program, includes: (i) financial sector reform-MOU (US$1.2
billion) in the form of budget support; (ii) reform of the commercial law (US$25 million); (iii) banking sector reform
(US$100million); (iv) capital market reforms (US$37 million); (v) mortgage finance (US$40 million); and (vi) insurance
sector (US$50 million). EU support for the financial sector reform program is provided through the FISC financial program
that was launched late 2004 covering the period from 2005 to end of 2008, with a budget of Euro 15 million covering the
payment system (Euro 2 million), banking supervision (Euro 2.4 million), public bank restructuring (Euro 8 million), and
capital markets (Euro 2.6 million). EU is currently finalizing a follow-up program to support the implementation of second
generation reforms, focusing on the area of banking supervision through the Eurosystem.
34
   Annex 15 "Fund Relations Note" includes the Article IV Consultation Mission Concluding Statement of February 2010.
                                            - 27 -

supervision has been completed, and a second protocol was signed to assist in Basel II
implementation.
C.     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK ACTIVITIES
95.     The World Bank Group's work in Egypt's financial sector has been exemplary in the
sense that support has been provided through a continuum of instruments, from analytical
work (including successive FSAPs), and technical assistance including advisory services from
the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and International Finance Corporation
(IFC) investments to lending from International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD). The synergies between these various instruments have proven critical to the success
of the overall engagement.
96.     Analytical underpinnings. Several Bank studies provide strong analytical
underpinning to the design of the proposed DPL and have helped identify areas that require
further reforms. These studies include the 2002 FSAP and the 2007 FSAP Update, 2005, 2006
and 2009 Investment Climate Assessments, the 2007 Finance for All: Policies and Pitfalls in
Expanding Access; 2008 Access to Finance and Economic Growth in Egypt; 2009 Egypt
Macro Policy Note; 2010 Determinants of Savings in Egypt Report; in addition to the updates
of the 2004 Accounting and Auditing Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC); and 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) which assesses the
current fiduciary risk based on the recent implementation of the Public Financial Management
Action Plan.
97.      While these reports have documented the substantial progress made by the financial
sector reform program since it was launched in 2004, they also identify access to finance and
financial intermediation as a priority area for the next series of reforms to be undertaken by
the government. The analytical underpinnings highlight the considerable empirical evidence
that has shown the relationship between access to finance and economic growth and
development, job creation, improving income distribution and reducing overall economic
volatility, which has encouraged the authorities to adopt access to finance as the main theme
of their recent reform program. Furthermore, the IEG Country Assistance Strategy (1999­
2007) for Egypt recommended that the Bank build on the recent success of reform efforts in
the financial sector, focusing on specialized banks, the supervisory framework, capital
markets and non-bank financial institutions.
98.     Technical assistance. There have been five FIRST-financed technical assistance
projects that have enhanced staff knowledge of the critical issues and challenges in the
financial sector. These FIRST projects have included: (i) Strengthening Banking Supervision,
building the capacity of the banking supervision department at CBE focusing on connected
lending, large exposures and market risk assessment; (ii) Automation of CBE's Credit
Information System, with the objective of strengthening the existing credit information
department at CBE and improving data collection and analysis for credit information;
(iii) Modernizing the Payments System, which aimed at strengthening the payments system at
CBE done in collaboration with the EU; (iv) Establishing the Private Credit Bureau, which
entailed legal and regulatory amendments to allow for the establishment of private credit
bureaus that would cater both to banks, and non-bank financial institutions; and (v)
Modernizing the Insurance Sector, focusing on developing actuary skills. Furthermore, the
Bank also financed the fee-based technical assistance on governance, anti-corruption, and
regulatory reforms. The World Bank has also provided technical assistance in several aspects
of pension reform, including: (i) sustainability analysis of the current pension schemes and
reform options; (ii) fiscal impact of the proposed pension reform; (iii) minimum pensions and
                                                           - 28 -

minimum return guarantees; (iii) costs of survivorship and disability pensions; and (iv) draft
regulatory framework for public (mandatory) and private (voluntary) pensions.
99.    CGAP support. CGAP has provided analysis and recommendations with respect to
Egypt's access to finance efforts and was involved in preparation of two key operations: the
Enhancement of Access to Finance for Micro and Small Enterprises Project, and the proposed
DPL III. CGAP has provided support to the government in the creation of a micro-lending
NBFI category of companies aimed at building a sustainable and robust microcredit sector. In
addition, CGAP has promoted the exploration of opportunities for greater penetration of
financial services to the low-income population through branchless banking.35 CGAP also
invited high level representatives from the central bank and Ministry of Investment at its
annual policy forum on access to finance in MENA and held a regional conference in Cairo
on mobile banking.
100. IFC investments. IFC has assisted several banks through its Banking Advisory
Services especially in the development of their SME and retail operations and in the area of
risk management. IFC was also heavily involved in Banque Misr's pilot microfinance
operation which it launched in 18 branches. IFC has also been a key partner in many of
Financial Sector Projects funded by the Bank, including; (i) the Mortgage Finance Project
where IFC is investing 8.1 percent in the Egyptian Mortgage Refinance Company (EMRC)--
the liquidity facility; (ii) DPL I where the IFC bought shares (9.75 percent) in the privatized
Bank of Alexandria; and (iii) DPL II public sector shares in joint venture banks where IFC
participated with a 10 percent equity stake of the acquisition of Delta International Bank by
Ahli United Bank of Bahrain. Finally, IFC provided capacity building for financial
intermediaries, banks, NGOs, and MFIs, as well as micro and small enterprises and
supporting I-Score, which complements the work led by the Bank.
101. IBRD lending. The proposed DPL III operation is closely linked to five key financial
sector operations in Egypt. DPLs I and II (each US$ 500 million) that supported the
government in implementing the first generation of its Financial Sector Reform Program
(2004­2008) discussed above, where the focus was on attaining a sound and efficient
financial sector. The new DPL will have a greater emphasis on improving financial
intermediation and access. It is also linked and complement the work done under the
Mortgage Finance Project (equivalent to US$ 37.5 million) that aims to establish a mortgage
finance liquidity facility, strengthen the regulatory framework for mortgage lending, and
modernize property rights registration as well as the Affordable Mortgage Finance Program
DPL (US$ 300 million), which focuses on reforming the current system of inefficient and
poorly targeted supply-side subsidies for housing for the broad low and middle income sector
and replacing them with a transparent and economically efficient demand-side subsidy
system.
102. The proposed DPL III also complements and mutually reinforces the Enhancing
Access to Finance for Micro and Small Enterprises Project (US$ 300 million), which aims at
contributing to a sustainable improvement in inclusive (region and gender) access to finance
for micro and small enterprises on a commercial basis. This will ultimately lead to job
creation, poverty reduction, and economic growth as well as reduce the impact of the global
crisis on those enterprises, as it will result in improvements in institutions, financial
infrastructure, and the legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks, that would sustain the
increased levels of MSE lending, and access to finance more broadly.

D.       PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATIONS
103. In line with OP 8.60, the Bank advised the Egyptian government on the need and
importance of undertaking consultations on the reform program with the various stakeholders.
As such, this operation builds on the priorities identified by the government of Egypt during
the high-level policy workshop on Access to Finance that took place on March 17, 2008. The
workshop was co-chaired by the CBE and the Ministry of Investment and was attended by
government officials, representatives of private and public banks and non-bank financial
institutions (including MFIs and mortgage, insurance and leasing companies), investors,
entrepreneurs, as well as representatives from NGOs, trade unions, chambers of commerce,
and the Federation of Egyptian Industries. While the government was praised for its
achievements in restructuring and stabilizing the financial sector, the consultations
highlighted that access to finance was still a major area in which there was room for further
reform. Consequently, the Egyptian authorities' consultations with stakeholders provided the
foundation upon which the second generation of the Financial Sector Reform Program were
designed and crafted.
104. The government also confirmed to the Bank that consultations with relevant
stakeholders are a key component in the design and implementation of any reform policy.
This is evident in CBE's Banking Supervision Unit approach in issuing new regulation.
Before new regulations were drafted and issued stakeholder consultation meetings were held
at the CBE where both state-owned and private banks were invited to provide their feedback
on the specific regulation in questions. Extensive consultations took place between EFSA,
micro-finance institutions, banks, leasing companies, factoring companies and NGOs during
the drafting of the Non- Bank Licensing and Regulatory Law. Moreover, there is a standing
consultation committee hosted by the Egyptian Banking Institute with representatives from
the CBE, state-owned and private banks, members of the private sector, entrepreneurs, non-
bank financial institutions and academics in which reforms pertaining to financial
intermediation and SMEs' access to finance are discussed and modified according to
stakeholder feedback. To ensure coordination between the two regulators (CBE and EFSA)
there are also monthly meetings between the Governor of the CBE and the Chairman of
EFSA and a representative of each regulator serves on the Board of its counterpart. The
government also indicated that while it has been conducting consultations with the various
stakeholders all along - as evident in examples above - further consultations on the specific
reform program would continue throughout implementation.
E.       LESSONS LEARNED
105. The proposed operation is a stand-alone financial sector DPL--a follow-up on the
previous two financial sector DPLs, supporting the second generation of the reform program.
This design is consistent with the findings and recommendations of the 200 IEG review. IEG
notes that outcomes of loans classified under the Financial Sector Board (FSB) were
significantly better than outcomes of financial sector components of multi-sector loans.36
106. The success of past World Bank operations supporting financial sector reform
highlights the importance of a supportive macroeconomic environment, characterized by a
policy framework that prioritizes a long term growth agenda over the opportunistic
interventions dictated by short term cyclical needs that make policy hard to predict. The
private sector entrepreneurs need a stable and predictable policy environment in which to

component see IEG (2006), World Bank, p. 84.

operate. Without this overarching framework, no sectoral policy, be it related to financial
development or to human capital development, will be fully cost effective and sustainable
over time.
107. The operation also benefited from the experience of previous World Bank loans in
Egypt. The 1991 Structural Adjustment Loan did not receive satisfactory ratings as many of
the structural reforms aiming to reduce the role of the state and strengthen the private sector
fell short of expectations. The Technical Assistance Project for Privatization, Enterprise, and
Banking Sector Reform, approved in 1992 and cancelled in 1996 also received poor ratings,
with less than US$0.5 million disbursed out of US$ 9 million and meager progress on the
component to design and implement a comprehensive banking sector reform. In contrast,
DPLs I and II were successful because of the government's strong commitment to reform and
effective consultations with stakeholders. The reforms already implemented have contributed
to the resiliency of the financial system throughout the global financial crisis.
108. A key element of the World Bank discussions has been the approach to restructuring
of financial institutions in the reform program. Reducing the risk of further SOEs' NPLs to
the state-owned banks has been achieved by the privatization or closure of many
commercially nonviable state non-financial enterprises; an important element of the broader
reform program. Finally, the proposed engagement of the Bank over an adequate period of
time during the implementation of the government program aims at ensuring the attainment of
the program's medium-term objectives.
109. International evidence points to the potential for a significant increase in financial
inclusion through the development of branchless banking and through shifting government
payments into bank accounts. The potential for scaling-up financial access and extending
access to remote and underserved regions through these approaches has been demonstrated in
countries such as Brazil and Kenya.37 The early international experience with mobile phone
payments calls for the development of interoperable payments platforms, practical and risk-
based approaches to regulation that enable rather than stifle innovation, and shared networks
of cash-handling agents. There is also a need for product development that overcomes the
lack of human interaction and reliability concerns that may hinder customer adoption. Finally,
there is a need to put in place relevant consumer protection regulations.
110. Increasing cases of microfinance over-indebtedness globally, including in MENA
(Morocco), point to the importance of microfinance borrowers in urban concentrations being
included in credit information services. Growth in microfinance lending that is not
underpinned by rigorous credit policies and risk management, adequate management
information systems, and systems for sharing positive and negative client data, risks being
unsustainable. During the design of this operation the team has therefore emphasized to I-
Score, the Ministry of Investment, and the EFSA, the importance of extending I-Score to
include borrowers from the largest microcredit NGOs.

V.     THE PROPOSED THIRD FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY
       LOAN
A.     OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE OF THE PROPOSED OPERATION
i.     Objective of the Operation
111. The main objective of the operation is to assist Egyptian authorities in further
developing the enabling environment for financial intermediation and financial access, and
increase private participation in the provision of financial services, through a strengthened
bank and non-bank financial system. This operation supports the government's second
generation Financial Sector Reform Program (2009­2012), aimed at building up a financial
system that is more inclusive, competitive and effective in financial intermediation. This will
lead to a financial sector, capable of contributing to Egypt's growth performance and
providing access to a broad segment of Egypt's population, and combat the adverse
consequences of the global economic crisis. By providing ongoing support to the second
generation of the reform program, the proposed operation contributes to the sustainability and
irreversibility of the reforms and, therefore, to the fulfillment of its final objectives. The
indicative policy measures are outlined in the Operational Policy Matrix (Annex 1).
ii.    Rationale for Bank's Involvement
112. There is evidence of a strong and causal relationship between the depth, soundness
and efficiency of the financial system, and economic growth. Access to financial services is
an important factor in the reduction of poverty and inequality, and the improvement of
welfare among lower income families. The Bank Group's 2007 Strategy for the Financial
Sector emphasizes the use of Bank policy-based lending in support of market reform and
strengthening, and to the expansion of access. The proposed operation is crucial for
supporting the continuation and deepening of the financial sector reforms that were supported
by DPLs I and II. It is part of a comprehensive assistance that includes analytical work,
advisory services, and technical assistance. The Egyptian government has repeatedly
indicated its appreciation of the Bank's integrated delivery of assistance, and has requested
the operation to assist in reform implementation. The perception that the Bank is prepared to
remain engaged in the reform effort makes the institution a privileged partner. Moreover, the
operation provides an effective vehicle for the Bank to continue playing a leading
coordination role among the development partners.
B.     OPERATION DESCRIPTION AND POLICY AREAS
113. The proposed operation would support the government in the implementation of the
second generation financial sector reform program, and follows-up on achievements made
under DPLs I and II. This operation consists of five general pillars: (i) financial and
operational restructuring of state-owned banks; (ii) strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory architecture of the banking sector; (iii) reforming the non-bank financial sector;
(iv) strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework of the non-bank financial sector;
and (v) improving the financial and institutional infrastructure and legal framework. These
elements are explained below and shown schematically in the Policy Matrix in Annex 1.
Pillar I: Financial and Operational Restructuring of State-owned Banks
114. Substantial further progress in implementing the financial restructuring of the
state-owned commercial banks. The Ministry of Investment has now fully settled the
                                                      - 32 -

remaining SOEs' NPLs held by state-owned commercial banks, amounting to LE 10 billion.38
An agreement was signed in September 2009 between the Holding Companies of SOEs and
the National Bank of Egypt and Banque Misr to settle all remaining outstanding NPLs
through a debt-asset (land) swap. In addition, the stock of private sector NPLs was also
significantly reduced through the work out units created at the banks. Under the second
generation reforms the banks will continue their workout efforts as well as improving their
coverage ratios through adequate provisioning. By continuing the financial restructuring of
state-owned banks in a manner which ensures full compliance with prudential requirements,
fully settling NPLs and undertaking the necessary and parallel strengthening of the regulatory
environment, the operation helps support more efficient functioning of the financial system,
and its ability, in the medium-term, to improve financial intermediation and access in support
of real sector growth.
115. Continue the operational and institutional restructuring of the state-owned
commercial banks, and the in-depth program of improvement in information technology,
procedures, risk management, governance, and staff skills, will help prevent the reoccurrence
of NPLs as will the government's more prudent approach to SOE borrowing. Moreover,
lending transactions are monitored and conducted on an arm's length basis, and the SOEs are
being submitted to restructuring programs. The two state-owned banks are now ready to
expand credit in a proper manner to sustain the growth of the economy under the close
monitoring of CBE.
116. Submit the Egyptian Agriculture Bank Law (replacing Law 117 of 1972) to the
Cabinet of Ministers whereby PBDAC would be regulated by Law 88 of 2003, and issue
Ministerial Decree separating non-bank activities from commercial banking. The Egyptian
draft Agriculture Bank Law was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and the Prime Minister
on February 10, 2010, and will be submitted to Parliament this fiscal year. The new law
converts PBDAC into a state-owned bank regulated by CBE under Law 88 of 2003.39
PBDAC's governance structure will improve and a new Board of Directors will be formed
that will include external experts in financial, banking, and legal matters, as well as a
representative of the Ministry of Agriculture. Strengthened responsibilities and supervision by
CBE will be enforced.
117. On separation of activities, Ministerial Decree 749 of 2009 was issued on June 1, 2009
to remove non-banking activities from PBDAC and pave the way for its operations as a state-
owned bank, with corresponding regulation and supervision. This new status will give it the
capacity to expand lending to the rural economy and improve access to deposit and payments
services through new activities and products. All assets and employees will be transferred to
the new bank and the employees will be subject to the personnel rules governing employees
in state-owned commercial banks. The new bank's activities will be audited by the CAA and
by a private auditor.
118. The restructuring of PBDAC is key to the overall objective of enhancing access to
finance on which this operation focuses. PBDAC's extensive branch network in the form of
two governorate banks, 1,019 village banks, 24 satellite offices, and 191 branches gives it
unique access advantages and potential, and this unique network is increasingly interlinked
through the extension of internet connections. In addition to providing deposit services,
38
   Based on the June 2004 independent audits of the state-owned commercial banks , total SOEs NPLs amounted to LE 26
billion of which around LE 16 billion were settled under the first generation financial sector reforms (2004-2008).
39
   Law 117 of 1972 that currently governs PBDAC as a General Government Organization would be replaced by the
Agriculture Bank Law to place PBDAC under Law 88 of 2003, which governs state-owned commercial banks as well as
other banks.
                                                              - 33 -

payments services, lending for agriculture, as well as rural investment and consumers,
PBDAC also provides extensive MSE loans with more than half of PBDAC's outstanding
loans for less than LE 25,000 and a quarter below LE 10,000. The newly restructured
PBDAC, with stronger IT systems and risk management capacity, would be well placed to
provide comprehensive access to finance in rural areas, and to address the severely
constrained access of many rural MSMEs and low income population. PDBAC could play a
central role in the government's push to increase financial inclusion through providing
improved payments services, and e-money services linked to mobile phones and ATMs.
Pillar II: Strengthening the Regulatory and Supervisory Architecture of the Banking
Sector
119. Sign a protocol with the European Central Bank (ECB) and seven European
national central banks to assist in the implementation of Basel II accords. A new Euro
system technical assistance program on banking supervision was launched in early January
2009 for a period of three years ending December 2011 supported by various ECB experts,40
managed by a Resident Program Coordinator. This new program aims at supporting the CBE
in designing a Basel II framework customized to the Egyptian banking system through a long
term strategy which would lead Egypt to build a credible, risk-based supervisory and
regulatory framework in line with the best international practices. The program encompasses
Pillar I (capital adequacy) and Pillar II (supervisory review process) out of three pillars of the
Basel II framework taking into consideration the length of the program and the characteristics
of the Egyptian banking system. This new framework will help improve the management and
monitoring of risks in banks (mainly operational and credit risk in Egypt) and hence ensure
best practices going forward.
120. CBE has set up a group of qualified staff to work full time on Basel II framework
issues. A diagnostic of the needs of the Egyptian banking system has been conducted and
identified a set of strategic themes41 (nine) on which the program will focus during the
months to come. An intensive program of knowledge sharing and capacity building along
these themes has been performed with experts visiting Egypt from NCB partners (24 missions
in 2009 and 16 mission in 2010 so far). In addition, relevant staff from Basel II team
participated in study visits to central banks in Europe (five in 2009 and five in 2010 so far).
These study visits helped the CBE customize its strategy to Basel II implementation and take
stock of lessons learned.
121. Strengthen the CBE's macroprudential supervision by conducting annual stress
testing of the banking sector, and by preparing quarterly consolidated banking sector
reports that will serve as the basis for the CBE's Financial Stability Report. CBE has
enhanced its efforts to assess macro prudential risks. It has made considerable efforts to
improve its capacity for microprudential supervision aimed at detecting weaknesses at the
level of individual banks. In addition, the Banking Supervision Department set up a
Macroprudential Unit with the aim to assess and produce regular reports on main
developments in the Egyptian banking sector at the aggregate level. The unit has also started
to make use of several analytical tools to assess financial stability, by conducting regular
stress testing and standard financial soundness indicator analysis on the banking sector. The
Department is now in the process of strengthening the Macroprudential Unit with the aim to

   Own funds, market risk, credit risk, internal control, credit risk mitigation, operational risk, credit rating systems, Pillar II
issues, and accounting issues.
                                                            - 34 -

prepare and publish a full-fledged Financial Stability Report that will be the first report of its
kind in the MENA region. As a first step, the CBE has put together an Action Plan to prepare
the report by the end of 2011 (see Annex 8). The publication of Financial Stability Reports
has become standard international practice for assessing and communicating risks in the
financial system that may threaten financial stability. The published report will improve the
transparency of the CBE's risk assessment, facilitate broad communication with the financial
community and other interested parties, and encourage market discipline.
Pillar III: Reforming the Non-Bank Financial Sector
122. Enact Insurance Law 118 of 2008 (Article 27) separating the life from the non-life
insurance portfolios for all insurance companies; private and state-owned. The operational
restructuring of the four original state-owned insurers is complete. The branch structures of
MIC and Al-Chark Insurance Company have been rationalized and common head office
departments merged, with personnel savings (more than 1,000 to date) achieved through early
retirement arrangements. Wide ranging management changes have also taken place and IHC
has recently launched a staff development program that amongst other things identifies high
potential staff who will form future leadership cadres. Currently 150 individuals are being
streamed through this program. The final stage of the legal and financial restructuring of the
state-owned insurers involved transferring the run off non-life portfolio in NIC to MIC and
the reciprocal transfer of the MIC life insurance portfolio to NIC. The first of these portfolio
and business transfers took place in April 2010 and are now completed.
123. The separation of life and non-life activities will facilitate the strategic development of
IHC's insurance activities, and is required both under Egyptian law and IAIS prudential
standards.42 The move to specialized insurers will also ensure more effective asset-liabilities
management, more efficient use of capital and more efficient and specialized provision of
insurance services. Developmental benefits from the creation of two large specialized
financially sound insurers include their transformation into increasingly valuable assets for
the government, reduced fiscal exposure to non performing state owned entities and the
introduction of new business models that will lead to increased access opportunities for
underserved sections of the population.
124. The market as a whole also sees benefits in the IHC strategy for its insurance
subsidiaries.43 In particular it now sees the opportunity for growth in a market that is
characterized by fair and healthy competition between profit oriented insurers. Recent
research has pointed to a causal link between insurance sector development and economic
development, and the restructuring and strategic development respectively of the state-owned
insurance sector in the first and second generation reforms should significantly remove
historical roadblocks to this causality becoming effective in Egypt.44

125. Strengthen the regulatory framework governing collective investment vehicles
through issuing EFSA Decree 88 on December 21, 2009, and requires investment funds to use
an independent fund administration company to perform such functions as calculation of
NAV, record-keeping on investors and investment transactions, and calculation of
management fees and performance bonuses for fund managers. While this is a major step

42
   This is to protect long-term life insurance savings from the volatility of non life activities and to preempt cross subsidies
and inadequate capitalization.
43
   Some insurers regret the passing of Egypt Re. because it provided an implicit government subsidy when alternative
international reinsurance pricing was at the high end of the cycle.

Developing Countries, Journal of Risk and Insurance, Vol . 75, Issue 4, December 2008

forward, more needs to be done to make Egypt's regulations on collective investment
schemes more consistent with IOSCO best practices. Additional clarifications and
refinements would be useful to enhance the professionalism of investment fund managers;
modify rules on diversification; supplement rules on fund manager performance fees;
establish a code of ethics for investment managers; upgrade fund transparency and reporting;
and set higher standards for the marketing of investment funds to investors. In addition, the
relatively new development of REIFs and other CIS vehicles warrants regulatory attention.
EFSA is redrafting CML Executive Regulations on CIS, ensuring greater consistency with
IOSCO standards. These amendments will also lead to more flexibility in structuring the
investment funds, which could expand access to finance for micro and small companies
through the establishment of specialized SMEs venture capital funds.

Pillar IV: Strengthening the Regulatory and Supervisory Framework in the Non-
Banking Financial Sector
126. Issue Law 10 of 2009 regulating non-banking financial markets, institutions and
instruments consolidating the regulatory bodies of non-bank financial sector via the
establishment of EFSA. EFSA, which falls under the Ministry of Investment, became
operationally effective July 1, 2009. The new authority replaced the three authorities
regulating the non-bank financial services, namely the CMA, EISA, and MFA. EFSA is
responsible for the supervision of non-bank financial markets and instruments, including the
capital market, the stock exchange, all activities related to insurance services, mortgage
finance, financial leasing, factoring and securitization. Its main objective is to ensure market
stability as well as to regulate the concerned activities, and boost competition and attract more
local and foreign investments to the Egyptian market. The mandate of EFSA also includes
limiting systemic risk, realizing financial discipline and protecting rights of investors. The
new entity is also well placed to support capital market development through its oversight of
both the markets and the main long term institutional investors. The EFSA is uniquely well
placed to promote prudent and safe expansion of financial services, for example through the
proposed microfinance NBFI model.
127. Cabinet of Ministers approved Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory Law,
setting the regulatory and licensing framework for all non-bank financial institutions
including microfinance, financial leasing, and factoring, as well as standards in
transparency and corporate governance. The new draft law was approved by the Cabinet of
Ministers on March 24, 2010 and the regulatory framework is set. The new law will redraw
the boundaries of jurisdiction between EFSA and GAFI with respect to supervision over
companies, and will extend the licensing requirement to financial leasing, factoring and
microfinance. Additionally, the new law will strengthen EFSA's powers with respect to
market manipulation and will close supervisory gaps, as well as issuing prudential and capital
adequacy rules. EFSA would accordingly institute consistent and unified measures of
licensing, supervision and discipline across the non-bank financial markets, whereas
currently, non-bank financial services are governed by different laws and regulations.
128. The law would allow for the creation of the first commercial MFIs in Egypt with the
capacity to access commercial financing on a greater scale to reach million of clients in the
next five years. Newly established MFIs are likely to include a mixture of NGOs transformed
to MFIs, MFIs established by banks, investors, or NGOs as separate business entities and
international MFIs. Consequently, the new legislation will attract additional investment, spur
development of the micro-finance sector, increase competition and in doing so, create a larger
and more effective pool of resources for those seeking access to micro credit. The draft
                                             - 36 -

provisions that would be issued under the new law do not allow for deposit-taking by these
institutions. They set-out consumer protection and information requirements, as well as
transparency requirements, but do not comment on the need for microfinance NBFIs to report
to a credit bureau.
129. The NBFI Regulatory Law would also facilitate licensing of new leasing and factoring
companies and would clarify the legal position and standards for companies offering those
services. It would complement the proposed amendments to the Leasing Law 95 of 1995,
which are intended to increase the attractiveness of financial and operating leasing (although
in practice may reduce favorable tax treatment for financial leasing). Those amendments
include, allowing operational leasing as well as financial leasing, clarifying accounting
standards, including for depreciation and allowing leasing companies to securitize their
leasing portfolios.
130. Submit Private Pension Funds Law to the Cabinet of Ministers. The legislative
framework for private pension funds has been set and further improvements are expected to
be enacted through the new draft Private Pension Funds Law that was submitted to the
Cabinet of Ministers on November 9, 2009 and is expected to be submitted to Parliament for
adoption by December 2010. It promotes higher professional standards for private pension
provision and management by providing a comprehensive regulatory framework, including
mandatory registration, investment guidelines, funding requirements, governance, accounting,
reporting, audits, supervision and sanctions. While strengthening the role of EFSA as a
supervisory authority of private pension provision, the law also includes incentives to
members and fund managers, such as tax exemptions. The proposed regulations contained in
the proposed private pension law are consistent with international standards and took into
consideration previous technical cooperation provided by the Bank. While the new law will
not be enough to support a substantive expansion of the sector, it will represent a major
progress in the pre-conditions for a sustained development of the sector.
Pillar V: Improving the Financial Infrastructure and Legal Framework
131. Strengthen the payments system infrastructure and promote financial inclusion
through establishing the real-time gross settlement system and automatic clearing house
and extending their scope. Following the launch of the RTGS in March 2009, a full ACH is
being established to facilitate government payroll and pensions through debit cards. As a
result, 12 million monthly payments are expected to pass through the ACH in three years
time. Around 350,000 card-based accounts have so far been opened under this initiative,
mostly in Cairo, with eight banks participating, including all of the largest banks in Egypt (in
terms of network outreach) except for PBDAC, which is still improving its information
system and branch connectivity and may join later.
132. Direct credit services are planned with all rules and regulations benefiting from the
experience in Single Euro Payments Area in this regard. A major portion of taxes and customs
collections will be performed through the ACH. Even government vendors' payments will be
made using the ACH; government certified digital signatures; and the treasury single account
(TSA). The government makes 30,000-40,000 procurement-related transactions daily, mostly
through checks sent to SMEs (for example small tradespersons). These could instead be
made through ATMs and banks accounts. The `billers hub' that is currently used for bill
payment to mobile phone providers, could also be extended to cover payments to government,
and payment of credit card bills using direct debit arrangements. Further, a national inter-
bank switch system for ATM, Electric Funds Transfer-Point of Sale and inter-bank mobile
transactions has been established to support retail payments, and will be extended to cover the
                                             - 37 -

remaining four banks not yet included, and to handle local transactions in Egypt rather than
abroad. Payment systems regulations would be issued to cover licensing of payment service
providers and the oversight of payment services and systems.
133. CBE issues new regulations on mobile phone payments. The CBE's Board issued the
regulations and the CBE Sub-Governor issued the Circular to all banks on March 17, 2010 in
that effect. Four banks have already been licensed by the central bank to provide mobile
phone payments under this regulation namely, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation, BNP Paribas, Housing and Development Bank and Banque Misr. There are
currently 52.5 million GSM subscribers, which constitute a huge potential market for mobile
phone payments and other financial services. This regulation provides the required regulatory
space for the introduction and testing of mobile phone payment products for this market,
while ensuring that there are adequate regulatory protections in place, including for consumer
protection, dispute resolution, anti-money laundering, and IT security. The regulations also
include reference to the use of electronic money and the use of service agents, which are both
key components of mobile phone banking as a business model, although dedicated regulations
covering those areas still need further development.
134. Mobile phone banking provides a new opportunity to support the basic financial needs
of poor and underserved populations, whether for paying salaries, reimbursing suppliers, or
sending remittances. The regulator plays a critical role in providing sufficient regulatory
space for the introduction and testing of mobile phone products, while ensuring that as the
sector grows in size, there are adequate regulatory protections in place, in particular for
mobile phone payment users. In this context, issuance of regulations on mobile phone
payments is an essential first step to providing a legal framework within which private sector
solutions can start to meet the large potential consumer demand, including from low income
individuals, micro and small enterprises, and other financially-underserved groups.
C.     PROGRAM FEATURE AND LOAN AMOUNT
135. The proposed DPL would be a single-tranche loan in the amount of US$500 million
equivalent. Disbursement would occur upon effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. The
government reform program represents a consistent and self-reinforcing package
implemented over the medium term. The government position and vision for the sector are
laid out and detailed in a Letter of Development Policy. In sum, DPL III supports the second
generation reforms of the government reform program, which has a medium-term
implementation frame. Follow-up support from the World Bank, beyond the proposed loan,
could be envisaged in line with the progress of structural reforms and satisfactory
implementation of agreed restructuring and capacity building programs.
D.     EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE OPERATION
136. The positive developments that have taken place and will continue to take place under
the proposed operation should ultimately contribute to better resource allocation and long-run
growth performance. These reforms are building a more resilient, effective, well-capitalized,
and competitive financial system led by private sector banks and operating under a much
improved regulatory framework. By continuing the financial and operational restructuring of
public financial institutions and the full settlement of outstanding SOEs' NPLs together with
the necessary and parallel strengthening of the regulatory environment, the operation would
help support more efficient functioning of the financial system, and its ability, in the medium-
term, to improve financial intermediation and access in support of real sector growth.
                                            - 38 -

137. The full implementation of the bank reforms should result in a well-capitalized and
competitive banking system led by private sector banks operating under a much improved
regulatory framework and with the potential to safely and prudently expand its provision of
financial services to new clients and sectors. Bank credits are beginning to recover and
should expand further in the next few years, after several years of decline relative to GDP and
bank assets (a normal outcome in periods of restructuring and regulatory reform). Moreover,
the private banks are preparing themselves for lending to under-served sectors, such as
housing and SMEs. These are positive developments, which should ultimately contribute to
better resource allocation and long-run growth performance.
138. The insurance sector reforms should result in a more innovative sector with greater
client coverage, with healthy competition built around the full marketing mix rather than
being just price based (backed by an implicit government guarantee in the case of the state-
owned insurers). Two well-capitalized and specialized state-owned insurers with widespread
branch networks, one in life and one in non-life, are beginning to consider new markets and
new business models (micro-insurance and banc-assurance). There will be more access to
insurance services and products through links with the banks and microfinance institutions as
consumer and mortgage lending grows. The institutional investors will be able to have more
input into capital market developments through the establishment of the integrated non bank
supervisor.
139. Private pension reforms will enhance the development of the currently weak and
under-regulated long term retirement savings schemes, by providing appropriate incentives
and regulatory framework and enabling the prudent growth in uptake of private pension's
schemes. In addition to tax incentives, reforms in the currently unsustainable public pension
schemes will provide space for a more significant role of individual and occupational pension
plans. Capital market reforms are expected to--among other things--improve the pricing of
investment certificates and increase overall transparency and disclosure of investment funds,
address SME Access to finance needs by facilitating the establishment of specialized (such as
small cap) funds and improve access to finance for corporation and public authorities by
activating fixed income market for medium- and long-term finance.
140. The payments system infrastructure and regulations outlined under this loan should
enable the Egyptian economy, and its financially underserved groups, to benefit from the
massive potential for increased access to finance that branchless banking and government to
person payments offer. Electronic payments through bank accounts, rather than as cash
through the Post Office or bank tellers, would significantly advance financial inclusion.
Banks could provide other valuable financial services to customers that receive card-based
accounts under the Pensions and Payments Initiative, as they build up valuable information on
those new customers.
141. The 52.5 million GSM subscribers in Egypt that could potentially use mobile phone-
based services linked to banks (withdrawals, deposits, remittances, bill payments, and other
payments), is an even larger potential market. The low barriers to access of branchless
banking technologies such as mobile phone payments, offer the potential to reach a
significantly larger proportion of the Egyptian population than at present, including rural,
remote and low income groups. Mobile phone banking is significantly less costly and more
efficient than physical transactions and relatively expensive bank branches, and can provide
access to finance even when bank branches are not readily accessible. Branchless banking,
including mobile phone payments, can also have a wider positive economic impact by
                                            - 39 -

allowing people to move out of cash-based informal systems and participate in the formal
economy.
142. The creation of a microfinance company model should facilitate the development of a
more vibrant microfinance sector that significantly expands access to finance, with related
economic benefits for low-income and rural populations in Egypt. This new legal model
would help attract private sector investment in the microfinance sector, and establish
standards for transparency and corporate governance for microfinance institutions. The
resulting increased private sector investment and expertise would contribute to a more viable
and robust microfinance sector, helping Egyptian authorities meet the dual challenges of
reducing unemployment and poverty. The EFSA reports significant pent-up investment that
would flow into the new microfinance company model, with banks, non-financial companies,
and international microfinance funds all with strong interest. At least three microfinance
institutions are already in discussions to set-up microfinance companies with investors.
Moreover, this type of microfinance institution falls under the financial regulator, the EFSA,
which represents an important step towards a more appropriate and effective regulation and
supervision of the microfinance sector, even beyond those institutions licensed by the EFSA.
The largest five microfinance NGOs have already expressed their willingness to adhere to the
standards in the new law and the subsequent microfinance provisions, including for sharing
credit information.
143. Leasing and factoring, by providing lower risk and more efficient forms of finance
that bypass SME collateral and informational constraints, can significantly improve SME
access to and uptake of financial services. While leasing provides a means to SMEs of
investing in growth through the expansion and upgrading of productive capacity, factoring
can increase turnover and improve access to higher return markets. Reverse factoring, or
`purchase' factoring (currently provided by the largest factoring provider in Egypt, `Egypt
Factors'), can give access to finance for smaller enterprises that would not otherwise be
considered creditworthy by banks, as it is based on the financial strength and record of a
larger `buyer'. Both could thereby result in an expanded and more competitive SME sector,
which generates higher levels of income and employment. However, while the EFSA
anticipates several new applications for leasing company licenses, an existing leasing
company was concerned about potential changes to tax treatment in the amendments being
considered for the Leasing Law of 1995.
144. The CBE leadership role on access to finance that is envisioned under this loan would
provide a clear message to banks to prioritize access, with strong risk management and more
efficient lending made possible by the availability of credit scores, SME ratings, a unified
collateral database and legal framework for secured lending, improved SME sector data, and
the removal of unnecessary legal constraints. Credit information, scoring and ratings would
reduce information asymmetry, credit risk and lending costs. SME finance banker training
should also boost the volume of good quality bank lending to SMEs in Egypt as well as
improving communication and critical information flows between banks and SMEs. Data
from the enterprise census survey should be useful for banks to better design SME financial
products, and the central bank to facilitate and monitor progress in improving financial
inclusion.
145. All this is expected to result in significant and sustained improvements to financial
access, through financial infrastructure improvements, legal reforms, and the policy measures
identified. These cover payments system infrastructure, information asymmetry and credit
risk management, branchless banking, microfinance supervision and regulation, and SME
                                                       - 40 -

creditworthiness, and would lead to financial services becoming available to a much larger
proportion of potential users, including underserved groups, through well supervised
institutions. The CBE and the Ministry of Investment would send an important signal through
this operation that access to finance is a priority for economic growth and development.
Progress in the implementation of the Financial Sector Reform Program will be monitored,
and its output, outcomes, and impact will be assessed and measured through various
indicators for each sector. These reforms are creating the conditions for a much more resilient
and effective financial sector, capable of positively contributing to Egypt's growth in the
remainder of the decade and beyond.

VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.       POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
146. Recent evidence has shown that a developed financial system can help reduce poverty
and income inequality. Through its effect on growth, a mature financial system can also help
reduce poverty, through the strong and causal relationship between the depth and reach of
financial systems and economic growth. Empirical studies of Egypt show that poverty
elasticity to growth is fairly high, estimated at -2.7 in February 2008/09 (World Bank,
2009).45 Getting the financial system in Egypt to function more effectively and provide the
full range of financial services is a task that will be well rewarded with economic growth and
reduced poverty. This is especially needed in rural areas. As shown in Figure 6, the poorest in
the rural areas were the only group in the country that experienced negative growth rates in
their consumption expenditure between 2005 and 2008.Restructuring PBDAC, one of the
major proposed reforms under the current operation, should, for example, have a positive
poverty reduction impact and will improve living standards of rural Egyptians through both
growth and income distribution channels. As PBDAC lends heavily to agriculture, growth
performance of this sector will improve and will have a positive impact on poverty reduction.
This is true not only because 75 percent of the Egyptian poor lives in rural areas (World
Bank, 2009), but also because empirical evidence shows that the elasticity of poverty with
respect to the growth of value added in agriculture (estimated at three) is the largest among all
sectors of the Egyptian economy (World Bank, 2009). Meanwhile, strengthening the PBDAC
structure will allow for more effective use of its extensive branch network.46 As noted in 2006
World Bank report, rural households located close to a bank branch are 22 percent more
likely to have formal savings or investments. Moreover, PBDAC extends micro loans from
LE 500 to LE 3,000, with terms from one to five years. This means the operation will, holding
everything else constant, lead to a more equitable income distribution, simply by targeting
and reaching low-income potential borrowers. This corroborates the findings of many
empirical studies on the role of improving households' access to financial services in reducing
poverty and improving income equality. Even if the proposed operation is shown to have
some unexpected negative distributional implications, they are most likely to be outpaced by
the above mentioned poverty impacts of growth and more equitable income distribution.
There is evidence that there is a relatively higher impact of growth and a lower impact of
inequality on poverty levels in the rural areas of Lower Egypt, and a very low elasticity of
poverty to inequality (World Bank, 2009).



45
   The elasticity of poverty to growth is the percentage change in the poverty rate given a percentage change in mean
consumption levels.
46
   As previously noted PBDAC has branches in more than 1000 villages, many of which are among the poorest villages.
                                                      Figure 6: Growth Incidence Curves,
                                                     2005-2008, for Egypt, Urban and Rural
                                                                     Areas
                                            - 41 -

147. Bank restructuring would normally be
associated in the short-term with staff
redeployment resulting from optimization of
labor input and skill upgrading. To mitigate
the potential social impact of the restructuring
process in the first-generation reforms that
focused on state-owned commercial banks,
voluntary severance packages were offered to
employees who wished to avail themselves of
early retirement schemes. Training programs
were also offered to staff whose positions at
their level of expertise may be eliminated. The
proposed operation, which supports second-
generation reforms, concerns broad strategic
reform decisions that do not include personnel
reduction, and would, therefore, not include a
social protection component. In addition to the
training programs to upgrade the capacity of
PBDAC staff, the plan is to make use of the
abundant human resources in PBDAC to
provide more effective outreach to low-income
rural households, even in the villages where
there are no branches of PBDAC.             The
proposed operation would have no significant
impact on clients or social groups that might be
foregoing benefits currently accruing to them
from state-owned banking activities. Indeed,
state-owned commercial banks had already
stopped government-directed lending policies,
and were no longer extending credit to public enterprises unable to service debt. The
preparation of the proposed operation has entailed broad discussions with market participants
from across the financial sector.
148. The policy measures outlined in this operation would improve the opportunities for
SMEs and for low income individuals to gain access to financial services, including female-
headed enterprises and for women. Mobile phones will provide a low cost point of access for
financial services, which will benefit women due to the low barriers to entry in terms of cost,
distance to travel, and paperwork. Women will also be brought into the financial system
through the Government's drive to offer pensions and public sector salaries through bank
accounts.
B.     IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
149. The Bank will work closely with the authorities to ensure that the overall status of the
government's Financial Sector Reform Program is on track. Regular Bank missions will
interact closely with the two main counterparts, Ministry of Investment and CBE--the two
entities responsible for overall implementation of the reform program, and for coordinating
actions among other concerned agencies. Bank staff will also interact with the different
regulatory and supervisory bodies given their responsibility for supervising financial
institutions. Bank staff will continue the policy dialogue from the field with the institutions
involved in the implementation of the operation, as well as coordinate effectively with donors
                                            - 42 -

and consult with stakeholders. The government and the Bank will exchange views on the
progress in the implementation of the second generation reform program to ensure that the
expected project outputs, outcomes and impact materialize.
i.     Continuing Bank Dialogue with the Egyptian Authorities
150. The Bank will continue the policy dialogue with the Egyptian authorities on the
financial sector reforms. The financial sector dialogue conducted over the past few years has
allowed for differences between the authorities and the World Bank to be narrowed down,
and for a common view to emerge on a number of sector policy issues embodied in the
Financial Sector Reform Program. There has been a broad agreement on the substance and
design of the operation components, the scope of Bank assistance, and the importance of
proceeding diligently with the reform program. Actions on these components are, overall,
progressing satisfactorily. There is also a shared understanding among development partners
actively involved in the financial sector reforms, in particular United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), EU, and AfDB that are supporting the objectives of the
proposed operation and have indicated their intent to continue their financial and technical
assistance to the authorities in the financial sector, all of which would ensure effective
completion of the reform program. In that context, the Bank will ensure the deployment of
staff and consultants able to advise the government in all of the policy and technical areas
pertaining to the reforms.
ii.    Monitoring Output, Outcomes and Impact of the Operation
151. Monitorable indicators have been developed by the Government to assess progress in
the implementation of the operation, supporting the Financial Sector Reform Program.
152. Bank performance. Two aspects of bank performance would be closely scrutinized,
solvency and enhanced access. Indicators used to assess bank solvency include, NPLs-to-
total loans ratios, SOE's NPLs, and provisions-to-NPLs; while those to assess access include
increase in government-to-person payments through financial institutions, and increase in
mobile phone payment transactions. Two indicators related solely to PBDAC (its coverage
ratio and the number of financial products offered) as well the overall capital adequacy ratio
of the banking system will also be monitored. On banking supervision, indicators used are
periodic stress testing of the aggregate balance sheet of the banking sector and individual
banks, the publication of a financial stability report at least once a year, and having a
100 percent of Egyptian banks have adopted the Basel II framework.
153. Non-bank performance. Measures to be used to assess performance of the insurance,
pension and capital market sectors include, gross non-life premium to GDP, gross adjusted
life premium, number of mutual funds, number of new bond issues and investment funds'
assets under management. Other non-bank performance indicators include ratio of leasing
assets to GDP; microfinance, leasing and factoring companies licensed under the NBFI Law;
the number of active female microfinance clients; and outstanding microfinance portfolio.

C.     FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

i.     Public Financial Management (PFM)

154. As stated in OP 8.60--Development Policy Lending "Drawing on relevant analysis of
the country's PFM, the Bank determines whether the operation should include measures to
address identified fiduciary weaknesses". The 2003 CFAA concluded that the Egyptian PFM
system constituted a significant fiduciary risk due to the perceived weaknesses in accounting
                                             - 43 -

and reporting process and oversight functions whether through internal audit, external audit or
the Parliament. The Minister of Finance is particularly interested in getting an assessment of
the development risk inherent in the massive PFM reforms, whether launched or planned, and
in the sequencing of those reforms.
155. The Bank launched a CFAA update in 2007 and some significant improvements were
noted. Highlights include a major increase in transparency, including making public the
2004/05 budget; the extension of the 2005/06 budget to include quasi-fiscal activities for
payments to state enterprises and consumers and to bring into the TSA approximately 5000
special revenue accounts of ministries, departments and agencies. The passage of revisions to
the Law on Accounting gave authority for the creation of the TSA and the introduction of a
GFS-2001-compliant chart of accounts with an eight-chapter classification structure. The
government signed the IMF's Special Data Dissemination Standard and now prepares a
monthly Financial Bulletin and a quarterly Economic Monitor. Ministry of Finance (MOF) is
continuing its work to establish a well-trained macro-fiscal unit to prepare a multi-year fiscal
and expenditure framework to guide future budget preparation activities and has issued a
policy forbidding state guarantees for state enterprises.
156. While work on other key reforms continues, further improvements could be achieved
through the implementation of the budget process modernization plan for budget preparation,
execution and reporting through: (i) drafting revised budget legislation; (ii) launching the
process of restructuring the MOF including development of the internal audit function; (iii)
finalizing the implementation of the TSA process; and (iv) developing a plan for
implementing an integrated information system.
ii.    Corporate Financial Reporting (CFR)

157. The Ministry of Investment is leading the reform in the area of CFR through many
initiatives that are funded either locally or by international donors. During the past three
years, Egypt had made significant efforts to align CFR requirements with international
standards and to close the "compliance gap" in both accounting and auditing practices. The
Bank launched an Accounting and Auditing ROSC update in 2007 and some significant
improvements were noted. Highlights include (i) the drafting of a new Accounting Practice
Law which has been reviewed by the Bank, though not yet been ratified; (ii) translating of
IFRS into Arabic and developing the needed arrangements to update annually; (iii) issuing
quality control standards as a listing requirement; and (iv) working on translating the
International Standards on Auditing.
D.    DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
158. The proposed operation will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for DPLs.
The amount will be disbursed in one tranche in the full amount of the loan, against
government agreement on the medium-term framework of policy and institutional reforms as
summarized in the Letter of Development Policy.
159. Flow of funds (including foreign exchange) is subject to normal financial management
processes. It is not possible to track the ultimate use of the foreign exchange provided by the
DPL proceeds, but loan proceeds flow into a dedicated account at CBE and from it to Egypt's
budget, and are thus subject to normal PFM processes and CBE procedures. As an additional
fiduciary arrangement and by way of a letter, the government will provide confirmation to the
Bank when the loan amount has been credited to an account used to finance budgeted
expenditures. The diagram below depicts the envisaged flow of funds arrangements:
                                                           - 44 -

          World Bank                        CBE                            Ministry of       Budget
                                             US$                            Finance         Egypt PFM
                                        Dedicated Bank                         LE
                                           Account                       General Account,
                                                                              CBE

160. As there are no IMF Safeguard Assessments available for the CBE and its external
audit reports are not published, the Bank will request the auditors of the CBE to provide a
special opinion confirming that the DPL funds went into the state official foreign exchange
reserves then into the state budget taking into account the accuracy of the exchange rate used
at the transaction. The audit should be conducted six months after the funds in the dedicated
account have been fully utilized. The time period for the submission of the audit report to the
Bank is three months. A timely audit of this nature was conducted for the previous Egypt
DPL with no findings noted.
E.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
161. Based on the assessment of key policy areas supported by the operation carried out by
the team, the proposed operation is not likely to have any significant positive or negative
effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources. According to OP/BP 8.60,
safeguard policies (such as OP4.01 Environmental Impact Assessment) do not apply to
development policy lending, and an Integrated Safeguard Data Sheet (ISDS) is not needed.
However, the team will continue to identify and monitor any possible implications (both
positive and negative) of policy measures the operations supports such as the restructuring of
state-owned financial intuitions. Furthermore, any potential negative environmental effects on
agricultural credit that may occur as a result of the conversion of PBDAC to a state-owned
commercial bank can be mitigated through a complimenting operation's (the Enhancing
Access to Micro and Small Enterprises Project) Environment Management Plan. This plan
has been adopted by the Social Fund for Development which is mandated by Law 141 of
2004 as the institution responsible for the development of SMEs.47 In doing so, the team has
ensured the environmental soundness of the project and prevented the funding for economic
activities that may exert negative impacts on human development and the environment in
general.
F.      RISKS AND RISKS MITIGATION
162. Potential risks associated with the Financial Sector Reform Program and the proposed
operation can be divided into two types: (i) country risks, including political risk,
stakeholders' opposition, and fiscal sustainability; and (ii) operational risks, including the
governance risks associated with restructuring and recapitalizing state-owned banks, and the
risk of non-sustainability and reversibility of the reform program. Measures to mitigate such
risks have been considered under the reform program supported by this operation, and have
also been discussed. Nevertheless, the risks, uncertainties and challenges that may affect the
implementation of the reform program are non-trivial and must be acknowledged.
i.          Country Risks
163. At the country level, there are political risks associated with the upcoming elections,
in May and November of 2010 upper house Advisory Council and lower house People's
Assembly's are set to take place respectively while Presidential elections are set to take place
in September 2011. Any potential change in government might lead to a slowdown in the
implementation of the reform program. Uncertainties in the international economic

47
     The majority of PBDAC's clients are small and medium enterprises.
                                             - 45 -

environment, the increasing exposure of IBRD in Egypt, and risks related to fiscal
sustainability have also been taken into consideration by the team.
164. While any change in government may present itself as a potential risk to the pace and
effectiveness of reforms, the Financial Sector Reform Program has been cemented to the
fabric of the sector with very specific measures taken in earlier operations to ensure
irreversibility. The government's commitment to the program for the past four years has been
displayed at the very highest level--the Letter of Development Policy shows both the
executive and legislative commitment to the program. Moreover, the CBE, one of this
operation's two main counterparts, is a separate and independent entity and its current
Governor (whose term ends in 2012, after the closing date of the proposed operation) has
been a strong advocate for and engineer of the current reform program.
165. With regards to fiscal costs of the reform program, settlement of NPLs of SOEs owed
to the state-owned banks would not have fiscal implications as it is done through a debt-asset
(mainly land) swap. Moreover, no compensation for voluntary retirements is foreseen as a
result of the reform program supported by DPL III. There are no plans to lay off redundant
workers are foreseen during the phase of reforms. In cases of redundant workers, such as in
Banque du Caire, employees were trained to support lending the micro and small enterprises.
The other major fiscal costs in the banking, insurance and pension sectors have already
occurred and the reformed institutions are becoming profitable.
166. As previously examined in more detail,48 although the government faces the challenge
of managing a large fiscal deficit and a sizable public sector debt, the debt remains
manageable under various reasonable scenarios. The debt projections will not be significantly
affected by the borrowing as part of the proposed operation and the actions under it. But
success of the financial sector policy reform hinges on a stable and predictable
macroeconomic environment, which will be difficult to achieve without returning to the fiscal
consolidation program initiated since 2005, and the public debt borrowing strategy shifts
toward a more diversified holder base that depends less on public banks holding significant
amounts of government paper.
ii.         Operational Risks
167. There are two main operational risks associated with the implementation of the
proposed project. The first of these risks is related to the restructuring of state-owned banks
and recapitalization without privatization. While the challenges associated with restructuring
state-owned financial institutions are well documented, the risk of suboptimal use of funds to
shore up their balance sheet structure should not be underestimated. The financial
restructuring of state-owned banks in which the state has not declared its intention to divest
its shareholding entails risks that the restructured institution and the government may not
depart from old lending practices that were at the root of current problems. The history of
state-owned bank restructuring in many countries is full of cases of bank recapitalization that
have gone awry and led to instances of financial support that failed to shore up the bank's
position on a sustained basis. This operation faces this risk with regard to the restructuring of
the state-owned specialized banks.
168. To reduce this risk, the operation depends first on the commitment of the government
to banking and financial sector reform, demonstrated by the substantial reform efforts that
have already taken place in both the financial sector and the state-owned enterprises, and in
strengthening the central bank regulatory and supervisory role. This commitment has meant

that the state-owned commercial banks have continued to improve their performance and as
long as the commitment continues the same is likely to be true for the state-owned specialized
banks. Second, the financial restructuring and recapitalization plan is being implemented by
new, commercially-oriented management and involves a much stronger governance
framework and an overhaul of lending and risk control practices. Full implementation of the
institutional and operational restructuring plan is thus a critical part, and a specific focus of
the government and central bank's banking sector reform program. .As the institutions will
remain in public hands, it will be crucial to ensure good governance structure and close
monitoring of the restructuring plans by the CBE (acting on the owner's behalf) throughout
the restructuring period. Top quality bank management, committed to reforms, will also need
to be ensured in order to sustain reform momentum. The current CEO of PDBAC has played a
critical positive role in its progress to date.
169. Moreover, the risk of retaining a financial institution in public hands would be
mitigated through further strengthening the credible and independent regulatory authorities,
which is part of the reform program supported by DPL III. Strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework is essential for ensuring previous problems do not recur and
sustainability. It is crucial to continue the ongoing program to strengthen the bank regulation
and supervision framework, including further strengthening off-site supervision, improving
banks' provisioning, risk management and governance. The credibility and independence of
the regulator is the base upon which a resilient financial system may emerge. The risks
associated with this component relate to the authorities' ability, within the program
timeframe, to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework. These risks will be
mitigated by supporting the banking and insurance supervisors' on-going efforts to implement
the programs that have been devised.
170. Another operational risk is the potential non-sustainability and reversibility of the
reform program. The past five years have proven that the government is committed to the full
implementation of the reform program, and in many cases to delivering more than was
envisioned. The successful completion of the first generation of the financial sector reform
program, the strong dialogue to date and the requests for technical assistance to implement the
reforms leave the Bank confident of the sound execution of the second generation of the
Reform Program.

                      ANNEX 3: FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE (2004-2008)

BANKING SECTOR

1.        The reform program initiated in 2004 has transformed the structure of the Egyptian banking sector.
Under the government's reform program, the minimum bank capital requirement was increased and supervision
has been strengthened. As a result, weaker banks have left the system through mergers and acquisitions as well
as exit of some foreign banks' branches. The number of banks has declined from 57 in 2004 to 40 in 2007, with
a corresponding increase in average bank size. The state-owned banks have divested most of their shares in joint
venture banks, reducing that element of indirect state ownership and management of banks. These measures
have resulted in a significant decline of the share of banks with state participation from more than 75 percent in
2004 to about 43 percent in 2008.

2.       The reform program adopted by the Government of Egypt proved successful in boosting profitability as
evident in the rise of Return-on-average assets from 0.5 in 2004/05 to 0.8 in 2007/08, and Return on average
equity from 7.7 in 2004/05 to 13.5 in 2007/08. Furthermore, the banking sector witnessed an increase in
efficiency, evident in the decrease of cost to income ratio from 43.3 in 2004/05 to 37.2 in 2007/08. The reported
average equity-to-total asset ratio in commercial banks has also risen from 5.5 percent in 2007 to 6.1 percent in
2008; while the capital adequacy ratio has reached 14.7 percent in 2007/08. The financial situation of Egyptian
banks has improved significantly in recent years, although the experience of large scale banking restructuring
programs in Central Europe and other regions suggests that capital ratios in Egypt will only be stabilized and
measured with accuracy when the reform program is fully implemented.

INSURANCE AND PENSIONS SECTOR

3.       Following the first generation reforms aggregate profitability for both state-owned insurers and for the
industry as a whole is heading towards adequate levels (Table A3.3). In addition the sector appears to have
weathered the credit crisis storm well in terms of solvency. Recent industry growth has reflected the move
towards adequate motor third party liability premiums and the rapid growth of comprehensive motor (which had
also been operating at a loss) partly reflecting the burgeoning car fleet in Egypt,49 with overall motor premiums
growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.4 percent between 2004/05 and 2008/09. Private

been adopted by a number of foreign insurers, also showed healthy growth. Offsetting these gains there has
been severe price competition in fire and property business. In common with other Middle Eastern countries,
Egypt lags its peers (in terms of GDP/ capita) on insurance penetration metrics and this will be a key focus of
the second generation reforms.

4.       The third party motor vehicle insurance (MTPL) market was improved financially through price
increases and claims capping, with gross loss ratios reducing from 412 percent in 2004/5 to 195 percent in
2008/9 (Table A3.4). In addition private insurers began to enter the market and the state-owned insurer MTPL
market share has reduced from 98 percent to nearer 70 percent.

5.       Non banking assets under management grew rapidly in nominal terms over the restructuring period
from LE 14.4 billion to LE 24.2 billion, and broadly maintained their relationship to nominal GDP (Table A3.5)
despite adverse inflationary trends. 50 Once macro settings are normalized and given plans in place to introduce
new marketing mixes after the final life non-life split of the State Owned Insurers (SOIs) on July 1st, 2001 there
should be a steady increase in both access and penetration measures.
6.        Performance metrics. EFSA produces comprehensive data on the insurance sector each year that
facilitate the production of the relevant performance metrics. From July 2010 it will be possible to produce
these separately for life and non life. Benchmarks for insurance vary widely between classes of insurance and
countries and trends within Egypt will be more important. For strategic sectoral development (including the
development of the state-owned insurers) key measures that should be monitored by the authorities are as
follows:
         Non Life ­ penetration ratio, loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio (the sum of the previous two)
         plus a solvency measure consisting of the ratio of net assets to net premiums and a technical provision
         strength ratio consisting of the ratio of technical provisions to the average of the two previous year's
         net paid premiums. Balance sheet ratios will be calculated for the industry as a whole and for the state-

7.       Around 600 private pension plans operate in Egypt, but around 65 percent of them were established by
government owned organizations or the public sector. Out of the rest, 12 percent correspond to syndicates,
banks and universities in equal proportions, and only 22 percent to the rest of the private sector. Most of the
plans are defined benefit, operate on a pay-as-you go basis and pay lump sums to beneficiaries. While the
schemes have been regulated by the Egypt Insurance Supervision Authority since 1975, the funds were not
subject to strict reporting rules.
8.        As shown in Table A3.6, between years 2000 and 2005 private pension funds in Egypt represented a
low but increasing percentage of GDP (less than 3 percent). Between 2005 and 2009 the trend reverted and the
funds represented continuously lower percentage of GDP. In addition, absence of active portfolio management
is reflected in high concentration of investments in government bonds and liquid assets.

9.        Several factors converge to explain the poor performance of private pensions. The generous and
unsustainable benefits of the mandatory pension plans with artificially high implicit rates of return preclude the
expansion of complementary retirement saving plans. The ongoing reform process of public pension schemes is
therefore a key piece to revert the situation and provide incentives to expand private savings for retirement. In
parallel to the market growth, the shift to efficient portfolio management requires a sound regulatory framework
improving the governance of the pension funds, requiring the adoption of investment policies and improving the
role of EFSA as supervisor.
10.      In 2008, the insurance supervision authority conducted an independent actuarial valuation of 25
pension funds representing more than 50 percent of the total assets managed by the industry (equivalent to 18.6
billion LE). The result of this valuation showed that the funds had surplus using the ongoing valuation, but that
solvency valuation showed deficits in all but three of the 25 pension funds, with funding ratios of less than 50

   The increase in assets in 2007/8 reflects bubble returns on single premium investment linked contracts and the drop in
insurance assets in 2009 partly reflects commensurate surrenders during the subsequent credit crisis.. These asset swings
were largely confined to the banc-assurers. The average growth rate over the 2 years was 15.2 percent.

11.      In order to improve reporting standards, increase the supervision authority and create pre-conditions for
the expansion of the sector, EISA (now EFSA) prepared a set of regulations including new valuation rules and a
comprehensive new law for private pensions. The valuation rules, adopting solvency criteria, were set in place
in 2009, and the draft law was prepared and is ready to be submitted to the cabinet. The main areas of the new
private pension law include provisions on: (i) registration and licensing of pension funds; (ii) financing and
investments; (iii) governance and management; (iv) supervision and control; (iv) merger and liquidation of
companies; (v) optional pension companies; (vi) taxation; and (vii) penalties.

CAPITAL MARKET SECTOR

12.      During the fiscal years 2004/2005- 2007/2008 the Egyptian Capital market witnessed remarkable
developments in several fronts. Investor protection and disclosure was of paramount importance on the reform
agenda. The activation of the "Investor Protection Fund" insuring investors against the actions of financial
intermediaries pertinent to non-trading risk, the establishment of an Auditors Oversight Board to monitor the
performance of auditors for listed companies, and financial institutions operating in the non-bank financial
services field were amongst the main outcomes of the reform agenda. Additionally, new regulations were set in
place to combat insider trading while setting a broad definition and scope for such a violation.

13.       Last but not least, new trading mechanisms, including margin trading, short selling, and same day
trading were introduced to the market as well as setting the regulatory framework for issuing new financial
instruments including asset and mortgaged backed securities, money market funds certificates, real state funds
certificates, and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).

14.       As a result of the aforementioned measures, the annual value of trading reached EGP 547 billion during
the FY 2007/2008 up from EGP 73 billion during the FY 2004/2005, with an increase of more than 6 folds
(Table A3.8). Additionally, the annual volume of trading increased by more than 7 times to reach 20 billion
securities in FY 2007/2008 compared to 2 billion securities in FY 2004/2005. Foreign and Arab investors
increased from 9,693 to 13,622 and from 10,246 to 19,304 between the fiscal years 2004/2005 ­ 2007/2008
respectively. Furthermore, the number of mutual funds increased to 44 funds during the FY 2007/2008
compared to 24 funds during the FY 2004/2005.

1.       The reforms initiated over the past few years ­ in particular the enactment of the new "Central Bank,
Banking System and Money Law", the floating of the Egyptian currency, the liberalization of interest rates, and the
strengthening of monetary policy framework ­ set the stage for the development of a more efficient banking system.
2.       Under the comprehensive "Financial Reform Program" recently approved by the Egyptian government ­
which addresses, inter-alia, the problems of state-owned banks ­ the CBE is managing the banking reform program
on behalf of the government (owner of the public banks) and to this effect is acting through the "Banking Reform
Unit" established at the Central bank. In this context, the owner has directed the board of directors, and the chairman
of the board, to develop and implement an institutional and operational strengthening program for each state-owned
commercial banks (henceforth the Bank) in coordination with the Banking Reform Unit. Any potential financial
restructuring of the Bank will be made conditional on a convincing and detailed institutional and operational
strengthening plan which would provide comfort to the Egyptian authorities ­ owner and regulator ­ and the
market that the restructured institution would be able subsequently to operate and grow on a commercially
sustained basis in increasingly open and competitive markets.
3.        The development of the program is being carried out by dedicated staff ­ including external expertise
involving, as required, a specialized firm or banking institution with sub-contract arrangements as the need may be ­
with appropriate professional qualifications and experience (numbers, skills) in assignments concerning banking
institutions of comparable nature, size, and complexity. The program of operational and institutional strengthening is
conducted and coordinated by the Bank's management working closely with the Board in coordination with the
Banking Reform Unit acting on the owner's behalf. The following sections outline an all exhaustive suggested
framework which would be tailored to the specific situation, needs and priorities of each bank.
II.      General Scope of the Program
4.        This note defines the overall framework of the program of operational and institutional strengthening which
will enable the Bank to function successfully as a modern, competitive commercial bank. Due account is being taken
of the effectiveness and reliability of the Bank's accounting, financial, administrative and control procedures and their
upgrading. The board and management of the Bank has already launched the operational strengthening program ­
under mandate from the owner and guidance from the Banking Reform Unit which has provided Bank's management
with specific guidelines to this effect. The Banking Reform Unit had also commissioned a comprehensive
independent full financial due diligence and diagnostic study to assess the Bank's performance, outline the main
areas of institutional weaknesses and present recommendations to address the weaknesses detected.
5.        More specifically, the objective of the program is to support the Bank's board of directors and management
team efforts in developing a detailed, credible business strategy and plan, and to recommend, inter-alia, steps that
should be taken to streamline operations, optimize the branch and distribution network, and strengthen
organizational, operational and management structures. The plan proposed under the program should include a
candid and detailed assessment of needed professional skills in critical business areas (front, middle and back
office), as well as staffing and staff training. The (revised) strategy of the Bank would need to be strictly defined
under its proposed business plan to preclude lax lending policies and ensure a level playing field for all banks
with private as well as public ownership. The proposed scope of work under the program should cover ­ as detailed
in the following sections ­ the specific areas of: (i) strategic and business planning; (ii) organization structure; (iii)
budgeting and performance measurement; (iv) management information system and management accounts; (v)
operations; (vi) automation and technology support; (vii) internal audit; (viii) credit analysis and portfolio
management; (ix) asset and liability management; (x) market development and marketing; and (xi) human resource
management and training.
         A. Strategic and Business Planning
7.         While the Bank has developed a planning process, it also needs to strengthen its formalized strategic
planning capability. Given the need to build and develop the Bank in a changing economic and market environment,
the completion of a comprehensive strategic plan is a priority as it is the necessary foundation for building a program
of institutional change. The Bank's mandate from the owner would provide the basis for formulating the strategy. The
strategic plan needs, moreover, to be extended into a series of business plans for various functions and organizational
levels. The strategic plan must clearly define the Bank's mission and objectives, target markets, products and
                                                         - 64 -

services, financial goals, resource requirements and action plans for executing its strategy and achieving its goals and
objectives.
8.       One of the program's outcomes will be to support the board of directors and management design and
implement a formalized strategic planning process for the Bank as a whole and the individual business and staff units.
That process must establish how the task of planning is organized, conducted and monitored on an on-going basis.
The role of various departments (including, if necessary a specialist strategic planning unit within the Bank) in the
planning exercise must be established and the steps in the process with appropriate deadlines for completion of tasks
must be outlined and agreed with the Bank's management.
9.        The preparation of the strategic plan will be based inter-alia on the analysis of the external environment, the
competition, current and potential markets, and the Bank's current market position. To this end, there would be a need
to conduct relevant internal analyses to identify the Bank's strengths and weaknesses in relation to the market, the
competition and future business opportunities. These internal analyses should include profitability analyses of existing
businesses such as corporate and consumer lending. It is expected under the program, that the Bank's board of
directors and senior management would then address and define the Bank's mission and strategy, and prepare
business and action plans to execute that strategy. This corporate strategy will then be extended into a series of plans,
each covering a major business of the Bank ­ defining specific goals, target markets, products and services, resource
requirements, and actions programs as needed to provide practical guidance to each business unit and tools for
monitoring and evaluating performance.
10.       In the frame of the program, it would be expected to train Bank staff in strategic and business planning in
the course of the work, so that the Bank has the ability to continue the planning process in the future. Any identified
gaps in critical skills within the Bank should be reported to management.
         B. Organization Structure
11.       The Bank will assess the existing organization structure and its adequacy for its new role and the
requirements of the strategy and business plan. Thus, once the strategy and business plan are developed, the Bank
must review its organizational setting so that it may execute its strategy successfully. In this regard, the Bank's Board
and management will work together to develop and document the organization structure of the head-office, regional
offices (as the case may be), and their specific relationships to the branch offices and other distribution platforms (e.g.
E-banking). This would entail a definition of each organizational unit (including permanent committees), its mission,
main responsibilities, key functions to carry out each responsibility, and required staffing levels.
12.      To build the new organization structure, the Bank's board and management will define the specific
requirements and will be expected to prepare a plan for implementing the new organization indicating implementation
actions and responsibilities, schedule and support requirements.
         C. Budgeting and Performance Measurement
13.       There will be a need to assess the Bank's existing capital planning (in terms of regulatory capital) and
budgeting systems, and identify any needed improvements. The objective will be to ensure that the capital planning
and budgeting systems are sufficiently comprehensive to meet fully the needs of the Bank, including as a basis for
providing incentives for, and controlling, management and staff performance throughout the institution. Should the
need to upgrade the capital planning and budgeting systems be confirmed, the Bank would need a revised system
which should be formally linked to the strategic planning process to ensure that the annual financial plan for the Bank
truly represents and reflects the strategic objectives.
14.       The system, which should be comprehensive and formalized, should ensure that individual branches and
units within the Bank prepare budgets for all income and expenditure items over which they have responsibility. The
process should ensure in particular that: (i) annual budgets for the Bank and its departments and branches are linked
to the strategic planning process and objectives; (ii) budget targets are agreed to between head-office and individual
department and branch managers to ensure challenging but realistic targets and secure good motivation and
performance from managers; (iii) detailed and relevant variance analyses take place on a regular basis and all
significant variances from the Bank's targets and objectives are highlighted and explained as necessary and corrective
actions are initiated; and (iv) the management accounts for the Bank and its constituent parts are designed to report
actual performance against budgets and strategic targets.
15.     In addition to variance analysis, the Bank will ensure that it has a comprehensive system of measuring
performance against targets through the use of a well defined set of management accounts and reports and through a
                                                         - 65 -

system of individual performance management. The Bank will train a core staff in the utilization of the new systems
and processes that may be developed.
         D. Management Information System and Management Accounts
16.       There will be a need to define the information required to manage the Bank, measure its performance and
control its risks. On completion of the Bank's strategic plan, a detailed plan of the management information required
to execute the strategy will need to be completed, including management reports at each managerial level. This will
cover the accounting system needed to provide management with financial information for each of the operational
units and product lines, as well as for the Bank as a whole. The new management information requirements must be
integrated into the automation strategy of the Bank.
17.      In assessing the adequacy of the existing management information system and recommending adjustments
as needed, the Bank will ensure that the management information plan would cover all the key areas of Bank
operations and management, including: (i) credit and portfolio status; (ii) treasury including liquidity, interest rate and
foreign exchange risks, funding, asset and liability management, and deposits management; (iii) operations (front,
middle and back-office), head-office and branches; and (iv) strategy, budgeting and performance measurement
including the design and implementation of an appropriate management accounting system.
18.       To this effect, measures will be needed to ensure that a comprehensive accounting system for the Bank will
give management financial information on each of the operational units and for the Bank as a whole. The accounting
system should include information on a profit and cost-center basis with appropriate transfer pricing for inter-unit
transactions. The management accounts should also be designed to give revenue, cost and profitability information
by product, customer, branch and business line.
19.     The Bank's management will ensure that the new management information requirements, including the
management accounts, are integrated into the automation strategy and technology support framework of the Bank.
The Bank will also need to train a core staff in the utilization of the new systems and processes that may be
developed.
         E. Operations
20.      In light of the strategic plan ­ which would have addressed the systems requirements for new business units
­ the adequacy of the Bank's operating systems and procedures will be assessed, together with the need for their
strengthening to ensure their effectiveness. There will be a need to ensure that any strengthened or revamped systems
would take into account the Bank's planned businesses, methods of operations, service and control requirements and
the automation strategy.
21.       New operations systems and procedures would need to cover both head-office and branch operations and
other product/service production and distribution networks/systems. Indeed, with intensified competition for products
and services, and pressure on margins, it would be necessary to strengthen operations at the branch level. To this
effect, there may be a need to develop and implement a "model" branch, and test its practicality. (There might be a
need also to contemplate non-branch production and distribution). The Bank would then plan the model
implementation in the rest of the branch system including allowance for necessary variations to account for
differences in branches in such aspects as size, level of automation, and product, service, or customer mix. The
development of the model branch would include the: definition of the mission and role of the branch (integrated with
the strategic plan and the overall organizational plan); design of operational processes, procedures and workflows;
design of the organizational structure; and design of the branch operational infrastructure. The Bank will also train the
relevant team in the skills necessary to assure effective plan implementation.
         F. Automation and Technology Support
22.       There will be a need to assess whether the Bank's existing automation and technology support infrastructure
is adequate for the operations, management and control of an efficient commercial bank, especially the core system
that assists in the administration of most of the central functions. To this effect, the Bank's management (and external
auditors as the case may be) will review the progress made with regard to automation and technology and ensure that
the Bank has a detailed automation strategy. Once the management information needs have been defined, the
efficiency and effectiveness of the hardware architecture and system engineering in the Bank will be reviewed and
evaluated (taking into account any contingency plans relating to business continuity risks). In so doing, due account
will be taken of the need for congruence between the Bank's strategy, business goals, and existing technology. The
work would require more specifically: (i) an assessment of the information and processing requirements, and a
definition of a set of additional application needs for the Bank; (ii) an analysis of the information and processing
                                                           - 66 -

effectiveness of existing systems; (iii) an estimate of the cost of additional hardware, software (especially for the basic
banking functions related to customer accounting, portfolio analysis and management, foreign exchange operations,
etc...); (iv) an outline of the management, organization, manpower and training requirements needed to implement
the program; and (v) an implementation schedule together with critical milestones. Due attention will be needed in
integrating any new initiative: internally, with regard to a compatible system of hardware, software and
communications from branch to head-office; and externally, with any new payments system and inter-Bank
arrangements.
         G. Internal Audit
23.       The Bank's internal audit function will be assessed as well as the need for strengthening the related policies,
procedures and standards to deal with the Bank's prospective strategy and revised business model. In line with the
strategic plan and the implications of that plan--in terms of organization structure, financial instruments, operations,
systems and procedures, and automation--there will be a need to propose adjustments as required to the internal audit
system and process with appropriate corresponding manuals.
24.       There will be specifically a need to: (i) advice on improvements to audit methodologies, and adequacy of
audit coverage in terms of scope (e.g. credit, operations, assets and liabilities management), depth and reporting
standards; (ii) suggest required follow-up and monitoring; (iii) define the audit organization; and (iv) identify
complementary audit skill requirements. The Bank auditing staff will need to be trained in the utilization of new
methodologies (this sub-component--which requires specialized skills--would call for interaction with/involvement
of the external auditors.)
         H. Credit Analysis and Portfolio Management
25.       Long standing problems of portfolio quality have taken a heavy toll on the Bank's operations and financial
position. A formalized and thorough management and operational structure delineating credit policies, procedures and
systems must be developed as a matter of priority. Special emphasis should be given to portfolio control and problem
loan management. The revised structure should bring up-to-date market skills and techniques to the process of credit
management, especially in the context of the asset quality problems faced by the Bank. The Bank's management will
need to enhance credit management policies, procedures and systems, regarding both aspects of credit analysis and
portfolio management, and problem loan management.
26.       (a) Credit analysis and portfolio management. There would be a need for improvement in policies and
procedures regarding: (i) target market guidelines; (ii) portfolio limits; (iii) risk tolerance criteria; (iv) credit approval
authorities; (v) credit analysis, structuring and pricing; (vi) loan documentation, contracts and security; (vii) loan
disbursement procedures; (viii) loan follow-up and monitoring; (ix) credit recovery and legal enforcement; (x) credit
administration and controls, including disbursement, amendment to terms and other sanction authorities, credit audit
and policy exceptions; (xi) organization of credit within the context of the strategic plan; and (xii) automation of
reports needed to monitor asset quality.
27.      (b) Problem loan management. There would be a need to optimize policies, procedures and organizational
arrangements (including if warranted, special workout unit for certain types of problem assets) related to: (i) problem
loan definition and identification; (ii) problem loan reporting; (iii) problem loan follow-up; (iv) delinquent loan
recovery; (v) viability analysis and loan restructuring options; (vi) repossession and legal recovery actions; and (vii)
provisions and interest accruals.
28.     There will be a need to train a core staff in the utilization of each of the new processes that may be
developed.
         I. Asset and Liability Management
29.       The need for up-to-date treasury and asset and liability management (ALM) policies and practices is being
accentuated by the on-going liberalization of the financial markets. The skills, policies and systems required to
manage these risks must be strengthened in the Bank, so that comprehensive risk management policies be developed
or improved to govern interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and other non-credit related risks. In this regard,
consultants, as needed, will be expected to advise on, and as needed, help implement the processes, organization, and
information systems required to manage the range of ALM risks currently facing the Bank and any additional risks
inherent in the execution of the Bank strategic plan. The consultants will assist, as the need maybe, in developing and
documenting processes to cover, at a minimum, such ALM areas as liquidity, interest rate and duration gap and
pricing, and foreign exchange. Further, the consultants will advise, as the need maybe, on an organization structure
that will execute the proposed, upgraded ALM processes - defining specific responsibilities, authorities, and functions
                                                         - 67 -

of each unit, as well as required staffing skills. In addition, it will be necessary to define the information required to
support the ALM processes (e.g., external and internal information, formats and time-frames). The consultants, as the
need maybe, will assist also as needed in the implementation and the start-up of the upgraded ALM unit.
30.      The consultants, as needed, will train key staff (treasury staff and management, and other senior managers
who will participate in, or contribute to, ALM decisions) in utilizing the ALM system and implement the practical
day-to-day functions.
         J. Market Development and Marketing
31.      There will be a need to assess the adequacy of the Bank's formal marketing function and strategy and the
degree to which these are aligned to its activities and to the requirements of the market. This would include an
assessment of staff marketing and sales experience. In this regard recommendations, as needed, regarding adjustments
to the marketing function and strategy would need to be developed as part of the Bank's strategic and business plan.
In this context, a market analysis might be critical to the success of the strategic plan and vital for the proper
execution of the business plan.
32.       In conjunction and congruent with the strategic plan, the Bank's management would need to complete a
detailed marketing plan for the Bank and each of its business units covering, as the case may be, new product
introductions, service innovations and improvements. These plans should include: (i) a definition of market
objectives; (ii) an analysis of market targets, products, and growth rates and shares; (iii) an analysis of customer
needs, and marketing image of the Bank and its services; (iv) a marketing "strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats" analysis for the Bank; and (v) a plan of organization of marketing and sales at head-office and branch levels.
33.       In particular, consultants, as needed, should advise the Bank's management on how business units should
best be defined to meet the requirements of customers and the achievement of the Bank's strategic goals. (For
instance, the assessment could be made as to whether there is a need for relationship or account managers to handle
major clients, the different organizational arrangements required for retail, small corporate, private sector clients or
the possible requirement to set up specialist units for individual product areas.) The Bank's non-marketing functions
and operations should be examined also for impact on the Bank's marketing goals. The results of the analysis should
be considered in the Bank's overall review of strategy and operations.
34.      The consultants, as needed, will advise on skills needed for market analysis and planning, and help institute
a formalized market planning and development process within the framework of the Bank's strategic planning
process. The consultants, as needed, will be expected also to help the management of the Bank define: (i) a training
program regarding the Bank's marketing strategy and methods of sales and customer service; and (ii) an advertising
and public relations program.
         K. Human Resource Management and Training
35.      There will be a need to assess the Bank's human resource management practices and their adequacy for a
commercial bank operating in an increasingly competitive environment. Following the assessment of the adequacy in
terms of staff skills, recommendations may be needed to address identified deficiencies in light of the Bank's revised
business strategy and business focus and plans. To this end, a comprehensive training needs analysis will be required
and a formalized training (and as needed recruitment) plan, in line with the requirements of the Bank's strategic plan,
should be established. The analysis and plan should take into account the requirements under each of the Bank's
functional areas.
36.      The Bank's human resource management systems will have to be thoroughly assessed, and as need be,
upgraded to meet both current and future human resource requirements. There will be a need to address: (i) first the
Bank's immediate needs for building critical skills and efficiently deploying the work force to staff its new
organization, and support the execution of its strategy and business plan; then (ii) the Bank's medium-term needs for
developing and managing its human resources.
37.       The Bank will need to implement a first set of high-priority human resource management systems
consisting specifically of: (i) a training needs analysis; (ii) a training and development master plan, including a
prioritization and planning of how all training needs will be met, and the launching of highest priority programs; (iii)
a performance appraisal system, including the assessment of the performance and potential of employees, and the
identification of major development needs; and (iv) a staffing program which entails the effective matching of people
to jobs in the revised organization structure.
38.    The Bank's next order of priority is to build, implement and train staff in applying the human resource
management systems, related to: (i) manpower planning, covering supply and demand analysis, projection of
                                                          - 68 -

manpower gaps and excesses (over 2 to 4 years) by major skill and rank level, and plans to fill the gaps and deal with
the excesses; (ii) recruitment, with pro-active methods for finding and selecting key talents; (iii) rewards management,
along a compensation scheme that will attract, retain and motivate managers, technical personnel and staff; (iv)
management development, with methods for developing general and technical managers; (v) performance
management, through an effective system for managing individual performance (e.g., goals, standards, monitoring,
evaluation); and (vi) work culture development, under a program for building a competitive, commercial work culture
throughout the organization.
39.       These steps will include documentation of each system in the form of an operating manual, as well as pilot
implementation and training of implementation staff. In particular, consultants, as needed, will conduct on-the-job
training for the staff so that the Bank has the full ability to carry on the work in the future. The consultants, as needed,
may set as a priority ­ although this would have to be based on the training needs analysis ­ the focus on two
selected and critical groups of managers: (i) branch managers, where training should cover inter-alia, business
planning, profit and cost management, human resource management, management control and marketing; and (ii)
head-office department directors, where training should cover inter-alia, business and staffing planning, profit and
cost management, human resource management, change management, performance monitoring and measurement.
III.     Output
40.      The consultants, as needed, will work with the board of directors and management of the Bank to develop,
along the specifications of the framework outlined in this note, the following program: (i) a strategic plan; (ii)
business plans for individual business units; (iii) an organization structure; (iv) a budgeting and performance
measurement framework; (v) identification and framework design of required management information systems; (vi)
automation and technology support program; (vii) internal audit processes; (viii) implementation of a credit risk
management process with emphasis on management of problem loans; (ix) implementation of asset and liability
management systems for significant non-credit related risks; (x) development and initial implementation of plan for
marketing of the Bank's products and services; and (xi) human resource management and training program including
the implementation of priority human resource management systems.
41.     It is recommended within this framework that performance indicators be established to assist in monitoring
achievements.

ANNEX 5: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR A "COMPREHENSIVE INDEPENDENT FULL FINANCIAL
   DUE DILIGENCE AND DIAGNOSTIC STUDY OF STATE-OWNED SPECIALIZED BANK"
I.       Introduction
1.       As part of the government "Financial Sector Reform Program", the Central Bank of Egypt and <XYZ---
Bank> seek to engage the services of an international auditing firm (the Auditor) to conduct a comprehensive
independent full financial due diligence and diagnostic study of a state-owned specialized bank (the Bank), and as the
case may be, its group of subsidiaries and their consolidated position. The full financial due diligence and diagnostic
study performed, the findings, recommendations and reports provided by the Auditor will be performed on the basis
of International Standards on Auditing applicable to special full financial due diligence and agreed upon procedures
engagement in relation to the diagnostic study, based on the bank's Financial statements prepared according to
Egyptian Accounting Standards- unless otherwise specified in these terms of reference. In this regard, you are invited
to submit a proposal and work plan for conducting the full financial due diligence and the diagnostic study.
2.        This engagement should be carried out by staff with appropriate professional qualifications and expertise,
including experience in assessing asset quality and reporting on the financial statements and accounts of entities
comparable in nature, size, and complexity. The Auditor should provide the CVs of the principals of the firm who
would be responsible for providing the findings, recommendations and reports, together with the CVs of managers,
supervisors, and key personnel involved in the assignment. CVs should include details on full financial due diligence
and other services carried out by such staff, including ongoing assignments. To the extent judged appropriate, the
Auditor may propose to engage the services of specialized local or international staff to reinforce the team which is to
examine the Bank's loan portfolio quality and administration process. Given its primary responsibility for the
assignment, the Auditor should exert due quality control of the work performed by such firms, in terms of approach
and methodology, and guarantee the quality of their performance. It is understood that the primary responsibility for
the review of the quality of the Bank's assets including the loan portfolio will be assigned to a professional with
substantial banking experience in credit assessment, and that the rest of the full financial due diligence team under his
(her) direction will have appropriate experience in credit assessment of portfolios of similar complexity.
3.         The Auditor will provide his findings, recommendations and related reports on the bank's financial
statements of the fiscal years ended - - - , and as the case may be, its subsidiaries and the consolidated financial
position, result of operation and cash flow of the Bank's group. To this effect, the Bank will provide the Auditor with
the following consolidated statements for the fiscal years under this engagement: (i) Balance Sheet; (ii) Income
Statement; (iii) statement of cash flows; (iv) Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity; (v) Statement of loans and
facilities as of the balance sheet dates; (vi) Statement of Past Due, Non-performing, and Renegotiated Loans and
facilities; (vii) Statement of Provisions for loan Losses, Write-offs, and Recoveries; and (viii) Statement of
Commitments and Contingencies. Other statements, reports, and supplementary data should also be made available
based on the full financial due diligence requirements submitted by the auditors prior to the inception of the
assignment in order to render his reports, conduct diagnoses, and otherwise comply with these terms of reference. The
Auditor may propose in writing all those changes to the present terms of reference as the Auditor may think are
appropriate given the circumstances.
II - General Scope of Full Financial Due Diligence and Diagnostic Study
4.        The full financial due diligence of the financial statements and the diagnostic review should be carried out in
accordance with the International Standards on Auditing applicable to special full financial due diligence purpose in
relation to the full financial due diligence of the bank's financial statements and agreed-upon procedures engagement
in relation to the diagnostic study.
5.        The full financial due diligence should be planned and conducted on the basis of a program sufficiently
expansive in covering the Bank's activities to enable the Auditor to sign the opinions and reports required as per
section III of these terms of reference. In devising the diagnostic review, the Auditor is required to take into
consideration the effectiveness and reliability of the Bank's accounting, records and administrative procedures, as well
as the financial and administrative internal controls and procedures applied by the bank.
6.        Independence and Impartiality. At the time of submission of a proposal and work plan to carry out the full
financial due diligence and diagnostic study, the auditor must be independent of any member of the board of
directors, executive officer, or senior manager of the bank. Independence implies that the senior managing partner,
and any partner, or staff who would be involved in the assignment, is not serving as a director of the bank, nor has
                                                        - 70 -

any personal, financial, or close business relationship except as an independent professional adviser during the course
of the engagement .
Under the proposed scope of work, the Auditor is required to provide specific comments on the following areas
         A - Accounting policies and procedures
7.        The Auditor should comment on the accounting principles applied by the Bank and its subsidiaries,
particularly to: (i) confirm whether and to what extent Egyptian Accounting Standards and rules of preparing the
Banks' financial statements issued by Central Bank of Egypt have been and are being consistently applied; and (ii)
indicate specifically the reliance on other accounting principles and their effect on the bank's financial statements.
          B - Internal control policies and procedures
8.        The Auditor should comment on whether : (i) assets are being appropriately safeguarded; (ii) expenses are
being controlled; (iii) adequate and comprehensive policies exist, have been approved by management and the Board
of Directors, are documented in writing, and have been disseminated within the Bank; (iv) transactions have been
executed in accordance with written policies; (v) liabilities have been completely recorded on a timely basis and (vi)
all transactions including non-banking activities have been recorded to permit timely preparation of financial
statements in accordance with the Egyptian Accounting Standards and rules issued by Central Bank of Egypt in this
regard.
         C - Internal control systems
9.        The systems of internal controls and checks, including internal auditing, should be assessed and reviewed
and evaluated in order to determine the degree of reliance that can be placed upon them, and the extent of testing and
verification that needs to be performed by the Auditor. Regardless of whether the Auditor intends to rely or not on
the existing internal control systems, the Auditor will report those weaknesses detected that according to the volume
and complexity of transactions and their risk profile, have to be corrected in order to ensure prudent detection,
measurement, management and control of operational, credit and market risks.
10.       The Auditor will provide -specific comments- on the adequacy of internal control systems and procedures
including the anti-money laundering procedures and compliance as well as the written policies and procedures,
accounting and administrative controls, budgeting, internal audit, and management information systems. To the
extent that weaknesses are detected, appropriate recommendations should be made on how to strengthen or correct
existing systems.
         D - Asset quality review
11.       The Auditor will assess the quality of assets and the implied risk profile of the Bank and provide a specific
opinion commenting on the reliability of the stated values of the Bank's assets. This assessment should include not
only loans and facilities but also all other extensions of credit (on and off-balance sheet items), the bank's financial
assets including investments portfolio and other assets including other accounts receivable and inventory items. The
analysis of the credit exposure should be related to corporate whether public or private sector, medium enterprises,
and agricultural and livestock loans (retail activities including individuals).In making the assessment, the Auditor
should consider specifically, the following:
12.        (a) - Classification of assets held by the Bank. The Auditor will ensure that the classification of assets is
based on qualitative criteria and agreed definitions, and that adequate consideration has been given to: (i) the level,
distribution, and severity of classified assets; (ii) the level and composition of non-accruing, non-performing, and
reduced rate assets; and (iii) undue concentrations of credit. Assets should thus be categorized as performing or non-
performing, and risk-classified irrespective of whether they are overdue for payment. Problem assets (defined as loans
with principal or interest past due for 90 or more days) should be placed in risk classifications according to specific
criteria for "substandard", "doubtful", and "loss" categories as described in Obligor risk rating circular issued by the
Central Bank of Egypt. Also performing loans should be classified in accordance to the mentioned circular. Assets
should be categorized into corporate whether public or private sector, medium enterprises, and agricultural and
livestock loans (retail activities including individuals). . Additionally, all credit to an individual borrower (or to a
related group of borrowers) should be placed in the same risk classification; different classifications should be
specifically noted and justified. Impairment losses should be clearly identified, distinguishing their impact upon
provision and the income statement.
13.      (b) - Selection of loans and other assets for review. In assessing the quality of assets, the Auditor should
assure not less than 75 percent coverage of the portfolio of loans, advances, and all other similar credit risks,
                                                         - 71 -

including guarantees, open letters of credit, and similar off-balance sheet credit risk items. The review will be divided
into categorized loans (corporate whether public or private sector, medium enterprises, and agricultural and livestock
loans (retail activities including individuals). Each loan should be first assessed conventionally (documentation,
payment performance, collateral, current profitability of the borrowing entity, and any special known problems).
Typically, the Auditor will examine and appraise all loans, advances and guarantees to a single obligor or related
group of obligors which exceed a cutoff amount equal to one-half of one percent of paid-up capital and retained
earnings. Past due loans and advances, renegotiated loans and advances, internally identified problem loans and
advances, loans and advances to insiders, and their related interest, investments, equity participations, inter-bank loans
and money market claims, foreclosed or repossessed properties, contingent liabilities and guarantees, and other assets
should also be reviewed. In addition, a sample of loans and advances below the cutoff amount, not otherwise selected
for review, should be reviewed and the results of that appraisal extrapolated to the loan portfolio not otherwise
examined.
14.       (c) - Methodology and Criteria for asset quality review. In assessing the quality of assets related to corporate
and medium enterprises loans and advances, primary emphasis should be placed upon the borrowers' ability to repay
debts and support interest service and principal repayments out of prospective operating cash flows. To this effect, the
Auditor would be expected, especially in the case of large borrowers, to comment on the: (i) adequacy of the
borrower prepared projections to identify future cash flows to service total indebtedness; (ii) appropriateness of the
assumptions relied upon in these projections; and (iii) process by which the Bank evaluates the borrower's projections
and subjects them to rigorous sensitivity analyses. Collateral support should normally be of secondary importance. To
the extent, however, that the Bank relies on collateral as the primary source of payment, the Auditor will ensure that
appropriate appraisal procedures have been followed, including updated appraisals of such collateral, and that the
existing documentation and legal procedures allow the Bank to realize, without protracted delays, the estimated value
of the collateral. In upraising the value of collaterals under construction or in progress the auditor should segregate
and present the progress of construction in 3 tranches depending on the level of completion (i) up to 35 percent
completion; (ii) above 35 percent - 70 percent completion and (iii) above 70 percent completion. When the primary
source of repayment is supported by secondary guarantees granted by other local banks, the Auditor should evaluate
the likelihood of those guarantees being executed because of the problematic situation of the final borrower, and the
prospects for those banks being able to serve those guarantees.
15.       (d) - Concentration of credit exposure. The Auditor would identify, quantify and appraise the concentration
of credit with particular emphasis on credit extended to: (i) insiders and their related interests; (ii) connected parties;
and (iii) major economic sectors. For the purpose of this review, related or connected borrower concentrations
representing 5 percent or more of capital or 5 percent of uncovered portfolio whichever is less, or industry
concentrations representing 10 percent or more of capital or 10 percent of uncovered portfolio whichever is less
should be specifically detailed. Borrowers should be considered "related" based on common ownership, inter-
company dependence, or common sources of repayment. "Connection" implies the ability to exert control or
influence policy and decision-making, especially on credit decisions. (Connected parties or firms typically include a
firm's parent, major shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, directors, and executive officers.) The status of
each individual concentration exceeding the 5 percent level will be analyzed. In this case, the Auditor should
comment on the borrower's performance and the probability of repayment according to the existing terms of the
loans. The Auditor should comment on the adequacy of the Bank's current policies, practices, and procedures to
identify common ownership, control, and reliance on common cash flows. The Auditor should also comment on the
Bank's ability to identify and track extensions of credit to insiders and whether these credits are based on normal
terms or whether they are granted on terms more favorable (availability, tenor, rate, collateral, risk tolerance) than
those provided to the general public. The Auditor should also, if appropriate, suggest new guidelines and new
procedures by which concentrations should be identified and tracked in the Bank.
16.       (e) - Adequacy of loss reserves and additional capital needed for regulatory compliance. The Auditor will
assess the adequacy of the reserves for loan losses and other valuation reserves, and provide an opinion as to the
adequacy of capital. To the extent that capital is inadequate to support present and future operations, the Auditor
should recommend the amount of additional capital required on the basis of the relevant regulations established by the
Central Bank of Egypt. The analysis would take into account, inter-alia, the adequacy of provisions for losses, and
adjustments necessary to bring valuation reserves to adequate levels. To this end, the Auditor should outline the
methodology used to determine the level of reserve adequacy, including the amounts set aside as specific reserves and
general reserves, and the extent of reliance on collateral for establishing the recommended reserves. In this regard, the
analysis should specifically state the amount of reserves required without collateral reliance, and the amount required
with collateral reliance and the basis upon which collateral has been valued.
                                                         - 72 -

17.        (f) - Quality of earnings. The Auditor will assess the reliability and composition of the Bank's reported
earnings for the period reviewed. The Auditor thus should specifically comment on: (i) the extent to which accrued
but uncollected interest is taken into income ­ especially when such interest income relates to loans which the
Auditor, or the Bank, has placed into substandard risk category or below; (ii) the extent to which collateral values
(rather than operating cash flows) are the basis for decisions to capitalize interest and/or to roll-over extensions of
credit; (iii) capitalization of expenses; and (iv) any other income recognition policies which could distort earnings. On
the basis of the analysis, the Auditor would recommend, as needed, adjustments to the profit and loss statement for
interest taken into income on non-performing assets, as well as for past due interest which has been capitalized,
renegotiated, or refinanced.
         E - Adequacy of, and adherence to, lending and credit administration policies
18.       The Auditor would make an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of, and adherence to, operational
and lending policies, and credit administration procedures. This would include policies and procedures for approving
credit and establishing and enforcing repayment programs, collecting past due loans, provisioning for actual and
potential losses, writing-off of bad assets, debt recovery, and management reporting. Where deficiencies have been
identified, the Auditor would make recommendations for strengthening the policies and correcting the weaknesses.
19.       More specifically, the Auditor should provide a comprehensive evaluation of the capacity of the Bank to
assess, administer, supervise and recover loans, advances, guarantees and other investments, as well as an evaluation
of the Bank's current credit procedures and organization, including: (i) the standard loan process from client's initial
enquiry to final lending decision; (ii) formalized credit policies, procedures, and underwriting criteria; (iii) adequacy
of financial information received from the borrower and analyzed by the Bank as the basis for credit extension and for
periodic        assessment        of        the      changing         risk      inherent        in      the         credit;
(iv) specific lending procedures and techniques for project appraisal, approval and legal finalization of projects,
procurement, disbursement, and follow-up; (v) lending organization covering relevant departments and staffing
including profile and skills of chief lending officers, credit managers and officers; (vi) internal loan review process,
internal risk categories, and procedures for management of problem loans; (vii) specialized work-out units including
scope, skills, resources, and efficiency; and (viii) mechanisms for legal recovery, foreclosure and repossession of
collateral, and transmission of legal rights.
         F - Interest rate, foreign exchange and liquidity positions
20.       The Auditor would be required to appraise and report on the adequacy of, and compliance with policies and
procedures for assets and liabilities management, including interest rate, liquidity and foreign exchange risk
exposures. The Auditor, where relevant, will assess and report on the existence of adequate trading limits and
controls, segregation of duties, accounting and revaluation procedures, and management reporting requirements and
systems.
21.      The Auditor should report significant exposures to changes in interest rates, and comment upon procedures
and controls in place to manage interest rate risk.
22.       The Auditor should evaluate the Bank's foreign exchange risk, determine the profile of open positions and
their evolution, and assess the controls and procedures in place to manage the associated risk.
23.       The Auditor should assess and comment on the Bank's liquidity both in terms of the ability to manage asset
and liability positions, and generate operating cash flows sufficient to cover operating cash expenses. The Auditor
should also comment if liquidity support is being provided by any organization, bank or financial institution, or the
government, and the relative impact there from upon the Bank in terms of profitability, liquidity, and interest rate and
foreign exchange risk exposures. More specifically, in assessing liquidity management risks, the Auditor should
consider: (i) the volatility of deposits; (ii) the reliance placed on interest-sensitive funds; (iii) the access to money
markets or other ready sources of cash; (iv) the ability to convert assets readily into cash; (v) the capacity to meet
unexpected deposit withdrawals and other demands for payment; (vi) the ability to satisfy reasonable credit demands
readily; (vii) the financial strength of clients related to off-balance sheet liabilities and the prospects and timing for
possible draws on guarantees and other off-balance sheet items; (viii) the overall adequacy, effectiveness, and
compliance with liquidity management policies; and (ix) the nature, volume, and anticipated use of credit
commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees. Where deficiencies have been identified, the Auditor should
recommend measures for strengthening or correcting the weaknesses in the Bank's management and monitoring of its
liquidity position.
                                                          - 73 -

         G - Verification of title to, and value of, fixed assets
24.       To the extent that fixed assets are material to the total assets and to the capital of the Bank, the Auditor will
verify that the Bank has clear and unobstructed title to these assets. Specifically, it is anticipated that the Auditor will
conduct (or have conducted on the Auditor behalf) a review of all title documentation and relevant land registries.
The Auditor will provide comments on the status of the title to fixed assets.
25.       To the extent that the value of fixed assets is material to the total assets and to the capital of the Bank, the
Auditor will verify the reasonableness of the values assigned to fixed assets. To this end, the Auditor will: (i) identify
the methodology by which values have been assigned, and (ii) reconcile historical costs to existing book values.
Finally, the Auditor will confirm (by separate appraisal based on comparable sales or another accepted methodology)
that the values assigned provide a realistic measure of realizable values and that the values assigned are not so
distorted that they may in fact distort the Bank's stated capital levels.
         H - Equity position
26.       The Auditor will review the equity accounts of the Bank and verify existing equity levels. The Auditor, as
the need may be, will address the status of capital subscriptions and identify and comment on the value of all capital
contributions which may have been made in a form other than cash.
         I - Adjustments
27.       The Auditor should provide a detailed listing of adjustments required in order to ensure that the financial
statements accurately and fairly represent the financial position and performance of the Bank. Adjustments may
include additional provisions to the loan loss and other valuation reserves, the suspension or reversal of interest
accrual on loans and advances which are judged to be non-performing, assets which are to be written-off, foreign
exchange losses, income which is to be restated, or any other reclassifications and adjustments which materially affect
the financial statements. (For reporting on individual reclassifications and adjustments, materiality will be kept at the
2 percent level of the Bank's net worth for balance and off-balance sheet related adjustments, and 1 percent for the
profit and loss account.)
28.       The Auditor should provide a detailed listing of asset and liability items which, after adjustments, are still
carried in the financial statements at amounts which may differ significantly from realizable values. The Auditor
should provide also a detailed listing of revenue and expense items which, after adjustments, may still be significantly
over or understated.
III - Reports to be Provided by the Auditor
29.       The Auditor, at the completion of the review, will provide the Central Bank of Egypt and <XYZ---Bank>
with the following reports:
30.       (a) - Annual consolidated statements, after appropriate reclassifications and adjustments. These statements
(referred to in para. 3 of these terms of reference) after appropriate reclassifications and adjustments, should include
extensive notes on balance sheet and income statement items explaining the accounting methodologies used, and
clarifying any items which, in the Auditor's view, could, in the absence of a note, mislead a reader accustomed to
financial statements prepared according to the Egyptian Accounting Standards and rules and instructions issued by
Central Bank of Egypt..
31.       (b) - Statements on specific investments. The Auditor should provide individual statements for each of the
investments in which: (i) the Bank's direct or indirect participation exceeds 20 percent; and (ii) the total risk to the
Bank exceeds 5 percent of the Bank's equity. Financial subsidiaries in which the Bank holds a direct or indirect
participation of more than 40 percent will be consolidated (financial subsidiaries are those entities the main activities
of which include holdings of financial instruments, leasing, capital and money market activities, insurance and real
estate activities). The consolidated statements of the subsidiaries should also be audited or, alternatively, the Auditor
should obtain reports from secondary auditors, guaranteeing the application of similar full financial due diligence and
accounting standards as those applied to the Bank. Consolidation of subsidiaries should be based on the application
of a standardized package designed to homogenize reports and opinions rendered by secondary auditors used for such
purposes. The Auditor will specifically report on any limitation to the engagement found in relation to the
consolidation scope, or any exclusion thereof which the Auditor may judge necessary.
32.        (c) - Comment on the accuracy and reliability of the accounting system. The comments on the accuracy and
reliability of the Bank's accounting system would either: (i) comment on the performance of the Bank during the
period and the financial condition as of the end of the period; (ii) comments stating clearly the material misstatement
                                                         - 74 -

in the financial position and performance of the Bank; or (iii) state the circumstances and findings which preclude the
Auditor from providing his comments.
33.       (d) - Diagnostic studies and supporting schedules. The diagnostic studies and supporting schedules will
address the following: (i) accounting policies and procedures; (ii) internal control policies and procedures, and related
systems; (iii) asset quality, adequacy of loss reserves, and quality of earnings; (iv) foreign exchange, and liquidity
positions; (v) verification of title to fixed assets; (vi) verification of value of fixed assets; (vii) equity position and
status of capital subscriptions; (viii) detailed listing of proposed adjustments required by the Auditor in order to assure
that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Egyptian Accounting Standards and in the light of
rules and instructions issued by Central Bank of Egypt ,; (ix) detailed listing of asset and liability items which, after
adjustments, are still carried in the financial statements at amounts which may differ significantly from realizable
values; and (x) detailed listing of revenue and expense items which, after adjustments, may still be significantly
overstated or understated.
34.      (e) - Management Letter. The Auditor's Management Letter should include an executive summary that
would summarize the report's findings and recommendation as well as the process of the engagement , specifically
commenting on the issues or concerns raised during the full financial due diligence of the financial statements and the
preparation of the diagnostic studies required under these terms of reference.
35.      The Central Bank of Egypt may request supplemental information or targeted examinations of specific areas
on an ad-hoc basis if such information is deemed necessary. The Auditor will present and discuss the results and
contents of the full financial due diligence and diagnostic studies with the Bank, and the Central bank of Egypt.
Other Considerations
36.       (a) - Authority to Practice in Egypt. Your firm should be authorized to practice in Egypt and be capable of
using procedures and methods that conform with International Standard on Auditing. Your firm should employ
adequate staff with appropriate professional qualifications and suitable experience, including experience in assessing
credit quality and in auditing the accounts of entities comparable in nature, size, and complexity.
37.       (b) - Confidentiality. These diagnostic full financial due diligence are to be prepared for use by the Central
Bank of Egypt, <XYZ ...Bank>, and any other organization that the CBE deems appropriate. Therefore, the results
are not for public disclosure but may be publicly disclosed by the bank at its discretion. All results are to be treated in
a confidential manner; accordingly the auditors will never discuss with, nor distribute to parties outside the CBE or
the above mentioned parties, and the management of <XYZ bank>, without their explicit authorization, any aspects
or details relating to their findings.
38.      (c) - Submission of the Proposal and Work Plan. Any proposal and work plan which your firm may wish to
submit should address the foregoing terms of reference. Such proposal should include the proposed fees and should
be signed by an authorized signatory of the firm, dated with the date of the signing thereof, and submitted in a sealed
envelope addressed to:
         Lobna Hilal
         Sub Governor
         Central Bank of Egypt
         31 Kasr el Nil street
         Cairo
and      <Name and Title>
         <XYZ Bank>
         Cairo
                                to be received not later than close of business on <date>.
                                                           - 75 -

           ANNEX 6: INSTITUTIONAL AND OPERATIONAL RESTRUCTURING OF PBDAC

1.        Operationally, PBDAC had begun to simplify its complex branch structure and improve its branch
network; it has reached over 90 percent internet connectivity within the branches. This will allow it to more
closely manage the maximum size of loans approved at each level and streamline inter-branch communications,
as is done by commercial banks. Beginning in 2008, PBDAC has begun a major program of operational and
institutional restructuring in the areas of risk management; audit and control; information technology (IT); and
organization, including human resources and the branch network. In July of 2009, they signed an agreement
with their partners to finance the complete reorganization and restructuring, planned for May 2010. It is also
looking at commercial policies under its new legal framework, in particular new products that can take
advantage of PBDAC's extensive branch network and improve branch-level viability and also give wider access
to financial services to those living in rural areas. PBDAC's initiatives are being supported by in-house and
external technical advisors from Rabobank, which has substantial experience in assisting banks in developing
countries and with which PBDAC has had a relationship that began in 2007, and has been renewed until end
2010 to expand on and better execute the business plan.
2.        The introduction of the Egyptian Agriculture Bank Law, the new law governing PBDAC, which was
approved by the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister in February 2010 converts PBDAC to a joint stock,
state-owned bank under the same legal framework as the existing state-owned commercial banks.52 Its
governance structure will be the same as the other state-owned commercial banks with: a general assembly; a
smaller board that will include external experts in financial, banking, and legal matters as well as a
representative of the Ministry of Agriculture; and strengthened responsibility to and supervision by CBE.53 The
existing two banks for Upper and Lower Egypt, which were entities in the PBDAC holding company under the
Chairman of PBDAC, will be merged into PBDAC, which will be given a new name--the Egyptian Agricultural
Bank. All assets and employees will be transferred to the new bank and the employees will be subject to the
personnel rules governing employees in state-owned commercial banks. The new bank's activities will be
audited by the Central Audit Agency and by a private auditor. Non-banking activities will be separated from the
bank. This new status will give it the capacity to expand lending and financial services throughout the country
with its wide branch network and penetration.
3.       The restructuring of PBDAC is the prior condition to be part of the process of fostering access to
finance in Egypt. In the long run, the new PBDAC should become a key player in financing individuals and
micro enterprises, providing payments services in rural areas, and extending the use of electronic money.
Already, almost half of PBDAC's outstanding loans are for less than LE 25,000 and a quarter are below
LE 10,000. PBDAC's stated vision is to `provide a full set of retail banking services, as well as financing
MSMEs'. PBDAC is investing in its future potential role as a full service bank for the rural population through
a comprehensive set of restructuring measures including (i) revamped Risk Management procedures and
capacity, (ii) branch restructuring, (iii) investment in IT, ATMs and e-banking capacity, and (iv) introducing
new financial products (including 5 in the past 2 years). An important driver of improved rural financial access
could be the provision of payments services for government pensions and salaries, and remittances, through
PBDAC's extensive rural outreach.
4.       As part of the restructuring process, PBDAC is enhancing its risk management through the formation of
a department that conducts gap analysis and is redefining credit policy. The department was charged with
diagnosing risks in the market, credits, and operations and has produced reports on the current situation in each
of these areas. It is developing a risk awareness program for the bank, risk indicators, and a training program in
credit and operational risk for the branch managers as well as for the risk management staff. The new
department is supervised by an executive consultant from Rabobank. In the area of credit risk, there will be
development of and greater use of credit scoring. Issues of operational risk are also being looked at and dealt
with by redefining procedures with assignment of responsibility, particularly a "major incidents" procedure.
The better control provided by the interconnectivity of the branches will be complemented by better defining
operational and credit risk at branches and training potential managers at the branches.


52
   Law 117 of 1972 that currently governs PBDAC as a General Government Organization would be amended to place
PBDAC under Law 88 of 2003 which governs state-owned commercial banks as well as other banks.
53
   Its chairman was appointed by and reports to the Minister of Agriculture; its 16 Board members included five members
from the Ministry of Agriculture and persons related to agricultural activities in addition to three members of the bank (there
was no General Assembly).
                                                      - 76 -

5.       Theoretical training will also be done on risk management. A later phase will be to set up four separate
teams for market, credit, operational risk, and risk within the department. These teams will define road maps to
implement the new procedures and controls. In these areas PBDAC is working closely with Rabobank. In the
area of control and audit, the past and future improvements in IT will improve control and, as noted, new
procedures are being put in place, to take advantage of this. The reporting system will also be changed to
improve control and compliance. A separate project management department will be set up to improve focus on
major interdisciplinary projects. These include projects for procedures, product development, marketing and
data quality. Efforts will also be made to step up anti-money laundering activities. The new board structure will
strengthen the role of the Audit control substantially. In the area of information technology, the plan is to
enhance the current IT system, in particularly in the areas of audit and control. At the same time, PBDAC, with
the consultation of Rabobank, is preparing a contract for bids to set up new core banking IT system and
associated training. In the area of human resources, which is linked with the branch network, all staff has been
transferred to the new bank and are subject to the rules for government employees in state-owned commercial
banks.
6.       Staff will be reorganized in line with the new work processes and organizational structure, and given
new job descriptions and the necessary training, in line with the new branch organization, products and
processes, and the greater use of IT and automation. The training program has been in operation for some time,
with the number of attendance in courses rising from 5700 in 2007 to nearly 14,000 in 2009. A key focus in the
training and the new human resource policy is to focus staff on better consumer service and reduce complaints
from depositors and borrowers. The branch network is now almost fully interconnected through the internet.
Branches are now going through the human resources program described above. The approach is to set up a
model branch (Imbaba), where all innovations are to be fully put in place and tested in their entirety, while at the
same time gradually putting in place the new work processes, new organizational chart and training program,
and their enhancement in a subset of the branches. Currently, the model branch is still undergoing changes and
about 50 percent of the branches are undergoing the tripart process. PBDAC also intends to refurbish its
branches, but slowly, while devoting most of the resources associated with its reform plan to improving IT,
human resources, and training.
                                                              - 77 -

       ANNEX 7: FRAMEWORK FOR BANKING REGULATION AND SUPERVISION PROGRAM

1.         The strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework in the banking sector remains a critical
part of the second wave of the financial reform program. A credible and independent regulator is the necessary
anchor of an effective and resilient financial system, especially in an environment where Egypt will be more
integrated in the global financial system. The proposed operation would continue to support the strengthening of the
banking supervision department at CBE towards Basel II implementation. The implementation of Basel II is a step
further of the reform of the banking system that CBE has undertaken since 2004 which has set the basis of risk based
supervision. The Egyptian authorities have agreed to embark on this new regulatory framework for three main
reasons: First, Basel II aims at enhancing the management of all kind of risks, therefore strengthening financial
stability, second, it leads to a more efficient management of capital ensuring that capital will be mobilized where
significant risks are located, third, Basel II in line with best international practices, will help upgrade the
competitiveness of the Egyptian banking system.
2.        During the past three years CBE has set up the basis of a risk-based supervision in making impressive
achievements. The on-site inspection process is now aligned on a risk based approach such as credit organization and
policy, concentration of credit, risk management system, IT system and internal controls. New manuals for on-site
supervision with a risk focus are being used to drive on site inspections. New reports based on a CAMEL approach
have been implemented and internal rating is assigned at the end of the on-site exam to reflect the overall financial
standing of the bank. Separate reports are made on IT, market risks, AML and retail banking if needed. The off-site
supervision has also developed new tools to help focus on critical issues for an enhanced decision making process
regarding early signs of weaknesses. A risk-oriented report regarding the strategy, management and the overall
performance of a credit institution has been designed and implemented. This yearly report covers all risks inherent in
the bank's activities, including both quantitative and qualitative information on individual bank ratings based on
CAMELS and bank' overall risk profile. Brief reports are also produced on quarterly basis analyzing individual banks
performance including peer comparisons as well as compliance of banks with CBE prudential requirements..
Recently, since 2006, the CBE has issued new regulations, notably on developer finance, acquisition finance, opening
of new branches, money market funds, goodwill valuation, SME lending, and some minor changes on credit
classification & provisioning.
3.        CBE is willing to maintain the momentum of further strengthening its capabilities to perform an effective
risk-based supervision. A new Euro system technical assistance program on banking supervision has been launched
early January 2009. This new program aims at supporting the CBE in designing a Basle II framework customized to
the Egyptian banking system through a long term strategy. To this end, the CBE benefits from the expertise of various
NCB experts 54who are managed by a Resident Program Coordinator. On its side the CBE has set up a group of 15 of
qualified staff to work full time on Basle II framework issues. The program encompasses pillars one (capital
adequacy) and two (supervisory review process) taking into consideration the length of the program and the situation
of the Egyptian banking system. The plan towards Basel II is divided in three phases, where the first phase focused on
gaps identification, and finalizing CBE Basel II Strategy. The second phase will focus on discussion papers,
qualitative impact study (QIS) for regulations guidelines, and data reporting scheme. The third phase on drafting the
newly proposed regulations, and preparation of the Basel II framework implementation.
4.        The first phase has been achieved successfully. A project plan has been prepared for modernizing the
supervisory reporting framework. The planned new reporting system will be based on "raw-data reporting" (as
opposed to "reporting of ratios") and implemented through an automated IT tool (as opposed to current paper-based
reporting). The project plan includes the design and implementation of a data warehouse. A diagnostic of the needs of
the Egyptian banking system has been conducted and identified a set of strategic themes 55 (nine) on which the
program will focus during the months to come. In particular, accounting issues will focus on IFRS training and Pillar
II issues will refer to portfolio concentration, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. An intensive program of knowledge
sharing and capacity building along these themes has been performed with experts coming from NCB partners. CBE
and ECB experts have identified key people at adequate level of responsibility in banks 56 and other stakeholders,
who will become active counterparts in working groups to launch the dialogue between the CBE and the banking

community at large. Twelve banks have been identified to be part of the working groups based on their diversity in
terms of concentration of activities, shareholders structure, Basel II readiness, size of the balance sheet and risk
management systems. The CBE has issued a report on a strategy for Basel II implementation in Egypt which was
presented to the banking community on October the 14th, 2009. This strategy has identified realistic steps that can be
reached during the second phase taking into consideration the length of the program and the stage of the development
of the Egyptian banking sector. The strategy is based on simplicity and communication: standardized approach will
be applied to remain consistent with different levels of sophistication in banks information and control systems.
Dialogue, awareness and capacity building are key factors of success for a new supervisory and regulatory framework
as Basel II. To implement this strategy in due time in getting effective results, it would be advisable to set up
seminars for the banking community: one during the discussion papers period to present the rationale of the
exercise and a second after the QIS period to discuss the fine tuning of the new regulations.
5.         The second phase has started and is dedicated to elaborate guidelines for drafting new regulations, run
simulations, and build a new data reporting scheme. Working groups involving the banking and financial
community would be set up. This structure is the backbone of an effective implementation of the new framework in
ensuring a mutual understanding and in monitoring its impact on the banking system. Working groups will meet
regularly for reviewing "discussion papers" on the key themes (operational risk, credit risk, market risk and own
funds) prepared jointly by the ECB and CBE experts57 but they have a broad mandate to examine and advice on all
implementation issues. NCB experts would also assist the CBE in its preparation of a Quantitative Impact Study
(QIS) for banks aims at evaluating the implications of the new regime in terms of capital requirements. After
reviewing this impact study, new regulations in line with the basic Basel II regime would be prepared based on
guidelines elaborated along this phase II of the program. One of the main delivery of phase II is also the design of a
new data reporting scheme in order to implement these new regulations. The main effort of the program will be
concentrated in 2010, with the formalization of business requirements and set up of data model. The action plan has
been amended with additional breakdown on the specific subcomponents with the specification of milestones. The
CBE experts will be working on together with their Information Technology experts, supported and advised by Bank
of Italy. This component is quite challenging and will require strong coordination between the IT department of CBE,
the banking supervision department, the ECB experts and the Egyptian banks. To this end, the CBE has dedicated a
core CBE team to this project coming from the off-site department, Basel II team, and IT department. Three
committees are foreseen for the implementation of the raw data project: a core committee that will be working with
EU experts, an internal CBE committee and an external committee with participation of Egyptian banks. Once again a
closer coordination should be established without delay with Egyptian banks as many of them are in the process of
choosing new risk management systems compliant with Basel II requirements.
6.       The third phase would last six months and will focus on drafting the newly proposed regulations, provide
support to enhance the implementation process for the new regulations and data reporting scheme. This would
include knowledge sharing and capacity building to all the CBE staff on how to monitor the compliance of the
Egyptian banking system with these new regulations. Finally, this phase should set up the organization of the
implementation of the new data reporting scheme.
7.        As quoted in the Basel II strategy for Egypt, due to the diversity of the Egyptian banking system the
authorities have chosen a pragmatic approach which paves the way for more sophisticated methods in the future.

     To this effect six study visits have been scheduled to meet experts in NCB

      ANNEX 8: ENHANCING FINANCIAL STABILITY ANALYSIS AND MACROPRUDENTIAL
                                 SURVEILLANCE

                                             CENTRAL BANK OF EGYPT

1.       Long-run objective. Improving the transparency of risk recognition in the financial system and facilitating
broad communication with the financial community. In line with international practice in terms of assessing and
communicating risks in the financial system that may threaten financial stability, the CBE prepares and publishes a
regular Financial Stability Report (FSR). Regular stress testing makes prospective capital needs more measurable.
2.        Intermediate objective by end-2011. Stress testing becomes an integral part of the CBE's systemic
surveillance of the banking sector. Preparing and presenting to the CBE Board a full-fledged Financial Stability
Report based on the CBE's assessment of overall risks in the financial system facilitate the early detection of changes
and vulnerabilities in the financial system.
3.        The CBE's approach to enhancing financial stability analysis. The Banking Supervision Department
(BSD) of the Central Bank of Egypt has made commendable progress strengthening the microprudential supervision
of the banking system in recent years through the work of the Offsite, Onsite, Regulation, Licensing, Basel II
Implementations, Credit Registry and Legal cases units. The seventh unit in the Department, the Macroprudential unit
has been tasked to look at trends and risks in the Egyptian banking system at the aggregate level, and develop
capacity to conduct macroprudential analysis.
4.        The Macroprudential unit currently has five staff including the Acting Chief. The unit has good cooperation
with other units in the Banking Supervision Department that provide data and information for aggregate banking
sector analysis. The Macroprudential unit focuses on the banking sector but may study developments in other
segments of the Egyptian financial markets to detect any potential weaknesses that may affect the banking system. At
this point, this approach seems sufficient given the small size of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) and relatively
low market risk to the banking sector. Nevertheless, financial markets and NBFIs in Egypt are poised to grow and
become more sophisticated, which will necessitate following trends and emerging risks in those segments as well in
the context of a comprehensive financial stability analysis.
5.         The Banking Supervision Department started to prepare a quarterly consolidated banking sector report that
summarizes the major developments in the banking sector and discusses topical events related to the financial sector.
Monthly reports may also be produced focusing on global and domestic developments that may affect the Egyptian
banking sector, these reports are event-driven. In addition, several analytical tools are now actively used to assess
financial stability risks. Most importantly, the unit is using standard financial soundness indicator analysis and has
started to conduct regular stress testing exercises. The stress tests focus on credit risk in the Egyptian banking system
as they are the predominant source of risk at this point. The BSD conducts stress testing on individual banks, as well
as on the banking sector on aggregate basis. Stress testing is conducted on all 39 banks in the system. The standard
stress tests are currently conducted annually, however, event-driven stress test are also performed on an ad-hoc basis
or in the case of potential risks that may affect the system. The BSD is planning to revisit the standard stress test to be
conducted on a semi-annual basis.
6.        The Macroprudential unit includes one staff focusing on macroeconomic developments and modeling. The
unit is developing a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model (DSGE) to model the Egyptian economy and
plans to use it in the future as a basis for simulating macroeconomic scenarios for its stress tests.
7.       All in all, the Central Bank of Egypt has a strong base of skills, procedures and information to build upon to
conduct enhanced financial stability analysis in the future.
8.        Preparation phase. In the first phase of the preparation for establishing a full-fledged Financial Stability
Report, the CBE will focus on the following tasks with clear assignment of responsibilities:
                  Develop research agenda on financial stability analysis
              -      This research agenda could usefully start by harnessing the knowledge and methodology presented
                     in other central banks' Financial Stability Reports. Currently, approx. 60 central banks around the
                     world publish FSRs. FSRs come in a wide variety, some with standard and stable structures, others
                     with a more flexible structures focusing e.g. on the most dominant current risks, some event-
                     driven. This will prove as a very useful first step in preparing for the eventual structure of the
                     Egyptian Financial Stability Report.
                                                              - 80 -

               -    Refine and expand analytical tools and techniques taking into consideration international practices,
                    and customizing them for Egypt. Further prepare the unit's macroeconomic model for use in
                    connection with stress testing scenarios.
               -    Further strengthen financial market (both domestic and international) analysis expertise.
               -    Draw up a list of "special themes" that will become part of the financial stability report in addition
                    to its standard structure. These themes can serve educational and research dissemination purposes.
                    Such topics may include e.g., payment systems, operational risk, real estate market risk,
                    preparation for Basel II, new initiatives in international regulation and supervision, etc. Develop
                    research agenda for those deemed most useful for the first few FSRs.
             Further expand the staff of the Macroprudential unit and diversify the mix of skills. Perform a gap
          analysis in terms of skills and taking into account the research agenda. In addition to the focus on banking
          sector analysis, the unit should aim at having staff with interdisciplinary expertise, including expertise in
          macroeconomics, financial markets (most importantly, domestic and foreign money markets, derivatives
          markets, stock markets), and statistics. If this is not feasible, then it is advisable to develop a working
          relationship with other units at the CBE with such expertise for collaboration in the preparation of the
          financial stability report. It is also useful to have staff with a good mix of skills in terms of experience in the
          private sector, regulatory and supervisory agencies, and academic research.
             Assess data and information needs. Organize available data and, if possible, set up a database that can
          become a flexible, up-to-date and easy to use resource from the desks of the staff. Assess data and
          information that will need to be additionally collected and those that can only be collected through surveys.
          Specifically, prepare for data collection on real estate markets and prices, and on cross-border financial
          flows, as building up these databases may take some time. Develop or strengthen contacts with other
          agencies or CBE units who may already collect such data (e.g. real estate developers, national statistical
          agency, stock exchange, etc.).
            Develop contacts with other domestic financial sector agencies for future collaboration on financial
          stability analysis. As financial sector segments other than the banking sector become potentially of systemic
          importance, they will need to be taken into consideration in the FSRs. In order to facilitate information flow
          between agencies, it is important to establish contacts early and discuss key issues that may impact the
          whole financial system.
            Develop international contacts and participate in seminars and conferences on financial stability
          analysis.

                ANNEX 9: STATE-OWNED INSURERS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

1.       The Program Document (PD) dated May 17, 2006 for the first DPL (Report No. 36197--EG) contained
a section specific to the restructuring of state-owned insurance companies (Operational Policy Matrix Section
V).
2.       The first of these items was supported by Annex IV to the DPL I PAD, which laid out the advisory
consortium's terms of reference. All Board Approval triggers were satisfied. The due diligence advisory
agreement was signed with BNPP/ CIB after a competitive tendering process. For technical reasons and to
hasten the process the first stage (due diligence and recommendation), involving a consortium of advisers under
BNPP/ CIB leadership, was signed with each of the four state-owned insurers, with coordination being achieved
though a Steering Committee. Subsequently the Insurance Holding Company (IHS) was established and this
took over the role of the Steering Committee.
3.       The MTPL project was carried out by Actuaria, an Italian actuarial firm, and in the process significant
technology transfer was achieved. This exercise established that MTPL claims provisions were approximately
EL1.9 billion in deficit and that on average MTPL premium levels (which are established by the State and had
not been changed for many years) were approximately 1/5th of the required level. These figures were supported
by the independent work of Milliman, an actuarial firm working as part of the PNPP/ CIB consortium, and by
actuaries working in the IHC.
4.       The general assemblies of the three SOIs approved the full transfer of real estate assets to the newly
established specialized company starting from 1st of Oct., 2007. Property assets have been transferred at book
for the companies merged into Misr and will be transferred (partially at market) for National (to become Misr
Life) by July 1st, 2010. In addition the Chairman of the IHS announced in the Egyptian press that all JV
holdings were to be divested.
5.      The first indicator (restructuring) was delivered according to the following schedule:
                 The due diligence commenced in February 2006 and the resultant report was delivered in
                 September 2006 to the IHC and the four state-owned insurers' Chairmen.
                 Based on the due diligence reports 5 year business plans were produced by each company with
                 the assistance of the consortium.
                 Further feedback was provided and, based on this, BNPP/CIB prepared restructuring
                 recommendations.
                 Based on feedback from the Minister a more focused and refined strategy was subsequently
                 submitted.
                 The Minister of Investment announced a broad state-owned insurer restructuring strategy in
                 the mass media on August 16, 2007.
                 The Chairman of IHC announced a non core asset realization strategy in the mass media on
                 September 3, 2007.
                 The Minister of Investment announced that Al Chark insurance company and Egypt Re will be
                 merged into MIC to create a regional leader.
                 The general assemblies of the SOIs approved the transfer of real estate asset to the newly
                 established real estate asset company.
                 Key findings of the due diligence carried out in 2006 were as follows: (i) As at June 30, 2005
                 the three direct insurers all had aggregate reserving (life) and provisioning (non-life) deficits.
                 Of these the two smaller direct insurers were in deficit. One of these was heavily insolvent
                 and the other was on the margin; and (ii) the two larger direct insurers and the reinsurer had
                 positive net present values.
6.      . The elements of the MTPL strategy were as follows:
                 Publicizing the extent of the MTPL shortfall to prepare the general public for reform.
                 Bringing claims provision deficits in the two largest direct insurers and the reinsurer up to
                 required levels over 3 years.
                 Gradually raising premium levels, and taking action to limit claims costs and inflation.
                 Requiring the insurance sector to continue underwriting this class of business.
                                                    - 82 -

7.      The second indicator (MTPL reform) was delivered according to the following schedule:
                 A new law no.72 of year 2007 was issued on 29 June 2007. This, amongst other things, caps
                 pay outs.
                 The attendant Executive Regulation has been issued by the Ministerial Decree no. 217 of year
                 2007 on 13 August 2007.
                 A new increased price list has been issued and implemented starting from 1st September 2007.
                 A notional defendant fund to protect "Hit and Run" victims was established and its bylaws
                 were issued by a PM Decree on 20 August 2007.
                 The Board of the above mentioned Fund was appointed by Ministerial Decree no.311 of year
                 2007.
8.       Despite these reforms the MTPL sector continues to be unprofitable with a loss ratio to June 2009 of
170 percent and there is evidence of some gaming of the nominal defendant arrangement. there is a need for an
independent rate setter to be established and a study will be produced by EFSA to recommend that this occurs.
This will mean that all insurers will have to share MTPL claims data in a neutral environment. Various
mechanisms have been developed elsewhere (e.g. KSA) to deal with gaming to transfer losses to other insurers
and these should be investigated.
9.       The restructuring strategy announced by the Minister of Investment has taken all of the above elements
into account and is now moving into the final stage:
                 There will be two state owned companies one will become a specialized non-life insurer and
                 the other will become a specialized life insurer. This will be effected through portfolio
                 transfer.
                 The property business will be handled through a separate division containing an asset
                 manager, a development company and a property manager.
                 A securities manager has been established and, amongst other activities (including a private
                 equity fund) it will manage parts of the 2 insurers' equity portfolios.

                    ANNEX 10: PRIVATE PENSION SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM


1.       The third DPL will support actions to develop private pensions market by: (i) introducing a sounder
regulatory framework that improves reporting, transparency and governance, diversifies the pension plan
products, introduces capital and funding requirements, provides rules for investment and annuitization, requires
professional management of intermediaries, and provided incentives to expand the private pension sector in
Egypt; (ii) improving information of the existing pension plans in order to identify those facing critical problems
of funding and support the actions from EISA to require corrective action plans; and (iii) improving capacity
building in to develop a sound supervisory strategy adopting the best international practices of risk based
supervision (RBS).
2.       Voluntary private pensions have a long history in Egypt. In 2009 there were around 650 active funds
covering around 8.5 million members of the public and private sectors. Most of the plans are sponsored by
employers (mainly in the public sector), offer defined benefit (DB) plans and only a few of them have annuity
products. There are no rules requiring professional management, and funds normally do not have independent
administrative capacity. Decision making largely relies on the boards of directors. Market concentration is high
as expressed in number of members and size of the funds. In fact, out of the active funds, only 25 represented
more than 50 percent of the market.
3.       Pension funds portfolios are strongly concentrated in fixed deposits (26.3 percent) and government
bonds (67.5 percent). This may be explained, among other factors, by low standards of professional portfolio
management, and lack of autonomous investment policies that will be addressed by the new regulatory
framework. In addition to the regulatory requirements, portfolio diversification will largely depend on the
capacity of the capital market to develop and offer more diversified and longer term investment options, as also
addressed by DPL III.
4.        A preliminary actuarial solvency valuation done by EISA for the 25 largest funds showed that only
three of them have funded ratios of 100 percent or more, with the vast majority being under-funded. Under the
new regulations, the funds will be required to conduct regular actuarial valuation and adopt corrective actions in
the cases of under-funding.
5.        Most of the current pension plans offer lump sums to members. The development of annuities is
essential in order to provide enhanced income support in old age. While regulatory reform will support this
development, investment opportunities and inadequate knowledge of this product will impose severe limitations
to expand market opportunities. Public information and financial education programs will need to support the
efforts to expand the sector by addressing the strong preference for present consumption at retirement.
6.       Another important limitation for the expansion of private pensions is the generosity of the public
pension schemes. The long term non sustainability of these schemes requires corrective actions that will in turn
impose additional opportunities and also challenges to the voluntary pension funds in order to be prepared to
provide adequate complementary support to mandatory pensions.
7.       The expected expansion of voluntary pensions will demand a strong supervision capacity. Under the
new pension law, EFSA will be responsible of supervising private pension plans. In order to perform this role,
EFSA will need to adopt a supervision approach following the best international practices, such as the RBS
that will also be adopted for the insurance sector. Capacity building for EFSA on RBS for pensions and
insurance will also be supported by DPL III.

                    ANNEX 11: CAPITAL MARKETS DEVELOPMENTS PROGRAM


1.       In the capital markets area, the third DPL would support policy reforms in three areas: regulation and
supervision of brokers; overhauling the regulation of investment funds; and facilitating the issuance of fixed
income instruments
2.        Regulation and supervision of brokers. Abuse of investors by financial intermediaries (e.g., brokers)
through use of privileged information for unfair gain or price manipulation would clearly set back the long-term
development of Egypt's capital market. The June 2008 Law 123 provides for criminal and civil penalties for
such behavior. In addition, financial intermediaries must have sufficient capital to sustain their operations and
protect their customers' assets. The protection of investors and stability of financial systems are increased by an
adequate supervision of ongoing capital standards. Capital adequacy standards foster confidence in the financial
markets and should be designed to allow a firm to absorb some losses without failing and wind down its
business over a relatively short period without loss to its customers or disrupting the orderly functioning of the
financial markets. The introduction of capital adequacy standards for Egyptian securities firms designed to
measure the ability of the companies to cope with the risks associated with their activities, clients, and the
securities they deal in supports these investor protection goals. These risks addressed in the new standards
include market risk, settlement risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk. Also new risk management
and technological capacity standards complement the capital adequacy enhancements to reduce the likelihood of
intermediary failure further. These higher standards may also encourage additional consolidation of smaller
firms, thereby strengthening the industry as a whole. EFSA has upgraded its standards on capital adequacy for
brokers to reflect the rise of intra-day trading as well as requirements for financial intermediary reporting on
capital adequacy.
3.       Investment fund regime enhancements. Investment funds are an important means for investors to
achieve a diversified exposure to investment opportunities. Proper regulation of these funds is critical to the
objective of investor protection and should ensure that investors have access to a fair market. Investors in
collective investment schemes rely upon sponsors, operators and other related parties of the funds to manage
their assets and to act in their best interests. EFSA Decree 88 now requires investment funds to use an
independent "fund services company" to perform important back-office functions where fund insiders might
otherwise be in a position to abuse public investors in a fund. These key functions include the calculation of net
asset value (NAV), maintenance of records on the fund's investment transactions and certificate holders, and
calculation of the fund manager's fees and performance bonus. In addition, it will be important to further reform
Egypt's investment fund regulations to bring these more into compliance with IOSCO international best
practices. Key areas for review will include measures to enhance fund manager professionalism; enhanced
transparency; regulatory reporting; and responsible marketing. The development of real estate investment funds
(REIFs) also warrants close attention and perhaps a separate chapter in the Executive Regulations.
4.       Development of fixed income instruments. Fixed income instruments can be an important vehicle both
for financing infrastructure development and other investment needs and for giving investors additional
opportunities for diversification. Greater issuance of debt securities by corporations and other issuers (e.g.,
public agencies) will depend in significant measure on the development of a more-lively secondary market for
government securities. In addition, the Government can do more to facilitate corporate and public agency bond
offerings by, for instance, reducing unnecessarily burdensome preparations to launch a debt offering and
introducing greater competition in bond-rating services
                                                     - 85 -

                             ANNEX 12: ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

1.       The role of the private sector in the economy has increased considerably since 2001 In 2004, the
Government of Egypt adopted an Asset Management Program to address the status of State-Owned-Enterprises
including the remaining public enterprises (150 as of 30 June 2009) in addition to the public sector holdings in
joint venture entities (620, as of December 31, 2009).

Settling NPLs
2.       In addition to the regular ongoing efforts on restructuring as well as implementation of governance
code in the SOEs, the Ministry of Investment (MOI) embarked on two main parallel schemes simultaneously to
face those challenges:
        Settlement of more than LE 32 billion of debts owed by SOEs to state-owned banks to bring the
        balance of outstanding debt down to around LE 10 billion, which are expected to be settled before May
        2010 through a land-debt Swap agreement between SOEs and the lending banks.
        In addition to settling NPLs, measures have been set in place ensuring that new loans are being
        extended to SOEs based on a comprehensive analysis of the companies' credit strength and ability to
        repay the debts. These measures ensure that only financially solid and viable SOEs obtain the required
        credit to finance their needs.
        Injecting investments in SOEs based on proper feasibility studies and forecasts for restructuring and
        renovations. Investments included profitable companies like Misr Aluminum, Egoth Hotels, Eastern
        Tobacco and Pharmaceutical companies, as well as losing companies like in the spinning and weaving
        sector. Total investments add up to LE 14 billion in the years from 2005 through 2009, which is an
        unprecedented rate.

Principles of Corporate Governance, Good Management and Disclosure
3.       The Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD) carries out the role of institutionalizing Corporate
Governance principles in Egyptian enterprises. High and middle-level management of both public and private
companies attended many workshops aimed at applying the Egyptian corporate governance code which was
issued in accordance with the OECD code. The EIoD periodic reports detail these efforts.
4.      Other measures aim at ensuring the hiring of new calibers to SOEs, setting a 6 year maximum tenor for
SOEs chairpersons. Additionally, to ensure the continuity of reforms, two deputies to each chairman are
appointed with the relevant background and experience. Since 2004, around 95 percent of the high-level
management in the 150 public enterprises has been reshuffled.
New Asset Management Program for Public Enterprises
5.       In early November 2008, the MOI proposed several new measures to further expedite the process of
restructuring SOEs. The main pillars of the new program are:
        Establishing an Asset Management Agency for SOEs: The agency will supervise the nine holding
        companies and will be responsible for restructuring SOEs. It will ensure the transparency and
        disclosure of information in accordance with best international practices, protecting workers' rights, and
        reshaping the ownership structure of SOEs when deemed necessary.
        Partial offering of SOEs through the stock exchange: The privatization policy for 2010 onwards will
        rely on partial offering of SOEs through the stock market. Companies will be classified for sale
        according to the tranches to be offered through the stock market. In the primary market, the offering
        will be confined to Egyptians to directly benefit from the program. Establishing a Future Generations'
        Fund: A fund will be established to preserve the rights of future generations. This fund will receive
        stake of public enterprises sold through the stock market in addition to resources allocated by the state.
        This will enable the Fund to provide assistance and support to future generations in the fields of
        education and healthcare.
                                                                   - 86 -

                                    ANNEX 13: ACCESS TO FINANCE IN EGYPT

1.        Financial access in Egypt is increasing in terms of lending, deposit-taking, and physical access through
banks and ATMs. Between 2006 and 2009, branch density rose by 60 percent, the number of ATMs by 26
percent, number of deposit accounts by 15 percent, and number of loans by 165 percent. The impact of the
global crisis on access to finance in Egypt has been to slow improvements in access to finance. SME lending
relative to total lending stayed virtually static between 2008 and 2009, while rates of growth in deposit and loan
accounts in 2009 were around one third of 2008 growth rates, but did not turn negative (3.5 percent and 12.8
percent respectively).

2.        However access to finance continues to be highly constrained, and lags behind regional and
international comparators. The only headline indicator on which Egypt is not below trend as compared to GDP,
is number of loans per 1,000 population. Deposits and ATMs per population are both notably low given Egypt's
level of GDP. The increase in ATMs since 2006 in particular has been very modest in comparison to that of
other countries at a similar stage of development. Leasing and factoring are emerging sectors with significant
unrealized potential still for improving access to finance for SMEs, as illustrated by the relative low percentage
of leasing penetration in the Egypt market.

A.        Microfinance

3.       Egypt has one of the two largest microfinance markets in the Arab world, with more than 1.3 million
active clients and a total outstanding loan portfolio of over US$337 million (Table A13.2). However, it is
estimated that less than 5 percent of the population under US$2/day has access to microfinance. NGOs still
dominate the microfinance market, with the 5 largest microcredit NGOs (Table A13.3) accounting for 45
percent of the microcredit clients in Egypt at the end of 2008, while the leading 4 banks providing microcredit
had a combined market share of only 18 percent.

4.        The potential for increased scale is huge though, through: (i) the non-bank finance company model that
will be created; (ii) increased bank wholesale funding of NGOs and NBFIs; (iii) PBDAC's extensive network of
outlets; and (iv) branchless banking technologies such as mobile phone banking. Mobile phone banking has the
potential to dramatically increase access to finance for the under-banked in Egypt, if a regulatory framework for
the development of mobile phone banking is put in place that also includes safeguards for consumer protection.
Egypt Post serves over 17 million clients through 3,700 outlets nationwide, including with savings, payments
and domestic transfer services, although not with microcredit.
5.        Two private sector banks already offer microcredit in cooperation with microfinance service
companies. Reefi is a service company working with Commercial International Bank (CIB), while Tanmeya
works with the Egyptian Gulf Bank (EGB). Reefi was established in 2007 as a Joint Stock Company with
Egyptian shareholders and the Social Fund for Development. Tanmeya was established in 2009 as a Joint Stock
Company with Egyptian shareholders, Finance Unlimited ­ a platform company of Citadel Capital - and EGB.
The EFSA estimates their joint market share to already be 3 percent of active microfinance borrowers, and
growing rapidly. Tanmeya plans to reach 100,000 clients by the end of 2010, and 1 million clients over the next
5 years, through 400 branches, and with a range of financial services including insurance, leasing, payments and
microcredit.
6.       Microinsurance is being introduced by leading microfinance NGOs (ABA and Dakalehya are both in
the top five of MFIs in Egypt by size, and the First Microfinance Foundation has the potential to join them in
                                                            - 88 -

that bracket) and service companies (Tanmeya), as service agents for insurance companies (Allianz and Alico).
So far this has been limited to death and disability protection on microloans, but with assistance from technical
assistance providers such as Planet Finance and from brokers such as Planet Guarantee, this may extend by 2011
into specific health, education or other insurance products.

B.        SME Finance

7.       Policymaker and lender interest in SMEs has been growing, but access remains limited for small and
medium firms. An overview of the leading SME finance providers, including number of clients, total and
average loan size, is provided in table 13.4 below. Average sizes of bank loans to SMEs vary significantly, from
$18,000 to $1.5 million, to some degree depending on the definitions used by the source of funding.
8.       There are over 200 registered leasing companies in Egypt, but only about 20 are active on any notable
scale. Incolease is the market leader, with an estimated market share of up to 40 percent. Incolease has 500
clients and a portfolio of about $542,000, and estimates that between 30 and 40 percent of its clients are SMEs.
Incolease set-up a leasing company `Upper Egypt Leasing Company' with a business support organization
`BEST', to target SMEs in that more difficult market, which had a cheaper and more streamlined cost structure
than the parent company, and was able to more profitably serve smaller firms. Incolease has supported this
company by seconding managers, and training marketing officers. In its first year of operation, this company has
leased about $11.7 million of assets.
9.        Factoring is not well developed in Egypt, with only a few companies providing this on any scale,
including Egypt Factors, the Export Credit Guarantee Company of Egypt (ECGE), and Concept. Egypt Factors
was set-up by CIB and by FIM Bank, and received an initial IFC investment. Egypt Factors started operations in
2008/09, and now has about 100 firms as clients. It provides export and local factoring to large and medium
sized firms, and purchase (reverse) factoring to SMEs. Through purchase factoring, SMEs in a range of sectors
- including food products and car manufacturing - that are suppliers to larger firms, including CIB or Egypt
Factor corporate clients, can receive a discounted payment for their invoices with those clients. These SMEs
would otherwise find it difficult to access financing from banks, given a lack of audited financial statements and
credit history. EGCE reportedly receives subsidized funding through the Government, which Egypt Factors does
not have access to.

10.      Egypt's SME sector is primarily a small enterprise sector. 92.5 percent of Egyptian enterprises are
micro in size, 7.3 percent small, and only 0.2 percent are medium and large. Only about 1.5 percent of private
sector enterprises have more than 10 employees. Micro and small enterprises in Egypt tend to have very small
amounts of capital. Around 59 percent of enterprises with 1­4 workers have capital of less than LE 5,000 (less
than US$ 1,000) and only 6 percent of all enterprises have invested capital of more than LE 50,000 (less than
US$ 10,000).58

11.     The legal and institutional framework governing creditor protections shows a mixed pattern. Egypt has
improved its credit reporting system, as reflected in the high score on the Doing Business `Credit Information'
index. Low public registry and credit bureau coverage may contribute to relatively poor performance on loan
recovery.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with the
Arab Republic of Egypt
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 10/49
April 14, 2010
 Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the
 IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
 (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV
 consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of
 post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term
 program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy
 matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use
 the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Egypt is
 also available.



On March 24, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV
consultation with Egypt.1

Background

Egypt made significant progress in wide-ranging structural reforms that accelerated after 2004. This spurred
rapid output growth--averaging 7 percent a year during FY2005/06 FY2007/08--underpinned by foreign
investment-driven productivity gains and the favorable external environment. Reforms also reduced fiscal,
monetary and external vulnerabilities, leaving some room to maneuver on macroeconomic policies in the event
of negative shocks.

Egypt weathered the global financial crisis relatively well and financial market pressures eased after the initial
outflow. Equity prices plateaued in recent months, after having recovered over half of the losses since the April
2008 peak. Egypt's sovereign spreads tightened during 2009 and, in early 2010, remain well below their pre-
Lehman levels. The temporary financial outflow was met mostly with a drawdown in the central bank's foreign
currency deposits with commercial banks, reversing the buildup in 2006 07 and limiting the impact on the
Egyptian pound and real economy. The authorities allowed some additional nominal exchange rate flexibility,
with the pound depreciating by about 6 percent between September 2008 and March 2009, and subsequently
appreciating (with resumed capital inflows) almost to its pre-crisis level.

The real economy held up relatively well in the face of weaker external demand. Although the current account
moved into deficit (2.4 percent of GDP in FY2008/09) as service receipts and remittances declined, and
investment and activity softened in exposed sectors, growth still reached 4.7 percent in FY2008/09. Resilient
domestic consumption demand, and production in the construction, communications, and trade sectors, helped
sustain growth and the pick-up to nearly 5 percent in the first half of FY2009/10.

The government reacted quickly to the crisis by providing a sizable fiscal stimulus in the second half of
FY2008/09 based mainly on accelerating investment projects. Key fiscal reforms such as introducing the
property tax, broadening the Value Added Tax (VAT), and phasing out energy subsidies were postponed. The
FY2009/10 budget continues to support economic activity and targets a wider deficit of 8.4 percent of GDP
largely reflecting a substantial projected cyclical fall in revenue (particularly from trade and Suez Canal traffic),
as well as the impact of wage increases adopted before the crisis and higher post-crisis debt service costs.

Reducing the fiscal deficit and public debt are key medium term objectives. Egypt's public debt remains high in
comparison with many other emerging market countries. While much of the debt is denominated in local
currency, the maturity structure is short, creating an annual rollover requirement of 20 percent of GDP. To
address this vulnerability and help spur private sector-led growth, the government has announced its intention to
reduce the deficit to about 3 percent of GDP by FY2014/15.

Supportive monetary policy helped resist crisis-related pressures. The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) cut policy
rates six times between February and September 2009 as both headline and core inflation declined rapidly to
single digits by August 2009. The deceleration of inflation stalled since October 2009, with headline inflation
rising above 13 percent, mainly due to supply shocks in several food categories. In the absence of demand
pressures, the pick-up in headline inflation has not become more widespread, and core inflation remains in
single digits and inside the CBE's informal comfort zone. Accordingly, the CBE has kept rates unchanged in the
past three Monetary Policy Committee meetings.

The CBE's Phase I banking reforms (2004 08)--strengthened supervision, restructuring and consolidation, and
a cleanup of NPLs--reduced financial vulnerabilities. Also, limited reliance on short term wholesale funding
channels and relatively traditional portfolios, allowed Egyptian banks to sidestep many of the detrimental effects
of the crisis. While the financial system remains stable, the CBE's Phase II reforms (2009 11) seeks to
implement Basel II standards and improve access to credit.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of staff's assessment. They commended the authorities' sound
macroeconomic management and the reforms implemented since 2004, which had strengthened the resilience of
the Egyptian economy in the face of the global financial crisis.

Directors praised the authorities' policy responses to the crisis. The targeted fiscal stimulus and successive cuts
in interest rates helped cushion the impact of the global slowdown. Directors observed that economic
performance held up well, with growth falling less than in many other emerging markets during 2008/09, and
picking up further in recent quarters. Financial market conditions have improved and some capital inflows have
resumed since the initial downturn. However, inflation remains elevated despite falling substantially from the
peaks experienced in 2008.

As the recovery gains strength, Directors underscored the importance of shifting policies back toward fiscal
consolidation and other reforms. They supported the authorities' objective of reducing the fiscal deficit to about
3 percent by 2014/15, in light of the still high public debt and large financing requirement. Directors encouraged
the authorities to make a substantive step to reduce the fiscal deficit at an early stage--to lessen vulnerability,
boost confidence in the fiscal adjustment strategy, and speed the response of private investment. Increasing the
low tax revenue-to-GDP ratio with a full-fledged VAT, and improving the efficiency of public spending by
reforming energy subsidies and pensions will be crucial to achieving the authorities' fiscal objectives. Directors
saw merit in strengthening public debt management through lengthening debt maturities and diversifying the
debt structure.

Directors agreed with recent decisions to keep policy interest rates stable. However, if inflation does not abate as
expected, they encouraged the CBE to consider tightening monetary conditions to prevent a buildup of
inflationary momentum. They also saw further reductions in inflation toward partner country levels as a key
objective for the coming years. Directors noted that continued short-term capital inflows could challenge
monetary policy making, and encouraged continued increases in exchange rate flexibility.

Directors agreed that continued broad-based reforms are needed to foster inclusive, employment-generating
growth. Priority reforms should focus on improving the investment climate and raising productivity. Developing
public-private partnerships can help mobilize private sector financing and know-how, but associated contingent
liabilities should be monitored closely. Fiscal adjustment and productivity-enhancing reforms also will reduce
the risk of real exchange rate appreciation and help maintain competitiveness. Directors supported ongoing
financial sector reforms to help contain risks and improve private sector access to credit. They encouraged
forward-looking risk management and in this respect welcomed plans to introduce Basel II standards.

Directors also pointed to the need to enhance data quality and availability to help improve the policy debate and
business environment.

1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of
any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
