the risk\n            to development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a well-defined\n            policy matrix owned by the government and endorsed by the\n            Bank and partners is an essential implementation roadmap for\n            the authorities to move the agenda forward. Having a\n            government entity or authority that is empowered and\n            competent enough to successfully build consensus around the\n            program, and defend it in difficult times of political and\n            social unrest is critical. The single tranche third\n            development policy loan (DPL III) proved to be a suitable\n            instrument for the Borrower and the Bank. It responded\n            effectively to the needs of the authorities by providing\n            them timely support based on clearly established prior\n            actions. Lessons learnt from this operation can be\n            disseminated at knowledge management events. The experiences\n            in the preparation and implementation of the operation could\n            be shared with other regions through various means,\n            including the Finance and Private Sector Development (FPD)\n            network monthly newsletter, as well as through hosting a\n            brown bag lunches (BBL)."}, "docdt": "2012-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
