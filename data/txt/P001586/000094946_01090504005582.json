Both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are assessed\n            unsatisfactory, given the poor quality at entry, conducive\n            to critical failures in the appraisal of management\n            practices, and, the neglect in establishing an independent\n            research advisory committee to oversee the project's\n            science agenda, respectively. The lessons learned raise two\n            major issues: a) how to ensure a balanced scientific\n            research, and pro-active planning for resource management,\n            and, b) how to achieve sustainable management of\n            trans-boundary resources, given differing riparian\n            interests, and incentives to participate. The balance\n            between research, and planning appears to be primarily\n            determined by the terms of reference of the project manager,\n            and to a lesser extent, by the effectiveness of the steering\n            committee. While undoubtedly, the project's\n            science-bias caused a lack of focus on the planning, and\n            resource management, a more generalist scientific approach\n            would have improved the Lake's management plans, and, a\n            well designed operational set-up would have achieved\n            relevant objectives, with a greater inclusive, and riparian\n            approach to a balanced biodiversity conservation. Bank\n            efforts should facilitate regional institutions, and plan\n            extensive consultations to coordinate riparian efforts,\n            through free-standing projects to better support\n            cross-boundary resource conservation, with objective\n            management, and technical reviews, and carefully structured partnerships."}, "docdt": "2001-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
