The absence\n            of data on the Lake's biodiversity, and productive\n            systems, justified research which, in parallel with\n            on-the-job training towards building the riparian states\n            institutional capacity, was conducted by highly academic,\n            and scientific experts. This far sighted decision, provided\n            a cadre of scientific personnel, who can now build upon the\n            research undertaken, to manage the lake in the future.\n            However, it is important to note that the project's\n            institutional design stems from weak horizontal linkages\n            with national institutions, a most relevant factor to\n            scientific findings. These institutions, the Fisheries\n            Department, Water Resources Department, and the University\n            of Malawi, whose linkages most likely may not reduce the\n            long-term impact of the project, may well delay the adequacy\n            of the lake's management. Nonetheless, the\n            establishment of an environmental monitoring program for the\n            maintenance of ecosystems, was a major decision for riparian\n            cooperation in the lake's resource management, for it\n            lay the foundation to strengthen riparian capacity, in\n            preparation of the next phase of the program. However, the\n            project reinforces that insufficient preparation of project\n            components affects, and delays implementation, for it forces\n            management to determine factors whose suitability should\n            have been set at appraisal. Likewise, ill defined\n            implementing roles, and organizational requirements, should\n            have been defined at project preparation."}, "docdt": "2000-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
