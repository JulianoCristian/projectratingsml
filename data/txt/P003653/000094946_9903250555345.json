There are two main components in this project. First,\n            Inland Container Depot (ICD) development aims at developing\n            container handling capability at selected inland cities\n            located along two pilot corridors. The Bank will finance\n            qualified ICDs for their construction and the procurement of\n            equipment. Second, upgrading Tianjin Port container handling\n            capacity will extend financial assistance to the upgrading\n            of container handling equipment at Tianjin Harbor Container\n            Company, and providing technical assistance to establish a\n            better operational and institutional environment for\n            container operations."}, "docdt": "1999-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
