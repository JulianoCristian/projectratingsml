The main source of\n            air pollution source comes from tail gas from vehicles. To\n            mitigate the impact, all vehicles must run on designated\n            route. Trees will be planted along it. Cleaning of\n            containers results in water pollution. To mitigate the\n            impact, all cleaning wastewater must be massively treated.\n            Only the wastewater fitting the national standards may be\n            discharged. All rubbish produced in the process of treatment\n            must be sent to specific trash collection spots. During\n            operation, vegetation belts will be built in all ICDs to\n            reduce machine noise and vehicle noise. Layout of each ICD\n            will be reasonably planned and designed so that noise\n            pollution will be minimized. Vehicle speed will be limited.\n            Soundproof walls will be built in some sites. Cargoes at\n            some sites contain dangerous substances which may cause\n            diffusion of poison, explosion, and fires. These dangerous\n            cargoes must be handled by trained personnel. \"Temporal\n            Regulations on Port Management of Dangerous Cargoes\"\n            will be strictly enforced."}, "docdt": "1998-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
