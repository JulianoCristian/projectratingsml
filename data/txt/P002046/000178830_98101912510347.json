Agricultural Development\n            Project will consist of a package of farm support services\n            and physical infrastructure designed to benefit about\n            600,000 small-holder farm families in Kano State, of whom\n            about 70 percent are expected to adopt improved farm\n            practices. Support services would include improved farm and\n            water management practices, extension advice, crop\n            protection measures, weed control improved seeds,\n            fertilizer, and the provision of small-scale pump irrigation\n            on the fadama lands. Forest nurseries would be established\n            for on-farm and commercial planting programs. Physical\n            infrastructure would include constructing about 1,440 km of\n            feeder roads, drilling about 1,000 boreholes, rehabilitating\n            about 1,000 wells, and establishing project headquarters and\n            farm service centers. Consultant services would be engaged\n            to assist in recruiting a project management team and to\n            carry out studies of adaptive research, intermediate\n            technology, rural water supply planning, training and staff\n            development, and the project's socio-economic impact.\n            Since the basic agricultural package is simple and well\n            tested, the project does not involve unusual risks."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
