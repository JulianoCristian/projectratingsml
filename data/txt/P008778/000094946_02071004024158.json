impact as substantial,\n            Bank performance as satisfactory, and borrower performance\n            as satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project\n            implementation include: 1) The Bank was right to resist\n            engaging in the preparation of a large-scale and complex\n            operation and to focus on an operation with a relatively\n            simple design given that the beneficiary had no prior\n            experience in the implementation of externally financed\n            projects. 2) The Bank insisted on using international\n            procurement although a majority of the contracts were of a\n            nature and size unlikely to attract serious international\n            firms. The fact is that under the international umbrella the\n            bulk of contract work was provided by local contractors with\n            the external firms playing a mere role of coordinator. A\n            larger openness to the local contracting industry would have\n            eliminated some of the difficulties faced by the project. 3)\n            While promoting the involvement of private operators in the\n            delivery of local utility services is a major strategic\n            objective for the Bank, it must be recognized that it lacks\n            the flexibility of a commercial bank and cannot easily\n            respond to the changing needs of a beneficiary by adjusting\n            terms and conditions of its loans."}, "docdt": "2002-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
