                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The current ISR spans a period of over 6 months during which a 2nd order restructuring of the project took place to extend the closing date by 8 months up to June 30, 2012 and to
                         reallocate IDA and CIDA trust fund resources among disbursement categories. At the time of restructuring, in September 2011, implementation performance was deemed

                         management. However, by January, 2012 there has been a lapse in terms of financial management as well as some slow down in implementation of key activities. The Task Team
                         is particularly concerned that key issues in financial management including securing of funds to bridge an identified funding gap, weak budget control, inadequate SOE submission,
                         weak reporting, and outstanding reimbursements. There is also concern about the procurement of a consultant to complete the end of project evaluation. Although most activities are

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The PMU has revised its annual plan and budget to allow proper completion of the Project. A funding gap of about 1.7 million USD remains. It is expected that this shortfall will
                         be financed by the Government's own resources. A request to cover the shortfall through an EFY 2004 supplementary budget allocation has been submitted to the Ministry of
                         Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) by the Ministry of Agriculture. However, MoFED has not responded to this request over the past two months
                         2. Close attention needs to be paid to the timely implementation of delayed activities.
                         3. On the extension component, two key remaining activities are (a) the strengthening of Farmer-Research-Extension Groups (FREGs) and (b) support to Farmer Innovation Groups
                         (FIFs). There is too little differentiation in implementing FREGs, FIFs and normal demonstration through FTCs. Over the next six months, strengthening of FREGs will focus on
                         institutionalizing and ensuring sustainability of innovations introduced; and, implementation of FIFs will strictly follow FIF guidelines with greater emphasis placed on involvement of
                         women.
