                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The current ISR is the last before the project closing date. The final implementation support mission was carried out from April 22nd to May 7th. During the mission, the Task Team
                         found that, with some important exceptions particularly on component 5: strengthening market institutions, most RCBP activities have now been completed. Nevertheless, capacity

                         building being an on-going process, some activities will need to be continued after Project closing: (a) training of professionals from the extension and animal health services and
                         agricultural research; including long term training some of which was started by the project but will not be completed by project closing (b) agricultural research sub-projects funded
                         under a competitive grants program, with a few sub-project that were started by the Project's National Agricultural Research Fund (NARF) expected to be still on-going at project
                         closing (c) implementation of a new ATVET strategy, the development of which was supported under the Project (d) roll out of the national agricultural research coordination system;

                         the framework for which was developed under the Project (e) ensuring internet connectivity within key institutions including agricultural research centers and woreda offices of
                         agriculture.

                         The Project will close with little implemented under component 5; i.e., strengthening market institutions. Already seriously delayed, it was expected that over the last 6 months, the
                         following would be implemented under this component: (a) installation of price tickers in 150 major agricultural markets, (b) installation of IT infrastructure at the Ethiopia Commodity
                         Exchange (ECX); and, (c) construction of two livestock quarantine stations. Installation/operationalization of the price tickers; and, shipment, clearing and subsequent installation of IT
                         infrastructure for the ECX is progressing, but slowly. The Task Team has been assured that, at the close of the Project, the IT infrastructure for the ECX will have been delivered and
                         installed. However, installation of price tickers will not be completed. Currently 50 out of the 150 planned market centers have tickers that are functioning. Regarding the construction
                         of livestock quarantine stations, it is clear that neither the Metema nor the Humera Livestock Quarantine Station can be completed and made fully operational by the Project.

                         The Task Team appreciates that the RCBP has, in this last stage of its implementation, faced considerable implementation difficulties --- arising from insufficiency of project funding
                         following cancellation of about 13 million USD in 2008 and subsequent difficulties in securing additional funds to complete Project activities, an inflationary environment that has put
                         pressure on maintaining budget controls, inadequate attention to safeguard policies at the start of civil works that disrupted activities, which were then difficult to resume, weak
                         implementation capacity among implementing agencies, etc. It is therefore pleased that most activities have been brought to completion and is satisfied that the GoE will take forward
                         initiatives started by the Project. The Task Team also notes improvements in financial management and safeguards compliance. Although the Government's implementation
                         completion report has not yet been started, the Task Team has also noted that the necessary studies to inform the Government and World Bank Implementation Completion Reports
                         to assess the results and impact of the project as well as to draw lessons learned from RCBP implementation are under way and will all be completed by mid June. Given continued
                         outstanding activities at project closing, implementation progress is maintained as moderately unsatisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The Ministry of Agriculture will fully take over the construction of the two livestock quarantine stations planned to be carried out by RCBP and do this at its own pace. Since it is not
                         acceptable for the Project to close with a partially constructed facility that will not be completed within a reasonable period after Project closing, the GoE will return all payments made
                         on the Metema Livestock Quarantine Station to the Project account and use such funds as well as the amount set aside for Metema phase I construction to cover costs under other
                         components. Clinical materials and a vehicle already procured for the Metema Livestock Quarantine Station will be distributed to other livestock quarantine stations.
                         2. Progress on institutionalizing and ensuring sustainability of innovations introduced through RCBP has been limited. Regional and national workshops will be held to urgently
                         discuss the issues of institutionalization of RCBP initiatives into the regular agricultural service delivery to develop concrete plans for such institutionalization. With regard to
                         competitive research grants for agricultural research, this will be institutionalized within the Ethiopia Agricultural Research Coordination System. Ongoing NARF sub-projects will be
                         funded directly by the EIAR
                         3. In view of the upcoming closing of the project, the Ministry of Agriculture and EIAR management will pay close attention to timely submission of SOEs and justification of advances
                         and to proper financial closing procedures.
