follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory\n            and borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: the project offers a broad\n            and diverse range of lessons, many of which are identified,\n            discussed, and documented in the various case studies and\n            implementation completion studies commissioned by the\n            Project Management Unit (PMU) at the end of the project.\n            Strengthening agricultural information and knowledge systems\n            can yield significant returns. While this only confirms a\n            broad body of literature, the project showed that the\n            results can be achieved under difficult circumstances such\n            as in the civil service system and a weak implementation\n            capacity. The concept of 'capacity building'\n            incorporates both the strengthening of existing systems and\n            institutional reforms. Human resource development is a key\n            part of capacity building. Because in-service training\n            supported by projects is often not institutionalized and\n            therefore does not follow normal training parameters, it\n            runs the risk of being implemented in such a manner that the\n            training is not effective or does not meet a required\n            standard. To enhance women's participation, affirmative\n            action and gender disaggregation can be a useful starting point."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
