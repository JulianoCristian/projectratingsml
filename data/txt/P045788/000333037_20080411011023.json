were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the project included investments\n            in three provinces with each province setting up an\n            implementing unit to implement the project in its province.\n            As it was not practical 17 organically to have a common\n            implementing agency for the project, the Bank task team had\n            to deal directly with three separate counterparts. Project\n            preparation and supervision, as a result, were more complex\n            than usual. Variances in geological conditions between those\n            actually found on site and those used in detailed designs\n            reflected a need for more comprehensive site investigations\n            at the design stage. The program for overseas training for\n            Inner Mongolia (140 person-months) turned out to be overly\n            ambitious (only 69 person-months were achieved) as the\n            province did not seem to have enough staff to be sent for\n            training. In light that the ministry of finance has become\n            stringent with the incurrence of expenses for overseas\n            training, a more realistic program may be structured for\n            future projects. Rural roads in the Roads Improvement\n            Program for Poverty Alleviation (RIPA) component have a\n            positive impact on poverty alleviation and yielded\n            considerable social benefits for poor communities."}, "docdt": "2007-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
