 IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report

       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.

       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.

       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System

       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).

       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

       Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.

       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) prepared by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) for two projects: Tri-provincial Highway Project (Loan 4356-
CHA) and Hubei-Xiaogan-Xiangfan Highway Project, (Loan 4590-CHA). The
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan to the Government
of China (GOC) for the Tri-provincial project was approved by the Board of Directors on
June 23, 1998 in the amount of US$230.0 million. At appraisal the total project cost was
estimated to be US$658.7 million, with US$428.7 million to be contributed by the GOC.
The final project cost was US$649.3 million of which the loan contributed US$225.0
million. The IBRD loan to GOC for the Hubei project was approved by the Board of
Directors on September 17, 2002 in the amount of US$250.0 million. At appraisal the
total project cost was estimated to be US$690.90 million, with US$440.9 million to be
contributed by the GOC. The final project cost was US$862.5 million of which the loan
contributed US$221.7 million.

The projects were completed as planned. There were, however, significant road design
changes to increase the capacity of the main highway component in both projects. In the
Tri-provincial project the costs of these changes were paid from the savings that resulted
from conservative cost estimates. At completion about US$5 million of the loan remained
undisbursed and was canceled. In the Hubei project the savings in the rural roads
component of about US$30 million were canceled because the State Ministry of Finance
did not approve their use for additional rural roads - the increased costs (40 percent) of
the main roads were funded by the province.

The projects were selected for assessment because of the comprehensive road network
improvement involving several road owners; their road traffic safety components; their
sizable institutional development and training aspects to strengthen road management,
including land acquisition, resettlement and environment safeguards; and socioeconomic
development to reduce poverty or provide better access to "lagging regions". Useful
lessons are drawn from this project which will be valuable for other projects in the region
and elsewhere, while the experiences in the management of the safeguard issues will
provide an input into an ongoing IEG study of the effectiveness of the World Bank
Group's safeguard policies.

IEG prepared this report based on an examination of the relevant Project Appraisal
Documents (PAD), Implementation Completion Reports (ICR), legal agreements, project
files and archives, as well as other relevant reports, memoranda, and working papers.
Discussions were also held with Bank staff in both Washington D.C. and in China, both
in Beijing and the provincial capitals. An IEG field mission visited China in February and
March 2009, conducted site visits, and discussed both the project and the effectiveness of
Bank assistance with relevant officials and stakeholders. The mission appreciates the
support and attention given by beneficiary officials well as the Bank's office in Beijing.

Following IEG practice, copies of the draft PPAR was sent to government officials and
agencies for their review, but no comments were received.

Summary

        This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for two highway
projects in China: Tri-provincial Highway Project (Loan 4356-CHA) and Hubei-
Xiaogan-Xiangfan Highway Project, (Loan 4590-CHA). The projects formed part of the
extensive lending by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
to China's road sector to help finance the ambitious program of completing the 44,000
km of the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) by 2020. Both projects featured
tolled expressways. The Tri-provincial highway project was the first IBRD loan to the
western provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia, whose highway networks
lagged behind the more developed eastern provinces. Hubei is located at the center of the
NTHS, and also ranks among the less developed provinces. In addition to the highway
development, both projects included a rural roads component to improve access to poor
counties as well as a road safety component. The total project cost was close to US$650
million in the three provinces and slightly over US$860 million in Hubei, of which the
Bank loans contributed US$245 million and US$220 million, respectively.

        The projects had similar development objectives: to increase the efficiency and
safety of traffic in highway priority corridors in order to facilitate faster socioeconomic
development; to provide improved access to targeted poor counties; to improve highway
sector institutional capacity; and to improve the safety of road transport.

        Three factors merit to be singled out in respect of the projects' implementation.
The first was China's phenomenal economic growth during the implementation period,
which led to an upward revision of the highways' design parameters. The second factor
was a growing perception of the importance of the environment and other safeguard
policies in highway development, which--after advice from the Bank's teams--were
consistently and reliably addressed. Third, although the rural roads do not fall under the
jurisdiction of the implementing entities, they were (after some difficulty) successfully
implemented and may have had a catalytic effect in accelerating the unlocking of the
potential benefits of improved access to poor areas.

        The projects were implemented on schedule even with an expanded scope of the
road works. Because substantial funds remained unspent, the Tri-provincial project was
extended by two years to permit upgrading of a Class II road in Gansu. The Hubei project
was completed as scheduled.

        The overall outcome of both projects is satisfactory. All the components were
completed successfully and mostly exceeded the target values for the project
development objectives. This rating is also supported by substantial relevance and high
ratings for efficiency with economic rates of return of over 25 percent. Risk to
development outcome is rated negligible to low based on the financial viability of the
projects on the basis of expected traffic growth, a new funding mechanism for rural
roads, strong institutions, and the competence of the professionals involved in project
operation and maintenance.

        The design for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for these projects was a
challenging task. Several of the measures and diverse objectives with many jurisdictions
were difficult to monitor in a project context, but needed to be addressed at higher
administrative and management levels. There may have also been changes in the way
statistics were reported. Output and outcome measures for the main highway component
enabled monitoring of project progress, and measures for the broad socioeconomic
objectives were used, although there were some attribution problems. Given the solid
performance in implementation and the setting up of systems that can be utilized for
future planning and monitoring, M&E is regarded as substantial.

        Bank performance was satisfactory. The project concepts, their identification and
preparation were not without issues in either project: there were problems with project
costing and jurisdiction in the case of both the road safety and rural roads components,
but the shortcomings in preparation were compensated for by exceptionally good
supervision. The construction component of the projects was implemented well to good
design standards; institutional capacity and traffic safety have improved considerably;
and the Bank safeguard policies were implemented beyond mere compliance. It also is
likely that the rural roads components have had an influence on the Government's recent
emphasis on and funding for rural roads, while the sound application of the Bank
safeguards policies and entrenchment in provincial practices was a positive development.

        The Borrower performance rating is also satisfactory for both projects. There was
effective cooperation between the Borrower and the Bank throughout preparation and
implementation. The central and provincial governments were fully committed, assisted
in the preparation, followed the projects closely and helped to resolve issues promptly.
With the local governments' support, land acquisition and resettlement were addressed
and carried out satisfactorily and without delay. The implementing agencies in all the
Provincial Communication Departments demonstrated commitment towards achieving
the project objectives, to carrying out Environment Management Plans and the safeguard
policies to the letter--occasionally with the Bank's support and through firmness of
supervision to the many institutional strengthening activities, as evidenced by timely
completion of the project, the extensive and sustained training, and adoption of new
concepts in road maintenance. The project has motivated the Provincial Communications
Departments' staff and has improved their professional skills and awareness of good road
management practices.

        The Bank's lending to China's highway sector continues to deliver some
important benefits. The value of the Bank support lies less, however, in the actual loans
(which are a tiny percentage of the country's total transport investments), but more in the
form of less quantifiable benefits such as the best practice application of safeguard
policies and the development of road management methodology through studies, advice
and training. In the projects reviewed in this PPAR the inclusion of the rural road
components also over time may help to unlock the potentially substantial benefits that
can come from improving rural access by contributing to the debate about how
jurisdictional and funding issues can be overcome. According to several officials
interviewed by the IEG mission, the Bank has had a very useful and even
transformational effect on motivating local transport sector professionals to think "out of
the box". From this overview come four lessons:

                                      xi


It is important to ensure during project preparation that the mandate of the
implementing entity is consistent with the scope of the project. The
implementation of the two highway projects in China proved unexpectedly
challenging because the implementing entity had no jurisdiction over the rural
roads and the traffic safety components.

A middle income country can still benefit substantially from the Bank's technical
assistance and expertise. The provincial officials involved in these major highway
projects learnt quickly from the experiences from the training programs, study
tours and advice from Bank staff. In respect of safeguards policies there was
ample evidence of a movement from a compliant paradigm to one in which
society was better off because of the intervention. Technical expertise was also
passed on in respect of inter alia road maintenance by contract, expressway
management, and good practice in road safety.

Some adjustments in the scheduling of safeguards procedures could be
considered. The completion of the full Resettlement Action Plan before the
preliminary engineering highway design was completed wasted scarce resources
as it had to be re-done because the road alignments changed significantly.

Since the gap between safeguard policies in the Bank and China on highway
projects is now quite small, good supervision is the key to ensuring that the
policies are followed. In China, at least in the provinces where the projects were
assessed, performance-based project lending has sufficed in respect of safeguards,
but the application of the country systems with periodic supervision by the Bank
could be contemplated.

1.       Background

1.1         China's provinces are at different levels of development. China's Gross
National Product (GNP) in 2007 was about $3.8 billion, or US$2,830 per capita and has
grown by nearly 11 percent annually over the past 10 years, though this is expected to
slow with the current world wide recession. Even so, for comparison the poorest project
province had per capita income of about half of China's average, while the richest
province was twice the average.

1.2         China has been a major borrower in the transport sector. Between 1995-2000
China's share of the World Bank's commitments for transport were US$4.2 billion, 24
percent of total Bank transport commitments. Between 2001 and 2006 India overtook
China's position with US$4.2 billion in commitments (25 percent share), but China still
ranked second with US$2.3 billion in commitments.1 A large share of these loans has
been for tolled expressways, which can generate the revenue to repay the loans.2

1.3         The Tri-provincial Highway Project for the three adjoining provinces--Gansu,
Ningxia and Inner Mongolia--was the first Bank supported highway project in these
provinces, while the Hubei-Xiogan-Xiangfan Highway (XXE) Project was the third Bank
highway project for Hubei province.

The project context

Tri-provincial Highway Project

1.4         Gansu Province has a population of 26 million with an annual Gross Regional
Product (GRP) of US$40 billion and a per capita income of US$1,550, about 55 percent
of the China's average. Gansu is classified as a developing province with a higher than
average poverty level. Nevertheless, Gansu, whose main industries are mining,
agriculture, and tourism, has been growing at an annual rate of 11-12 percent
accompanied with changes in its industry structure.

1.5         When the project was prepared in 1997 Gansu had just 14 km of modern
highways. Reflecting a phenomenal pace of economic development, Gansu's highway
system now consists of nearly 6,500 km of highways of which 1,316 km are expressways
(and part from the National Expressway Network, [NEN]). Several hundred additional
kilometers are currently under construction. The local governments, the counties,
townships and villages, are responsible for maintaining the rural roads of about 92,500
km. Only about 20 percent of these rural roads are paved. The Gansu Provincial
Communications Department (GPCD) provides technical assistance in their planning and

road management, and subsidizes their maintenance. Nonetheless adequate funding of the
current expenditures for rural roads remains an issue.

1.6       Ningxia Province is China's smallest with a population of 7-8 million. It is also
classified as a developing province with annual GRP of US$13.3 billion and per capita
income of US$1,780, about 60 percent of China's average. The poverty level is higher
than the average for China. Ningxia's main industries are mining, chemicals, and
agriculture. Ningxia's economy has until recently been growing at an annual rate of 12
percent and has been characterized by changes in industry structure.

1.7       When the project was prepared in 1997 Ningxia had only one modern highway
under construction. Subsequent development in Ningxia has been rapid. It currently has
over 4,000 km of highways of which a quarter are expressways. Several hundred
kilometers are under construction. There are also about 16,500 km of rural roads, owned
by the counties, townships and villages. As in Gansu, the Ningxia PCD provides
technical assistance in planning and road management, and subsidizes the maintenance of
the rural roads on a 50-50 basis; the Province, through NPCD and the Ministry of
Transport, cover part of the rehabilitation and construction costs through grants.

1.8       Inner Mongolia Province has a population of 24 million spread over a vast
territory (its length is 4,200 km). Inner Mongolia is the wealthiest of the four provinces
with the annual GRP of US$90 billion and per capita income of US$4,500 about 60
percent above China's average. The annual growth rate has been about 20 percent and the
poverty level is low. Inner Mongolia is rich in natural resources whose extraction and
utilization constitute the main industries: coal, ferrous metals, oil and related industries,
and agriculture.

1.9       When the Tri-provincial project was prepared in 1997 Inner Mongolia had only
one expressway. Since then development in Inner Mongolia has been more rapid than in
the other three provinces. Its National Road System consists of over 15,000 km of
highways of which 1,800 km are expressways. Several hundred kilometers of roads are
under construction or rehabilitation. There are also about 104,000 km of rural roads,
owned by the counties, townships and villages. The Inner Mongolia Provincial
Communications Department (IMPCD) provides technical assistance for planning and
road management, and subsidizes their maintenance; construction grants are provided by
the state through IMPCD.

Hubei-Xiaogan-Xiangfan Highway Project

1.10      Hubei Province has a population of 60 million. Its annual GRP is about US$140
billion, and has until recently grown at 12 percent annually. The per capita income of
US$2,300 is about 80 percent of China's average. Historically Hubei has been a
relatively wealthy province, but in the past two decades has lagged behind the eastern
seashore provinces and is now below average among all China's provinces. Hubei has a
diverse industrial structure: auto manufacturing, steel, agriculture, and service industries,
especially in and around the provincial capital of Wuhan. There is a large income
differential between the capital city of Wuhan and the rest of the province, especially the
western rural counties, which have a high incidence of poverty.

                                              3


1.11      Hubei is at the center of China's National Highway Transport System. It
currently consists of nearly 6,000 km of National Roads of which about 2,800 km are
NEN expressways. Several hundred kilometers are under construction. There are about
170,000 km of rural roads, owned by the counties, townships and villages. As in most
other provinces the Hubei Provincial Communications Department (HPCD) provides
technical assistance in planning, road management and local governments' maintenance
activities.

1.12      In China, the National Expressway Network has been a major focus of transport
development and investment. The two projects in four provinces continue that pattern,
but they also indicate a shift of emphasis to the development of the inland provinces. This
PPAR evaluates, among other things, the value added of the Bank in supporting typical
highway projects in China. In particular, the PPAR shows that the Bank supported
projects continue to be of value to China, both on technical grounds and because of the
Bank's safeguard policies.




2.      Project Objectives and Components

2.1       The scope of the project development objectives (PDO) in the loan agreements
was similar in both projects. For the Tri-provincial project the objectives were:

    1) To increase the efficiency and safety of traffic in highway priority corridors in
        order to facilitate faster socioeconomic development;
    2) To provide improved access to targeted poor counties;
    3) To improve highway sector institutional capacity; and
    4) To improve the safety of road transport.

For the Hubei-Xiaogan-Xiangfan there was an overarching PDO: "To improve the
efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the transport infrastructure in support of the
social and economic development of Hubei province."


2.2       The objectives and the PDO indicators are similar, but not identical as shown in
Tables 1 and 2. The Tri-provincial project put more emphasis on the financial and fiscal
impacts while in the Hubei project their importance is less pronounced, perhaps because
there the toll road administration and management is already well-established. The
project objectives are relevant and in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS
1998) and China's transport development plans for road network capacity, traffic safety,
and poverty alleviation. They remain relevant to the Bank's FY06-10 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS): to reduce barriers to trade and investment; manage resource
scarcity and environmental challenges; and reduce poverty, inequality and social
exclusion. The projects' main highway components are part of the Government's planned
development of the National Expressway Network, to be completed by 2020.

2.3      The project components effectively map one-to-one to the project objectives.
The allocation of project costs at appraisal to the objectives is summarized in Table 1.
The projects were classified as Environmental Category A under the Bank's Operational
Directives and Policy 4.01. IEG agrees with this classification. The Tri-provincial Project
triggered two safeguard policies (Environmental Assessment, and Involuntary
Resettlement) and the Hubei project three (Environmental Assessment, Involuntary
Resettlement, and Cultural Heritage).

3. Project Design

3.1        The implementing agency in each province was the provincial communications
department (PCD). A World Bank Financed Project Management Office, (PMO for short), was
established in each PCD headquarters and was responsible for project preparation and
coordination, implementation of the traffic safety, and the institutional strengthening
components. The rural roads improvement program was carried out by the county level
construction office under the auspices of the respective Highway Administration Bureau of the
PCD. The implementation of the principal component, the highway and related roads, was
carried by a construction management office in the PCD, or a project company fully owned by
the PCD. The staff at the headquarters PMO and the construction management office were
largely the same. As planned, after completion the construction management entity was either
reorganized to operate and maintain the (toll) road or the project roads were transferred to a new
entity for maintenance and operation. The financial management was undertaken by the
Provincial Finance Bureaus. This institutional arrangement for project implementation, although
logical at appraisal, did not, however, take into account the local administrative mandates and
practices.

3.2        In the Tri-provincial project the unusually large contingencies covered any cost
increases with money left over, which was used to add a Class 2 road to the project in Gansu.
The large contingency was agreed to because the project was the first Bank project in the
province and there was no information on prices under competitive procurement rules. In the
Hubei project the contingency cost was in line with industry practice, and the cost estimate for
the main highway was consistent with the past experience in similar projects (project ICR p.20),
but it proved to be too low. The cost estimate was reviewed by international consultants who
recommended a higher cost estimate, but the Bank's Hubei task team was unable to persuade the
client to adopt more realistic cost estimates. The final costs were 30 percent higher than the
appraisal estimate and the province covered the overrun. The cost increases stemmed from road
alignment changes, related resettlement costs, the 4-lane connecting roads, and appreciation of
the Yuan.3 According to provincial government policy, the savings in the rural roads, in Hubei,
could not be used for expanding that component. Land acquisition and resettlement costs also
increased noticeably in both projects, partly due to design changes and partly due to higher
compensation standards in a Bank financed project.

3.3        The projects were not reviewed at entry by the Bank's Quality Assurance Group.
Project risks were, however, adequately considered, the safeguard policies were addressed during
preparation in compliance with Bank guidelines, and the engineering designs, cost estimates, and
electrical and mechanical facilities were reviewed by international engineering consultants. IEG
notes, nonetheless that there were issues with the cost estimates and also institutional design
issues with both the road safety and rural roads components (see par.5.3-5.5).




3. After these projects, the Bank and the Borrower agreed to adopt as realistic cost estimates as possible and to
reduce the size of the contingency.

                                                8


4. Monitoring and Evaluation

4.1       Design. Since the indicators are almost identical for both projects the M&E
ratings apply to both cases. The two projects covered four distinct areas: the dominant
expressway construction; poverty alleviation through the rural roads component;
institutional development, which included training, a broad array of studies, equipment
acquisition for road maintenance; and, traffic safety initiatives. To design M&E measures
for projects with such diverse objectives was a challenge. Of the PDO outcome
monitoring indicators, shown in Table 2, indicators 1-3 and 8-10 are useful and relevant
to the project expressways, their construction and operation, and the roads under the
jurisdiction of the PCD. The intermediate output indicators used in the project (not
shown) were traditional engineering milestones and measurable. They established useful
benchmarks to monitor and track the implementation progress of the project components,
especially the expressways and adjoining provincial roads.

4.2       However, the other outcome indicators pertaining to traffic safety and access to
poor counties fall under the jurisdiction of other entities and several road owners. The
projects covered only a portion of the rural road network, which is not under the direct
jurisdiction of the implementing entity, while the implementation of an M&E framework
with collection of road data and related socioeconomic data are not within the mandate of
the PCD. For this reason those PDO indicators that relate to rural roads, poverty, and to
an extent for traffic safety, proved difficult to formulate.

4.3        In traffic safety, the removal of black spots will reduce collisions. However,
traffic safety work consisted of several other activities and the catch-all outcome
measure--the accident rate--although concise and universally used will not indicate the
separate effectiveness of these measures. It is important to note, however, that the
accident recording system that was established will in time enable the analysis of the
kinds of issues just mentioned. Accident monitoring requires data over a long time period
to establish trends and causality. The same indefiniteness pertains to the institutional
development indicator--person months of training. It is concise and useful output
measure, but unlikely to capture the effects of the many activities that were undertaken
under the institutional development component. The school enrollment indicator is also
affected by many endogenous factors that make attribution to the project speculative.
Finally, the table includes no indicators for the safeguards. M&E during design is
considered moderate.

4.4       Implementation. Road data collection and the accident data record systems were
diligently established for the project roads. These data systems are used to deliver the
values of the project outcome indicators. The system can be expanded to cover the entire
network, but its full implementation (and utilization) will take several years. The rural
roads will normally be the last to be included in such data systems. For traffic safety and
institutional development, the chosen indicators were straightforward and easy to collect.
Because of their "catch-all" nature, they were also observed and monitored during
supervision using a mixture of indicators and checklists to gauge the implementation
progress. In IEG's view M&E during implementation in both projects is substantial.

                                              9



4.5       Utilization. The design of the M&E system described above was carried out
with a view to utilizing it not only to monitor and evaluate the project progress, but also
its effects beyond the implementation period. The indicators in Table 2, their target
values at completion and at the time of the PPAR mission, remain useful and informative
about the projects' lasting impacts even though a longer trend period is necessary before
some of the indicators will be useful. M&E utilization is regarded at this stage as
substantial.

4.6       Overall, M&E is rated substantial.




5. Implementation


Implementation and Implementation Issues

PROJECT APPROVALS AND PROJECT CONTENT CHANGES

5.1       The Tri-provincial project was approved on June 3, 1997. There were three
different task managers, but the discontinuity did not have an impact on performance.
Supervision averaged two missions a year and the project as originally conceived was
completed by mid 2005, but was then extended by two years to June 30 2007 in order to
utilize project savings in Gansu. This enabled the rehabilitation of an additional 85 km of
existing Class 2 road. At project completion US$5 million was cancelled. In Ningxia, the
Guyaozi-Wangquanliang Highway (GWH) was upgraded from a 2-lane road to a full 4-
lane expressway standard for functional classification, safety and maintenance reasons.
The Bank agreed to the change following a review of a supplemental feasibility study and
the Loan Agreement was amended accordingly on February 1, 2001. Also in Inner
Mongolia there was a design change. The Batou-Dongsheng Road was built as a 4-lane
expressway, not 2-lanes as planned. This enabled the old Class 2 Baotou-Dongsheng
Road, to be rehabilitated to function as a parallel auxiliary road to serve slow moving
local traffic and non-motorized vehicles, but sharing the bridge over the Yellow River.
IEG notes that these changes were well justified from the engineering point of view and
are also supported by current traffic volumes and the ex-post economic analyses.

5.2       The Hubei project was approved on September 17, 2002, and completed and
closed as scheduled on December 31, 2007. At completion about US$ 28.3 million
remained undisbursed and was cancelled. There were no major changes to the
components.

TRAFFIC SAFETY AND THE INSTITUTIONAL COMPONENTS

5.3       The traffic safety component was problematic in some respects in both projects
even though the outcomes were relatively successful in the end. Both projects had road
traffic safety experts involved in preparation. In the Tri-province project a coordinating
group and a road safety unit were established in each of the project provinces. In Hubei, a
Road Traffic Safety Training Center was established to ensure that the HPCD
implemented procedures for safety audits

                                              10


5.4       However, traffic safety, broadly defined, was not part of the PCD mandate--
except for the elimination of the traffic accident black spots. Responsibility for traffic
safety was transferred to the Public Security Bureau some years ago and the responsible
entity became the police. While the police were involved in road safety matters and now
have an incipient accident recording system, in most provinces no formal institutional
relationship had been established between the police and the PCDs. Such cooperation
would have been desirable for the identification of the black spots, if not for road design
and reconstruction. Another important fact was that the provinces had very few
kilometers of expressways prior to these projects. The traditional roads had design
features not meant for modern vehicular traffic and the roadside development--especially
access management--proved challenging. Vehicle ownership was low, vehicle mix was
diverse and drivers were unaccustomed to driving on expressways.

5.5       A properly designed road safety strategy, in practice, should ideally include
many aspects including educating motorists to drive on expressways, vehicle inspection,
driver licensing, public awareness and establishing an accident recording system for the
wider road network. This wide range of activities, which are national or provincial in
scope, normally takes several years to achieve, and would warrant the development of
state level involvement for regulations and policies. The safety aspects in these projects
had less ambitious intentions intended as the beginning of such a program and covered
the establishment of a high-level traffic coordination group, analysis of traffic accident
data, implementation of a pilot accident black spot elimination program, provision of
traffic law enforcement equipment, and the development of highway safety manuals and
audit procedures. Nevertheless, the lack of a proper framework caused problems even for
these pioneering measures.

5.6       The institutional (capacity building) component included extensive training
programs by national and international experts in road construction management,
construction quality, environmental management, maintenance management, and the
operation of toll roads. There was also training in road works supervision, traffic
engineering, road and accident data acquisition, and road safety design and audits.
Modern maintenance equipment was acquired for recycling asphalt pavements, which has
made road maintenance more appreciated and more effective. The need for further
technical cooperation in maintenance contracting, and maintenance management and
technologies and the role the Bank could play in this was recognized in all the provinces.

THE RURAL ROADS

5.7       The rural roads component faced similar difficulties in all the provinces,
especially in Hubei where US$10 million loan funds were used for their rehabilitation.
The Hubei State Audit Office raised questions concerning the possible "misuse" of loan
funds because the loan needed to be paid back from the tolls levied on the main highway.
The Audit Office eventually accepted the explanation--it was part of the legally binding
Loan Agreement--but HPCD, because of the doubts that had been expressed, would
prefer not repeat such cross-subsidization in another project. In addition, in all
participating provinces, the PCD provides only technical assistance for local roads in
terms of planning, programming and design--not funding. Local roads are the
responsibility of the counties, townships and villages which also carry out the

                                                     11



implementation. In practice, the provinces do provide limited support for rural road
maintenance through PCD; in Ningxia this support matches the local government support
of RMB800/km, but this amount is insufficient and will not keep the rural roads from
deteriorating. Even so, the PCDs have no jurisdiction to implement the rural roads
component and experienced difficulty in supervising it. Increased awareness of these
issues likely contributed to a new state rural roads policy last year (2008), by which the
state contributes RMB 500,000/km for the renovation or (re)construction of township
roads and RMB100,000/km for village roads. Adequate funding for the maintenance of
rural roads remains, however, an unresolved problem.

SAFEGUARDS

5.8        Background. During preparation of the Tri-provincial Highway Project in the
late 1990s, the local Environment Assessment (EA) regulations were at an early stage of
evolution. The substantial difference from the Bank environmental safeguards was the
absence of mandatory disclosure of the EA documents. In spite of the general consistency
with Bank policy4 requirements, the actual implementation of the Chinese environmental
policies fell short in the 1990s; only a simple EA document was required, and there was
no follow-up supervision on actual progress. This changed during the implementation of
the projects and the Bank's safeguards policies and their supervision ensured improved
implementation of environmental and social protection compared to earlier Bank funded
projects.

5.9         The Bank's safeguards policies thus helped promote the awareness of
environmental and social protection among project staff. The preparation of the
safeguards documents and their implementation was completed satisfactorily. This also
had positive impacts on non-Bank projects. Although there were occasional lapses that
had to be rectified these projects served as models for other projects in these provinces.

5.10       This said, the enhanced implementation capacity meant, in both projects that the
safeguard requirements were more rigorously implemented than in domestically-funded
projects. All project offices assigned dedicated staff for coordinating environmental and
social safeguards implementation. Supervision of Environment Action Plan (EAP)
implementation was assigned to the Project Supervision Engineer, while contractors were
responsible for implementation. The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was satisfactorily
implemented by the local governments following approval and was adequately
monitored.

5.11       The EMP implementation was monitored by local environmental agencies in
accordance with the EAPs. While both the Environment Management Plan (EMP) and
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) were concluded appropriately in both projects
there were some difficulties along the way. In Hubei, in the early stages of construction,
the implementation of the EMP, both in XXE and rural road improvement program




4. During the project preparation, safeguards requirements of the World Bank were in form of Operation
Directives. The Safeguards Operational Policy was officially established in 1999, after the Tri-provincial
Highway Project was approved.

                                                      12


(RRIP), fell short of the requirements.5 Bank supervision required and HPCD diligently
addressed the issues and they did not recur. At completion HPCD satisfactorily reclaimed
construction and waste disposal areas. EMP compliance was more problematic with the
RRIP roads, for which the construction management was done by local authorities not the
HPCD. Corrective measures were taken to minimize the negative environmental impact,
but only after the Bank had identified them.

5.12        Land acquisition and resettlement were important and significant elements in
both projects. In the Tri-provincial Highway Project, the RAP was developed in
accordance with Bank requirements and found to be satisfactory. In Hubei, the HPCD
had prior experience and was well prepared and resettlement proceeded smoothly. The
work was audited by both the government and an independent monitoring consultant.

5.13        In the Tri-provincial project, in Ningxia, because of design changes from the
planned 2-lane to a 4-lane road during preliminary engineering, the RAP estimate for the
land acquisition and the floor area of demolished homes needed to be substantially
revised upward. The total cost of resettlement more than doubled6. Design and other
changes also resulted in an upward revision in the estimate of impacted land area in Inner
Mongolia.

5.14       Moving from "Doing no harm" to "Doing Good". An example of good practice
resulting from the heightened environmental awareness is the desert hazard control
program in Ningxia. Due to the potential risk of sand dunes and a fragile local
environment, the NPCD expanded the roadside re-vegetation program to about 600 m
into the desert area with special planting techniques using indigenous species. The
successful re-vegetation program was also replicated in other (domestic) projects, and
awarded a prize by the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), which presented
it as a best practice model.

5.15        In Inner Mongolia irrigation was provided to some dry land and the cultivable
land in the affected area increased by over 70 percent; low-yielding cultivated grassland
was returned to forest. Extra safeguard efforts were also made in the Tri-provincial
Highway project. The ancient remains of the Wall of China in Ningxia were restored
using project funds although not directly affected by the project. A Minority
Development Plan was also developed with the assistance of a social scientist to address
the potential impact and plans for ethnic minority people, although the relevant
Operational Directive had not been triggered.

5.16        In Hubei, the RAP was developed by Wuhan University under guidance of the
Bank task team, and was found to be of good quality and in compliance with Bank
requirements. The RAP adequately addressed the community impact through an



5. Bank team identified inadequacies in EMP implementation: poor living conditions in labor camps,
inadequacy of sanitary facilities, construction dust, and uncovered material transport and storage. In the
rural road projects there was improper disposal of waste and insufficient slope protection. All defects were
corrected during implementation.

6. A total of 9,226 mu of land was acquired, 13 households, 63 people and 6 enterprises were affected.
Total compensation paid amounted to 28 million RMB, an increase of 69 percent over the RAP estimate.

                                                    13



inventory of affected assets, a census of the project affected persons, a social assessment
and consultation with local governments. Only a handful of complaints were received,
mainly concerning damages to village facilities such as roads and irrigation ditches. All
complaints were addressed by the HPCD and satisfactorily resolved.

5.17       HPCD also went an extra mile to protect a cultural heritage site. The project
passed by the Baizhaoshan Forest Park, at a distance of 1.2 km. Although it was
concluded that there would be no direct project impact, the project provided assistance to
the park by relocating a parking lot and building sanitary facilities to help handle the
anticipated increase of tourists upon completion of the XXE project.

5.18       Application of the environmental and involuntary settlement safeguard policies
is of great interest to the road sector officials. All the provinces shared the view that the
Bank's safeguard policies and their application and enforcement had a significant
positive effect on China's own safeguard policies7. Today there is little material
difference between the safeguard policies of the Bank and those in China. They are
applied uniformly in projects regardless of funding source. There also now exists local
competence in most aspects of the safeguard policies and a certification procedure has
been developed and adopted by SEPA, which also approves the EAs. There are two
issues, nevertheless, that may require reconsideration. The first concerns the timing of the
preparation of the RAP (also see Annex A). Currently the Bank requires the full RAP at
project appraisal, at the feasibility study phase. However, for many reasons the road
alignment, both vertical and horizontal, can change in the preliminary engineering phase
(as happened in both of these projects). Consequently, the RAP must be redone. This is
time-consuming and expensive, and also can affect the credibility and impartiality of the
PCD.

5.19        The second issue concerns the (independent) safeguard supervisor who
normally visits the construction site at three month intervals to supervise the
implementation of the EMP and the RAP. According to some provincial road
professionals this may be unnecessary for two reasons: the site supervisors now ­ it is
claimed - have sufficient competence to ensure the implementation of the EMP; and, the
independent supervisor must rely to a large extent on information supplied by the
international supervising engineer or the PMO.8 This warrants further analysis by the
Bank staff responsible for supervision to assess the validity of such assertions.

Financial management and procurement

5.20       Procurement. In Ningxia, early in the project, there was a misunderstanding of
the Bank's approval requirement for design changes. Work on the higher construction



7. National procedures are informed in part by the Circular on Strengthening Environmental Impact
Assessment Management for Construction Projects Financed by International Organizations.
8. The YBE Project (Hubei-Yichang-Badong Expressway) has further increased environmental supervision
by establishing a Client's Environmental Supervisor Consultancy which is resident on site and supervises
the implementation of the EMP independently of the (Supervision) Engineer. This Bank approach to the
implementation of the EMP adds a new layer of supervision. It merits a careful assessment during and after
the project.

                                                   14


standard of the GWH expressway had commenced before prior approval of the Bank was
obtained, and one contract was withdrawn from Bank financing, because the work had
advanced too far to justify Bank (retroactive) financing. Part of the increased cost of
upgrading GWH was financed by the funds released from this withdrawn contract. After
clarification, contract management proceeded from then on satisfactorily.

5.21      Financial management compliance in respect of independent annual auditing
was good; the project accounts were found to be satisfactory in both projects. The loan
disbursements were consistent with the construction progress, but appeared slow and
cumbersome from the Borrower's perspective.


5.22      Financing of the NHTS and the provincial roads. In all provinces the same
pattern of road financing is followed: roads are financed from the provincial budget, with
the PCDs proposing the road budget from the bottom up to the provincial government.
The toll income is, thus, part of the general income of the province through the Provincial
Finance Bureau. The toll rates are uniform and set by the provincial government; the
same applies to vehicle overweight charges. The PCD budgets also include funding
proposals from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and, later, for maintenance of
IFI funded roads. The project roads, excluding the rural roads, are usually tolled. In
Gansu the parallel road Class 2 road was also tolled at the entrances, primarily to prevent
diversion from the expressway. In Inner Mongolia, expressways built with local funds are
not tolled. In all the project provinces the road budget was sufficient for servicing both
the loan and road maintenance and operation.

5.23      The PCD has a corporate office with several subordinate entities for tolled
highways each managing 3-4 tolled (and in Inner Mongolia also untolled) road segments.
These entities keep accounts (income statements, balance sheet and application of funds)
by road segment and aggregate them for budget proposal purposes. They are also
required to have a positive cash balance after loan servicing and other expenses. Because
of accumulated depreciation, all road corporations have enough cash flow to service the
loans even if traffic, and the toll income, does not reach the projected level in the early
years of operation. This financing system has worked well in China for the rapid
expansion of the NTHS. Tolling of the expressways, and occasionally of provincial roads
to prevent diversion, has generated funds and facilitated the leveraging of loans from the
IFIs. There may be equity issues, however, because not all expressways are tolled and
other issues of conflict may arise if decision-making is not transparent.9 The expressway
companies, although state-owned, keep auditable accounts, remit the toll revenue to the
Provincial Finance Bureaus, and the provincial budget process is used to allocate funds.
A newly instituted fuel tax may at some point provide a new, expanded source for
financing road programs, including maintenance. This is particularly relevant in view of
the increased funding needed for the construction and rehabilitation of the rural roads.

5.24      Rural roads financing have gained the attention of the government, which in
2008 introduced a new grant policy. Some states have been more able than others to use



9. These and other issues are discussed in World Bank, op.cit p.41, and Li Ping et al pp 83-85 op.cit.

.

                                                   15



such grants. IEG's discussions with selected county and village officials and observations
on site visits showed evidence of socioeconomic development associated with better road
access to these villages. Whether such development is a result of improved roads or vice
versa cannot however be fully ascertained without detailed studies. An issue that still
needs more attention is how to organize and integrate road (re)construction, maintenance,
planning, and funding of the rural roads. Currently, the PCD gives technical assistance to
plan, design and maintain the roads, and the county road bureaus carry out the works.

MAINTENANCE AND SUPERVISION PRACTICES

5.25       Maintenance and road data and management systems are still evolving
practices in the concerned provinces. In Hubei, where the practices are more advanced,
the competitively awarded routine maintenance contracts for roads and bridges are for
three year periods, in others the contracts are for one year. The practice is likely to cover
all the Class I and Class II roads soon.10 In Inner Mongolia maintenance contracting is
beginning on a pilot basis with project-financed recycling equipment on a negotiated
"plant pool" basis. Also Ningxia acquired a "recycling train" using project funds. The
provinces share the view that more technical assistance and cooperation on new
maintenance practices, methods, and technologies is needed. Road data systems are
central to road maintenance. All the provinces have such systems but of varying
complexity. Hubei is the most advanced where the road data acquisition was outsourced
to consultants; in the other provinces road data acquisition was performed by the project
company, often without up-to-date equipment.

5.26       Supervision elicited much discussion. Bank supervision was seen to be useful--
as long as all project components were supervised during the same visit rather than
separately (requiring much client time and input). The international supervision
consultant (the FIDIC Engineer or the Project Manager) was considered unnecessary (and
the Bank has now largely discontinued this practice in China). The supervision engineer
is chosen using the same process as for contractors. The new method of selecting the
project supervision consultant is welcome. To complement it, for effective supervision,
the Bank and China could also adopt the international practice on large projects of having
unspecified technical assistance funding in the loan to call on recognized experts to solve,
supervise or provide knowhow on demanding or unusual construction (or maintenance)
issues on a time-limited basis. Design reviews by recognized experts are also a useful
practice.

5.27       Procurement by the lowest evaluated bid is problematic in China. State-Owned
Enterprise (SOE) construction firms account for the largest portion of construction by
volume in China and follow the practice of maintaining that volume without necessarily
making a profit (as the state will cover the losses). At the same time private firms are
more numerous, but they must make a profit in order to survive. It is claimed that the
SOEs sometimes make low bids to win the contract and then try to minimize the loss by
doing less (in quality or quantity). Scrupulous supervision and rigorous selection of
supervisors has been the response to avoid quality problems, but problems with SOEs


10. Roll-in of maintenance by contract was an intermediate output indicator in the Hubei project. It was
fully achieved.

                                              16


still occasionally occur. Different provinces have adopted different approaches to address
the issue for non-Bank-financed projects. In Inner Mongolia, the system is similar to the
Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) selection of consultants; in Hubei the winning
proposal is the one which is closest to the average of all the bids from below; and MOT
for its part has issued a request that no bid evaluation panel member shall recommend bid
selection, which is less than the engineering estimate. For the evaluation panel MOT has
evolved a certification system of bid evaluators (and project supervisors). The panel, two-
thirds inter-provincial, is selected by the MOT from a pool of certified evaluators one day
prior to the evaluation. Because the SOE construction companies present a vexing
problem in China, the Bank should reconsider, together with the client, the selection
process of the winning bidder, which does not necessarily always work in the way that
was anticipated.




6. Ratings

6.1       The ratings are presented separately for the Tri-provincial Highway project and
the Hubei-Xiogan-Xiangfan Highway project. Because of the similarity of the PDOs
some repetition is unavoidable.

The Tri-provincial Highway Project

RELEVANCE

6.2       The project objectives were consistent with China's transport development plans
and are part of the Government's development of the National Expressway Network. The
components were consistent with the then prevailing Bank lending priorities, the CAS,
and the later CPS: construction or rehabilitation of the expressways and highways;
improving traffic safety; institutional development; and improving access to targeted poor
rural counties. Relevance of the project and its objectives is high. Relevance of design,
however, is modest since there were shortcomings in the institutional design
arrangements in respect of rural roads and road safety improvements, because the
mandate had not been clarified and the legislation enacted to support the project
intentions. For the rural roads there was also a lack of clarity regarding the financing
mechanism (cross subsidization with revenue from the main highways). The overall
relevance is substantial.

EFFICACY

6.3        The PDO indicators at completion, the original target values, baseline values
and actual values at the time of the PPAR mission are shown in full in Table 2.
Achievements of each objective follow:

(a) To increase the efficiency and safety of traffic in highway priority corridors in order
to facilitate faster socioeconomic development. The values of the PDO indicators (1, 2, 3,
and 8) for this objective need no explanation: the target values were exceeded both in
terms of traffic volume, economic rate of return (ERR), travel times, and traffic safety.

                                                      17



Although there was no indicator for the black spots, there was a successful black spot
elimination program of 100 spots. Accident rates were reduced by more than 50 percent
in these locations. The achievement of this objective is high.

(b) To provide improved access to targeted poor counties. The achievement of this
objective is shown by indicators 4, 5, 6, and 7 in Table 2. The rural roads were
rehabilitated as planned and provide year round access. The traffic volumes have grown
steadily, also after completion, and exceed the target values. However, the traffic counts
are not yet systematic and the reliability of this information may be low. The income
indicator, now measured by GRP, is the most reliable of the indicators for measuring the
effects of better rural access. It has increased over 50 percent since project completion
over the target value, but attribution to the project is unclear. The achievement of this
objective is substantial.

(c) To improve highway sector institutional capacity. Staff training and a studies program
were completed in all the provinces (indicator 10). Domestic training was over twice as
extensive as planned, but overseas training was less than planned. In the Tri-provincial
project, the training covered highway design and maintenance, highway materials,
construction management and supervision, and operation of and maintenance of
expressways. Studies were undertaken and manuals written for traffic accident audits and
traffic safety, and for organizing and managing toll roads and determination of toll rates.
However, the extent of the skills transfer, the outcome, was not measured. The
achievement of this objective is substantial.

(d) To improve the safety of road transport. Traffic safety has improved and there was a
significant reduction in collision rates from the range of 7-11 accidents per 10 million
vehicle km. to 0.4-5.0. The black spot program was implemented with good results. A
`Traffic safety coordination group' with the police was established to help identify black
spots and analyze accident causes. The achievement of this objective is high.

EFFICIENCY

6.4        The benefit-cost analyses were not recalculated for the PPAR.11 The ERR in
the ICR, was between 10 and 44 percent, with an average of slightly over 20 percent, and
in line with the PAD estimates. Table 2 shows that the traffic volumes on the
expressways in the Tri-province area have grown substantially since completion in 2005,
due to completion of missing road links in Shanxi and strong economic growth. The
robust traffic growth and improved traffic safety translates directly to user benefits. This
means that the ERR (five years after completion) is likely much higher. The financial rate
of return in the ICR is also an under-estimate for the same reason. The Borrowers




11. The person who calculated the ICR ERR values has retired and the files describing the network and the
traffic flows have been lost. Even in the absence of the recalculated ERR, a reliable "guestimate" can be
extrapolated on the basis of the current traffic and using the same growth rate as in the ICR.

                                                      18


indicated that the current cash flow covers the maintenance and debt service costs, and
the road segments will turn profitable in 2011.12

6.5        The calculation of the ERR for the local road projects is problematic because of
the variety of the difficulty of obtaining reliable traffic counts, and an absence of user
willingness to pay information. Traffic volumes have also grown in the rural roads,
whether they were part of the project or not. The efficiency of the project investments is
high.

OUTCOME

6.6        Two project objectives were highly achieved and substantial achievement was
attained in the other two, despite some uncertainties in measurement and some
institutional shortcomings. Relevance was substantial and efficiency high. The overall
outcome is thus rated as satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

6.7        The traffic volumes on the main roads have increased. The toll income in all the
provinces is sufficient to cover the loan servicing costs as well as road operation and
maintenance. The overweight charges and overweight enforcement have also helped
control the overloading problem while providing substantial revenue (for example, in
Ningxia, after the overweight charges were instituted in 2007, the toll road income
increased nearly 80 percent and a further 80 percent in 2008; although a proportion of
this increase in toll revenue also has to do with the completion of the missing links
connected to the Guwang Expressway). There is sustained improvement in road traffic
safety in spite of the strong growth in traffic. The institutional development and training
has increased institutional capacity and the new equipment is in good use. The new state-
wide rural road financing initiatives are expected to lead to substantial improvements in
the vast rural network over the next decade.

6.8        In sum, the benefits to the users from the highways and the rural roads will
likely remain and increase with traffic. The institutions are soundly managed and the
benefits from safety improvements should also be sustained provided that a
comprehensive strategy for road safety is developed. Further training and other capacity
building will likely continue to support the sector. Risk to development outcome is
negligible to low.

BANK PERFORMANCE

6.9        Bank performance during identification, preparation, and appraisal of the
project was satisfactory with some caveats. Risks were adequately considered and
counteracted. Staff was prepared for the safeguard management with suitable training
abroad. The socioeconomic justification for the projects was sound, but conservative. The



12. The income statement shows negative profit until 2011 or so in most provinces. (There are differences:
Inner Mongolia expects to pay back its loan by 2011). When depreciation is added back in the income
statement it provides, even now, a buffer for the cash flow being able to cover the debt service from the toll
revenue. It is debatable if depreciation should be a cost element at all because current maintenance, fully
funded, should counteract depreciation.

                                             19



large contingencies in the loan, however, are questionable despite the argument
concerning the lack of cost information from previously competitively tendered projects.
The jurisdictional and coordination difficulties between the lead-agencies for safety and
rural roads components were also not considered sufficiently. The environmental and
social assessments, the RAP and consultations of the affected population on the other
hand were satisfactory. Rating of Bank performance in project preparation is satisfactory.

6.10      Supervision of all components was superior. Once the revisions to the designs
(4-lane expressway instead of expandable 2-lane design in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia)
had been satisfactorily resolved, the highway components were implemented almost
flawlessly and ahead of schedule. The task team was receptive and flexible to proposals
to improve road designs, and responded to client needs as circumstances changed. The
project's first highway contract in Ningxia was not awarded on procedural grounds and
this allowed a greater funding for the redesigned sections of highway. Training on
environmental management was organized during project implementation both in China
and abroad. Compliance with environmental safeguards was especially noteworthy in that
there was a movement from "doing no harm" to "doing good". An assessment of the RAP
indicated general appreciation of the process and compensation. The Borrower was given
assistance to work comprehensively in traffic safety and in completing the RIPA
component in spite of lacking the lead-agency mandate. Bank performance in supervision
is rated highly satisfactory. The overall evaluation of Bank performance is rated
satisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

6.11      There was effective cooperation between the Borrower and the Bank throughout
preparation and implementation. The central and provincial governments were fully
committed. The MOT and MOF, at the central level, assisted as needed in the preparation
of the projects. During the implementation stage, they followed the projects closely and
helped to resolve issues promptly. With the local governments' support in land
acquisition and resettlement, all the safeguard issues raised at this level were
appropriately addressed. Government performance was satisfactory.

6.12      The performance of the implementing agencies was highly satisfactory. All the
PCDs demonstrated strong commitment towards achieving the project objectives, from
the road works to carrying out the EMP and the safeguard policies were implemented
beyond mere compliance. In general the project was executed as agreed and outputs
achieved as planned. The project motivated the PCD staffs involved in the project, and
improved their professional skills and awareness of good road management practices.
The observed professional thinking and behavior during the PPAR mission was
exemplary. The overall Borrower performance rating is satisfactory.

Hubei-Xiogan-Xiangfan Highway Project

RELEVANCE

6.13      The project objective was consistent with China's transport development plan
and part of the Government's National Expressway Network. The project components
were consistent with the then prevailing Bank lending priorities, the CAS, and the later

                                              20


CPS: construction or rehabilitation of the expressways and highways; improving traffic
safety; institutional development; and improving access to targeted poor rural counties.
Relevance of the project and its objectives is high. The design suffered from the same
shortcomings as observed in the Tri-provincial project with regard to rural roads
jurisdiction, cross subsidization and road safety. However, in this case the cost estimates
were 30 percent too low. Relevance of the design is therefore modest and overall
relevance substantial.

EFFICACY

6.14      The PDO of the project was: to improve the efficiency, safety, and cost-
effectiveness of the transport infrastructure in support of the social and economic
development of Hubei province. The indicators for the achievement of the PDO at
completion ("ICR target values") and at the time of the PPAR mission are in Table 2.
Note that in this case the project closed just one year before the PPAR mission and so the
traffic growth could only be measured for this period. The project objective is
multidimensional and its achievement needs to be judged using the project's outcome
indictors and the PPAR mission observations.

        The increased traffic volumes in the XXE corridor and in the rural roads and the
        increased incomes in the targeted poor counties are evidence of the project's
        support to economic development and poverty reduction in the province. Other
        indicators such as school enrollment have an attribution problem since the
        counterfactual is unclear.

        The black spot program was completed (165 improvements) and that activity has
        continued since project completion (to 210 improvements). A Traffic Safety
        Training Center was as established as part of the project, as was the pilot road
        traffic accident information system to help analyze and identify black spots. The
        target accident rates were met at project completion, but have worsened slightly
        since due to numerous accidents that occurred in a heavy snow storm.

        The project included an extensive training and studies program, which covered
        construction management, engineering supervision, expressway operation and
        safeguards management (resettlement), road safety, and quality control. Training
        and manuals were developed for road safety audits, maintenance standards and
        maintenance management, and expressway management. Maintenance by
        contract documents were prepared and also employed in practice for maintenance
        contracts. Modern maintenance equipment (recycling) was acquired.

        Part of the overall cost-effectiveness of the transport infrastructure is the well-
        managed safeguard management and the now standard use of Bank-harmonized
        safeguard policies in all the projects regardless of the funding source.

                                                    21



On the basis of the values of the project's outcome indicators and the mission
observations the achievement of the project's PDO is substantial. This is a conservative
valuation.13

EFFICIENCY

6.15       The benefit-cost analyses were not recalculated for the PPAR for the same
reason as in the Tri-provincial Highway project. Also, in the Hubei case, traffic is
expected to grow substantially when the expressway link to Shanxi is finished. The
robust traffic growth and improved traffic safety translates directly to user benefits. The
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) in the ICRs, slightly over 23 percent and in line with the
PAD estimates, is probably underestimated. The financial rate of return in the ICR is also
an under-estimate. As in the Tri-provincial Highway project, the Borrower indicated that
the current cash flow covers the maintenance and debt service costs, and the XXE road
segment will turn profitable in 2011.

6.16       Traffic volumes have also grown on the rural roads and the new State policy for
funding rural roads will likely stimulate further growth in the future. The efficiency of the
project investments is high.

OUTCOME

6.17       The project objective was substantially achieved with a few shortcomings and
efficacy is substantial. Relevance and efficiency are substantial and high respectively.
Therefore the overall outcome rating is satisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome

6.18       The traffic volumes on the project corridor have increased; the toll income is
sufficient to cover the loan servicing costs and road operation and maintenance; there is
sustained improvement in road traffic safety management; and the extensive institutional
development through training and studies was successful.

6.19       In sum, the benefits to the users from the highways and the rural roads will
likely remain and increase with traffic. The benefits from road safety and black spot
improvements are also probably sustainable. Finally, the institutional capacity building is
the strongest of the four provinces assessed in this PPAR. Risk to development outcome is
thus negligible to low.

Bank Performance

6.20       The Hubei Xiogan-Xiangfan project. The Bank team had the benefit of prior
experience with projects in Hubei. The risks were defined carefully and counteracted
including the risks with regard to safeguard policy implementation, especially possible
delays in land acquisition and resettlement. Environmental and social assessments were


13. After only one year the socioeconomic environment around the project has not had time to fully adjust
and take advantage of the new road. Based on PPAR mission observations the Hubei PCD, on its third
Bank supported project, is a more sophisticated road organization than those in the other provinces.

                                                22


made available to the affected parties. The assessments and consultations with the public
altered the road alignment in several places to reduce adverse impacts. A financial
management review was undertaken to ensure compliance with the Bank's procedures.
Socioeconomic justification for the project was sound. The engineering designs and other
documents, cost estimates, electrical and mechanical facilities, were reviewed by
international engineering consultants. There were concerns regarding the implementation
of traffic safety and rural roads components--both important matters to the Borrower and
to the Bank. It is likely that the institutional responsibilities and the functioning of the
road sector institutions with regard to these components were not fully understood, and
taken into account in project. It is noted that the Bank no longer includes rural road
components in highway project lending in China. The cost estimates for the project were
too low, but the team was unable to convince the Hubei authorities to adjust them. Rating
of Bank performance in project preparation is satisfactory, but with caveats.

6.21      Supervision of the project's components was of a high standard. In the early
stages of construction the EMP implementation did not meet the requirements, but after
the Bank's intervention HPCD took sustained corrective actions. On another occasion the
Bank team temporarily downgraded the project's implementation progress to
`unsatisfactory', on account of unsafe design of the connecting roads and continued to
follow up on this matter until the designs were rectified. Rural roads were supervised
comprehensively and built well. All the safeguard policies and environmental mitigation
measures for noise and dust were carried out appropriately. Bank performance in
supervision is rated satisfactory.

6.22      Overall evaluation of Bank performance is rated satisfactory

Borrower Performance

6.23      There was effective cooperation between the Borrower and the Bank throughout
preparation and implementation of both projects. The central and provincial governments
were fully committed, and assisted in the preparation of the project. During the
implementation, they helped to resolve issues promptly. With the local governments'
support in land acquisition and resettlement, all the safeguard issues were addressed and
carried out satisfactorily and without delay. Government performance was satisfactory.

6.24      The performance of the implementing agencies was also satisfactory. The
HPCDs built the XXE project to a high standard and on time. It was committed to
achieving the project objectives, to carrying out the EMP and the safeguard policies
beyond the letter--occasionally at the Bank's prodding and firmness of supervision--and
to the many institutional strengthening activities, as evidenced by the extensive training
courses. The Hubei Chutian Expressway Company was listed on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange, while good and cooperative relationships were maintained with the township
and city transport entities. Overall Borrower performance was satisfactory.

7. Conclusion and Lessons

7.1       The Bank's lending to China's highway sector continues to deliver some
important benefits. The value of the Bank support lies less, however, in the actual loans
(which are a tiny percentage of the country's total transport investments), but more in the
form of less quantifiable benefits such as the best practice application of safeguard
policies and the development of road management methodology through studies, advice
and training. In the projects reviewed in this PPAR the inclusion of the rural road
components also over time may help to unlock the potentially substantial benefits that
can come from improving rural access by contributing to the debate about how
jurisdictional and funding issues can be overcome. According to several officials
interviewed by the IEG mission, the Bank has had a very useful and even
transformational effect on motivating local transport sector professionals to think "out of
the box". From this overview come four lessons:

       It is important to ensure during project preparation that the mandate of the
       implementing entity is consistent with the scope of the project. The
       implementation of the two highway projects in China proved unexpectedly
       challenging because the implementing entity had no jurisdiction over the rural
       roads and the traffic safety components.

       A middle income country can still benefit substantially from the Bank's technical
       assistance and expertise. The provincial officials involved in these major highway
       projects learnt quickly from the experiences from the training programs, study
       tours and advice from Bank staff. In respect of safeguards policies there was
       ample evidence of a movement from a compliant paradigm to one in which
       society was better off because of the intervention. Technical expertise was also
       passed on in respect of inter alia road maintenance by contract, expressway
       management, and good practice in road safety.

       Some adjustments in the scheduling of safeguards procedures could be
       considered. The completion of the full Resettlement Action Plan before the
       preliminary engineering highway design was completed wasted scarce resources
       as it had to be re-done because the road alignments changed significantly.

       Since the gap between safeguard policies in the Bank and China on highway
       projects is now quite small, good supervision is the key to ensuring that the
       policies are followed. In China, at least in the provinces where the projects were
       assessed, performance-based project lending has sufficed in respect of safeguards,
       but the application of the country systems with periodic supervision by the Bank
       could be contemplated.

Annex A: A framework for project identification and
preparation, and its coordination with the public
participation processes.

1.      It was noted in the main text that the broad scope of the projects required the
involvement of many road sector entities (some of which had relatively narrow
perspectives) that were not directly under the jurisdiction of the implementing entity.
The Bank in the projects covered by this PPAR may also not have fully appreciated the
complexity of the mandate, functioning and jurisdiction of the provincial road sector
administrative entities during preparation. The resulting implementation arrangements
meant that the PDOs could not be properly addressed in a project context, because some
needed rather to be addressed at higher administrative and management levels.

2.      This is why project preparation did not flow seamlessly through implementation
and supervision. Nevertheless, through joint efforts by the Bank and Borrower teams the
difficulties in supervision were overcome. To remove the above difficulty, not
uncommon in Bank supported transport projects, this annex proposes a general
framework for how the transport sector (in any country) might organize its planning-
implementation-maintenance-monitoring functions in a coherent way. Through this
framework the several continuous and incremental steps that managers in any reasonably
mature road administration need to address are shown together with the sequence in
which they may be best accomplished.

3.      Figure 1 shows a transport administration framework that is flexible enough to
encompass the practices in most countries. The box with light background covers
planning work that is embedded in a societal context. The public participation process
that is associated with this framework follows.

4.      The process starts with general planning and analyses of transport network, modal
and approximate road alignment alternatives embedded in a broad societal context and
discourse. Concurrently, general information of this dialogue and planning activities,
their most important impacts and consequences, and explanation of the process to be
followed are publicized through several media. This process results in the selection of the
preferred alternative. At some point in time a decision is made to carry out a feasibility
study14 and an environmental assessment.

5.      The feasibility study, normally carried out at a scale of 1:5000 (1 cm on the map
is 50 meters; in rural areas 1:10,000 maybe sufficient), to determine the preferred
alignment location (within 50-100 meters), and vertical alignment within 2-3 meters, at
critical places a smaller scale may be necessary. There is general public participation with
feedback as will be explained. It is important that at this stage the legal framework and
the appeals process is in place--Policy Framework in the Bank's parlance. The scale
employed in this stage is small enough to allow good judgments to be made between
alternative alignments and their relation to land uses. However, this scale is too coarse to
identify the exact land parcels or buildings that need to be relocated. Such details will be
determined in preliminary engineering. In the feasibility study and in public participation
associated in it the preferred alignment is chosen.

6.      Preliminary engineering, normally at scale 1:2000, with smaller scale at critical
places, establishes the location of the road horizontally (~4m) and vertically (+/-0.5m).
That document normally has legal effects enabling the road administration to acquire land



14. The feasibility study is carried out if substantial time has elapsed since the Alternative Analysis (AA)
was conducted to ensure that there are no new issues, and that the assumptions and general forecasts that
applied during the AA are still valid.

                                                      27



by purchase or eminent domain. In that phase the road geometry, right-of-way,
resettlement, environmental mitigation, traffic safety, and other issues are considered in
detail. The directly affected people are personally informed and involved in the
negotiations process. Using Bank terminology, the EMP and RAP should be prepared
during preliminary engineering; this is also important from the point of view of costs: 40
percent of the road construction costs (at the chosen alignment) are determined by
material movements to build the road. Most important are, however, the legal obligations
of the chosen alignment.

7.       This is followed by detailed engineering, construction, maintenance, and
monitoring. Note that public participation, legal and policy frameworks, appeals,
evaluation of impacts and monitoring occur not only within the road administration, but
involve the society at large; therefore, the "box" describing them is set outside the
planning process.

8.       It also is important to note that the schematic planning process framework divides
itself between policy development and project development (boxes from preliminary
engineering forward). Note also that this scheme relates naturally to both Development
Policy Lending (DPL) and project lending. In China, the DPL type issues could consist of
the following activities: road classification (administrative and functional); planning of
provincial lower class network15 and associated methods; supervision of engineering and
environmental issues; procurement practice; financing of rural roads; road traffic safety
regulations (state wide uniformity is required); road user charges and their collection;
area-wide maintenance contracting, and many others. Loans, perhaps with the Ministry of
Transport as the lead agency, could be structured around these issues, perhaps with the
rural road rehabilitation as the anchor.

9.       The project loans would focus on implementing and maintaining important road
segments efficiently. These projects could involve innovative features in terms of
financing, procurement (e.g. Public Private Partnerships in which the entire sequence
after preliminary engineering is contracted out--with due process provisions for design
changes to encourage innovations). Several technical issues are best addressed in project
context. In China they could include: maintenance by contract, maintenance technology,
toll collection technology, approaches to dealing with overweight trucks, toll road
management, approaches to dealing with thorny, project specific engineering or
environmental issues, and so on.

The public participation processes.

10.      Figure 2 shows the recommended public participation process; again local
variations are possible. In principle, however, there are two public participation
processes: the alignment location inquiry and the design inquiry. In the context of the




15. This kind of activity is already taking place. The Mission visited a Tuyou county in Inner Mongolia
where county road professionals had already developed a comprehensive plan for the county and township
networks, and several rural roads were being improved, presumably as part of the plan.

EA, there is also normally a scoping exercise that identifies what issues are important in
the environmental assessment.

11.     The general scheme of the public participation is the same in the alternative
analysis/feasibility study stage. Plans are disclosed publicly and all affected interests can
participate and may make submissions. Specific submissions and comments are solicited
from government entities. The PCD would respond to these comments, and possibly
revise plans or the evaluation of alternatives (value engineering). There would be public
disclosure of the preferred alignment, which may be appealed.

12.     The same basic flow chart is followed in preliminary engineering phase. The only
difference is that public participation now involves only directly affected interests--
whose land or buildings may be condemned, or access to land, even if not taken, is
severely changed. After adjustments to the preliminary engineering design in response to
submissions, the PCD will decide (or in some cases refer to the MOT for a decision),
which may again be appealed according to the law.

13.     The integrated planning process framework described above will be applicable in
any country, with adjustments to the administrative culture, legal processes, and
competence of the client. It could lead to a speeding up of loan preparations, and make
them less costly and more focused. This would especially be true with regard to the
design and engineering details and possibly the application of the safeguard policies.
