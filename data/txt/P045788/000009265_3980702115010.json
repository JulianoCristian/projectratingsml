increases efficiency and safety of transport in\n            highway priority corridors; b) provides improved access to\n            targeted poor counties; c) promotes of institutional\n            capacities in the areas of highway planning, design,\n            supervision, operation, and maintenance of the highway\n            network; and d) increases road transport safety. There are\n            four components. The first constructs main highways,\n            expressways, and rural roads to serve the poor counties of\n            agricultural areas in three regions. This component\n            constructs civil works, electrical and mechanical works\n            including interchanges, tolling stations, service areas, and\n            management stations as well as tolling, monitoring,\n            telecommunications, and power supply and lighting systems.\n            The second component improves roads, improving all-weather\n            access to villages and towns through all-weather roads and\n            provision of non-motorized transport. The third component\n            strengthens the capacity of communications departments to\n            plan, construct, operate, and maintain the proposed highways\n            through training and the provision of critical and\n            technically appropriate equipment. The fourth component\n            funds a highway safety program, which increases cooperation\n            between the traffic police and the communication\n            departments; analyses traffic accidents; launches a pilot\n            program to treat accident black spots; develops traffic\n            safety manuals and safety audit procedures; and provides\n            equipment, technical assistance, and training."}, "docdt": "1998-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
