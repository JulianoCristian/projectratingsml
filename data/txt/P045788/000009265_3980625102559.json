environmental impact assessment report consists of\n            three parts: a) the section from Baotou to Dongsheng, and\n            the section from Baiyinchagan to Fengzheng of Inner\n            Mongolia; b) Liugouhe-Zhonghe and Xiujiamo-Gulang Section of\n            Gansu; and c) Guyaozi-Wangquanliang Highway of Ningxia.\n            Households to be removed will be compensated in accordance\n            with the resettlement plan.  Noise will be mitigated by\n            equipping high-noise construction machinery with sound-proof\n            features and by monitoring noise of vehicles.  Dust during\n            construction will be reduced by spraying water.  To prevent\n            soil erosion and ensure stable subgrades, retaining walls,\n            stone square network slopes, and reliable drainage work will\n            be installed.  To mitigate the impact on vegetation,\n            planting will be done throughout the project.  Arable land\n            will be restored and reclaimed.  Waste water produced from\n            the service centers will be treated and waste materials will\n            be carried to waste stations for disposal."}, "docdt": "1997-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
