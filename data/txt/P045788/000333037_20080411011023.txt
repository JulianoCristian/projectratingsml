F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower and the Project Provinces: (a) to
increase the efficiency and safety of traffic in highway priority corridors in order to
facilitate faster socio-economic development; (b) to provide improved access to targeted
poor counties; (c) to improve highway sector institutional capacity; and (d) to improve
the safety of road transport.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Project was initiated at a time when China's GDP grew consistently at a rate of 8%-
10% a year, placing a burden on the country's historically underinvested transport
infrastructures, especially roads. Few expressways existed at the time and about 22% of
rural communities had no all-weather vehicular access. Studies undertaken by the Bank
concluded that the country's road network capacity was insufficient to meet demand;
deficiency in capacity had led to transportation bottlenecks that restricted the
development of the economy; and that the problem was due mainly to inadequate
investment, insufficient reforms and management and operational weaknesses. These
studies included "China Highway Development and Management: Issues, Options and
Strategies" (February 1994) and "China, Forward with One Spirit: A Strategy for the
Transport Sector" (April 1998).

Inadequate capacity and poor accessibility had undermined the development of China's
interior provinces, resulting in an economic disparity between rich coastal areas with
access to deep-water ports and poor landlocked provinces.

To overcome the shortcomings in the country's road network, the Ministry of
Communications (MOC) at the central level prioritized the rapid development of the
National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) consisting of 12 inter-provincial trunk
expressways and totaling some 35,000 km. At the provincial/regional level, the strategy
was to concentrate on network maintenance and the expansion and improvement of
provincial and rural road networks totaling some 1.2 million km to provide greater
mobility and to stimulate socio-economic development particularly in less developed
provinces. On road transport policy, growing attention was being paid to removing
administrative and physical barriers to inter-provincial trade and to a redefinition of the
government's role in transport. Provinces and municipalities were to mobilize more
investment resources, seek greater efficiency through improved highway planning,
maintenance and investment strategies, and to improve cost recovery.

The Project which addressed the key issues of
    · expansion of highway capacity;
    · increase of accessibility to rural population in poor counties;
    · highway safety;
    · highway maintenance; and
    · cost recovery of investments through imposition of tolls on road users
supported objectives of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): (i) alleviating
infrastructure bottlenecks and increasing road network capacity and (ii) helping to
alleviate poverty in China, as expressed in the CAS Document R97-30 (IDA/R97-14) of
March 18, 1997 and in Progress Report R98-107 of May 28, 1998.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators



                                              1

The objective of the Project was to assist the Borrower and the Project Provinces: (a) to
increase the efficiency and safety of traffic in highway priority corridors in order to
facilitate faster socio-economic development; (b) to provide improved access to targeted
poor counties; (c) to improve highway sector institutional capacity; and (d) to improve
the safety of road transport (Schedule 2, Loan Agreement).

Key indicators for monitoring performance (Annex 1, PAD) included:
    a) Average daily traffic (ADT) on proposed and existing highways in selected high
        priority corridors
    b) Average speed on proposed and existing highways
    c) Traffic accident rates on proposed and existing highways
    d) Gross output value of agriculture and industry of main highway corridors
    e) ADT on roads included in the Road Improvement Program for Poverty
        Alleviation (RIPA)
    f) Number of days/year the roads in RIPA were closed to traffic
    g) Bank loan to each province is recovered through tolls on main highways

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority),
and Reasons/Justification

The development objective and key indicators remained unchanged throughout the
implementation of the Project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The measured benefits of the Project were savings in vehicle operating cost and travel
time savings for vehicle occupants. Benefits generated by the RIPA component in the
form of an increase in children's accessibility to schools, the population's access to
medical services and an increase in the average annual income per capita of the local
population were acknowledged but not quantified. However, local governments
impacted by the component furnished data that illustrated the extent of the benefits that
had accrued. (See also section 3.5). Other important benefits in support of the Project
that were not quantified were a reduction in road accidents particularly fatalities, and a
strengthened capability of the agencies responsible for the planning, design, supervision,
construction, operation and maintenance of the highways in each of the Project Provinces.
Benefits that were not quantified were not taken into account in the economic and
financial analysis in justification of the Project.

The primary target group was the population of the Provinces of Inner Mongolia, Gansu
and Ningxia, which were ranked respectively the third, eighth and fifteenth poorest
among the thirty-one provinces and municipalities of China measured by income per
capita (China Statistical Yearbook, 1997). The six main project highways would pass
through towns and counties that comprised about half of the population of the three


                                               2

project provinces, some 6.2 million for Inner Mongolia, 6.1 million for Gansu and 2.1
million for Ningxia. The improvement of rural roads would benefit counties whose
population constituted about 15% of the total poor population of the three provinces (1.3
million).

Institutional capacity building would directly benefit the Communications Departments
of Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Ningxia and their related entities and agencies.

1.5 Original Components

The Project consisted of the following components (See Block 1: Project Description,
PAD):
(a) Construction of Main Highways with a total length of about 687 km comprising
      (i)     Baotou-Dongsheng Highway (103 km) of which 92 km are a 4-lane Class 1
              highway and 11 km are a 2-lane Class 2 highway in Inner Mongolia;
      (ii)    Baiyinchagan-Fengzhen Highway (142 km) a 2-lane Class 2 highway in
              Inner Mongolia;
      (iii)   Liugouhe-Zhonghe Expressway (33.5 km) a 4-lane expressway in Gansu;
      (iv)    Xujiamo-Jiepaicun Highway (64 km) a 2-lane Class 2 highway in Gansu;
      (v)     Guyaozi-Wangquanliang Highway (94 km) of which about 83 km provide 2
              lanes for traffic on a 4-lane Class 1 highway subgrade and about 11 km are a
              2-lane Class 2 highway in Ningxia; and
      (vi)    Yanchi-Xingren Highway (250.5 km), a 2-lane Class 2 highway in Ningxia.
(b) Road Improvement Program for Poverty Alleviation (RIPA) comprising the
construction and improvement of about 1892 km of rural roads in poor counties, of which
803 km are in Gansu, 836 km in Inner Mongolia and 253 km in Ningxia.
(c) A program to strengthen institutional capacity in highway planning, design,
supervision, construction, operation and maintenance in each of the Project Provinces.
(d) A highway safety program to reduce traffic accidents on highways.

The Project was described in Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement as consisting of three
parts, with a part each in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Part A), Gansu Province
(Part B) and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Part C). There was no inconsistency
between the Loan Agreement and the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The difference
was merely in the manner in which the Project was presented in the two documents. The
PAD presented the Project thematically while the Loan Agreement described in detail the
developments that would be undertaken in each of the Project Provinces. The project
components were similar in all three Project Provinces.

1.6 Revised Components

There was no revision of the Project's components. There were, however, changes within
the component for the construction of the main highways.



                                              3

1.7 Other Significant Changes

Significant changes in the design, scope and scale of the component for the construction
of the main highways included the following.

The original design of the Baotou-Dongsheng Highway (BDH) in Inner Mongolia, had a
50 km section in which the two southbound lanes were separated from the two
northbound lanes, the former to be constructed on a new alignment and the latter being
upgraded from the existing Class 2 highway. During implementation a decision was
made to construct new northbound lanes alongside the southbound lanes and integrate all
four lanes into a single roadway, and the old Class 2 Baotou-Dongsheng Road (BDR)
was rehabilitated to function as an auxiliary road to serve slow moving local traffic and
non-motorized vehicles.

The Guyaozi-Wangquanliang Highway (GWH) in Ningxia, originally to be a 4-lane
Class 1 highway sub-grade with 2-lane pavement from Guyaozi to Yanchi and a 2-lane
Class 2 highway from Yanchi to Wangquanliang, was upgraded to a full 4-lane
expressway standard for safety and maintenance reasons. The Bank agreed to the change
in the scope of the development following the review of the supplemental feasibility
study. The Loan Agreement was amended accordingly on February 1, 2001. However,
work on the higher construction standard had commenced before prior approval of the
Bank was obtained, and Ningxia decided to withdraw from Bank financing the contract
(one of four) where work had advanced too far to justify Bank retroactive financing. The
cost of upgrading would increase the original cost of the GWH by about 62% (RMB220
million). Part of the increase in cost was financed by the funds (US$4 million) released
from the contract that was withdrawn from Bank financing. Nevertheless, competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines resulted in Ningxia's loan
savings of some $5 million. This amount was cancelled from the loan on December 7,
2005.

At the request of Gansu, the scope of the development in this province was revised to
include the rehabilitation of an existing 85 km Class 2 road from Hekou to Tungouwan
(the Hekou-Tungouwan Highway (HTH)). The Bank agreed with the proposal in light
that the highway was the only road linking Lanzhou to Gulang, serving 7 townships,
carrying about 3,000 vehicles (MTE) a day and was in a poor state of condition. The
Loan Agreement was amended accordingly on June 8, 2004. The rehabilitation of this
highway was not in the original scope of work of the developments for the province and
was approved for inclusion in the Project only after a justification was made, and an
environmental impact assessment and a social assessment had been done and a
resettlement action plan had been prepared to the satisfaction of the Bank task team. The
Loan Agreement was revised again on November 23, 2005 to increase the disbursement
percentage for Category (2) (a) for Civil Works under Part B.1 from 49% to 65% to
enable the use of loan savings to finance the rehabilitation. This additional scope of work
led to the extension of the loan closing date to June 30, 2007.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Project was predicated on the premise that improving road network capacity would
help to generate economic development, alleviate poverty, and improve the quality of life
in the project areas.

The preparation of the Project took into account lessons learned from 19 highway
projects in China, of which 9 had been completed. Problems encountered in the past
included (i) poor construction quality, (ii) late start of the design of traffic engineering
facilities, (iii) difficulty in implementing highway safety programs due to limited
experience of the implementing entities, and (iv) inadequate advance notification of Bank
requirements relating to land acquisition and resettlement.

To mitigate the risk of an inadequate design, the designs and bid documents for the main
highways in the Project were reviewed by international design engineers. To ensure that
the quality of construction would meet acceptable standard, construction supervision was
enhanced by engaging foreign consultants to jointly supervise construction with local
consultants.

The difficulty in implementing safety programs in past projects was traced to the lack of
coordination between traffic police and highway departments. To overcome the problem,
a coordinating mechanism that included a system for accident data collection and analysis
was developed with the assistance of an international safety expert for all three Project
Provinces.

To make known early the Bank's requirements relating to resettlement and land
acquisition and to assist in meeting them, a resettlement specialist and a social scientist
were involved from the very beginning in the preparation of the Project. As this was the
first Bank-financed project in which social analyses with emphasis on minorities were
carried out, a Minorities Development Plan was developed with the assistance of the
social scientist whose assessment (undertaken in conjunction with local consultants) was
widely reviewed and commented upon. Attention given to the preparation of the plan was
considerable.

The negative impacts of highway construction (erosion particularly the effect on graves,
silting of fields, competition for water between local communities and construction
activities, and crossing of roads by school children) were addressed in the Resettlement
Action Plan (RAP), the Environmental Action Plan (EAP), engineering designs, and
during construction supervision.




                                               5

There was an inherent risk that traffic on toll roads would increase at a lower rate than
estimated because of the imposition of the user charge. This risk was mitigated by
ensuring that tolls that would be imposed for the use of the highways would be
appropriate.

Commitment in the Project was strong from the provincial governments, which actively
participated in all stages of project preparation from the conduct of feasibility studies to
the detailed engineering design. Participatory processes in the preparation and design of
the Project were extensive. Affected communities were involved in the selection of the
alignment of the various roads as well as the number and the location of interchanges,
underpasses and grade separations. During the preparation of the Environmental Impact
Assessment, the local population was intensively consulted through workshops, meetings
with local government representatives, and public polling supplemented by interviews.
Documents relating to these consultations were made public. Special attention was given
to consultation with affected persons and their representatives during the preparation of
the Resettlement Action Plan. Extensive field socio-economic surveys of selected
communities containing significant minorities along three of the highways were
undertaken in the form of focus groups, household case studies, individual interviews,
questionnaires and direct observations. Their findings were reflected in the designs of the
various highways. For the developments in Ningxia, an additional survey was carried out
with the participation of experts on cultural property to assess the impact of the
developments on the Great Wall, and measures to mitigate any possible adverse impact
were included in the EAP.

The Bank-financed Second Shaanxi Highway Project and the Second Henan Highway
Project showed that basic access through all-weather roads and the provision of non-
motorized means of transportation contributed significantly to the reduction of poverty in
rural areas. In light of this finding, the Road Improvement Program for Poverty
Alleviation for each of the three provinces was formulated to focus on the lower-category
roads in the poorest counties.

Procurement arrangements were meticulously planned and clearly spelt out in the Project
Agreement as were the actions and measures that were to be taken in implementing the
road safety program. These explicit arrangements and requirements helped to simplify
project implementation planning.

The formulation of the Project to include developments dispersed over 3 provinces with a
part of the loan on-lent to each of the provinces to correspond with the cost of the works
and services at the province, however, did not facilitate the supervision of the Project as a
unitary whole. Separate project implementation units were established by each of the
Project Provinces and the Project was implemented and supervised as if they were 3
separate projects independent of one another. Resources for Bank supervision of the
Project, consequently, were greater than usual.

2.2 Implementation

Project implementation was generally satisfactory. Construction of the 6 original main
highways commenced in March 1999 in Gansu (7 contracts) and Ningxia (8 contracts)
and in May 1999 in Inner Mongolia (12 contracts). All contracts were awarded under
ICB procedure and on FIDIC conditions of contract. The highways were completed by
September 2001 in Ningxia, October 2002 in Gansu, and October 2003 in Inner
Mongolia.

There were numerous contract variations due to differences between actual geological
conditions on site and those adopted in design drawings which were based on geological
surveys conducted prior to detailed design, changes in the design and scope of works of
BDH in Inner Mongolia, and in the upgrading of GWH in Ningxia. These variations in
aggregate came to some RMB683.4 million for civil works of the main highways
(RMB371 million in Inner Mongolia, RMB230.6 million in Gansu and RMB81.8 million
in Ningxia). Unexpected severe climatic conditions affected construction in Ningxia and
heavy storms in July 1999 ruined the sub-grade, destroyed bridges and culverts of the
GWH. The outbreak of SARS curtailed construction activities in Inner Mongolia in 2003.
Initial delays in contracts affected, however, were subsequently overcome.

The whole of the Project was completed as designed with the exception of the changes
mentioned in Section 1.7. These changes are amplified below.

The change along the 50 km section of the BDH in Inner Mongolia, in which new
northbound lanes were built on the same roadway as the southbound lanes instead of
upgrading part of the old Class 2 road to Class 1 standard, was due to conditions on the
old road having seriously deteriorated since the time of project appraisal. It was not
financially viable to re-build part of the old Class 2 road as the half width of BDH which
would also have the effect of cutting off from use the concerned section as a part of the
existing Class 2 road. Moreover, traffic forecasted for the old road during project
appraisal was based on traffic counts taken in 1995 and actual traffic since then had
increased faster than expected. The decision was taken in August 2000 to build new
northbound lanes over this section and rehabilitate the old road as an auxiliary road to
serve slow moving local and non-motorized traffic.

The GWH in Ningxia originally was to be developed on a new right-of-way to a 4-lane
Class 1 highway sub-grade from Guyaozi to Yanchi (83.4 km) but with only 2 lanes
paved, and as a standard Class 2 highway from Yanchi to Wangquanliang (10.7 km).
The unpaved portion of the sub-grade from Guyaozi to Yanchi would only be paved
when the traffic warranted. After construction had started in March 1999, Ningxia
Communications Department, upon approval from the then State Planning Commission,
decided to upgrade the whole length of the highway to expressway standard and to have
all 4 lanes paved at the same time. Approval of the Bank to revise the scope of the
contract was sought in June 2000. The Bank agreed to the change in August 2000



                                               7

following a review of the supplemental feasibility study and the Loan Agreement was
revised accordingly. However, works on the upgraded standard had begun before the
prior approval of the Bank was obtained, and in the contract for the construction of the
section from Yanchi to Wangquanliang, work had advanced too far to warrant Bank
financing. Ningxia Communications Department decided to drop the far-proceeding
contract from Bank financing.

The rehabilitation of 85 km of the existing Class 2 HTH in Gansu was included for Bank
financing in 2004 when it was evident that Gansu would have considerable loan savings
in its part of the loan. The Loan Agreement was revised on June 8, 2004 to include this
work in Part B of the Project (Gansu). The closing date of the loan was extended from
June 30, 2005 to June 30, 2007. In response to the request from MOF and GPCD for
increase of disbursement ratio, the Loan Agreement was again revised on November 23,
2005 to increase the disbursement ratio for civil works-Category (2)(a) of Part B.1 of the
Loan Agreement-from 49% to 65%. The rehabilitation, costing some RMB173.85
million, consisted mainly of the reconstruction of the pavement and drainage ditches on
both sides of the road, and the construction of some culverts and bridges. The
rehabilitation of the road, carried out in 3 NCB contracts, commenced in April 2005 and
was completed towards the end of 2006. The rehabilitated road was excluded from tolling
as both sides of the road were fringed with farms and densely populated, and the
imposition of a toll for its use would be inequitable to the local communities.

There was no mid-term review of the Project. The Project was not at risk at any time.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The Project was monitored through a monthly progress of work on the main highways, a
quarterly report on the progress of implementation of all components of the Project, an
annual monitoring report covering all components and assessing the extent to which
various implementation and development objectives have been satisfied. Annual
accounts for the Project for each fiscal year were audited by independent auditors and
reviewed by the Bank task team.

Key indicators (See Section 1.2) were designed to measure the achievement of the
Project's objectives. The choice of indicators used was appropriate. The rate of progress
in implementing each component was also measured against planned targets.
Implementation indicators, determined during project appraisal for each year of project
implementation, served as bench-marks for monitoring progress of work and project
activities. Data for monitoring performance were collected and reviewed in accordance
with the agreed plan

Bank review missions were mounted regularly to monitor progress and quality of work
on site and provided advice on overcoming difficulties and issues arising from project



                                              8

implementation. The utilization of the assets was also monitored in their initial years of
operation during project implementation review missions. The monitoring and
evaluation of the design, implementation and utilization of the Project was satisfactory
and adequate. Arrangements for the collection of data have been instituted to assure the
sustainability of their collection and usage for monitoring performances by the
implementing entities beyond the project implementation period.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The main environmental impacts were noise and air pollution during the construction and
operation phases, soil erosion during the construction phase, impact on vegetation
especially in Inner Mongolia, and impact on cultural heritage property particularly in
Gansu. Environmental management was built into the overall project management
system. Staff from PMOs, contractors and construction supervisors were specifically
assigned to ensure compliance with the EAPs. Training on environmental management
was provided in the course of project implementation by international and national
experts to adequately equip them for the task. Independent environmental monitoring
was conducted by local environmental agencies in accordance with the EAPs.
Compliance with environmental safeguards was satisfactory.

Surveys undertaken for the RAP proved to be inadequate and land acquisition and the
floor area of homes demolished were higher than estimated. Additionally, land use of the
impacted area in Inner Mongolia was substantially revised to yield an increase in
cultivable land of more that 70%, irrigation was provided to some dry land, and some
low-yielding cultivated grassland were returned to forest. The total cost of resettlement
more than doubled as a consequence.


                                 RAP Estimate            Actual         Increase (%)
 Land acquisition                    29,655              33,973             14.6
 Homes demolished (m2)               55,229              81,309             47.2
 Total resettlement cost
                                     243.77              509.20            109.9
 (RMB million)

A resettlement assessment undertaken by independent monitors after the completion of
implementation of the RIPA component concluded that minor adverse impacts on
affected persons had been ameliorated and the compensatory benefits provided were
generally appreciated. The RAP was completed satisfactorily and in compliance with
Bank and national requirements.

Procurement was undertaken in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. There
was an initial misunderstanding in Ningxia of the requirement for Bank prior approval for
major changes in the scope of work of contracts financed by the Bank. After the Bank
task team had made clear the requirement, contract management proceeded satisfactorily
and without further problem or difficulty.


                                              9

Project financial management met acceptable standards. Compliance with the
requirement for independent auditing of annual project accounts was good.

Compliance with loan covenants was generally satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

All roads were operated and maintained by the respective highway administration entities
of the Project Provinces in accordance with current practices upon their completion.
YXH and GWH are now the responsibility of Ningxia Highway Administration Bureau
and Ningxia High-grade Highway Administration Bureau. LZE and XJH are managed,
operated and maintained by Liugu High-grade Highway Toll Administration Department
of Gansu, while BDH and BDR have been transferred to Inner Mongolia High-grade
Highway Construction Development Company for their management, operation and
maintenance. These operating entities belong to the Communications Department of the
respective Project Provinces.

Investments in the Project are likely to be sustained. Traffic on two of the main roads
have exceeded targets while the rest, except for GWH in Ningxia, are either close to their
target values or showing an increasing growth rate since their opening. Traffic was lower
than expected in GWH because the section of the highway in Shaanxi Province to which
it would connect had not been opened to traffic yet. This section of the highway is
expected to be opened at the end of 2007. The target number of vehicles on RIPA roads,
though short of expectation, shows an increasing trend. Bank review missions that
monitored post-completion operation found a satisfactory level of maintenance.

Monitoring of the utilization of project highways after their completion found that they
have been maintained well by the operating entities, but overloading was a common
problem. Ningxia formed a leading group at provincial government level to address the
issue of overloading. Sub-leading groups were also formed in city and county levels to
attend to the problem. Ningxia also established 10 permanent loading monitoring
stations equipped with electronic weighing platforms, staffed jointly by the traffic police
and local communications bureaus while Inner Mongolia established 3 monitoring
centers. The sustainability of these efforts to curb overloading will require continuing
vigilance and a strict enforcement of the regulations on highway loading.

Institutional capacity to plan design, operate and manage highways in all Project
Provinces has been strengthened through technical assistance and training. This is
demonstrated in Inner Mongolia by the dispatch of several PMO staff to implement the
program for the construction of 1300 km of expressways and 1400 km of Class 1
highways upon completion of BDH.

Improvement in highway safety is expected to be maintained as a result of the
establishment of a high-level traffic safety coordination group to improve communication
between the traffic police and the Communications Department in each of the Project
Provinces and the traffic safety manuals developed under the Project.



                                              10

Plans are on hand to further improve the road infrastructure network in the Project
Provinces including the new construction of 1,435 km expressway and 58 km Class 1
roads in the 11th Five-Year Plan in Gansu; the linkage of Yinchuan, the provincial capital
of Ningxia, to central cities such as Taiyuan, Beijing, Wuhan, Lanzhou and Baotou.
Ningxia has also plans to develop a provincial road network that would be connected to
the expressways of neighboring provinces. In Inner Mongolia, on completion of BDH,
the province proceeded with the construction of some 1300 km of expressways and 1400
km of Class 1 highways as well as the development of rural roads to provide better access
to poor counties.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of the Project was to assist the Borrower and the Project Provinces to: (a)
increase the efficiency and safety of traffic in highway priority corridors in order to
facilitate faster socio-economic development; (b) provide improved access to targeted
poor counties; (c) improve highway sector institutional capacity; and (d) improve the
level of safety of road transport.

The Project was designed to meet these objectives through the construction of 2 high
grade highways each in the provinces of Gansu, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia along their
major traffic corridors and which would effectively link them to the sea. The Project was
also designed to improve access to the provinces' poor counties by improving the
condition of rural roads. The objectives, design and implementation of the Project are
consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the People's Republic of
China for the Period 2006-2010 dated May 23, 2006, in terms of upgrading transport
infrastructure to link inland provinces to the coast so that transportation benefits accrue to
the poor while also improving network management and traffic safety expressed in Pillar
2 of the CPS. The Project would also meet China's main transport concern of ensuring
that its highway system help integrate the country's economy and facilitate the movement
of goods and services. The Project was, and continues to be, highly relevant to the
development needs of the country in general and of Project Provinces in particular.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The Project was predicated on the premise that improving road network capacity would
help to generate economic development, alleviate poverty and improve the quality of life
in the project areas. The outcome of the Project would be determined by a series of
indicators that included the volume, average speed of travel and accident rates on the
highways, the gross output value of agriculture and industry (GOVAI) of the project main
highway corridors as well as the volume of traffic on the improved rural roads in the
RIPA component and the number of days these roads were closed.




                                              11

Based on the indicators for monitoring outcome, the Project has attained its development
objective. GOVAI on the main corridors was higher than estimated by 60% in Inner
Mongolia, 57% in Gansu and 36% in Ningxia. The average speed of travel on the project
highways has improved and fatalities in road accidents have dropped (See also Results
Framework Analysis in Data Sheet). Traffic on the main roads from 2005 to 2025 is
expected to grow at a rate that matches the growth rate forecasted during project appraisal
except for BDH which significantly exceeds forecast and YXH and GWH which fall
short of expectation (See also Annex 3, para. 4).

Traffic Growth Forecast 2005-2025: ICR vs PAD (in %)
                  BDH          BFH         YXH           GWH           XJH         LZE
    ICR            5.2          5.5         2.6            3.3          5.3         5.7
    PAD            2.6        5.4-6.1       5.8            8.1          5.2         5.8


Project outputs upon completion of the Project exceeded expectation. In addition to the
original list of the six main highways, two other highways were rehabilitated. This was
highly valued by the clients. All these outputs were obtained within the original project
cost estimates.

Project outcome is rated satisfactory specifically for the following reasons:

a) Transport efficiency and safety along the selected high priority highways increased.
All the six highways originally planned under the project have been completed and
opened to traffic on schedule. According to the latest monitoring report, traffic volume
on the two most important highways (LZE in Gansu and BDH in Inner Mongolia) had
exceeded the predicted values by 28% and 37% respectively. Traffic on the remaining
four highways were close to the predicted values or showed high growth rates although
the current volumes are lower than expected, except for GWH in Ningxia. The low
traffic on GWH in Ningxia was mainly due to the delayed construction of the adjacent
section in Shaanxi province. Obvious improvements in transport efficiency and safety on
the six corridors were achieved. Especially, relief of traffic congestion and improvement
of road conditions on the most important coal transport corridor in Inner Mongolia (by
completion of BDH and BDR) and on the Lanzhou bypass (by completion of LZE) was
significant.

b) Accessibility to the targeted poor counties improved and poverty reduced. The
completion of about 1900 km rural roads under the RIPA component contributed greatly
to improving accessibility to the targeted poor communities in each of the three provinces.
Closure of RIPA roads was minimal in Ningxia; none in Gansu and Inner Mongolia.
According to the statistical data provided by the local government, the social and
economic benefits of the investment were significant. (See Section 3.5 for details of
poverty impacts and social benefits)



                                             12

c) Safety of road transport improved. All activities listed under the Road Safety Program
have been completed. Treatment of 57 black spots showed very good results. With the
completion of a number of analyses and studies (see also Annex 2, Output by
Components), the awareness of road safety of the clients had been reinforced. Traffic
accidents were within the values predicted at appraisal. During the implementation of
this component the coordination mechanism between the Provincial Communications
Departments and the traffic police was established and overloading of vehicles was
effectively controlled.

d) Highway sector institutional capacity strengthened. The required domestic training
for all the three provinces was completed beyond expectation while the overseas training
program was substantially completed. The overseas training program totaling about 267
person- months on various subjects benefited 385 persons. Under this component, a sum
of US$ 23.94 million worth of maintenance equipment and laboratory testing apparatus
were procured by the three Project Provinces. Through the provision of the training and
equipment procured under the Project, the capacity of the Provincial Communications
Department in terms of highway planning, construction, operation and maintenance
especially in expressways and Class I highways was enhanced.

3.3 Efficiency

The investment in the Project in economic terms was cost effective although the post-
project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Main Highways at 19.2% was less
than the PAD's estimate of 23.2%. However, the economic net present value (ENPV) of
the Main Highways at a discount rate of 12% was higher than estimated at appraisal
(RMB5, 691.1 million vs. RMB 4,469.7 million). The RIPA component for all three
provinces in aggregate had an EIRR of 43.6% and an ENPV of RMB1, 181 million. The
recalculated aggregate EIRR and ENPV for the entire project were 20.7% and RMB
6,262.3 million respectively. The lower than expected EIRR was due mainly to lower
traffic demand in Ningxia and higher construction cost for the majority of the new roads.
The detailed economic and financial analysis found in Annex 3 is summarized below.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
The overall outcome of the Project has been satisfactory based on the relevance of the
development (See Section 3.1), the attainment of the project development objectives (See
Section 3.2), and the efficiency with which the project outputs were achieved (See
Section 3.3).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Social development in the project areas has been favorable since the Project was
launched. In Gansu, as a result of the improvements made in the Project, every city or
town in the project areas has regular bus and the children's education enrolment rate
raised by more than 3%. In Ningxia, the 253 km of rural roads improved/constructed
under the Project conveyed economic and social benefits in poor counties by increasing
access to their townships from 72% in 1997 to 95% in 2001. The average annual income
per capita in these counties increased from RMB869 to RMB1230 during the same period.
In Inner Mongolia, the RIPA component provided all the counties impacted by the
program with access to major highways, up from 35% in 1998, and average annual
income per capita increased from RMB450 to RMB1066.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The capacities of the Communications Departments of the Project Provinces to design,
manage, operate and maintain highways have been strengthened. PMO staff, many of
whom were new to implementing and supervising contracts under FIDIC conditions,
have benefited from their exposure to executing and supervising contracts under such
arrangement. Coordination between the traffic police and the Communications
Departments has been institutionalized and manuals have been developed to improve
safety and maintenance standards. Overseas training provided numerous staff with an
exposure to the management, operation and maintenance of highways in developed
countries as well as to how environmental concerns were addressed in mature economies.
Measures to strengthen institutional capacity are likely to have a continuing positive
impact on matters pertaining to highway engineering, construction supervision, contract
management, resettlement, environmental monitoring and highway management,
maintenance and administration.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
There were no unintended outcomes or impacts

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops



                                            14

No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were conducted in the Project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low or negligible
The risk to development outcome is low or negligible. The main roads in the Project are
important sections of NTHS and contribute effectively to the linkage of provinces
adjacent to one another as well as facilitate their access to the sea. Traffic volumes on
two of the main highways have exceeded the forecast and the others have robust growth
rates. Economic growth and the expansion of trade in the Project Provinces will
generate a greater demand for the use of the project roads. Improvement in the quality of
life of the rural poor people will be sustained by better accesses to markets, schools and
medical services provided by RIPA roads. RIPA roads will also stimulate economic
development in the poor counties. Revenue on tolled roads are sufficient to cover their
maintenance, and for non-tolled roads (rural roads in the RIPA component) their
maintenance costs amount to only 3% of the provincial maintenance budget, well within
the capacity of the provinces to meet. Institutional capacities for operating and
maintaining highways have been enhanced with the technical assistance and training
provided under the Project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated satisfactory. Analysis of the
justification for the Project was sound and project preparation was comprehensive. The
design of the Project for implementation under three separate implementation units
created some logistical problem and project implementation had to be managed with
increased resources for supervision.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The quality of Bank supervision was satisfactory. Reporting requirements were
comprehensive. Regular field supervision missions, being focused on the quality and
timely completion of work and the achievement of the Project's development objectives,
were regularly mounted twice a year. Issues that emerged during implementation were
attended to efficiently and promptly. The Bank task team was sensitive to the needs of
the Project Provinces, responded positively to their requests for changes in the project
scope and design to enhance the benefits that would be generated by the Project.
Compliance with safeguard and fiduciary policies was monitored closely. Project outputs,
as a result, were achieved as planned.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory



                                              15

Overall, Bank performance is rated satisfactory taking into account its performance in
ensuring quality at entry and the consistency and quality of its supervision throughout the
implementation of the Project.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Government performance was satisfactory. The MOC and MOF, at the central level,
provided valuable assistance in the preparation of the Project. During the implementation
stage, they followed the Project closely and helped to resolve issues promptly.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
 Gansu Communications         Project preparation by GCD was timely and effective. Gansu
 Department                   commenced construction promptly in May 1999, and had
                              completed the original scope of the Project for the province by
                              2004. A subsequent add-on, the rehabilitation of HTH, extended
                              the final completion of the Project work beyond the original
                              closing date by about 2 years.
 Inner Mongolia               Project preparation was effective. Experienced staff were
 Communications               assigned to the PMO at the beginning of project implementation.
 Department                   The standard of supervision was satisfactory. Overseas training
                              was overly planned but not fully undertaken due to the limited
                              availability of staff for training and the stringent control
                              imposed by the Finance Department.
 Ningxia Communications       Project preparation was effective. Project implementation
 Department                   initially suffered from a lack of familiarity with Bank
                              procurement guidelines and a major revision of contract was
                              made without prior Bank approval resulting in the withdrawal of
                              one contract from Bank financing. However, knowledge of
                              Bank procurement policies and procedures improved
                              considerably after that event and project implementation
                              proceeded satisfactorily henceforth. Project output of a higher
                              construction standard than originally planned was achieved.



(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.
Overall, Borrower performance was satisfactory based on the support it provided in the
preparation and implementation of the Project. Borrower performed responsibly to
ensure that the scope of the Project was executed in accordance with the agreed schedule
and that project outputs would be achieved as planned.

6. Lessons Learned

The Project included investments in three provinces with each province setting up an
implementing unit to implement the Project in its province. As it was not practical

organically to have a common implementing agency for the Project, the Bank task team
had to deal directly with three separate counterparts. Project preparation and supervision,
as a result, were more complex than usual.

The program for overseas training for Inner Mongolia (140 person-months) turned out to
be overly ambitious (only 69 person-months were achieved) as the province did not seem
to have enough staff to be sent for training. In light that the Ministry of Finance has
become stringent with the incurrence of expenses for overseas training, a more realistic
program may be structured for future projects.

The mechanism in managing World Bank financed projects in Inner Mongolia needs to
be improved for future projects. So far, the province had three Bank projects including
the one under review. For each of the projects, IMCD set up a PMO with a different set
of staff. This resulted in inexperienced staff managing Bank financed projects since the
new staff would have to go through a learning process from the very beginning. Further,
the PMO was disbanded as soon as the main roads were completed although other
components of the Project were still being implemented, which caused difficulty in
communication with regard to managing incomplete activities.

Variances in geological conditions between those actually found on site and those used in
detailed designs reflected a need for more comprehensive site investigations at the design
stage.

Ningxia PMO lacked sufficient knowledge of the Bank's procurement guidelines in the
initial stage of project implementation. Training of PMO staff in Bank's procurement
policies and guidelines before the launching of a project would be helpful.

Rural roads in the RIPA component have a positive impact on poverty alleviation and
yielded considerable social benefits for poor communities.

Traffic

Except for the HTH in Gansu, all the seven sections of highways in Inner Mongolia,
Ningxia and Gansu were opened to traffic in 2001- 2002. Based on 2005 traffic data,
except for the two highways in Ningxia, which were 18%-55% of the PAD's estimates,
the average traffic for other five new highways were about 96% of the PAD's estimates,
ranging from 56% to 138%.

The average annual traffic growth rate on the new highways in 2002 to 2005, except for
the two highways in Ningxia, grew at an annual rate of 38.4%, which was much higher
than the PAD's estimate of 5.8%. The high traffic growth rate is an indication that more
and more road users choose the new highways as their traveling route and are quickly
accepting the toll highway concept.

Considering the current growth rates on the new highways, the long ­term traffic
projection for 2005-2020, except for Ningxia, is estimated to be 5.2% (ranging from
3.6% to 5.7%). In the PAD, the corresponding growth rate is 4.6% (ranging from 2.6% to
6.0%). For Ningxia, the long ­term traffic projection for 2005-2020, is estimated to be
2.9%. In the PAD, the growth rate forecast for Ningxia is 7.3%.

Net Present Value/ Economic Rate of Return

The economic evaluation is comprised of two major components: (a) the 8 main
highways in Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and Gansu on the northwestern region of China and
(b) the 54 rural roads under the program of Roads Improvement for Poverty Alleviation
(RIPA) in the same region. The economic evaluation covers all subcomponents as well
as the entire project. Both costs and benefits reflect December 2005 prices.

The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the main highways is estimated at 19.2%;
the economic net present value (ENPV), at a discount rate of 12 percent, is estimated at
RMB 5,691.1 million, compared to the PAD estimate of 23.2% for the EIRR and RMB

4,469.7 million for the ENPV. The EIRR and ENPV of the RIPA roads are estimated at
43.6% and RMB 1,181 million, respectively. The PAD had no EIRR and ENPV for the
RIPA.

The recalculated aggregate EIRR and ENPV for the entire project are estimated to be
20.7% and RMB 6,262.3 million. The EIRR is lower than anticipated at appraisal
(23.2%) mainly because of the lower traffic demand on Ningxia and higher construction
cost for the majority of the new roads.

The results of the EIRR and ENPV for the main highways and the rural roads under the
RIPA, compared to the PAD, are summarized in the following table.

Financial Rate of Return

Most of the tolled highways in the project were opened to traffic in 2001- 2002. The
three Provinces have formed the operating entities, responsible for the day-to-day
management, operations and maintenance of the roads. The main income of these
entities comes from the tolls charged on the road users. The toll charges are set by the
provincial governments. The entities plan to use the toll revenue to cover amortization
charges of the Bank and domestic loans. Based on the current toll revenue and operating
costs, the entities would not be able to generate enough revenue to finance operation,
maintenance, and debt services because of the low profitability mainly as a result of the
low toll charges and the lower than expected traffic in Ningxia. The low profit margin
produces a negative impact on the FIRR for the capital investments. The result of the
financial evaluation for the project shows that the FIRR of the project will be -4.7% with
a negative FNPV (at 4.56% discount rate) of RMB5,651 million. There were no FIRR
and FNPV in the PAD.

Fiscal Impact of the Investment

For the revenue-earning entities (the tolled highways), the low profitability and high
portion of the borrowing for some of the roads diluted the equity and lowered the
financial leverage of the entities. To maintain the long-term financial viability of these
entities, constant cash transfers from the governments to their cash in-flows are crucial to
their daily operation. The financial records showed that cash transfers to these entities
constituted only a small fraction of the provincial governments' total revenue (less than
5%). This low ratio would imply that the financial risk of project entities not being able
to obtain the required cash injection from the governments is low. The fiscal impact in
each of the Project Provinces is as follows:

For the non-revenue-earning entities (the roads under the RIPA), the long-term
sustainability depends on the resource allocated for the maintenance of these non-tolled
roads. Financial records indicate that the total annual maintenance required for the RIPA
roads would constitute only a small fraction of the governments' total annual
maintenance budget (less than 3.3%). These low ratios represent that the risk pertaining
to the availability of funds for the maintenance of RIPA roads is very modest.

Project Components
The Project, comprising developments in Gansu, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia, consisted
of the following components:
(a) Construction of Main Highways with a total length of about 687 km comprising
    (i)     Baotou-Dongsheng Highway (103 km) of which 92 km are a 4-lane Class 1
            highway and 11 km are a 2-lane Class 2 highway in Inner Mongolia;
    (ii)    Baiyinchagan-Fengzhen Highway (142 km) a 2-lane Class 2 highway in Inner
            Mongolia;
    (iii)   Liugouhe-Zhonghe Expressway (33.5 km) a 4-lane expressway in Gansu;
    (iv)    Xujiamo-Jiepaicun Highway (64 km) a 2-lane Class 2 highway in Gansu;
    (v)     Guyaozi-Wangquanliang Highway (94 km) of which about 83 km provide 2
            lanes for traffic on a 4-lane Class 1 highway subgrade and about 11 km are a
            2-lane Class 2 highway in Ningxia; and
    (vi)    Yanchi-Xingren Highway (250.5 km), a 2-lane Class 2 highway in Ningxia.
(b) Road Improvement Program for Poverty Alleviation (RIPA) consisting of the
    construction and improvement of about 1892 km of rural roads in poor counties of
    which 803 km are in Gansu, 836 km in Inner Mongolia and 253 km in Ningxia.
(c) A program to strengthen institutional capacity in highway planning, design,
    supervision, construction, operation and maintenance in each of the project provinces.
(d) A highway safety program to reduce traffic accidents on highways.

Objective of the Project
The objective of the Project was to increase the efficiency and safety of traffic in
highway priority corridors to facilitate faster socio-economic development, provide better
access to targeted poor counties; to improve highway sector institutional capacity, and to
improve safety of road transport in the three provinces (Gansu, Inner Mongolia and
Ningxia).

The development of the Baotou-Dongsheng Highway (BDH) would improve the
efficiency and safety of transportation between Baotou, the most important industrial city
in Inner Mongolia with rich mineral resources, and Dongsheng, an important coal center,
as well as access to the Dalate power plant. The proposed development would reduce
traffic problems associated with heavy loaded vehicles, especially coal trucks and trailers.
The Baiyinchagan-Fengzhen Highway (BFH) would serve the city of Wulanchabu in one
of the most poverty-stricken areas of Inner Mongolia. BFH, a segment of national trunk
highway (NH 208), would improve the linkage of Inner Mongolia with Shanxi, Shaanxi
Sichuan and Yunnan. The Liugouhe-Zhonghe Expressway (LZE) would serve as a by-
pass to Lanzhou City to overcome traffic congestion. The Xujiamo-Jiepaicun Highway
(XJH), a Class 2 auto-only highway was expected to stimulate tourism in Gansu. Both
LZE and XJH form important sections of the east-west national trunk highway (NR 310
and NR 312) extending from the port city of Lianyungang on the China Sea to


                                              28

Huoerguosi on the border with Kazakstan. Both central and provincial governments
accorded a high priority to their development. The Guyaozi-Wangquangliang Highway
(GWH), a part of national trunk highway, would link Yinchuan the capital of Ningxia to
Taiyuan (Shanxi Province), Jinan and the port of Qingdao (Shandong) on the East China
Sea. It would provide an important traffic corridor for the rich coal and petroleum
resources of Ningxia. The Yanchi-Xingren Highway (YXH), an important east-west
provincial highway would serve the poor counties along its alignment as well as the poor
who had been relocated from the mountainous areas in southern Ningxia to the irrigated
agricultural areas around Xiantoushi.

Project Entities
The project entities were Gansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD), Inner
Mongolia Communications Department (IMCD), and Ningxia Communications
Department (NCD), each responsible for the preparation, design and implementation of
the developments in their respective provinces.

Bank Loan
The Bank Loan of $230 million was on-lent to Gansu Province ($100 million), Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region ($80 million) and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region ($50
million). . The loan was signed on December 18, 1998, became effective on March 18,
1999 and closed on June 30, 2007.

Project Outputs
The Project was completed as planned. The six main roads were satisfactorily completed
on schedule, within their estimated costs and on time. In addition, 85 km of the Hekou-
Tungouwan Highway in Gansu and 82 km of the old Baotou-Dongsheng Road were
rehabilitated. These additional outputs were not in the original scope of the Project. The
RIPA and Highway Safety components of the project were also completed as planned.
Some 800 km of rural roads in Gansu, 840 km in Inner Mongolia and 250 km in Ningxia
were improved. Outputs achieved under the Highway Safety Program included the
establishment of a traffic coordination group, a study on highway accidents, the
development of highway safety manuals and safety audit procedures for each of the
project provinces, and the implementation of corrective measures at 57 black spots to
reduce traffic accidents

Achievement of Objectives.
The Project has achieved its objectives.
In Gansu, traffic on the expressway in 2003 (8713 ADT), its first full year of operation,
exceeded expectation by 23% although the number of vehicles using the Class 2 auto-
only highway was less than expected (4352 ADT vs. 5154 ADT). GDP in the
expressway corridor expanded about 12% upon the completion of the Project compared
with the provincial GDP growth of about 10%. Road fatalities on the two project
highways declined 7.3-7.8 per million vehicle km before the Project (1997) to 0.5 per
million vehicle km after the Project (2005). Out of 24 black spots in which remedial
measures were taken, 21 did not have a single accident while the accident rate at the


                                            29

remaining3 spots was reduced by as much as 50%. The successful completion of RIPA
helped to raise the living standard of the poor and the minorities. Every town in the
project counties now has a regular bus service. The number of children going to school
has increased by about 3%. Twelve study groups were sent overseas for training that
totaled 42.5 person-months, helping to strengthen the capacity of the provincial highway
authorities in the design, construction, supervision, management, operation and
maintenance of the provinces' road network. .

In Inner Mongolia, the new Baotou-Dongsheng Highway, completed in June 2002, had
an ADT of 8,469 MTE, having increased from 7,411 the previous year. The old Class 2
Baoutou-Road, whose rehabilitation was completed in October 2003, had an ADT of
11,264 MTE, an increase of 44% from 7,897 MTE in the base year (1997). GOVAI in
the corridor increased from RMB25.4 billion in 1997 to RMB85.4 billion. Traffic on the
Class 2 Baiyingchagan-Fengzhen Highway showed an increasing trend, up from 1,271
MTE in 2003 to 1,875 MTE in 2004. GOVAI on this corridor increased from RMB2.2
billion before the Project o RMB8.7 billion after the Project. In counties impacted by the
RIPA component, the percentage of access to the highways increased from 34% in 1998
to 100% in 2004. The average annual income per capita increased 137% from RMB450
to RMB1066.

In Ningxia, the number of vehicles using the Guyaozi-Wangquanliang Highway (GWH)
has been increasing steadily since it was opened to traffic (630 MTE in 2002, 1,298 MTE
in 2003 and 1197 MTE in 2004). There was a slight drop in traffic in 2004 due to the
completion of the reconstruction of a section of National Highway 307 which diverted
some traffic from GWH. Traffic on GWH was generally less than expected because the
section of the highway from Jingbian in Shaanxi Province to which GWH would connect
had not been opened to traffic. However, the construction of the Jingbian-Zizhou-Suide-
Wupu section of the highway in Shaanxi would be completed towards the end of 2007
and the joining of this section of the highway to GWH would ensure an increased volume
of traffic on GWH. The Yanchi-Xingren Highway (YXH) which was completed in
November 2000 saw strong traffic growth, with the average daily traffic increasing from
1830 MTE in 2002 to 2201 MTE in 2003. The upgraded YXH serving the poor counties
of Yanchi, Tongxin and Haiyuan helped to lift the working and living conditions. The
RIPA component originally comprising the new construction and the reconstruction of 13
road sections totaling some 253 km of rural roads but later extended by another 4 new
sections to take the total length to 356 km was completed in 2001 at a cost of RMB59.03
million, increasing the coverage rate of the township and village roads in Yanchi County
from 72% in 1997 to 95% in 2001. Average income per capita increased from RMB869
to RMB1, 230 during the same period. Road accidents dropped significantly following
the completion of the Highway Safety Program.

Project Preparation, Design and Implementation
Project preparation in Ningxia started as early as September 1994 following the approval
of the Ningxia Development and Reform Commission for the developments. The design
of the developments was based on a feasibility study that was approved by NDRC and
MOC in August 1998. Project preparation in Inner Mongolia commenced in 1996. MOC



                                             30

approved the designs of BDH and BFH in September/October 1998. MOC had also
approved the developments for Ningxia in March 1998 and the designs for GWH and
YXH by June 1998. The loan was approved by the Bank on June 23, 1998.
The Project was the result of the effort of numerous national and provincial organizations
and agencies.

Project Implementation-Gansu
Construction of the highways totaling 100.3 km was undertaken through 7 contracts.
Work on the Liuguohe-Zhonghe Expressway commenced in March 1999 and was
completed in October 2002. Construction of the Class 2 Xujiamo-Jiepaicun Highway,
which commenced in March 1999, was completed in October 2001. Design work was
undertaken by No.1 Highway Institute of the Ministry of Communications and the
Highway Planning Institute of Gansu Province. Construction supervision was undertaken
by a joint team of foreign and local consultants. Overseas training in project management,
construction supervision, traffic engineering, environmental protection and monitoring,
highway financial management and highway safety totaling 42.5 person-months were
undertaken while training was provided to some 740 persons domestically.

Two factors affected the implementation of the Project, namely, (1) insufficient site
investigations resulted in a large number of variations; and (2) awarding contract to the
lowest evaluated bidder who did not have adequate financial resources and who
consequently had difficulties in executing their contracts.

Considerable emphasis was placed on environmental protection. To prepare for the task,
12 persons were sent overseas for training that totaled 9 person-months. Environmental
monitoring was regularly undertaken every 3 months during the construction period as
well as after the completion of construction. The national environmental bureau
examined conditions at project sites in October 2002 and May 2003.

Land acquisition and resettlement were executed satisfactorily as planned. A total of
316,089 mu were acquired.

Cooperation between GPCD/PMO and the World Bank during project preparation and
implementation was good. The Bank effectively reviewed the resettlement action plan,
the environmental action plan, preliminary designs of the works, the pre-qualification of
contractors and the overseas training program in the course of project preparation.
During project implementation the Bank sent regular review missions to supervise the
quality and the progress of work and helped GPCD/PMO in resolving design changes and
claims.

Project Implementation-Inner Mongolia
Construction of the new BDH commenced in May 1999. Undertaken in 6 contracts, the
construction was completed on schedule in June 2002. The rehabilitation of the existing
Baotou-Dongsheng Road (NH 210), undertaken through 3 contracts, commenced in July
2002, and was completed in October 2003. Construction under the RIPA component (13

rural roads) started in 1999 and was completed in 2001 at a total cost of RMB180 million.
Work under this program included 836 km of sub-grade and pavement of which
128.3 km were asphalted, 82 bridges totaling 1142 m, and 550 culverts. Local and
foreign consultants jointly supervised construction. The inputs of foreign consultants
came to 78 person-months. The foreign consulting company also provided 3 person-
months of domestic training and 10 person-months of overseas training. Overseas
training arranged by IMCD totaled 69 person-months and cost $590,000. Training
courses included project management, construction supervision, transport engineering,
environmental protection and monitoring, highway planning, high-grade highway
maintenance and management, highway financial management and transport safety.

Environmental protection was considered an important aspect of high-grade highway
management. To this end, the PMO arranged training for 22 personnel to prepare them
for the tasks ahead. Environmental monitoring was entrusted to the Inner Mongolia
Environment & Science Institute, the Environment Monitoring Station of Wulanchabu
League and the Eerduosi City Environment Station. Environmental monitoring was
undertaken seven times a year during construction and twice a year during the operation
phase.

Land acquisition and resettlement, mainly in the BDH and BFH corridors was executed
in accordance with the requirements of the RAP. While land acquisition and resettlement
costs in the BFH corridor matched the RAP's estimates, those for the BDH corridor
exceeded estimate by some 50% due to the revision in the construction scheme for the
new BDH that required an additional land acquisition of some 50 km and the upgrading
from Class 1 (open) to of Class 1 ( fully closed). Total compensation paid under the
Project which exceeded estimates by some 36% is summarized below.

Project Implementation-Ningxia
Construction of GWH (94 km) was undertaken through four contracts, three of which
were financed with proceeds from the Bank loan. Construction commenced in March
1999 and was completed by October 2001. Construction of YXH (250 km), also
commenced in March 1999 through five contracts four of which were financed by the
Bank loan, was completed in October 2000. During construction, numerous contract
variations had to be issued to improve the quality of construction materials such as using
solidification additives, sand gravel replacement in salty soils, mechanical compaction,
the use of glass-grid as to prevent reflective cracks on pavements and grass-grids to
solidify sand on desert sections. Construction supervision was undertaken by a joint team
of local and foreign consultants. The inputs of foreign consultants amounted to 99


                                               32

person-months. Foreign consultants also provided 22 person-months of overseas training.
Overseas training amounting to112 person-months were also provided under the Project's
training program at a total cost of $980,000. Domestic training totaled 2115 person-
months incurring a cost of RMB4.6 million.

The original RIPA component in the province consisted of 13 road sections with a total
length of 253 km. In order to expedite poverty alleviation, 4 additional road sections
were included. The 17 road sections were distributed over 5 poor counties (Tongxin,
Penyang, Xiji, Haiyuan, Yanchi and the Hongsipu Migration Zone). Works on the roads
started in 1998 and were completed in 2000. In all, 356 km of rural roads costing
RMB59.03 million were constructed compared with the planned 253 km of total length.

Land acquisition and resettlement were executed in accordance with the requirements of
the RAP. The living standard and income of affected people have improved. A total of
9226 mu of land was acquired, 13 households, 63 people and 6 enterprises were affected.
Total compensation paid amounted to 28.05 million an increase of 69% over the RAP
estimate.

This was the first World Bank financed highway project in Ningxia. To ensure the
successful preparation of the project, the Ningxia Provincial Communications
Department (NCD) set up a World Bank Loan Project Office (WBLPO) for the front-end
preparation. NCD later set up the Gu-Wang & Yan-Xing Highway Engineering
Construction Headquarters to take over responsibility. Design work was undertaken by
China Highway Engineering Consultancy Supervision Company and Ningxia highway
Survey & Design Institute. Representatives of the design institutes were available at
construction sites during implementation to facilitate design changes and revisions of
contract drawings. Construction supervision was performed by foreign and local
consultants. Two levels of supervision were provided consisting of a general supervision
office and resident supervision office for each contract. Supervision staff totaling 126
personnel managed and controlled the quality, progress, measurement and payment
according to FIDIC conditions.

Factors Affecting Implementation
Factors which impacted significantly on the implementation of the Project included
    · Changes in construction standards (Ningxia, GWH)
    · Inadequate geological surveys and site investigations (all 3 provinces)
    · Unexpected severe climatic conditions. Heavy storms in July 1999 in Ningxia
        ruined sub-grade and destroyed bridges and culverts


                                               33

    · Outbreak of SARS in 2003 curtailed construction activities in Inner Mongolia.

Future Development Plans
Gansu plans to continue the improvement of its highway network including new
construction of 1,435 km expressway, 58 km Class 1 highways and 890 km Class 2
highways during the 11th Five Year Plan. By 2010, Gansu will have 2,441 km of
expressways, 199 km of Class 1 highways and 2,325 km of Class 2 highways. The
density of roads is planned to reach about 12 km per square km.

Inner Mongolia's transport development strategy gives priority to the connectivity of
nearby provinces with highways improved to Class 1 standard and the development of
rural roads to provide better access to poor counties. By 2010, Inner Mongolia will have
2600 km of expressways, 4400 km of Class 1 highways and 1300 km of Class 2
highways. Roads in townships will be asphalted and administrative villages will be
linked to the highways.

Ningxia's plan for the future is to link Yinchuan, the capital of the province, to central
cities such as Taiyuan, Beijing, Wuhan, Lanzhou and Baotou. With this objective in
