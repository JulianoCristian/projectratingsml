Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) there is a need for a more\n            focused multi-sectoral approach which prioritizes sectors\n            with the largest potential impact on the epidemic such as\n            health, education, transport, labor, gender and defense on\n            the basis of their comparative advantages; 2) the risk of\n            scaling up care and treatment agenda at the expense of\n            prevention is real; 3) there is a need to put in place\n            functional mechanisms for coordination, alignment and\n            harmonization of the major funding streams for HIV/AIDS; and\n            4) no corruption/governance issue was identified, and this\n            can be attributed to the use of the independent Technical\n            Resource Network, the project's emphasis on\n            transparency and accountability of budget allocation and\n            expenditures, clear eligibility criteria for implementers,\n            the contracting of accounting firms to help the districts\n            with financial management issues, and fiduciary capacity\n            building for civil society organizations (CSOs)."}, "docdt": "2007-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
