distortions and increasing export incentives.  Under the\n            policy package supported by the loan, the Government would\n            take additional steps to eliminate trade restrictions, to\n            improve institutional support systems and rationalize\n            regulatory procedures.  The project is designed to increase\n            profitability in the sector, change farmers'\n            expectations and bring about a more positive investment\n            climate.  Achievement of these goals should, in turn, lead\n            to higher productivity and exports."}, "docdt": "1984-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
