C. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
1. Equipment Purchases
There will be no equipment purchase because Monitoring Contractor will perform such
activities. Monitoring Contractor will be selected after procurement process during which
Contractor should provide evidence on possession of necessary equipment and previous
experience in such works.
2. Training/Study Tours
Republic of Srpska capacity for monitoring of road works' impact and enforcing
environmental standards is very weak. This capacity needs to be reinforced both within the
Road Directorate and the Ministry of Environment.
Training should support creation of the Road Directorate environmental capacities through
following training activities:
1. environmental management;
2. environmental assessment procedures and preparation for road and highway projects;
3. preparation of technical specifications and terms of reference for road construction,
rehabilitation, reconstruction and maintenance activities;
4. selection and evaluation of possible mitigation measures for noise, air and water protection
against road activities;
5. environmental enforcement.
Activities listed under I to 4 would be realized for the Road Directorate staff that will be
responsible for environmental management (2 students planned). These training activities
would be coupled as one course in maximum duration of three weeks. Item No. 5 would be
carried out in order to train the Ministry of Environment staff so they could successfully
provide law enforcement in the field of environmental protection regarding activities on roads
and highways (1 student planned). Duration of environmental enforcement training is not to
exceed two weeks. In order to enable future expert help in the field of environmental issues
for roads and highways it is planned to train one local consultant also.
Approach to the formal training program will be to provide an educational experience which
will help the trainees to better accomplish their on-the-job responsibilities. The emphasis of
the program should be pragmatic and practical. Strong emphasis should be given to on-the-job
training which would include an explanation of what is to be done and the trainees will be
expected to put these procedures in practice under the supervision of the training personnel.
All training activities could be carried out in Republic of Srpska under guidance of recognized
foreign institution or organization.
Study tours should be the backup activity for training. They could be organized as study visit
to Highway Administration Environmental Units in U.S.A. Canada, France, Germany. United
Kingdom or Sweden and European Environment Agency in Copenhagen, Denmark. Through
those study tours participants would become acquainted with environmental management
organization, policies. procedures and practices utilized in those Environmental Units and
with monitoring activities that are conducted in order to provide necessary information for
environmental management. Participants of the study tours would be the same ones as those
that would participate as trainees.

D. SCHEDULE
During construction phase of the Project, mitigation and monitoring activities will run parallel
to the physical activities. They will commence at the time when men, equipment and/or
materials are moved to the site and will end after the job is completed and all men, equipment
and/or materials are removed fiom the site and the work at particular location is complete. If it
is necessary monitoring activities could be extended to the period after completion of works,
such as monitoring of waste material depository areas.
Terms of Reference for monitoring services (Appendix 2) state out in detail what is going to
be monitored and which specific parameters, where the monitoring will take place, how
frequently etc. Detailed monitoring plan, including what will be measured, where, type of
instruments and their accuracy, frequency of measurements etc. will be specified by
monitoring contractor as predicted by the Terms of Reference.
Exact start and end dates of mitigation and monitoring activities can not be stated, as the
overall project schedule charts are not defined. Schedule charts will be adopted after selection
of Construction Contractor and in accordance with schedule of activities proposed in tender
documents.
Mitigation and monitoring activities during operation will run together with maintenance
activities or when responsible institution decides to check the road environment quality. These
activities will be planned after completion of rehabilitation works in cooperation with
Contractors.
Training activities and study tours are planned according to point 2. Training/Study Tours of
part C. Institutional Strengthening.
14



E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Construction Contractor will make proposal for environmental protection, including safety of
persons associated with the works and also the public, during pre-construction period. This
proposal will be reviewed by the Road Directorate Environmental Unit in order to obtain the
"no objection" to the proposal's recommendations. In this regard attention will be given to:
- taking all reasonable steps to protect the environment on and off site and avoiding damage
or nuisance to persons or to property arising from its operations,
- maintaining conditions of safety for all persons entitled to be on site and
- provision and maintenance of all lights, guards, fencing, warning signs, traffic control and
watching for protection of the works and other property and for the safety and convenience
of the public.
Construction Contractor will provide monthly reports to the Republic of Srpska Road
Directorate Environment Unit which document the environmental mitigation and protection
measures carried out during that month's reporting period. Same applies to the Monitoring,
Supervision and Maintenance Contractors for their part of mitigating and monitoring
activities. If some kind of accident or endangerment of environment would happen reporting
will be immediate. Agreement with Traffic Police (Ministry of Internal Affairs) on regular
reporting (monthly or quarterly) should also be made.
Monitoring Contractor will be selected after procurement process of monitoring activities
during construction and operation phases on sections under project. Monitoring Contractor
will monitor environment quality (air, water and soil quality, noise levels and equipment
supply) through those phases and report monthly to the Road Directorate Environmental Unit
(Appendix 2). These reports will encompass list and explanation of all undertaken activities at
the site and results of the field research, as well as recommendations for future field activities
and protection measures.
The Road Directorate Environmental Unit will prepare quarterly Environmental Monitoring
Reports for submission to the Project Implementation Directorate of the Road Directorate,
according to the received data from all Contractors and Traffic Police. In those reports
Environmental Unit will resume information gathered at the field and evaluate effectiveness
of the mitigation program in the light of monitored parameters. Part of report will concentrate
on possible future mitigation and monitoring activities that could be utilized to assure better
quality of road environment.
The Project Implementation Directorate will prepare and submit an annual Environmental
Report which summarizes the environmental protection measures implemented by the
Construction and Maintenance Contractors, problems encountered, actions taken to resolve
environmental problems and results of environmental monitoring.
The Project Implementation Directorate will have the authority to spend, shutdown or change
operations according to recomrrmendation of Environmental Unit. This will be the case if
environment conditions along road section included in project are not in accordance with
environmental standards and regulations or if works are not performed according to technical
specifications and contract requirements related to the environment. This will be proved by
Monitoring or Supervision Contractor reports to Environmental Unit.
All expenditures referring to mitigation and monitoring activities will be authorized through
the  Project  Implementation  Directorate  after checking  and  confirmation  or  on
recommendation of Environmental Unit.
15



Ministry of Environment Inspection will have the authority for immediate suspension of
works if performance is not in accordance with environmental standards and regulations.
Inspection will then inform the Road Directorate Environmental Unit about suspension and
order to proceed according to its directive.
At present the Republic of Srpska Road Directorate does not have the capability to carry out
monitoring function, as it does not have an in-house Environmental Unit. Also, the Ministry
of Environment has no resources to carry out environmental monitoring. However, Road
Directorate choice is not to carry out any monitoring activities by itself but to make agreement
with institution capable to perform environmental monitoring. When established, an in-house
Environmental Unit will coordinate the work of environmental monitoring contractors,
manage information, make decisions and reports. Environmental Unit establishing as one of
the Road Directorate Departments is one of the goals of institutional strengthening so
necessary steps should be taken in that direction.
Institutional arrangements flow chart is detailed on Fig. 1 with all relations presented as
controlling and reporting activities.
During implementation of this Project public has the right to participate either directly or
indirectly which introduces the possibility to present its interests and opinion in the process of
decision making. In order to reach the best option during this process, state should enable for
each individual to get appropriate knowledge connected with basic relation between nature
and human health, activities with harnful influence on nature and importance resulting from
it. Public or each individual will be allowed to bring legal action at competent court if it
considers that its claim for participation or information is ignored, groundlessly refused or
provided information is inadequate.

presentation of the EMP (Appendix 3)
10:40 a.m. coffee break
10:50 a.m. discussion
Meeting ended at 11:30 a.m.
Summary:       All participants have praised current activities and activities planned
through the EMP. They have emphasized the fact that this is the first plan
of this kind in Republic of Srpska and that the Road Directorate is a kind
of pioneer in such activity. No one had any objections to the EMP.
Mr. Kuvalia (Republic of Srpska Bicycle Association) pointed out the
facts about cyclers safety, their problems while participatinc in traffic
and raised the question on special traffic signs concerning cyclist on the
road.
Miss Samac (Institute for protection. environment and informatics)
acclaimed establishment of the Environmental Unit and planned scope of
its work. Question was raised on modern technologies in asphalt
production like use of tire chips.
Mr. Vejnovic (Defendologist Association) has offered all kinds of help in
the field of activities of the Defendologist Association.
Mr. Stojakovic (Ecological Movement EKO-BANJA LUKA) pointed out
that the EMP is going one step forward in front of future Law on
Environment Protection, which is in the process of passing and that it is
not in any kind of collision with the Law.
21



Mr. Stefanovic (The Regional Environmental Center) underlined the fact
of legislation shortage in the Republic of Srpska and that it is in the
process of production. Difficult situation that we are in and resources
coming from abroad are forcing institutions and credit users to go in front
of the legislation.
Mrs. Karahasanovic (The World Bank) although her passive presence at
the meeting had to point out that the EMP has received high grade at the
World Bank.
Response was given to the question about cyclers and asphalt production,
as follows.
Traffic signs are standardized through international conventions and
agreements. There are about 27.000 traffic signs on the roads of the
Republic of Srpska and a great number of them is under process of
replacement with new ones.
Construction material production activities, like concrete, prefabricated
elements. as well as bituminous materials, are restricted with existing
capacities. There are about 15 asphalt plants in Bosnia and Herzegovina
only and in Republic of Srpska only two are less than three years old.
The rest of the plants are more than 20 years old so we are not able to
talk about utilization of new technologies in such plants. Price of
involvement of any foreign construction contractor in the rehabilitation
of roads and especially in installing new production capacities is very
high compared to the amount of rehabilitation investment.
Reports on this meeting were announced at Independent Radio-Television, Republic of
Srpska Radio-Television and Bel Television on Thursday. 19'h July 2001. Republic of
Srpska Radio-Television signal can be seen on whole territory of Republic of Srpska.
