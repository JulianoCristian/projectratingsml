environmental management plan (EMP)\n            looks at the environmental adversity resulting from the\n            implementation of the Road Management and Safety Project,\n            and, proposes the following mitigation measures. During\n            construction, it is expected that air, water, and noise\n            pollution will occur : existing asphalt plants, stone\n            quarries, and borrow pits will be used to supply, and\n            materials will be transported, which should be covered,\n            and/or sprayed to prevent dust emissions. Construction\n            activities will be limited to daylight working schedules to\n            control noise disturbances. Traffic disruptions will be\n            minimized by an appropriate traffic management plan, through\n            alternative access routes, and installation of road safety\n            signs. Potential water, and soil pollution from improper\n            disposal of waste materials, and contamination, call for\n            waste disposal at selected sites, including appropriate\n            handling, and storage of oil spills, or lubricants.\n            Destruction of crops, and vegetation will occur : a working\n            zone control will be ensured, as will vegetative\n            propagation. During operation, similar measures will ensure\n            air, water, and noise pollution, with additional protective\n            noise barriers, planting hedges along roadsides, and\n            limiting traffic as possible. Compliance with environmental\n            standards, and health, and safety requirements will be ensured."}, "docdt": "2001-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
