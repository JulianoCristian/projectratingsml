           Bosnia-Herzegovina is to improve traffic flow and reduce\n            accident rates on the country's road network. There are\n            two main components. The first component finances road\n            maintenance, rehabilitation, and safety improvements for the\n            main and regional road network, including about 280 km of\n            priority road sections in the Federation of Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina, and about 290 km of priority road sections in\n            the Republic of Srpska. The second component finances the\n            institutional strengthening of the two road directorates\n            (FBHRD and RSRD), including setting up of road and bridge\n            data banks, introducing the use of the Highway Development\n            Model (HDM) for setting road maintenance priorities,\n            supervision for civil works, the use of competitive bidding\n            procedures, familiarization with modern road maintenance\n            technologies, improved financial management systems,\n            establishing environmental units in each of the Road\n            Directorates and to support these units in implementing\n            their Environmental Management Plans (EMPs), staff training,\n            and audits of the project accounts. This component also\n            includes a program of technical support for the\n            Bosnia-Herzegovina Road Infrastructure Public Corporation\n            (BRIC), including establishing improved and uniform road and\n            bridge design, maintenance and construction standards,\n            creation of a road safety database, and conducting safety\n            awareness campaigns."}, "docdt": "2002-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
