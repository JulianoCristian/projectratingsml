A
of
the Project,  an amount equivalent  to €  2,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and 
deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3(a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that 
unless the Association shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount 
equivalent to €  1,000,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Credit Account plus the 
total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association pursuant to Section

paragraph 3(a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Association shall otherwise agree, the 
Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to €  750,000 until the aggregate amount 
of withdrawals from the Credit Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments 
entered into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions  shall be equal to or 
exceed the equivalent of SDR 1,200,000
. 
2.
Payments out of the Special Accounts shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures in 
accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

After the Association has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Accounts have been 
duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Accounts shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Association a request or requests for deposit into the Special Accounts of an amount or amounts which 
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests, the Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit 
into the Special Accounts such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of the Special Accounts, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Association 
requests for deposits into the Special Accounts at such intervals 
as the Association shall 
specify.
(ii)
 Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Association 
the documents and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of 
this Schedule for 
the payment or payments in respect of which 
replenishment is requested. On the basis of 
each such request, the 
Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the 
Credit Account 
and deposit into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall 
have 
Page  16
requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and other evidence to 
have been paid out of the Special Accounts for eligible expenditures. All such 
deposits 
shall be withdrawn by the Association from the Credit Account 
under the respective 
eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent 
amounts, as shall have been justified 
by said documents and other evidence.
4.
For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Accounts, the Borrower shall, at such 
time as the Association shall reasonably request, furnish to the Association such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Association shall not be 
required to make further deposits into the Special Accounts:
(a)
if, at any time, the Association shall have determined that all further withdrawals should 
be made by the Borrower directly from the Credit Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V 
of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
(b)
if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Association, within the period of time 
specified in Section 4.01 (b)(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the 
Association pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and accounts for the Special 
Accounts;
(c)
if, at any time, the Association shall have notified the Borrower of its intention to 
suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account 
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or
(d)
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Credit allocated to the eligible Categories for 
the respective Special Accounts, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered 
into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, 
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Credit 
allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Association shall specify by 
notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the 
Association shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Accounts 
as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.
(a)
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any payment out of  the Special 
Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Association, the Borrower shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Association: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Association may 
request; or (B) deposit into the Special Accounts (or, if the Association shall so request, refund to the 
Association) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or 
justified. Unless the Association shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Association into the 
Special Accounts shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or 
Page  17
refund, as the case may be.
(b)
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in the 
Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Association, refund to the Association such outstanding amount.
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Association, refund to the Association all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
(d)
Refunds to the Association made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of this 
Schedule shall be credited to the Credit Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
