    outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: Training of the staff within\n            the integrated Project Implementation Directorate benefited\n            the entire organization and not only the implementation\n            unit. It enabled organization wide familiarization with\n            modern rules for procurement and disbursement to carry out\n            project operations timely and efficiently. Institutional\n            strengthening and capacity building needed time and hands on\n            supervision even with well motivated staff. Many roads in\n            Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) that now are main roads used to\n            be regional roads, and the regional roads used to be local\n            roads, and, consequently, the characteristics of the\n            classified road network are inadequate. The inference is\n            that maintenance alone is insufficient to support economic\n            reorientation and growth and improve traffic safety; the\n            road network structure needs to be reassessed and rebuilt\n            with appropriate standards as the demand for more transport\n            infrastructure is growing. The Traffic Police must be fully\n            involved in traffic safety work. There are about as many\n            accidents in the urban areas as on the inter-city network,\n            together over 70 percent of the total. The elderly are the\n            most vulnerable group, and the most common cause of\n            collisions is speeding. Therefore, safety work needs full\n            cooperation of the police and the road administrations, and\n            needs to be expanded to cover the urban areas. Effective\n            enforcement requires cooperation between the key entities,\n            the establishment of a lead agency, and the preparation of a\n            strategy to guide the comprehensive response involving all stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2007-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
