Project implementation was delayed by the\n            unsettling economic and political situations especially\n            during the latter part of the project. There were five\n            changes in the government and many changes of key officials\n            within the concerned ministries. There was even a coup\n            d'etat during the final year of the project. Lessons\n            learned from this project include: 1) To address land\n            management issues in Africa, it requires full government\n            commitment and should be addressed with a step-by-step\n            approach beginning with basic building blocks before\n            proceeding to a broader agenda. 2) Reform is more likely to\n            be achieved by focusing on key policy and institutional\n            improvements rather than a broad-based detailed reform\n            agenda. 3) When new agencies are being established there\n            need to be intensive supervision missions, especially at the\n            beginning, to carefully follow up on the agreed work program\n            with the implementing agency. This is especially important\n            during the initial phases of the project and particularly so\n            when a new agency such as AGEF (Land Management Agency) is\n            created. 4) A carefully prepared procurement plan is\n            necessary from the time of appraisal to enable\n            implementation to begin quickly and smoothly."}, "docdt": "2001-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
