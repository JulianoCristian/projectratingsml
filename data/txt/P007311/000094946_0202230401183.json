FIRST HEALTH PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated unsatisfactory.\n            The many activities initiated under the project--and\n            particularly the institutional development interventions,\n            civil works, stocking of health centers--are not sustainable\n            without government support. That support is unlikely given\n            the government's on-going fiscal crisis and lack of\n            institutional commitment. world Bank performance is adjudged\n            unsatisfactory overall: The Bank made a concerted effort to\n            design and supervise the project well, in the face of severe\n            limitiations. However, the Bank demonstrated questionable\n            judgement in the change in orientation of the project and\n            the extension of the closing date. Overall Borrower\n            performance was also rated unsatisfactory: Many positive\n            aspects of the implementing agency 's performance were\n            dwarfed by the overwhelming constraints associated with the\n            political and economic upheaval affecting Haiti during the\n            1990s. Some of the lessons learned are: Under the right\n            conditions, public-private partnerships can help to mitigate\n            institutional constraints. Supply-driven public sector\n            projects cannot overcome systemic constraints. Basic\n            implementation capacity is essential. Governance of\n            acceptable quality and basic implementation capacity are\n            essential for the success of a Bank operation. Small,\n            simple, and well-defined operations will work better than\n            more wide-ranging projects. Changes in the nature of public\n            sector employment may only be realized on a government-wide basis."}, "docdt": "2001-09-06T00:00:00Z"}
