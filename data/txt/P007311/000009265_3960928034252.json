It\n            would specifically : 1) rationalize the allocation of\n            resources for primary health care (PHC) within a more\n            coherent institutional framework, 2) implement, in the\n            Western health region, a Basic Health Services Delivery\n            model (BHSDM), based on the GOH stated PHC policy, and\n            conceived as a framework for all public and private health\n            activities; and 3) support the Acquired Immunodeficiency\n            Syndrome (AIDS) medium term prevention and control program,\n            and the national tuberculosis (TB) control program. These\n            objectives would be supported by 3 key measures : 1)\n            restructuring of the MSPP budget over the project\n            implementation period, 2) increased coordination, dialogue\n            and integration between the private and public sectors, and\n            3) the implementation of personnel recruitment and\n            retirement policies as provided by current legal regulations."}, "docdt": "1989-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
