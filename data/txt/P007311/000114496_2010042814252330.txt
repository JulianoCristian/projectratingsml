(First Health Project)
Amendment
Dear Sir:
I refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the above-referenced Project 
between the Republic of Haiti (the Borrower) and the International Development 
Association (IDA), dated February 2, 1990 (the Credit Agreement).
I am pleased to inform you that IDA agrees to amend the Development Credit 
Agreement for purposes of reflecting changes made in a category of expenditures and in 
the procurement procedures as a consequence of the Ministry of Public Health and 
Population (MSPP) having entered into an agreement with the Pan American Health 
Organization for the latter to act as its procurement agent.  A change is being made, 
also, to enable financing under the Credit of the auditing services of records and 
accounts related to the Project, including the PAHO accounts to be used under the 
Letter of Understanding between IDA and PAHO dated October 18, 1990. Therefore, IDA 
hereby proposes the following amendments to the Development Credit Agreement:
1.
The table in Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Credit Agreement is replaced with 
the table in the attachment to this letter.  The definition of “non-salary operating 
costs” included in paragraph 2 (b) of Schedule 1 is amended to read as follows:
“(b) the term “Salaries of the Project Management Unit” means salaries of 
the 
Director, professional staff and support personnel of the Project 
Management Unit, and the 
term “non-salary operating costs” means: (i) expenditures 
for operation and maintenance of  vehicles financed under Category (4) of the table set 
forth in paragraph 1 above; (ii) 
communications, office supplies and other 
sundries supplies and office maintenance 
expenditures of the Project 
Management Unit; (iii) expenditures for the production and 
printing of forms 
referred to in Part B (f) of the Project; and (iv) the cost of services 
for the 
required audits of records and accounts related to the Project” .
2.
Part C (2) of Schedule 3 is amended as follows:  
“Contracts for goods, including but not limited to medical equipment and 
supplies and  drugs, may be procured through the Pan American Health Organization 
acting as procurement 
agent, under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of 
price quotations solicited, 
whenever possible, from a list of at least 
three qualified suppliers from countries eligible 
under the Guidelines in 
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Association, provided 
that the 
contracts for medical equipment, supplies and drugs do not exceed, in the 
aggregate, the equivalent of US$10,300,000”.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and dating the 
enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to me.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
