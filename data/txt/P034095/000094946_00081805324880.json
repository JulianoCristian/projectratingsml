of the legal, and regulatory\n            framework, conducive to a strong, and stable banking system.\n            However, the timing for the reform process - the supervising\n            agency was being strengthened at the breakout of the\n            financial crisis - hindered the capacity, and experience in\n            banking supervision, thus its sustainability remain\n            uncertain. Lessons reinforce the notion that government\n            commitment to, and ownership of a reform program, as in this\n            case, is conducive to successful results. But as experience\n            suggests, the implementation of a comprehensive reform\n            approach, requires a consistent, and correct sequence of\n            enterprise, and financial sector reform, to avoid, as\n            mentioned above, an erroneous timing which may hamper\n            financial sustainability. Nonetheless, the macroeconomic\n            stability of the Kyrgyz Republic, paved the way to reduced\n            volatility of capital flows, and enhanced the potential for\n            safe financial management, which was instrumental in\n            attracting investments, and facilitated credit risk\n            management. To finalize, strong financial systems require\n            enforcement powers, thus effective banking regulation, and\n            preventive early-warning systems, and instruments for\n            depositors protection, should be in place for effective\n            on-site examination, and off-site surveillance."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
