through the\n            provision of foreign exchange resources to finance imports\n            of inputs, raw materials, spare parts and services; 2)\n            create a competitive, sound and efficient banking system; 3)\n            improve public confidence in financial institutions; 4)\n            foster a health adjustment and renewed growth in the\n            financial sector, which will contribute to the\n            government's stabilization objectives; 5) encourage the\n            development of sound contractual savings organizations; and\n            6) develop technical capacity in banking and financial\n            management and reinforce the implementation of the\n            country's reform program as a whole.  The components of\n            the projects are the following: 1) creation of a policy and\n            regulatory environment conducive to the sound growth of a\n            competitive and efficient private banking system; 2)\n            liquidation of the two dominant and insolvent state-owned\n            banks: Agroprombank and Elbank; 3) downsizing and financial\n            restructuring through private re-capitalization of two large\n            and insolvent former state banks: Promstroi and AKB\n            Kyrgyzstan Banks; 4) creation of a temporary Debt Resolution\n            Agency to help collect, restructure, sell or write-off the\n            old non-performing loans, and thus accelerate enterprise\n            restructuring or liquidation in the process; and 5) creation\n            of a regulatory and supervisory framework, and supporting\n            policies and infrastructure, for the development and growth\n            of emerging non-bank financial institutions."}, "docdt": "1996-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
