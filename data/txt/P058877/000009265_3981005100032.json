The first\n            three components all contain technical assistance, design,\n            and supervision of the investments. The first component,\n            municipal and rural infrastructure, will help restore\n            infrastructure in affected municipalities and rural areas.\n            The second component, flood management and hazard reduction,\n            will repair hydrotechnical infrastructure, modernize flood\n            management system, improve forecasting and planning, and\n            introduce liability and homeowner insurance. Earthquake\n            reconstruction, the third component, will reconstruct\n            household units in affected municipalities and rural areas,\n            provide training and studies to reduce earthquake\n            vulnerability, and introduce liability and homeowner\n            insurance and construction industry liability insurance. The\n            Project implementation unit component will help implement\n            procurement and disbursement activities associated with the project."}, "docdt": "1998-08-24T00:00:00Z"}
