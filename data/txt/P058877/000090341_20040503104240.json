The lessons learned indicate that\n            methodologies are needed for addressing the problem of\n            reconciling damage and needs assessments after a disaster,\n            and tailoring project implementation to the refining of the\n            needs estimate, such as by phasing construction and\n            instituting checkpoints for incremental stages during\n            implementation of construction components. A strong,\n            experienced and independent Project Implementation Unit\n            (PIU) familiar with Bank procedures is especially critical\n            to effective implementation of fast-track emergency\n            projects. Construction supervision by international\n            consultants lent credibility to reconstruction\n            activities-necessary in an environment of distrust of local\n            code enforcement and construction quality. Activities that\n            do not perform well in the early stages of the project, may\n            perform very well later on, as demonstrated by the\n            successful implementation of weather forecasting system. In\n            order to guarantee the sustainability of the apartment\n            blocks and its environment including the landscaping\n            arrangements, site and block management organizations should\n            be established. Specification and monitoring of the\n            interfaces between different contractors and systems is\n            essential. The maximum momentum in an emergency project is\n            normally in the first few months after the disaster. The\n            design of residential sites under emergency construction\n            should recognize that the sites will become permanent\n            settlements and allow for the long-term needs of\n            beneficiaries in the broadest sense, and allow for the\n            higher costs of such an approach. The Bank needs to develop\n            appropriate, operationally-oriented protocols, procedures\n            and design criteria for responding to situations demanding\n            large emergency construction programs, that can be applied\n            soon after a disaster to ensure that design meets the needs\n            of long-term urban development, as well as the short-term\n            emergency needs."}, "docdt": "2004-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
