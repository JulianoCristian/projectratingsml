          assist the Government of Jordan to further develop and\n            implement its medium-term education and training strategy.\n            The project intends to focus on improving the quality,\n            relevance and cost efficiency of education; on institution\n            building; and on strengthening the linkage between\n            education/vocational training and skilled manpower demand.\n            To this end, the project involves improving the quality of\n            basic education; improving the quality of physical\n            facilities and reducing cost per student place; and\n            improving responsiveness of vocational training to labor\n            market needs.  In addition, this project entails\n            strengthening education planning, management, and the system\n            for measurement and evaluation of education quality."}, "docdt": "1987-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
