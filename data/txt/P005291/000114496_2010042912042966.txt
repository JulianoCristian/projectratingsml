                  Re:   Increase in Disbursement Percentages
Excellency:
     The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the
Bank) has decided, pursuant to a new policy designed to assist
borrowers affected by the recent Middle East crisis, to temporarily
increase the Bank's share of the
cost of projects financed under Bank Loans.
     Pursuant to your letter, dated February 2, 1991, we hereby
amend the Loan Agreements between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
and the Bank listed in the Attachment hereto in the manner described
in that Attachment. These amendments will take effect upon receipt
of your confirmation by the Bank and will apply to all withdrawals
of the proceeds of the applicable Loans allocated to the categories
listed in the Attachment made on or after September 1, 1990. For
withdrawals made at the existing disbursement percentages between
September  1, 1990 and the date of receipt of your confirmation, the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan may submit supplemental withdrawal
applications to the Bank for eligible expenditures reflecting the
increased disbursement percentages, subject to the other provisions
of the respective Loan Agreement.
     Subject to the Loan Account being open, this amendment will be
applicable in respect of all withdrawals made by December 31, 1991
or such later date as the Bank may establish.  Thereafter
withdrawals shall be made on the basis of disbursement percentages
determined by the Bank and notified to you.
     Please confirm your acceptance on behalf of the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan of the foregoing amendments to the listed
Agreements by signing and dating the confirmation form on the
enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us for our records.
                         Very truly yours,
                         INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
