MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FOR A SEVENTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan for US$40.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be on standard IBRD terms and would assist in financing a project which would,
within the framework of the Thi^d Five-Year Plan objectives, help improve the
quality and cost efficiency of education, and orient higher education and
vocational training to areas of skilled manpower demand. The Project would be
cofinanced by the European Economic Community (EEC) for US$2.5 million
equivalent.
Background
2.       Jordan has, by regional standards, a well-developed general education
and voz.ational training system. It has achieved universal schooling in
primary education and realized high gross enrollment rates in the lower and
upper secondary education levels, respectively, 90% and 70%. In higher
education, about 25% of the relevant age group is enrolled. Girls currently
represent over 48% of the total number of s.udents, and occupationally-related
education and training has been expanding rapidly in terms of student
enrollments and the number of specializations offered. In 1986, the education
and training sector consumed about 8.5% of the GDP, translating to JD 46.5
(US$118 equivalent) per capita, which is high by regional standards. Jordan
has an impressive record of private sector contribution to education and
vocational training: in 1986, this represented about US$7.5 million. The
share of recurrent expenditures on education in the Government's 1986 budget
was 20%.
3.       Jordan's comparative advantage lies in its well-trained labor force.
The country has been providing skilled manpower, especially in the areas of
engineering, maintenance and contracting, for highly remunerative employment
in the oil-rich states of the Gulf. However, despite the impressive
accomplisnments in the education and training sector and the human resources
area, some important issues remain to be addressed. These include the need
for continuing qualitative improvements; meeting the shortage of physical
facilities; and the need for closer alignment of the education and training
system with the job market.
4.       Since quantitative expansion of education has been satisfied, the
Government's focus has now shifted to improve the quality of instruction



-2-
tnLough teacher upgrading. Although 95% of the basic education teachers have
thc required academic qualifications, they do not necessarily have adequate
instructional skills. The same applies to secondary school teachers, 922 of
whom have either a general university or a community college degree. It is,
therefore, necessary to provide these teachers with training in applied
pedagogical skills. Quality of instruction and learning is also adversely
affected by the shortage of instructional materials and the ineffective use of
the existing materials. Therefrre, increased availability and efficient use
of instructional materials are needed. Shortage of school buildings is also a
major problem. The Government has not been able to provide the school
facilities needed to keep up with the rapidly rising enrollments. It has, as
a result, resorted to renting facilities generally intended for residential
family use. In 1985, about 46% oi compulsory school students were
accommodated ill these rental facilities which are ill-suited for use as
schools. Moreover, changing demands of the labor markets require channelling
of students to appropriate fields to maintain a reasonable manpower
supply/demand ratio, adaptation of curricula and course offerings, and
strengthening of education planning.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.       A thrust of the Government's Third Five-Year Development Plan
(1986-90) is to generate employment and incomes through the development of
labor-intensive, small- and medium-scale manufacturing enterprises and
technica' service firms directed at the export market.  The Bank's lending
strategy for Jordan places heavy emphasis on developing the human resources
necessary t, sustain this strategy as well as to provide the skilled manpower
for the productive sectors. Hence, the proposed Project with its primary
emphasis on the quality of education and training and their relevance to labor
xiiarket needs wotvld constitute an essential element in the implementation of
Jordan's Third Five-Year Plan strategy.
Project Objectives
6.       The overall objective of the proposed Project is to assist the
Government to further develop and implement its medium-term education and
training strategy which is to improve the quality of teaching and learning and
provide a better learning environment at reduced costs per stildent place;
improve physical facilities; reinforce planning and management of education;
and strengthen the linkage between education/vocational training and skilled
manpower demand.
Project Description
7.       Within the framework of the broad objectives provided above, the
Project would:
(a) upgrade the skills of about 30,600 basic education teachers and
staff, would remedy skill deficiencies of secondary school teachers
through the introduction of pedagogical courses; and would increase
the availability of instructional materials as well as train teachers
to use them effectively;



-3-
(b) replace pedagogically unsuitable rented premises with 58
compulsory-level schools, apply the recently revised, cost-effective
accommodation norms and design standards to all compulsory-level
schools to be constructed; improve the planning and use of resources
available for the school maintenance programs;
(c) introduce pilot vocational programs for girls in areas of rapid
employment gro:wth, such as nursing and office technology; initiate
office technology and computer maintenance training courses to help
meet the growing manpower demand ln this area; and adapt community
college curricula and programs to meet labor market needs; and
(d' expand the use ef the existing Management Information System to key
directorates of the Ministry of Education (MOE) to improve the
efficiency of decision making process; establish an integrated system
for measuring student and teacher performance and evaluating the
effects of different combinations of educational inputs on the
quality and cost of education; improve the planning of higher
education to respond more effectively to skilled manpower needs and
financing constraints; and strengthen project implementation capacity.
8.       The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$108.3 million, with
a foreign exchange component of US$47.1 million (44X). The project would be
cofinanced by the EEC which would provide a grant of US$2.5 million. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The
Project, to be implemented over a period of seven years (1988-1994), provides
funds for civil works, furniture, equipment and materials. Amounts and
methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key processing events and the status of IBRD operations in
Jordan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached (IBRD
No. 20618). The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6854-JO, dated November 11, 1987,
is being distributed separately.
Agreed Actions
9.       During negotiations, agreement has been reazhed on the contents,
timetables, and annual review mechanisms of action plans to support project
implementation. The joint reviews include discussions of the assessments to
be conducted on the pilot vocational programs, including those for girls;
recommendations for strengthening the coverage and cost efficiency of school
maintenance; and proposals with regard to the operation and expansion of the
three pilot material resource centers for teachers. The higher education
studies are not part of the Project. However, agreement has also been reached
to hold a joint review of these studies focusing on the size of enrollments,
financing, and relevance of curricula to labor market needs. The Government
has also agreed to: (i' apply the accommodation norms and design standards
used in designing the schools financed under the Project for general
application to the MOE school building program; (ii) ensure that incentives
are adequate to attract the required number of secondary education teachers
and that as of September 1990, out of secondary school teachers to be
appointed, priority would be given to those who have followed an approved
program of pedagogical training as part of their degree courses; and (iii)
introduce a regulation providing seniority and related benefits and privileges
to teachers who complete MOE-approved, job-related training. The Government
has recently introduced this regulation.



-4-
Justification
10.      Under the proposed Project, a practical, on-the-job training program
geared to specific skill development and upgrading needs of ;!Jachers would be
introduced. This in-service training would replace the current practice of
awarding teachers full tuition fellowships to pursue higher-degree programs
for upgrading purposes and paying their salaries as well as thcse of
substitute teachers who replace them. The proposed program would upgrade the
skills of about 30,600 basic education teachers, headmasters and supervisors.
A similar scheme geared to the secondary school teachers would introduce
pedagogical skill training courses. This scheme would both reduce the
training cost and accelerate the upgrading of teachers. The school
construction program would provide 65,400 student places.  Application of the
recently revised accommodation norms and design standards to all
compulsory-level school construction would reduce the average gross area per
student by about 372 and average cost per student place by about 202. In
addition, replacement of the pedagogically-ill-suited temporary rented
facilities with proper classrooms would help improve quality of learning. A
series of studies would provide the basis for adjustments to the existing
higher education policies, programs and firancing mechanisms. In addition,
these studies would help set the framework for improved linkag. between higher
education and the domestic and external labor markets. Moreover, the
introduction of pilot vocational training programs for girls in areas offering
high employment potential would facilitate female integration into the labor
market.  Strengthening of planning and resource management at the Ministry of
Education, together with further development of its testing, measurement and
evaluation system, would improve the quality and cost effectiveness of
education.
Risks
11.      The proposed Project does not pose major risks on the substance of
project components. With respect to implementation, the Government has had an
excellent track record in carrying out Bank-financed projects in the sector.
Nonetheless, a series of detailed action programs and schedules have been
agreed upon with the Government. These programs call for periodic joint
reviews on specified dates as well as implementation of specific follow-up
actions resulting from these reviews.
Recommendation.
12.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
