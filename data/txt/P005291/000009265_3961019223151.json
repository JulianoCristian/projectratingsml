(b) reinforce institution building; and (c)\n            strengthen the linkage between education/vocational training\n            and skilled manpower demand. Bank performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower performance was satisfactory. Key\n            lessons of experience were : (i) the project enjoyed the\n            strong ownership of the Government because it was consistent\n            with Jordan's education reform program and was well\n            designed; (ii) by transferring the teacher training program\n            to the first sector loan the Bank showed appropriate\n            flexibility in modifying the scope of the project to adapt\n            to new developments without diluting a major objective;\n            (iii) studies, in this case the community college study,\n            need to be carefully timed and synchronized with other work\n            being carried out by the Borrower; (iv) the processing\n            timetable for donor cofinancing for technical assistance and\n            subsequent development of terms of reference and contracting\n            arrangements should be determined in advance and monitored\n            to ensure the best results; and (v) the abrupt dissolution\n            of a well functioning and well staffed project\n            implementation unit which is familiar with Bank\n            implementation procedures can disrupt project implementation\n            and result in the non-use of, in this case, a small amount\n            of loan funds on which the government has paid commitment\n            fees and interest charges."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
