Although\n            the overall program cost was in line with anticipation,\n            project implementation took longer than initially expected,\n            The Bank's response time to requests from the West\n            African Development Bank (BOAD) regarding specific\n            subprojects was too slow. BOAD development strategy did not\n            provide a clear vision. The project objectives were vague,\n            without a clear sense of priorities. No attempt was made to\n            define indicators for assessing institutional growth. More\n            importantly, the line of credit was extended at a time when\n            the common currency of the sub-region was clearly\n            misaligned, which created an unfavorable environment for\n            private sector development. Overall, the outcome of the\n            project is rated marginally satisfactory. No specific\n            performance indicators were identified at the time of\n            appraisal by which to measure the project's results\n            but, the major benefits discussed in the Staff Appraisal\n            Report (SAR) have been realized. In the context of policy\n            framework coordination, the Bank team in charge of the\n            proposed project should have included sector specialists, in\n            addition to financial sector specialists."}, "docdt": "1998-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
