MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT AND LOAN
TO
BANQUE OUEST AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (BOAD)
FOR A
THIRD REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit for SDR 32 million (US$40 million equivalent) and a Bank
loan for US$15 million to Banque Ouest Africaine de Developpement -BOAD -
(West African Development Bank) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, and the
proposed loan on standard Bank terms with 20 years maturity. Together,
they would help finance BOAD's lending program over a 3-year period 1990-92
in the member countries of the UTnion Monetaire Ouest Africaine--UMOA (West
African Monetary Union), as well as technical assistance to BOAD.
2.        Background.  BOAD was established in 1974 as the common regional
development bank of the UMOA which c.mprises seven French-speaking African
states: Benin, Burkina Faso, COte d'Xvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal -tnd Togo.
Within the UMOA framework, these countries share a common currency (CFA
Franc) freely convertible into the French Franc at a fixed parity, and a
common Central Bank (BCEAO) responsible for the conduct of the Union's
monetary and credit policies. All seven countries are undergoing, or have
under preparation, structural adjustment programs with Bank Group support.
The BCEAO, in consultation with the Bank and IMF, has formulated and is
implementing a comprehensive and far-reaching reform program inter alia to
liberalize financial and credit policies, restructure the distressed banks,
and improve the efficiency of resource mobilization and allocation in the
Union. As the regional development bank of UMOA, BOAD's role is to
contribute to the economic development and economic integration of its
member countries. It does so mainly by providing term finance both in the
form of loans and equity investments to viable investment projects, and by
undertaking economic, sector and project feasibility studies. BOAD
finances projects of both a regional and national character, in the public
and private sector, in all productive sectors (e.g. rural development,
industry, energy, transport, communications and other infrastructure) to
the exclusion of the social sectors (e.g education, health). Since
starting business in 1976, BOAD has achieved a satisfactory operational
record and built up significant capacity as a development finance
institution. Its financial condition is sound, as reflected in a strong
capital base, adequate liquidity, low indebtedness, and a loan portfolio
with moderate arrears. It has a well-structured organization, good
management, a competent and experienced professional staff, and systematic
operating policies and procedures including those for project appraisal and
supervision. Thus, BOAD is a suitable financial intermediary for
channelling resources to investment projects in the TJMOA member countries.
The Bank Group has maintained a close and productive relationship with
BOAD. Apart from significant technical assistance to help build up BOAD in
its formative years, this has included two lending operations. The first,
an IDA credit of US$3 million (No. 939-WAF) approved in 1981, financed



- 2 -
technical assistance as well as economic, sectoral and project feasibility
studiee. A PCR is under preparation for this credit. The second, a
:omposite IDA credit/Bank loan for SDR 13 million and US$6.1 million
respectively (No. 1331/No. 2242-WAF), has been fully comsitted for
subprojects and technical assistance. Both projects have been implemented
satisfactorily.
3.        Rationale for IDA/Bank Involvement.  The Bank Group played a
constructive role in helping BOAD start up and subsequently evolve into a
sound and effective regional development bank. The continuation of Bank
Group support both financially and through advice and technical assistance
will enable BOAD in the years ahead to expand its lending activity in
response to the pressing investment requirements of the UMOA countries, as
well as to further build up its institutional strength. The thrust of
BOAD's activities, namely the furthering of the economic integration of its
member countries, is consistent with a major Bank Group objective in
Africa. In that sense, the proposed operation would form part of a broader
Bank Group effort to support selected schemes and organizations involved in
intra-African cooperation and economic integration. The catalytic effect
of Bank Group lending would also facilitate BOAD's efforts to mobilize
additional external resources including its first attempt at foreign
commercial borrowing.
4.        Proiect Obiectives.  A major objective of the proposed project
is to enable the Bank Group, through BOAD as an intermediary, to contribute
to the provision of investment finance to a broad spectrum of viable
development projects in the 7 resource-poor UMOA countries, thus helping to
strengthen the supply response needed to support the structural adjustment
reforms underway in these countries. Such projects would be of a size
(US$3-l1 million in project costs; US$1-4 million in subloan amounts) too
small for direct Bank Group lending in a cost-effective manner. Another
important objective is to help BOAD achieve further institutional growth
particularly in enhancing the developmental impact of its operations.
Specifically. BOAD's Development Strategy agreed under this operation calls
for: (a) an intensification of its promotional activities, in particular
for those projects that contribute to regional economic integrationt (b) a
shift in its lending policy in favor of private sector investments:
(c) measures to ensure that BOAD will adequately address the environmental
impact of the projects assisted by it, including the formulation of
satisfactory guidelines and staff training to that end; (d) the !-ttiation
of a study toward the establishment in UMOA countries of grass-roots
banking institutions based on cooperative and mutualist principles, and
the lead role which BOAD could play in that process; (e) a study toward the
development of an effective leasing industry in the UMOA and the
prospective role to be played by BOAD therein; and (f) BOAD's first attempt
at borrowing from the international capital market on commercial terms, as
a means of diversifying its resources. Other institution-building measures
include arrangements for bringing BOAD's interest rates substantially in
line with the UMOA domestic market rates and a comprehensive portfolio
review to determine an appropriate level of provisions and steps to further
strengthen the portfolio management system.

5.        Proiset Description.  The proposed project would provide BOAD
with a composite line of credit comprising an IDA component (US$39 million
equivalent) for onlending to investment projects in the 6 IDA-eligible
countries (lenin, Burkir,a taso, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo), and an IBID
component (US$15 million) for onlending in CMte d'Ivoire. Eligible
beneficiary enterprises iould be in both the private and public sectors, of
a regional as vell as a national scope, in all productive economic
activities, e.g. agriculture, industry, energy, transport, communications
and other infrastructure. The line of credit is expected to cover
approximately one-fifth of BOAD's lending program for a 3-year period up to
end-1992 projected at US$270 million equivalent, and about one-third of
BOAD's estimated borrowing requirements. A technical assistance component
of US$l million equivalent included in the IDA credit would finance
economic, sector and project feasibility studies and specialized
consultants' services. A Staff Appraisal Report No. 8036-APR of December
27, 1989, is attached.
6.        Aareed Actions.  BOAD has adopted a Statement of Development
Strategy covering the 1990-92 period outlining its major developmental
objectives including those referred to in paragraph 4 above. BOAD has
agreed on the following main steps, (a) to start by June 1990 a study on
the modalities for setting up in the UMOA region of new banking
institutions based on cooperative and mutualist principles; (b) to initiate
another study by June 1990 on the prospects for developing the leasing
business in UMOA countriest tc) to borrow aoout US$20 million during 1990-
91 from the international capital market on commercial terms; and td) to
adopt a revised interest rate system wherebys ti) commercially-oriented
investments including all private sector projects will be charged UMOA
domestic commercial banking rates of up to 16? p.a.; and (ii) non-
commercial, development-oriented operations undertaken by the public sector
will be charged a lower rate set at a level sufficient for BOAD to recover
its full cost (8.82 p.a.), with the subsidies (2.4t p.a.) coming
exclusively from the member countries themselves.
7.        Benefits.  The line of credit under the proposed project would
provide the additional resources needed to enable BOAD to achieve its next
3-year lending program which is expected to generate investments totalling
over US$500 million. Subprojects to be financed, although not pre-
identified, will have minimum economic and financial rates of return of
12X. The technical assistance component, and more generally the
continuation of Bank Group involvement, will help BOAD achieve further
institutional growth, particularly in implementing its Development
Strategy, thus enhancing its economic impact and its contributions to the
UMOA's economic integration. The studies on cooperative and mutualist
banks, and on the development of the leasing business, are expected to
yield significant potential benefits in terms of deepening the UMOA
financial system. Lending to BOAD as a regional development bank whose
geographic area covers 7 countries would also enable the Bank Group to
achieve economies of scale compared with lending separately to national
financial intermediaries the majority of which, in the present UMOA
situation, are facing financial and other difficulties which restrict their
intermediation capacity.



- 4 -
8.        Risks.  No particular risks are envisioned except possible
financial difficulties of some UMOA countrie., which could adversely affect
their future debt servicing capacity and hence the quality of BOAD's loan
portfolio. This risk, however, appears no greater than for the Bank
Group's own lending in the same coantries, and is mitigated by the
structural adjustment reforms underway in the member countries, and b1
BOAD's close supervision of subprojects.
9.        Recomendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit and
loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the
Bank and recormend that the Executive Directors approve the project.
