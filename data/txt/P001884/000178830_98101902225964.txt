INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
INTERNATIO4AL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
FOR A LOAN AND CREDIT TO MAURITIUS FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.         I suibmit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$3.5 million and on a proposed Development
Credit for the equivalent of US$3.5 million to Maurititus, to helD finance
an education project. The credit would be cn standard IDA terms. The Bank
Loan, which would be utilized after the credLt, would be for 25 years, in-
cluding a 10-year grace period, with interes: at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         A renort, "Mauritius - 4-Year Development Plan - an Assessment"
(AE-30a) in three volumes, was circulated on November 22, 1972 (R72-240).
A memorandum on Recent Economic Developments and Prospects (268a-MAS) was
circulated to the Executive Directors on March 13, 1974. Country data are
provided in Annex I.
3.         Ilauritius is a small island, densely populated and heavily dependent
on one crop: sugar. For decades, it was considered a typical case of the
vicious circle of underdevelopment: population pressure on land was asso-
ciated with a stagnation of investment and output; the very limited size of
the national market seemed to prevent the establishment of domestic indus-
tries; the vagaries of weather, and the generally unfavorable outlook for
sugar demand at that time, inhibited attempts at increasing production and
reducing unemployment.
4.         The present outlook is much more encouraging, and Mauritius may
soon be viewed as a case of a rapidly developing cotntry which capitalizes
on the availability of cheap labor. After two decades of stagnation,
Mauritiuis is exneriencing ranid economic growth. Family planning programs
have been a major success, and the rate of population growth declined to
1.8 percent in 1972. The Government's effort to create new production and
employment opportunities through the development of export based, labor
intensive industries and tourism has achieved an impressive beginning.
Sugar prices have improved, and prospects for futurc development are
favorable. During 1970-72, real GDP grew by an annual average of 6 percent,
while national income grew by 6.4 percent and 12.5 percent in 1971 and 1972
respectivelv. The number employed went up by about 15,000 in the last three
years, mostly in industry and tourism, and the rate of investment rose from
16 percent in 1969 to 19 percent in 1972. Though the economy is still
heavilv dependent on sugar, manufacturing and services (including tourism)
increased output at a rate of 9 percent per annum, thus contributing close
to 30 percent of GDP growth in this period.



5.         In December 1971, the Government adopted a Four-Year Plan (1971 to
1975) for social and economic development. The principal objectives as stated
in the plan and modified since are: Further development of the sugar industry,
diversification of the economy to create substantial emplovment, particularly
in export oriented, labor intensive industry and tourism, and the imorovement
of training and education, and family planning services. The plan aimns at
a GDP growth rate of 7 percent per year and an increase in tne rate of' invest-
merit to 27 percent in 1975. This program is well conceived and addresses
itself to the basic production and employmen- problems faced by the Mauritian
economy; the Government's performance in pursuing those objectives has been
impressive.
6.         The diversification of the economy is a primary objective of Miauritius,
both within agriculture and in creation of other industrial activities. Sugar
still accounts for about 30 percent of national income and over 90 Dercent of
commo(lity exports.  However, though output increased substantially in 1972
and 1973, ard export prices rose by 40 percent, all activities related to
sugar contributed only about 25 percent to the grow7th of real GDP in the last
thrce Years; the denendence of the economy on sugar is thus being ,progres-
sively - though slowly - reduced. Future prospects for diversification within
agriculture include the development of groundnuts, vegetables and traditional
crops like ginger, and a livestock industry based on sugar cane by-products.
Outsicle agriculture, immediate possibilities for diversification are in
manufacturing and tourism.
7.         Absorptive capacity and availability of financial resources are
both possible constraints to economic development.    However, the steps taken
by the Mauritians in establishing new institutions and improving existing
developmental institutions, such as a planning office and a development bank,
in mobilizing external technical assistance and in training 'Mauritians, would
indicate that absorntive capacity is not likely to be a serious impecliment
to growth.  Other constraints, particularly finiancial constraints, might
operate before absorntive capacity comes into play.
8.         hlithierto, development has been financed mostlv from domestic
resources and in thiis regard both domestic policies and the improvement in
the international sugar price lhave made effective contributions. In 1972,
the (lomestic savings rate was 22 percent as compared to the investment rate
of 19 percent.   Thlis rate of savings was made possible because (a) the salary
structure of civil servants was frozen from 1968 to 1971, thus permitting
some Government savings; (b) wages in the sugar sector did not follow the
improvement in sugar prices; (c) price stability encouraged private saving.
9.        'There has in the last year been pressure on the public and private
sectors to distribute the gains of economic improvement more equitably.
Partl- as a measure to retain and attract skilled and qualifiedl peonle to
Government and partly as a redistributive measure, public sector salaries
were increased on the average by 30 percent in 1973. There has been a similar
increase in wages in the private sector.   Thiough some increases in wages



3-
were justified, the magnitude was such that inflationary pressures resulted.
Consumer prices rose by 28 percent in 1973, and merchandise imports increased
bv about 44 percent. The current account of the balance of pavments showed
no surplus in 1973, as comnared to a surplus of about $15.0 million in 1972.
The Government has taken a number of anti-inflationary measures to restrict the
level of aggregate demand. New taxes have been introduced, adding about 15
percent to Government current revenues, and credit restrictions have been
imposed.
10.        The question of income distribution will remain central in the
future. The recent economic expansion has been accompanied by a relative
deterioration in the share of wages and salaries in national income. They
accounted for 53 percent of GNP in 1972 as compared to 59 percent in 1968.
It is, however, almost inevitable in the early phases of a sharp upswing in
the rrice of sugar, in an economy so heavily dependent on this commodity,
that the share of wages and salaries in the national income should experience
a decline. The distribution of investments and the Government's fiscal
policies will plav a crucial role. Insofar as future investments emphasize
the creation of new job opportunities, the income clistribution situation
should improve. HTowever, Mauritius, along with many other developing countries,
has Eeatures in its economic policy which discriminnte in favor of capital
intensive techniques, including low interest rates, favorable depreciation
rules and generous tax exemDtions. Future economic policy will need not
only to focus on continued high rates of domestic savings to finance invest-
ments to benefit a large number of people, but also to correct some of the
biases which favor capital intensity.
11.        The contribution of capital inflows in supplementing the domestic
savings effort has been modest. Over the five years since Independence
(1969-73), annual gross public capital inflow averaged 1)S$4.3 million, of
which $1.9 million was in grant form and $2.4 million in loans. In 1969-70
and 1970-71, Hlauritius also made use of about US$2.7 million of SDRs each
year.  The U.K. has provided over 91 percent of grant funds and 80 percent
of the loans. The U.S., Australia, thie European Economic Commuinity and the
World Food Program have been the other contributors of grant aid, principally
in the form of food, while IDA has been the source of most of the remaining
20 percent of loans. In addition, there has been a recorded annual private
capital inflow averaging US$1.4 million over the same five-year period. There
are indications, however, that until quite recently there was in fact a net
outflow of private capital, not recorded in the balance of payments figures.
In future there will be a substantial need for external assistance if M4auritius
is to ensure long-tern social and economic development through the intended
step-up in investment.
12.        Official foreign exchange reserves went up from US$13 million to
IJS$67 million between the end of 1967 and the end of 1973. This is equiv-
alent to about 6 months of imports. Recent petroleum price increases are
expected to add abouit US$9 million per year to the import bill, but with
the expected capital inflow and good prospects for exports in the coming



- 4 -
vears, reserves should still rise despite the expected increase in imports
required for the investment program. At the end of 1973 external public
debt wvas $32.9 million, of which the Bank Grou- share represented about
25.7 rercent. Service naynents amounted to S3.1 million (of whicn about one-
sixth was to the Bank Group), equivalent to 1.S percent of foreign exchange
earningls during the year. By 1985 the Bank Groun share in debt and debt ser-
vice is exnected to be about 25 percent.  Given satisfactory economic per-
forrmance and not unfavorable developmertts in sugar prices, M-5auritius snould
be a;ble to service a liTmited amount of conventional borrowing without the
debt hurden exceeding manageable linits.
PART II - BAINK GROUP OPERATIONS IN IIAURITIUS
13.        The Bank made a loan of U,.$7 million to Mauritius in 1963 for a
power :roject, before the Island gained independence in 1968. This loan,
gtuaranteed by the UJnited Kingdom, has been fully disbursed. Since then,
four TDA credits totalling US$16.7 million were made, one for agriculture
in ATpril 1971 (US$5.2 million - Tea Development Authoritv), two for industrial
(developiment in June 1972 (US$3.5 million - DeveloTpment Bank of Mauritius) and
in June 1973 (US$4.0 million - Industrial Estates), and one for rural develop-
ment in July 1973 (US$4.0 million). In addition, the Bank has made two loans
to Mlauritius in April 1974, one of US.$10.0 million for a port pro_ect and one
of S5.0 million for a second development hank project.  IFFC made a loan of
US$600,000 in June 1971 for the construction of two be^ch hotels.  Annex II
contains a surmmary statement of the Bankc loan, IDA credits and IF( investments,
as of Mfay 31, 1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing, projects.  Except
for the tea Project, which is facing certain problems, described ir. greater
detail in Annex II, project execution has been excellent.
14.        The Ban, Croun's lending Drogra-n reflects Covernment priorities -
particularlv economic diversification and th e provision of the prerequisites
for e-nlovment *cneration outside sugar. Thc proposed project would he the

PART III - EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN MAURITIUS
15.        Nauritiiis has achieved virtually universal primary education, with
86 Percent of childlren aged 5-11 enrolled.  The drop-out rate is low, the
pupil-teacher ratio is satisfactory and only 10 percent of teachers are not
qualified hv Government standards.  More than 90 percent of pupils attend
either free public schools or private schools with Government aid. There is,
however, a high failure rate (63 percent in 1969) in the school leaving
examination partly due to the academic orientation of teachers, the high
incidence of unsatisfactory physical facilities and double-shift operations
and language and cultural problems in this multilingual society.
16.        At the secondary level, the enrollment ratio is only 30 percent
of the relevant age group and barely 6 percent of the total secondary enroll-
ment attend the four high quality Government secondary schools. About 80
percent are enlrolled in private schools and about 13 percent in Government
"'aided" schools.  Less than 1 percent find places in the Government-run lower
secondary schools where practical training is given. Among the serious
problems facing secondary education, the following are the most important:
a) the lack of effective control over private schools; b) the incidence of
trnoualified teachlers, particularly in private schools; c) the high drop-out
rates in Private schools; and d) the academic orientation, directed to the
Cambridge School Certificate examination.
17.        At the higher education level, the enrollment ratio falls to barely
1.5 percent of the relevant age group, partly due to the fact that until 1965
Mlauritius did not have a University. It can be expected that demand for higher
education will increase now that the University is established. Current enroll-
ment is 1,3(0. Courses offered at the University include primarily practical
subjects, e.g., agriculture, sugar technology, engineering, public adminis-
tration and business management.
18.        Technical training is given at the Industrial Trade Training Center
(ITTC), John F. Kennedy College and at lower secondary schools, but the total
enrollment is still under 2,000 although there are certain specialist train-
ing schemes operated by Government departments.   Applications for admission
are approximately three times the number of places available at the lower
secondarv schools and output is inadequate to meet needs for skilled industrial
workers and other trained manpower.   In addition, non-formal technical training
takes place under apprenticeship schemes run by private industries and some
agricultural training is being provided under programs for young farmers.
19.        In 1972-73, Ministry of Education recurrent expenditure on education
was about US$8 million, compared with a private sector figure of about
US$3 million. Total educational expenditure is approximately 4 percent
of GDP. Public expenditure on education is 11.7 percent of total public
expencliture and Government recurrent educational expenditure is 14.6 percent
of total public recurrent expenditure. These figures are low when compared
with other countries at a similar stage of development.



20.       At present, the main strengths of the educational system are:
a) comparatively high enrollment ratios at both primary and secondary levels;
b) higai academic standards at a few select Government-run secondary schools;
c) the existence of non-formial and apprenticeship schemes for both rural and
industrial skills; and d) the high value placed on education by Mauritians.
However, despite these achievements, the sector suffers from a nubner of
weaknesses:
a)   As a result of the theoretical emphasis of the examinations,
graduates are not equipped with practical training and
experience to enable them to be productively engaged in
Mauritius' expanding manu'acturing industries and in agri-
culture. Facilities for the teaching of science and pre-
vocational courses are inadequate; and moderr methods of
teaching are rarely used. While there are a significant
number of unemployed school leavers with general education,
the shortages of skilled and middle-level technicians persist
and are becoming acute.
b)   Government academic and administrative control over private
schools which account for about 95 percent of the total
secondary enrollment is almost non-existent. The quality
of education is particularly poor in the "non-aided" private
schools which account for some 80 percent of the total
secondary enrollment and often have unsuitable rented
premises.
c)   Facilities for agricultural and rural training are not
sufficiently developed.
These shortcomings constitute serious constraints on Mauritius' development,
as shortages exist in higher and middle level manpower, especially in manu-
facturing, construction, trade and transportation.
21.       Government educational policy includes among its objectives:
a) equality of educational oportunity; b) free universal primary education;
c) a secondary school and vocational training enrollment of 60 percent of
the 15-19 aoe group by 1980; and d) a balanced curriculum giving more weight
to science and practical subjects.   In the non-formal training area, the
Government intends to: a) develop a rural educational system to complement
the planned diversification of agriculture; and b) integrate non-formal ap-
prenticeship schemes in urban areas into the form.al structure by eliminating
examination rigidities and by expanding facilities for skill training.
22.       The Government strateoy is primarily aimed at reorganization and
rationalization of the educational system to reflect M4auritius' changing
needs in industry and agriculture. Apart from significant on-the-job train-
ing, the chief source of trained manpower to support industrial development
is from the UNDP/IL0 assisted Industrial Trade Training Center which, although
competently operated, is too small to supply industry's needs; therefore, a



-7-
second center is planned to help alleviate the shortage of craftsmen. A
further step to provide training for industry includes modernization of the
secondary schools' curriculum so as to focus on scientific and practical
subjects. A survey of private secondary schools has indicated the impractic-
ability of providing each school with workshops, laboratories and equipment
for relevant teaching; accordingly, it is planned to construct laboratory and
workshop centers strategically sited so that each would service a cluster of
secondary schools in an efficient and economical manner. Consideration is
being given to the fees that could be charged to private schools for use of
these facilities. Simultaneously, a greater control of private schools, re-
placement of the poorer ones and their gradual takeover by Government is
envisaged. A special committee, the Ramphul Committee, was appointed in
1973 to review and make recommendations regarding the reorganization of pri-
vate secondary education. The Borrower has agreed to consult with the As-
sociation on the measures proposed to be taken in the light of the findings
of this Committee (Section 4.04 of the Credit Agreement).
23.       As a first step towards replacing weak private schools, early con-
struction of a limited number of lower secondary schools is required. They
would be sited in rural areas where educational opportunities at this level
are minimal and where special emphasis would be accorded to their development
so as to prepare graduates for expected employment opportunities.
24.       In further support of the long-term strategy for development out-
lined in the Development Plan, 1971-75, in which unemployment is listed as
the most critical problem of the economy, Rural Education Centers are to be
established adjacent to selected primary schools. They would provide short
intensive agricultural and rural craft courses for adults and young people
and would support Government's agricultural diversification policy and prepare
school leavers for self-employment in farming.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The project proposed for BANK - IDA financing was appraised in
November/December 1973. A report entitled "Mauritius - Appraisal of an Educa-
tion Project", (No. 412a-MAS) dated July 2, 1974, is being circulated to
the Executive Directors separately, and a project summary is included as
Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington from June 11 to 14, 1974.
The Mauritius Government's delegation was headed by Mr. R. Pyndiah, Financial
Secretary, and included Mr. Murday, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education.
Description
26.       The project would assist the Government's efforts to reorganize
the education sector and would put greater emphasis on practical scientific
and agricultural subjects. The project would in particular support the
following objectives: broadening secondary schools curricula, expanding
industrial and vocational training, developing rural education and support-
ing the Government's efforts to increase control over private schools. It
consists of:



a)   Construction of and furniture and equipment for:   i)
six centers for science laboratories and workshops to
be used communally by private schools, which will
provide 2,300 additional student places; ii) six new
lower secondary schools, providing 3,300 additional
places; iii) an Industrial Trade Training Center
(ITTC), with 200 new places; and iv) five Rural
Educational Centers (RECs), with 400 new places.
b)   the provision of about 18 man-years of specialist ser-
vices and 5 man-years of fellowships for initial ITTC
staff and the Program Implementation Unit (PIU).
27.       The project would provide improved facilities for about 20 percent
of the 1980 total secondary enrollment and would double skill-training
capacity and increase non-formal rural education by 150 percent. It would
assist the curriculum improvements and examination reform promoted by the
Institute of Education by providing adequate facilities for the teaching of
practical subjects in both private and public schools.
Project Implementation
28.       An Institute of Education was established recently with assistance
from UNDP and the United Kingdom. The Institute will be the focal point for
reforms in education and will conduct research and formulate specific plans
for the introduction of examination reform, revised curricula and teaching
methods. In addition, the Institute will provide training for secondary
school teachers. The Borrower has agreed to consu'lt with the Association
regarding the program of the Institute (Section 4.06 of the Credit Agree-
ment). The Government would establish a Program Implementation Unit (PIU),
within the Ministry of Education, with overall responsibility for the Govern-
ment's educational development program of which the proposed project is a
major part. Key staff of the PIU will be a P'rogram Manager, an architect/
civil engineer and a procurement specialist, all full-time, whose appointment
and terms of reference would be determined in consultation with the Bank
Group. Owing to resource limitations at the Ministry of Works, an outside
consultant is expected to be engaged for design work and preparation of con-
tract documents. Actual construction will be carried out under contract by
the Government's Development Works Construction (DWC), an institution es-
tablished by Government in 1970 to execute labor-intensive works as part of
its uniemployment relief program and which has since then acquired considerable
exper-ience in school construction. The Mauritanian Government has agreed
that it would cause DWC to employ on a full-time basis an adequate number
of civil engineers to manage the construction of facilities included in the
projec-t (Section 3.05 of the Credit Agreement). Project implementation is
expected to take about five years.

Project Costs and Financing
29.       The total cost of the proposed project including duties and taxes
($0.38 million) is estimated at US$11.6 million, of which US$7.4 million
will be in foreign exchange. A breakdown of costs is given below:

30.       The proposed IDA Credit and Bank Loan would finance 63 percent of
total project costs excluding taxes, the remainder being borne by the Mauritian
Government. The proposed Credit and Loan would assist in financing all project
components except technical assistance, for which the Government has approached
bilateral sources.
Procurement and Disbursement
31.       Construction materials, building components, instructional equip-
ment and furniture would be procured in bulk and contracts would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines. Domestic manufacturers would be awarded a margin of preference
equivalent to the existing customs duty applicable or 15 percent of the
c.i.f. price, whichever is lower.
32.       Disbursement from the Credit and Loan accounts would be on the
basis of: 25 percent of expenditures for civil works, representing the
estimated foreign expenditure components for items such as construction
machinery, transport vehicles, spareparts, fuel and lubricants, but exclud-
ing construction materials and building components; foreign expenditures
for construction materials and building components; foreign expenditures,
or if produced locally, the ex factory price, for furniture and instructional
equiprient; 40 percent of architectural consultants' services, representing
the estimated foreign expenditure component; and foreign expenditures in-
curred by the Program Implementation Unit.

Benefits and Justification
33.       As a result of the project, education in Mauritius would have a
more practical emphasis which would help meet the rapidly increasing demand
for skills. By the early eighties, the schools and centers included in the
project would provide abouit half the total institutional supply of craftsmen
and skilled workers and about 75 percent of the secondary schocls graduates
with E. practical background.  With improved facilities, curricLla and teach-
ing methods, the contribution of training to productivity is expected t1o be
substantial. In addition, the project would reduce socio-economic disparities
by: a) assisting the expansion of secondary education in rural areas; b)
promoting the improvement of the private educational sector; and c) developing
progrzms tailored to students who will eventually become self-employed farmers.
Half the student places created will be in small towns or rural areas, and,
of the rest, the principal beneficiaries will be those poorer urban farailies
whose only access to education is currently through the private schools.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUllORITY
34.       The draft Loan Agreement between Maurituis and the Bank, the
draft Development Credit Agreement between Mauritius and the Association,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (ii4) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, the Recommendation of the Commitee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of. Agreement of the
Association and the text of the resolutions approving the proposed loan and
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
35.       In addition to the special features concerning implementation of
the project described in paragraph 31 of this report, attention is drawn to

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION   1/
Credit 239-MAS - Mauritius Tea Development Authority Project:   S5.3 million
Credit of April 9, 1971; Closing Date: December :31, 1977
This project constitutes the second phase of Mauritius' tea develop-
ment program. Project field development is satisfactory, but the Mauritius
tea industry has experienced a number of problems.   These result firstly from
the deteriorating world market prices which, combined with increases in cost
of labor, make the production of tea less favorable than expected at appraisal,
and secondly from the reluctance of labor to work in the rather isolatedl and
damp tea growing area. The total area to be developed under the project has
been reduced from 5,000 to 3,000 acres: this in turn has reduced the factory
requirements during the project period. Despite this reduction, project
costs are estimated to be some 25 percent above appraisal estimates. Although
prospects for the next five years are somewhat brighter, since Mauritius has
succeded in making arrangements to sell most of its tea production, the
Government has decided to undertake a comprehensive review of the future of
the tea industry. This review is expected to be carried out in shortly.
Credit 313-MAS - Development Bank of Mauritius Project; $3.5 million
Credit of June 23, 1974:   Closing Date; June 30, 1976:
As of June 30, 1974, projects amounting to $3.33 million had been
approved.
Credit 411-MAS - Industrial Estate Project; $4.0 million Credit of
June 29, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1980:
Construction work began in July 1973 and is proceeding ahead of
schedule.
Credit 419-MAS - Rural Development Project; $4.0 million Credit of
July 9, 1973; Closing Date: February 29, 1976:
Work began in July 1973 and is progressing satisfactorily. Some
delays are, however, being encountered with respect to bench terracing due
to leck of expertise in terrace layout and difficulties in identifying suit-
able areas for bench terracing since much of the suitable land has been
leased out for sugar production given the prevailing high sugar prices.   The
possibilities of designating alternative areas; for bench terracing are
currently being investigated.
I/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.
