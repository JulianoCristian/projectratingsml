the\n            transport sector.The principal components of the project\n            are: (a) rehabilitation of about 500 km of roads; (b)\n            establishment of a routine maintenance service; (c)\n            training; (d) improvement of the ferry service at key\n            crossings; and (e) assistance with management of the sector\n            to MTT and MOPCU.The project would benefit the country by\n            reopening roads neglected since independence, and by\n            reducing transport costs on 500 km of roads."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
