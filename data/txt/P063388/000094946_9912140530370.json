However,\n            significant risks are involved, namely radical changes in\n            public health financing, which require long term structural,\n            and political reform commitments. The project components are\n            included in three parts: 1) Part A, the enrollment data,\n            will identify the eligibility criteria, based on different\n            poverty measures, and includes a questionnaire design for\n            on-site surveys. The enrollment database of uninsured poor\n            will be established, with adequate systems to implement\n            regular updates. The design, and distribution of\n            identification cards for beneficiaries, will be achieved,\n            including a communications campaign to the targeted\n            population, and network providers. 2) Part B, will establish\n            the legal framework for the proposed health insurance,\n            identifying a fiscally affordable health benefits package,\n            and alternative health plans. Network providers will be\n            selected from the public, and private sectors, and payments\n            systems will be designed. 3) Part C, will prepare activities\n            for long-term sustainability, and will support monitoring\n            and evaluation of project indicators, administered by the\n            Coordination Unit."}, "docdt": "1999-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
