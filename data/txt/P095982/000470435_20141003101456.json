Distribution\n            and Transmission Improvement Project for Pakistan were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            unsatisfactory. The key lesson learned was to link critical\n            institutional reform on social and environmental safeguards\n            with the Project\u0092s progress. Institutional reform on social\n            safeguards, particularly on compensation payments, remains\n            critical to the DISCOs functioning as modern, efficient\n            entities embodying good practices on social issues. There\n            needs to be a greater upfront assessment of appetite for\n            reform and a systematic system to implement and monitor them."}, "docdt": "2014-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
