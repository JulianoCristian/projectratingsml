                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the APL1 project are to: (i) strengthen the capacity of the distribution and transmission networks to meet increasing electricity demand in the selected
                         areas more efficiently and with better reliability and quality; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity of the selected distribution companies and support other priority
                         areas of the power sector reform.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since effectiveness in December 2008, Project implementation was slower than planned due to various challenges: (a) a large number of implementing agencies (IAs) with no

                         experience of working on Bank financed projects; (b) weak implementation capacity especially in the initial years; (c) an aggressive plan to implement the Project within 3.5 years
                         after effectiveness -- distribution rehabilitation projects of this nature normally require 5-6 years to be completed; etc. However, the Project is very relevant for the current state of
                         affairs in the power sector, and upgrading the distribution networks - a key Objective of the Project - remains a high priority for the Government and IAs.

                         Project implementation has been slower than planned, and a portion of the project activities (particularly the distribution network investments) cannot be completed before the original
                         closing date of June 30, 2012.

                         The pace of implementation has improved since June 2011, the pace of improvement is maintained, and there is visible progress in capacity building, procurements and
                         disbursements. Specifically, Project Development Objectives (PDOs) continue to be achievable, and implementation capacity has been significantly strengthened.

                         The Government (jointly with IAs) has submitted a Restructuring Plan for the Project. This Plan aims to complete the revised Project scope in a reasonable time frame, and includes
                         actions to monitor the pace of implementation at regular intervals. The Plan also requests cancellation of US$ 62 million (equivalent) from the Loan and Credits, and an extension in
                         the closing date up to December 2013. This Plan has been accepted by the Bank.
