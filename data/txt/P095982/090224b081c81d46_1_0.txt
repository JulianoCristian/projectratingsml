                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the APL1 project are to: (i) strengthen the capacity of the distribution and transmission networks to meet increasing electricity demand in the selected
                         areas more efficiently and with better reliability and quality; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity of the selected distribution companies and support other priority
                         areas of the power sector reform.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The Government and the Implementing Agencies (IAs) continue to accord high priority to Objectives of the Project - to enhance the capacity of four distribution companies (HESCO,
                         IESCO, LESCO and MEPCO) and the transmission company (NTDC) to meet increasing electricity demand with greater efficiency, reliability and quality; and to strengthen their

                         While overall progress under the Project remains slower than planned, the pace of implementation continues to improve. The level of commitments (contract signed) has reached
                         80% of the revised Loan/Credit amount, and about 62% has been disbursed. However, the IAs need to continue to enhance the pace of commitments, and in particular

                         disbursements from the Loan and Credits. The IAs also continue to make progress in achieving the Performance and Monitoring indicators for the Project.

                         There is a need for further cancellations from the Loan and Credits, as contracts amounting to around US$ 35 million have not yet been awarded, and will therefore not be completed
                         by the revised Closing Date - February 28, 2014. These include contracts with an estimated cost of around US$ 20 million for LESCO, about US$ 4 million for MEPCO, about US$ 5
                         million under the Government's TA component, and around US$ 5 million in un-programmed amounts. The mission has agreed with the Government on a time-frame for submission
                         of a request to cancel these amounts from the Loan and Credits.

                         All IAs have started compiling data on the results -- i.e. sub-projects completed -- which have been achieved under the Project. These include, inter alia: (a) the completion of six new
                         grid stations; (b) conversion, augmentation or extension of 16 existing grid stations; (c) commissioning of about 15 transmission lines to connect those grid stations to the networks;
                         and (d) conversion, augmentation and/or extension of a further 16 grid stations by June 2013.
