                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the APL1 project are to: (i) strengthen the capacity of the distribution and transmission networks to meet increasing electricity demand in the selected
                         areas more efficiently and with better reliability and quality; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity of the selected distribution companies and support other priority
                         areas of the power sector reform.

                         The Project has been restructured, in accordance with the Restructuring Plan submitted by the Government in June 2012. Amendment Letters - to cancel US$ 62 million equivalent

                         were prepared by the Bank in June 2012 and sent to the Government and the IAs for countersignature. In parallel, on June 29, 2012 the Bank extended the Closing Date of the
                         Project to February 28, 2014. Following the Government's and the IAs' countersignature of the Amendment Letters on October 12, 2012, the Restructuring of the Project was
                         completed. The Bank team and the IAs are therefore working with (and on) the revised Project scope and completion schedule.

                         While overall progress under the Project remains slower than planned, the pace of implementation continues to improve. The level of commitments (contract signed) is more than
                         75% of the revised Loan/Credit amount, and about 50% has been disbursed. However, the IAs need to continue to enhance the pace of commitments, and in particular
                         disbursements from the Loan and Credits. The IAs also continue to make progress in achieving the Performance and Monitoring indicators for the Project, though the end-of-Project
                         levels of the agreed indicators will now be achieved by end-February 2014.
