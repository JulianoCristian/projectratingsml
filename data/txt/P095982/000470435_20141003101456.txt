1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country Background
After a decade of political instability, macroeconomic crisis, and limited economic and
social progress in the 1990s, Pakistan emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies
in Asia, with rising per capita income and improved social indicators. Successive years of
high growth (between FY04 and FY07 real GDP grew at more than 7% average) led to
commensurate high growth in electricity demand. During FY08, when financial crisis hit
world economies, Pakistan’s macro-economic performance deteriorated significantly
with double digit inflation, widening fiscal deficit and falling GDP growth. Nevertheless,
the electric utilities continued to experience a sharp increase in electricity demand.

Sector Background
At the time of appraisal, Pakistan power sector was in crisis because of stalled reforms,
energy shortages and financial deficit. Electricity sales rose by 40% in the five years
ending on June 30, 2007, period of high economic growth, while generation remained
practically stagnant and the system was unable to cover 2,000MW of peak demand with
acceptable reliability. With demand expected to grow at 7-8% per year in the medium-
term, plans for capacity additions needed to be revised upward to eliminate shortages.
The sector also needed significant fiscal support – approx. US$1.7 billion for FY08
(close to 20% of the projected operating revenues and 1% of GDP) – to cover the revenue
deficit. Poor electricity service was identified as a major constraint to economic growth.
Some of this deterioration in service was a result of Pakistan’s success at adding about
one million new (mainly household) connections each year, without a commensurate
expansion of generation capacity. Therefore, sector was in dire need of (a) substantial
investment in new generation to secure supply of electricity, (b) strengthening of
overloaded transmission and distribution system and improvements in energy efficiency,
and (c) bringing sector into financial equilibrium through tariff and subsidy reforms.

Power Sector Reforms
The government’s strategy for the sector, built on the wide-ranging power sector reforms
initiated in the early 1990s, aimed at improving sector performance and long term
sustainability through institutional, regulatory, and structural reforms. As part of the
reform, the Government opened up the sector to private investment, an independent
National Electric Power Regulatory Agency (NEPRA) was established in 1998, and
WAPDA Power Wing (a vertically integrated power sector utility) was unbundled into
four generation, one transmission, and nine distribution companies. After a period of
deteriorating financial performance in the late 1990s, the sector made some significant
improvements, especially in terms of improved collections of bills. However, there was
inadequate investment in low-cost base load generation capacity; from 2000-2008 there
was almost no investment in generation and from 2009 to 2013 there was a net increase
in capacity of just 3,000 MW. In addition, because of gas shortfall generation started to
shift to expensive fuel oil; in FY05 gas accounted for 50% and in FY13 it was only 27%.
As a result generation costs became significantly high and are difficult to control by the
                                               1
DISCOs. The objectives of power sector reforms have not been fully achieved, as some
important reform measures are yet to be implemented.

Rationale for Bank Involvement
Sustaining growth and improving competitiveness of the Pakistani economy was an
important pillar of the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY06-09. Attaining
this objective required significant investment in infrastructure, including power sector.

The World Bank was engaged in policy advice and backed the power sector reform
program through a series of budget-support operations. Improving electricity distribution
and transmission services was considered a key element of the overall effort of reforming
Pakistan’s power sector and strengthening its operating performance. The new companies
established as a result of sector restructuring needed to invest in their physical networks
to keep up with increasing demand, reduce losses, and improve services. They also
needed to strengthen the capacity in various areas of corporate functions and establish a
track record of performance and creditworthiness. Bank involvement in the project
helped the companies finance important investments for which there were no alternative
financiers. The Project was a first of a series of Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The
indicative triggers for APL-2 were: (i) successful progress of APL-1; (ii) corporate
autonomy of the DISCOs; and (iii) a fully functional wholesale market.

networks to meet increasing electricity demand in the selected areas more efficiently and
with better reliability and quality; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity of the selected
distribution companies and support other priority areas of the power sector reform.

The key performance indicators measured the effect of the project on the capacity of the
distribution and transmission networks to deliver the amounts of electricity which
consumers demand with improved reliability in terms of the overall annual electricity
throughput and the total level of losses (which include both technical and commercial
losses) to cover the efficiency aspect of the first objective. Selected intermediate
indicators also measured increased access, reliability and quality of supply in terms of
number of customers, interruptions and voltage conditions. The collection and number of
trainings were used to measure entities financial performance and capacity building
efforts and can be attributable to the second objective. While intermediate indicators
related to decline in tariff differential subsidies could be linked to progress on reforms.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
PDO and key indicators remained the same. However, at the time of restructuring in June
2012 target values were revised to reflect the reduced scope due to cancellation of about
US$ 62 million (25% of the original loan amount). The component-wise break-up of cost
before and after restructuring is given in Annex 1(a). Original and formally revised
indicators are listed in the Data Sheet Section F.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The immediate beneficiaries of the project were the national transmission and four
distribution companies as the project would improve their revenues and profitability by
reducing system losses, operation and maintenance costs, and the potential of accidents.
The consumers in their service area would also benefit through safer, better and more
reliable electric supply.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project included the following components:
   A. physical strengthening of distribution networks (including sub transmission)
       operated by four distribution companies 1;
   B. removing some bottlenecks in the transmission grid, operated by NTDC 2;
   C. technical assistance for capacity building, specialized studies, energy efficiency
       and sector reform; and
   D. a pilot energy efficiency program, involving installation of energy saving
       equipment at the customer level.

1.6 Revised Components
Prior to original closing date the Project was restructured with the approval of the
Regional Vice President to simplify the project design to focus on activities that were
critical to the achievement of the PDO and could be completed within the extended time
frame. As a result the following activities were dropped: (i) project activities under Part
A, totaling an estimated US$ 38.28 million, that were not urgently required due to the
recent power shortages caused by the lack of generation capacity; (ii) technical assistance
activities under Part C, totaling an estimated US$ 8.72 million, that were being financed
by other development partners, as well as those that were not ready for immediate
financing; and (iii) all activities under Part D (Energy Efficiency Component), totaling an
estimated US$ 15 million. In addition, US$ 4 million of the funds under the technical
assistance component were reallocated to the Ministry of Water and Power (MOWP)
from the four distribution companies to support the sector’s emerging urgent priorities,
including power trade with neighboring countries.

The Project was again restructured prior to the revised closing date to cancel the available
IDA funds (about US$ 2 million) so that those can be reallocated to the Pakistan program.

1.7 Other significant changes

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The overall quality at entry is rated as Unsatisfactory. As discussed below this is based on
little attention given to the corporate governance issues and risks were underestimated. In
addition, some of the indictors were not directly correlated with this intervention and did
not capture project development objectives. Intermediate indicators also failed to measure
implementation progress 3.

Soundness of Background Analysis.

The project was conceived as one of the investment components underpinning the
government’s power sector reforms initiated by power sector restructuring. In addition to
strengthening the newly formed entities the project also aimed at addressing broader
power sector issues related to governance, regulatory and investments so that the power
sector entities can function independently on pure commercial basis. However, these
were not supported with a political economy study to provide relevant inputs into project
design and to address critical risk factors. Therefore, technical assistance component for
capacity building, specialized studies, energy efficiency and sector reforms could not be
implemented in a manner envisaged.

At the time of Project inception and appraisal the country was experiencing a growing
electricity demand driven by a respectable economic growth in the years 2004 to 2007.
The four DISCOs selected for the EDTIP had experienced an average load growth in
peak demand (during 2005, 2006 and 2007) of 7.7% for IESCO, 19.3% for LESCO.
12.8 % for MEPCO and 14.7% for HESCO. The peak demand in the overall system was
expected to grow to 23,500 MW by 2012, requiring an addition of about 9,000 MW in
additional effective generation capability by 2012. The peak demand was already
exceeding effective generation capability in FY2006/07 4, therefore additions of at least
1,600 MW in generation capability were expected to be inducted every year between
2007 and 2017. Commensurate with such increase in peak demand and generation
capability the transmission capacity had also to be increased at transmission level by
NTDC and the sub-transmission level in DISCOs. Failure to provide such capacity
additions would have resulted in forced outages, lower reliability and sub-standard
quality of supply to the consumers, leading to an adverse impact on economic growth.

All DISCOs and NTDC had 5 year system expansion plans approved by the Planning
Commission of the Government of Pakistan (GOP). The EDTIP project, however,
covered only a small portion of the total investment needs of the transmission and
distribution companies 5. Initial discussions were held with all eight distribution
companies but only four 6 were selected based on the readiness of their projects,
implementation capacity, need and government’s preferences. The selected entities were
asked to prepare Project Description Documents focusing on two years of their
investment program for possible Bank funding covering Secondary Transmission and
Grid (STG) and Energy Loss Reduction (ELR) component which are at the core of the
electricity distribution business. Individual project components were selected on the basis
of technical and economic analysis of candidate projects in each entity. Several projects
were also considered for APL-2. In parallel, some of the investment to implement the 5
year plans was expected from other sources, such as Asian Development Bank (ADB) or
by IEs themselves.

Assessment of the project design.

NTDC was expected to cover most of its needs through other investment sources, so only
a small unaddressed portion of capacity enhancement (220 kV Grid station at Kassowal
and associated transmission line) in NTDC was included to address capacity restraint
issues affecting delivery to MEPCO at 220 kV. A substantial portion of the project (more
than 60 %) was designed to address the urgent need of DISCOs to satisfy the requirement
of capacity enhancement at the sub-transmission level, for efficient delivery of service to
consumers. The Project was thus appropriately designed to address the important and
urgent need for investment in the transmission and distribution system. The design of the
project, however, was overly complex covering both transmission and distribution with
too many implementing entities and an energy efficiency pilot program. Therefore,
project faced number of implementation challenges. Each of these components could
have been a separate project prioritizing the development challenges of each company
and appropriately addressing those.

After the unbundling, DISCOs were in the process of re-aligning their structures and
processes to function as corporate entities. This is a major change management exercise
and requires hand-holding support. Therefore, it would have been better to start with one
or two utilities (one DISCO and NTDC), instead of 5 and help the entities develop a
Business Plan and build their capacity. This would have helped prepare a robust project
design and the project could have been expanded later with additional financing and
bringing in more entities.

 For example, in case of IESCO, the EDTIP STG and ELR component was about one-fourth of US$ 230
million, the total requirement for its five years approved development plan.

 (1) Hyderabad Electric Supply Company– HESCO, (2) Islamabad Electric Supply Company– IESCO, (3)
Lahore Electric Supply Company– LESCO, and (4) Multan Electric Power Company- MEPCO. In 2012,
HESCO was bifurcated into two separate companies to form new Sukkur Electric Power Company-SEPCO.

                                                5
Selection of DISCOs. The four DISCOs were identified by the Government and stated to
be representative of companies in the sector ranging from top to bottom of the scale. The
identification by Government also took into consideration other factors, such as law and
order situation, ease of implementation and policy for privatization of some DISCOs. In
all the four selected DISCO there was a need for Grid station capacity expansion and
even though the Project has been closed, the need of Grid station capacity expansion
remains insatiate even in the better performing DISCOs.

Design of sub projects for DISCOs within the categories of ST and 11kV. Within the
DISCOs the segregation and ratio of subprojects between Sub-Transmission and
Downstream Distribution at 11/0.4 kV (11kV), were based upon the operational demands
of DISCOs as identified by them during need assessment, rather than being based on an
optimization of benefits approach. For example in the case of LESCO, during FY2007
the ST Losses were less than1.0 % and 11kV losses were 12.7 % as compared to 3.6%
and 8.9 % for IESCO, however project design did not include an ELR that LESCO
decided to undertake from its own resources. Inclusion of ELR component could have
given some flexibility to appropriately reallocate resources as LESCO’s STG component
faced many difficulties and several contracts were not awarded. Project restructuring was
done too late and left no choice other than cancellation. There was an emphasis on
technical loss reduction but as explained below the project was missing a comprehensive
revenue protection program including, disconnection of non-paying consumers, consumer
classification for billing, computerized metering etc.

Were alternatives considered?
ST capacity expansion is an essential need of DISCOs to carry out their business and
service obligation and as such had no alternative 7. However in the case of 11/0.4 kV
distribution system, the alternative or sharing between technical energy loss reduction
measures and pilferage reduction measures should have been considered for each DISCO
to optimize project benefits 8. Since no study was available to identify percentage of area
wise pilferage in overall losses, the selection of projects was done under the constraint of
assuming that the loading on line was arising out of a legitimate demand on the system.
Alternately, it could have been based on a minimum revenue billing and collection
requirement from the sub project area. This aspect has been taken into consideration on
an overall basis while selecting HESCO for investing in Aerial Bundled conductor (ABC)
installation as a measure of addressing the pilferage issue on a pilot basis. Other modes of
addressing the pilferage issue could also have been considered in all DISCOs, such as (a)
extending 11kV overhead line and installing smaller capacity distribution transformers


7
 Although Captive power is stated as an alternative in PAD, but it cannot be made available in the exact
same location where ST capacity constraint is being experienced; moreover it involves technical, regulatory
and functional issues which restricts its availability as a feasible alternative to capacity expansion.

8
 Distribution transformer and line capacity enhancement measures can become counterproductive if
carried out in areas where large scale pilferage is evident. Sub-projects, aimed at pilferage reduction could
have been included in all DISCOs, on the basis of grading of overall losses at the 11kV feeder level.

                                                      6
(Dtrs) to reduce or eliminate 0.4 kV overhead system, in areas where direct hooks are
being applied for pilferage; and (b) installation of smart meters having over load circuit
breaking and remote disconnection capability.

Overall, the project was missing a comprehensive revenue protection program and
therefore the intended targets were not achieved. A component on automated metering
and billing system implementation would have helped address this but as argued in this
report project design was too complicated and inclusion of another component would
have made it even more complex. Alternately, PDO could have been changed to bring it
in line with the power sector attributes directly influenced through this intervention.
Availability of reliable data is another consideration. The indicators therefore should
either be based on the data which can be measured reliably or for which management
information systems could be developed as part of the project.

Adequacy of government commitment.

Government commitment/ownership remained high during the preparation and design
phase as it continued the power sector reform program articulated in early 1990s to
transform the successor generation, transmission and distribution companies created from
WAPDA, into commercially oriented and efficiently managed and operated companies.
First annual consumer tariff determinations for DISCOs were completed in 2007 (an
essential first step towards their financial autonomy) by NEPRA, almost six years after it
became fully operational.

Unfortunately, the power sector reforms didn’t continue with the same vigor and the
sector plunged deeper into energy and financial crisis and is unable to recover its costs
from the current combination of tariffs and subsidies. This gave rise to inter corporate
arrears (also referred as circular debt) that amounted to about 4% of GDP in FY2013 and
the sector receives subsidies in the range of 1-2% of GDP. This also affected project
implementation in several ways because of weak governance structure and governments
interference in corporate decisions. The current government is trying to put things back
on track. It has cleared the entire stock of circular debt in June/July 2013 and is now
addressing underlying issues through policy measures, including the level of tariffs and
inadequate management resulting in higher than acceptable level of losses and non-
recovery of revenue. As part of government’s reform measures and its vision for the
power sector delineated in National Power Policy 2013, the Board of Directors (BODs)
of publically owned power sector entities have been strengthened, DISCOs have been put
under the Companies Act and new performance contracts are being signed including
revenue protection plans.

Assessment of Risks.

The risks were divided into two broad categories – (i) risks to project development
objectives that largely dealt with the success of the power sector reforms; and (ii) risks to
component results that depended upon selected DISCOs’ capacity to implement the
project and administer procurement, environmental and social action plans. Some of
                                              7
these risk factors particularly those related to tariffs and subsidies were translated into
legal covenants so that financial viability of the sector and its entities can be ensured and
IEs capacity to function independently can be built. These legal covenants were either not
met or were met with significant delays.

The issues in the power sector were well laid out in the PAD, but the overall project risk
was underestimated and should have been High rather than Substantial because of the
issues related to corporate governance, lack of autonomy given to power sector entities
and weak accountability structure, government’s unwillingness to implement tariff &
subsidy policy and procurement related issues indicating collusion 9.

In addition to the risks identified at the design stage, project faced several other risks that
caused significant delays. Key ones are: (i) land acquisition became a major problem e.g.
a grid station could not be built on already acquired piece of land and an alternate was
suggested; (ii) other unforeseen risks such as markets volatility, floods/natural disasters
e.g. bids were cancelled after a blip in commodity prices in 2008.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Implementation of the project remained slower than planned since its approval on June
17, 2008 particularly during initial phase of the Project. Project’s effectiveness was
unduly delayed because legal opinions and ratifications of the Project Agreement by
respective Boards of the DISCOs took 6 months and opening of designated account took
another 6 months after effectiveness. There were major delays in procurement cycle due
to several iterations to procurement documents, multiple rebidding of activities due to all
non-responsive bids or no bids received, and undue time taken from tendering/evaluation
to contract award. These issues arose because project was not ready for implementation
which points towards its poor quality at entry. The mid-term review was carried out one
year before project closing and the ratings were downgraded from Moderately
Satisfactory (MS) to Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) and Unsatisfactory(U) for
Development Objective (DO) and Implementation Progress (IP) respectively primarily
because of slow pace of contract award, lag in disbursements, delay in implementing the
Procurement Action Plan (PAP) 10, and weak institutional capacity. Specific actions and
timelines were agreed but even those were not adhered to and the project was restructured
in June 2012 (few days prior to the original closing date). The project was again


9
 INT was involved to address the issues of collusion and several actions were agreed under the
procurement action plan including amendment to SRO827(1) (See Section 2.4 Procurement for details).

10
  At the start of the project there were some instances of collusion and unethical practices in the sector for
which the Bank had proposed a Procurement Action Plan. Despite of repeated efforts there was very little
implementation. Lack of ownership and seriousness to implement PAP was a major reason for not meeting
this legal covenant.

                                                      8
restructured prior to the revised closing date to reallocate the unutilized IDA portion to
the Pakistan program. At first restructuring, recognizing the complexities involved in the
nature of the project and the delays caused due to factors outside the control of the IEs’
management the project was extended for 20 months and only the contracts which were
ongoing or at final stage of award were carried forward. This did not improve the project
performance and the ratings for DO and IP in the last Implementation Status and Results
Report (ISR) were still MU and U. The implementation performance varies widely
among IEs but all have experienced significant delays and have contracts that go beyond
the revised Project Closing Date of February 28, 2014 (PCD) or were not awarded. As of
PCD only 75 sub-projects (i.e. 65%) were completed and about 72.5% were disbursed.
Four large value contracts representing 23 sub-projects (amounting to about US$ 32
million, 16.5% by value) were not awarded even after an extension of 20 months. About
11.0% of the contractual commitment is going beyond the PCD and has to be funded by
the IEs themselves. (See Annex 2 for entity-wise details).

Based on a sample of 27 contracts from a total of 70 it was observed that procurement
cycle took more than 400 days on average for ICB contracts, an estimated delay of more
than 100 days on average. The average cycle time for NCB is in the range of 250 – 350
days which is also quite high. Similarly, for a selected sample of 63 contracts more than
75% of the contracts were not completed on time, experienced delays ranging from 1 to
18 months with an average delay of 3 months. Delays occurred almost at every stage of
the project cycle. As of project closing only 75 out of 115 subprojects were completed.
Majority about 23 were not awarded and 17 went beyond the PCD because of delay in
implementation.

Following factors contributed to the delay of project implementation:
• IEs’ weak capacity in contract management and ineffective use of technical
    assistance. The project had six
    implementing agencies most of which
    were established in 1998, after
    unbundling of the integrated utility.
    Secondly, it was the first Bank
    investment lending operation in
    Pakistan’s power sector since 1995.
    Therefore, the IEs didn’t have much
    experience in preparing or
    implementing Bank-funded projects.
    Also, frequent staff turnover eroded        Figure 1: Procurement Cycle in Days
    the capacity which was built in the
    interim. Figure 1 compares
    procurement cycle for similar NCB contracts funded by Bank versus own resources.
    For Bank funded projects a major gap was observed in bid evaluation for following
    reasons: (i) low clearing thresholds for DISCOs required multiple internal approvals,
    (ii) historical track record to assess quality and bidders’ past experience required for
    Bank funded activities was missing from the bids as bidders were only used to submit
    qualifications details as per the activities done through DISCOs own resources which
                                                9
    did not require such details. A logical rationale for delay in contract award and
    signing could not be ascertained. Generally the bid validity requested was 120 days,
    which is normally an adequate time period for doing evaluations and contract award.
    But there are instances where bid validity had expired and bidders were not willing to
    extend due to floating exchange rate and increasing prices of raw materials.

    Also, the TA funds were not utilized to build the capacity during the early phase of
    the project. For example:
        a. Lack of skill to deal with procurement/contract management relating to the ST
            portion of the project, particularly turn key projects including entire package
            of a 132 kV Grid station, was already realized at the Project appraisal stage.
            When the DISCOs took over the ST part of Transmission from NTDC, the
            Grid system operation and construction staff was transferred to the respective
            DISCOs but Procurement and contract management staff with NTDC was not
            shared with DISCOs. Acquisition of skills in this area was therefore an
            ongoing process during the implementation of the project involving delays in
            sending back and forth Bidding Documents and Bid Evaluation reports
            between WB and the IEs before approvals could be obtained and contracts
            signed by IEs. Gearing the TA component to building capacity in this context
            right at the beginning of the Project could have avoided most of the protracted
            delays.
        b. It was agreed that International Procurement Advisor (IPA) would be
            appointed by no later than December 31, 2008 but the consultant was engaged
            after the MTR and the procurement manual prepared by the IPA and reviewed
            by the IEs to strengthen procurement systems was never adopted by the IEs.
•   Revision of Technical Specifications during project implementation was time
    consuming and could have been done at the design stage or immediately afterwards.
    The government agreed with the Bank in mid-2009 that the IEs and PEPCO will work
    with the Bank to update the specifications of key equipment and material to be
    procured under the Project. This was necessitated by a need to ensure that the
    specifications used by the IEs in the bidding documents are non-restrictive by
    bringing them in line with the latest international standards and norms and to address
    collusion but the process was time consuming and about six months were spent to
    update/revise the technical specifications of main equipment.
•   Frequent complaints, contractual disputes and litigation issues held up project
    progress. Power equipment market was also not quite open, competitive and efficient.
    Manufacturers of distribution equipment and materials in Pakistan were not used to
    open and competitive bidding processes, based on WB guidelines and therefore there
    were several complaints and concerns raised by the potential bidders. Project received
    more than its share of complaints – 30% of the complaints received over the past 10
    years were related to this project. A number of complaints also arose out of local
    manufacturers and vendors trying to resist competition from international firms. To
    highlight the issue one ICB can be quoted here which was the cause of substantial
    underutilization of the loan.
        a. WB issued “No objection” for purchase of 27 number 31.5- 40 MVA Power
            Transformers (PTrs), relating to LESCO ICB 631-01. However, LESCO could
                                               10
            not sign the contract with the lowest evaluated bidder as the case remained
            under consideration of the LESCO Board for an indefinite period due to the
            issue of equivalency of On Load Tap Changer (OLTC, essentially required to
            change output voltage according to requirement during operation). The matter
            regarding OLTC also affected few other DISCOs/contracts not financed by
            the Bank and was investigated by the Competition Commission of Pakistan
            (CCP) on the complaint filed by an international manufacturer into the alleged
            monopoly created by specifying a particular make for OLTC in PTrs. The
            CCP concluded this to be a violation of the Competition Act 2010 based on
            imposing restrictive trading conditions. Later, NTDC filed a writ petition
            against CCP Decision and as a result the matter remained suspended.
•   Lack of preparedness to deal with unforeseen risks resulting in ineffective use of
    project funds. For example:
       a. Almost all bidding process in 2008 was cancelled due to sudden spike in
            commodity prices that didn’t seem like a valid trend and could have made
            these investments unfeasible. In retrospect, it seemed like a good decision
            because the spike disappeared within four months.
       b. In 2010, floods damaged distribution equipment and assets. Procurement
            activities in some DISCOs (particularly LESCO) were halted for about 8
            months so that the savings can be diverted for the restoration of distribution
            assets damaged by the floods. However, the government subsequently decided
            not to utilize the existing funds for such purposes and it appears that this was
            not communicated to the IEs in time and caused some delays.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Design. The PDO of EDTIP was generic, overambitious and mixed investments and
reforms. Such wide ranging objectives made it extremely difficult to measure the project
achievements. Moreover, the indicators selected for the project represented entity level
data and captured the intended outcomes on an overall operational performance of the IEs
in terms of units purchased, losses, collection, subsidies, interruptions, voltage profile etc.

The indicators were not project specific and therefore performance of one sub-component
could not be compared against the other for informed decision making and appropriate
reallocation of resources. The indicators also did not capture the effect of similar
concurrent activities by other lending agencies such as ADB or IEs’ own development
resource. The intermediate indicators also did not capture other actions that had direct
effect on IEs financial performance e.g. the timing and adequacy of tariffs adjustment
approvals and receipt of subsidies. The lack of reporting on project results, therefore,
posed lot of challenges for M&E. The intermediate indicators, therefore, should have
included project specific indicators such as 132/11kV capacity added in the ST system
and number of ELR projects completed out of total sub projects envisaged in the 11/0.4
kV system to measure project’s progress and benefits directly attributable to this project.

Implementation/Utilization. The Quarterly Progress Reports (QPRs) submitted by the IEs
included Key Performance Indicators. Most of these key indicators are widely reported
and are included in the regulators’ industry reports, tariff petitions/determinations, etc.
                                             11
The losses and collection figures are expected to be reliable as the amounts are audited by
independent auditors and units purchased and billed is largely through metering. The data
on quality and reliability of supply, however, show such a vast variation in numbers
across DISCOs and across time that it cannot be relied upon as a credible indicator to
judge progress of implementation or project’s effectiveness. No system was put in place
either as part of the project or by utilities themselves to improve data collection for better
monitoring and decision making purposes.

The Technical Assistance (TA) component was not used effectively to directly support
project implementation. An owner’s engineer for example would have helped identify
and address the issues leading to significant capacity building on project implementation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Environmental Safeguards: The project triggered Bank’s safeguard policies OP4.01 and
4.12 and was assessed as Environment Category B based upon the fact that most of the
anticipated/potential impacts were mild to moderate in significance and associated with
the construction activities and hence temporary in nature. In accordance with the
requirements detailed in the ESAs cleared by the Bank, the IAs established safeguard
departments to implement ESAs and ESMPs but often faced reluctance and sometimes
even resistance from within their respective organizations and from contractors. The key
factor affecting the safeguard implementation and outcome included lack of relevant
experience and awareness at the IE level. Similarly the contractors and consultants
engaged by the IEs were also quite weak in terms of understanding and implementing
environmental safeguard requirements. In addition, no monitoring was carried out by the
regulatory agencies (EPAs) for the ESA compliance during the project implementation.

Initially during the project implementation, the safeguard compliance was not satisfactory
primarily because the IEs and their contractors did not have any previous experience in
terms of understanding and implementing environmental safeguard requirements.
However the compliance improved gradually as a result of continued support and
guidance provided by the task team and the final monitoring conducted at the end of the
construction phase revealed that the project did not cause any significant, lasting and or
irreversible environmental impacts.

Social Safeguards: The Project used two instruments to address social safeguards issues –
Environment and Social Assessments, Resettlement Action Plans and one Abbreviated
Resettlement Action Plan. While ESMPs were formed for all IEs (HESCO, IESCO,
LESCO, MEPCO and NTDC), the RAPs were prepared and implemented only by entities
that undertook land acquisition for grid stations. This included IESCO and MEPCO while
LESCO prepared and implemented an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan. Mostly, the
RAPs were implemented for small number of Project Affected People e.g. in Lahore,
LESCO acquired land from 15 affected people. However, the major area of compensation
remained that for crop and other losses that were incurred during the implementation of
the Transmission Line components. These losses were assessed and addressed under the
                                              12
existing practices used by the IEs. The procedure involves post-assessment of losses
through the patwaris/land revenue officers and local staff. In the absence of standardized
guidelines and procedures for assessment of losses, the common practice across all
DISCOs is to undertake assessment after the damages. Further, there is no clarity on
standardization of compensation payments. The result was that compensation payments
were severely and consistently delayed in the Project. IESCO, LESCO and MEPCO
reported pending/outstanding payments even at the end of the Project. In the case of
IESCO, the payments were delayed for a year while MEPCO had only paid 19% of the
compensation owed for crop losses by the end of the project.

The Project supported the creation of Social and Environment Cells in each IE to oversee
the implementation of social safeguards. Over the life of the Project, these played a
significant role in monitoring safeguards implementation in the field, raising awareness
both within DISCOs and among contractors/implementing partners and conducting
periodic public consultations. A Grievance Redress Mechanism was operational
throughout the project. However, it had limited scope to address the major issue related to
delays in loss assessment and award of compensation payments for losses due to
Transmission Lines.

Financial Management
In compliance with Corporate Governance Rules 2013 issued by the Securities &
Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), new Boards including independent directors
of all DISCOs were appointed in August – October 2013. Oversight committees of the
Boards on internal audit and finance have also been made effective to ensure effective
controls and financial reporting. The Bank was informed, at the project appraisal stage
that Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 11 is underway in all implementing agencies,
except MEPCO, which is expected to be completed during 2008 – only LESCO has
successfully implemented accounting module. Further, it was agreed at time of appraisal
that the fixed assets physical verification and tagging exercise would be initiated by
DISCOs and is yet to be completed. Whereas, internal audit approach, to conduct the
audit is based on transaction-audit, a weak audit approach, instead of Risk-Based audit
approach as envisaged in the DISCOs Internal Audit Manuals. Implementing agencies
arrangements for financial reporting are given in the ensuing paragraphs.

Existing financial management arrangements in the six implementing agencies of this
project were used. Adequate staffing was maintained during life of the project. Internal
audit arrangements were also in place except for PEPCO where no internal audit was
conducted despite regular follow up.

Despite the above-mentioned drawbacks, the implementing agencies remained compliant
with the financial covenants submitting acceptable interim quarterly financial reports and
annual audited financial statements except NTDC in which case Bank had to take


11
     ERP cover computerization of accounts, human resource, billing, inventory and fixed assets management.

                                                     13
remedial measures as audited financial statements were submitted after a delay of over
four months after the due date. The delay was attributable to the board of directors not
being in place. Auditors’ performance remained satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
Completion of On-going Contracts and Operation & Maintenance (O&M) arrangements.
No transition arrangements are required to be made by the Bank as DISCOs are liable for
the completion of the on-going activities from their own resources. The annual
distribution margins (DM) determined by NEPRA will cover O&M cost and provides
return on assets and depreciation to cover the debt servicing. The tariff revenue also
ensures that the DISCOs are able to contribute equity for new projects and therefore
DISCOs/NTDC can finance the portion of the work (about US$ 20 million) that went
beyond PCD from their own resources. Most DISCOs, however, are not meeting the
efficiency targets set by NEPRA for system losses and bill collection which affect their
cash flows and profitability. Even though these companies are in perpetual loss and
require government support to remain financially viable retain their DM in full by
delaying the payments to NTDC/CPPA (single buyer and seller) for the power procured.
As part of the reform measures and action covered under Power Reform DPC, CPPA
would become independent of NTDC and would sign PPAs with the power generators on
behalf of DISCOs making them liable for their losses. This may also lead to reduced
access to generating capacity if DISCOs are unable to pay for the power procured.

Sustaining Reforms and Institutional Capacity.
Further strengthening of technical capacity would require an active TA or a lending
operation. Though the Bank will continue to remain engaged with the government and
other entities as part of its policy dialogue other development partners particularly ADB
and USAID are providing more direct support to power sector public entities.

As mentioned in Section 1.1, prior conditions including those related to power reforms
have not been met even today and APL-2 was never approved. One of those conditions
relates to Power Sector Reforms which have been a long drawn process. The Bank,
however, has remained engaged with the government in its reforms efforts. The National
Power Policy 2013 of the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has given a fresh impetus to
these reform efforts to develop an efficient and consumer centric electric power system.
The GOP has also developed an implementation plan, which is supported by the
development partners. The IMF approved in September 2013 a 36 month Extended Fund
Facility in the amount of US$ 6.68 billion, which includes reforms to the power sector.
The Bank’s power sector reform DPC series, first of which (US$ 600 million) was
approved in May 2014, also supports these reforms and was developed in collaboration
with ADB and JICA. These reforms efforts are expected to have positive results on the
sector and will improve financial viability of generating companies, NTDC and the
DISCOs.

                                             14
Ensuring Financial Sustainability of the Sector.
The largest financial risk in the sector is the under performance of the DISCOs against
the targets for loss reduction and bill collection set by NEPRA. Addressing these issues
through DPC would pave the way for much needed investments in the transmission and
distribution sector. The Government as the current owner has instructed the DISCOs to
implement revenue protection programs and through the performance contracts, MOWP
is holding the DISCOs accountable. Implementing a revenue protection program,
however, will require immediate investments. DISCOs also need to enhance transmission
and distribution network capacity to disperse additional power from planned and ongoing
generation projects without incurring major losses.

Follow-up operation/plans.
Considering the delays and problems faced during the implementation of the EDTIP
project a disbursement linked indicator type operation (DLI) 12 with some emphasis on
procurement aspects along with other operational parameters could be considered for the
design of any future project with electricity transmission and distribution companies.
However, given how poor the indicators were this would require (a) investment in
indicators to ensure availability of reliable information and (b) organizational changes to
use that information for performance monitoring. In addition to key performance
indicators a DLI could also include specific actions aimed to improve efficiency,
transparency and accountability in management and operations.

Power Reform DPC will set a stage for investments in the sector by (i) increasing
transparency and data reliability; (ii) addressing chronic issues related to tariffs, subsidies
and circular debt; and (iii) ensuring enhanced monitoring by NEPRA and the MOWP.
However, most of the DISCOs are still not up to the mark to raise commercial financing
on their own and therefore would need continued support of multi- and bi-laterals for
some time.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
The project objectives remain highly relevant to the needs of the country in general and
power sector in particular but as explained below were too ambitious. Similarly, project
design was very complicated spreading across many dimensions and indicators failed to
capture project progress. Therefore, relevance of objectives, design and implementation
is rated as ‘Moderate’ on a 4 point scale 13. Further explanation in support of this rating is
provided in the following paras.

12
  Use of DLIs, for some other projects in Pakistan, has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing
coordination with stakeholders and development partners and focusing greater attention on results as
opposed to administrative implementation issues, which was a major cause of EDTIP’s poor performance.

13
     4 Point Scale: Negligible to Low (N); Moderate (M); Significant/Substantial (S) and High (H).

                                                      15
Relevance of Objectives. The project remains highly relevant to the current Government
strategy delineated in the National Power Policy 2013 which has highlighted the key
weaknesses/challenges in the sector and 3 of 5 major targets set in the Policy relate to the
distribution sector which this project was also capturing. These three policy targets are:
reduce transmission and distribution losses from 23-25% to 16%, improve collection
from 85% to 95% and shorten processing time to improve governance. The project is also
relevant to key objectives of the FY10-14 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and will be
even more strongly related to future CPS (FY15-19) that has underlined the increased
importance of an efficient power sector for sustainable growth. In the last CPS (effective
during the implementation period) it underpinned primarily pillar 3 (improving
infrastructure to support growth) and in the current CPS a project like EDTIP would
directly support two of the four result areas i.e. Energy and Service Delivery.

Relevance of Design. A project addressing efficiency issues in distribution remains still
highly relevant to the current power sector business environment as it can address some
of the critical challenges that the sector is still facing i.e. financing and energy deficit.
Project design encompassed reduction in losses, one of the major causes of financial
deficit in the sector, and expansion of the network, needed to increase access to electricity
and disperse the power from generation projects with better reliability and quality.
Intermediate indicators, however, failed to measure the progress of the project and
therefore remedial actions were missing till the mid-term review (MTR). Overall, the
project design addressed a wide range of issues but was very complex and had an
aggressive implementation plan given the risks associated with power sector reforms,
weak implementation capacity of IEs and lack of project readiness to go into
implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

Performance of IEs against key indicators show mixed results and therefore it is difficult
to measure the achievement of PDO when there are several IEs. Generally, the
performance of the IEs improved over the implementation period of this project but the
target values were mostly not achieved. As explained is Section 2.3, these indicators
measured entity level performance in terms of reduction in losses, collection and amount
of electricity handled by the network and therefore it is difficult to attribute the
performance of the IEs (or its shortcomings) to this particular intervention. Moreover, the
indicators did not consider the impact of other investments and exogenous factors e.g.
supply deficit, which is not in control of the IEs and it is difficult to improve distribution
efficiency without having adequate available generation capacity. The project specific
analysis presented in Annex 3 shows that the performance in the project areas has
improved in terms of reduction in losses and increased sales as envisaged. However, slow
implementation of the project, a large number of incomplete sub projects and non-
compliance with several actions agreed under the project resulted in reduced and delayed

                                               16
benefits. Therefore, achievement of PDO is rated as ‘Moderate’. Results achieved under
each aspect of the PDO are summarized below and further details are given in Annex 2.

Objective number 1-a, to strengthen the capacity of the distribution and transmission
network to meet increasing electricity demand in the selected areas more efficiently was
not met. The selected indicators to measure the achievement of this objective are system
losses and collection rate. As shown in Figure 2, Transmission and distribution (T&D)
losses improved marginally and only 2 DISCOs were able to achieve the revised target
for T&D losses. ELR component was completed in IESCO only and it was able to
achieve the original and revised target for T&D losses. As oppose to STG, benefits of
ELR accrue throughout the implementation period and therefore HESCO and MEPCO
show improvement in their losses – while MEPCO has achieve the target HESCO despite
considerable reduction in losses failed to meet those targets. LESCO didn’t have an ELR
component and its losses have increased. The numbers, however, could not be relied
upon fully in the absence of an automated metering system.

The decline in collection can primarily be attributed to administrative issues and is
therefore also linked to institutional capacity (Objective 2-a). However, it is also related
to the efficiency of supply and since the project was missing a comprehensive revenue
protection program the collection rates as shown in Figure 3 declined significantly from
the base year values and targets were not achieved. In addition to capacity and
governance issues the situation was exacerbated due to increase in cost, change in
consumer mix, law and order, etc.

Objective number 1-b, to strengthen the capacity of the distribution and transmission
network to meet increasing electricity demand in the selected areas with better reliability
and quality cannot be assessed because area-wise data was not available (at appraisal or
at completion). However, based on the entity level indicator proposed in the PAD
electricity demand has not been met as supply was not assured to the distribution
companies. The amount of electricity handled was expected to grow at the rate of 5.9%
originally (FY12 Target), was revised down to yield 2.2% growth (FY13 Target) and was
able to achieve only 1.1% growth (FY13 Actual). Nevertheless, progress in enhancing
network capacity was satisfactory as 53 of 59 STG sub-projects were completed and the
remaining six are expected to be completed by September 2014 14. Number of electricity
consumers also increased by 30% during this period but resulted in increased load
shedding in a supply shortfall scenario.

Objective number 2-a, strengthening of institutional capacity, also was not achieved as
evident from slow implementation of several contracts, continued delay in complying
with the agreed procurement action plan and slow disbursements. Weak institutional
capacity was highlighted as a major risk and a mitigation plan was proposed in the PAD.
These actions, however, were either not implemented or were implemented with
significant delays. Nevertheless, capacity of the IEs has improved as evident from sharp
increase in contract signing and disbursements observed after the MTR but it is still not
up to the mark expected from commercially oriented entities.

Objective number 2-b, The TA component was not used effectively to support power
sector reforms and therefore this objective was not achieved. Successful reforms would
have meant a financially viable sector and therefore reliance on government subsidies
could be used as an indicator to measure the achievement of this particular objective. As
shown in Figure 5, since FY2007, the tariff differential subsidies have increased by
manifolds 15.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
As shown in the economic analysis (Annex 3), ELR projects in particular have very high
economic returns and ERR exceeded the appraisal estimates as cost of generation has
increased by manifolds since appraisal. STG project that substitutes non-grid electricity
also show high economic returns if valued using consumer surplus approach. Even if
benefits are measured taking distribution margin (DM) as a proxy for economic benefits
(as in the PAD) the returns are modest. Therefore, the DISCOs that had major share of
ELR in their portfolio have performed better in terms of ERR. However, implementation
delays were common and all IEs have uncompleted projects in their portfolios and this
has delayed project benefits or realization of its economic returns. US$64 million were

  By FY16, the government plans to reduce its electricity subsidy bill from 1.5 percent of GDP to 0.3-0.4
percent and TDS is expected to have declined after FY13 as part of the agreement with the IMF and actions
agreed under power reform DPC.

cancelled through project restructuring, another US$ 32 million worth of contracts were
not awarded and contracts amounting to US$ 56 million16 could not be completed by the
PCD. IEs’ failure to utilize about 59% of the original loan amount despite that it was
needed the most to deal with the challenges of the power sector resulted in what most
likely are substantial foregone economic and financial benefits e.g. denied access,
unreliable supply and increased energy and financial deficits in the sector.

As shown in Table 1 the economic returns of the project except for LESCO exceeded the
appraisal estimates even when valued using average distribution margin of PKR1.1/kWh
which is much less than PKR 6.3 estimated to be the consumer surplus. The main
benefits of the project were derived from increase in sales due to enhanced
transformation and transmission capacity and lower power purchases due to reduction in
losses. Though the additional sales because of STG components are less compared to
appraisal (even after accounting for the reduced scope) the ERR has increased because of
the ELR component. The power purchase cost used to value the benefits of ELR has
increased by more than three times. Moreover, the actual reduction in power purchased is
estimated to be more than the appraisal estimate. See Annex 3 for detailed analysis.

The ERR for NTDC is expected to be less than the appraisal estimate because NTDC had
only one project which could not be completed. According, to the appraisal document a
two year delay would have reduced the ERR from 32.9 to 22.3 percent.

                                           ERR at Appraisal                 ERR at Completion
     HESCO                                     45.08                               65.80

     NTDC                                      32.92                      Expected to be much less

Despite huge variation in the number of units, delays in implementation, etc. the project
has a very high economic rate of return of 47% (for all DISCOs combined), typical of a
distribution project and is therefore rated as ‘Substantial’ in terms of efficiency. The
delays in project implementation did not have a major impact on the ERR because both
cost and benefit streams were delayed by the same time period. There were few instances
in which line or the grid couldn’t be energized because of some litigation or other issues
after most of the costs were incurred but its impact on the overall returns was negligible.
Cancellation or no award would tend to reduce the NPV but did not have a major impact
on the ERR because neither the cost nor the benefits were accounted.




16
 STG-DISCOs: US$ 15 million, ELR-DISCOs: US$ 17 million, NTDC: US$ 24 million. Benefits of an
ELR project will accrue throughout its implementation while benefits of STG will come after completion.

                                                   20
Since the investments are part of a multiyear system expansion plans, approved by
Planning Commission of Pakistan, these are expected to be allowed by NEPRA, as
prudent investment to form part of IEs regulatory asset base. Consequently, a
corresponding return on assets, based on the prevailing weighted average cost of capital,
will be included in the tariff determined by NEPRA for each IE as a whole. Therefore, a
17% financial rate of return (the applicable relending rate of the government for these
entities in rupees at the time of project signing) in respect of the investment financed with
the EDTIP loan is assured for through the regulatory dispensation provided DISCOs meet
the regulatory targets for system losses and collection. Collectively DISCOs are not
meeting these targets and are therefore in chronic loss and rely on government support
and subsidies to remain financially viable. Delay in tariff determination/notification
process also makes the returns erratic and unpredictable.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Despite significant shortcomings like implementation delays, missing 50% of the targets
and several incomplete activities, the data collected for ICR show that the project made
significant contributions in the geographical areas where it was implemented successfully.
It has high economic returns based on the results achieved with the amount spent and is
therefore rated as Substantial in terms of efficiency. Achievement of PDO, however,
could not be measured reliably because of disconnect between the PDO and the
indicators. PDO was too ambitious and the indicators were not relevant and reliable to
capture project specific performance. Nevertheless, the project has helped IEs to enhance
the transmission and distribution capacity and reduce losses to support additional
consumers and increase revenue. Therefore, achievement of PDO is rated as Moderate
instead of Low or Negligible. Lastly, the project was highly relevant to address the needs
of the sector but was downgraded to moderate because of the design issues. Based on
these three aspects relevance, achievement of PDOs and efficiency as discussed in the
sections above the overall outcome is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
This aspect has not been documented for the EDTIP project. The project, however, is
expected to have made significant positive contribution in terms of improved availability
and reliability of power to general electricity consumers including the poor households.
For example, installation of Aerial Bundled Conductor in HESCO not only eliminated the
number of failure complaints lodged by the consumers but also show drastic reduction in
number of fatalities 17, which is why the project took off despite intense resistance at the
beginning.


17
     In FY13, HESCO reported zero public fatalities down from 18 and 11 in FY12 and FY11.

                                               21
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
It was Bank’s first project with the newly formed distribution companies and there was
lot of learning on both sides. The distribution companies are now more familiar with the
Bank’s procedures and requirements. The procurement manual and associated SOPs
developed under the project will further strengthen their institutional capacity if adopted
by the IEs. The project also helped the entities to revise the technical specifications. The
TA component on the other hand was not implemented. It covered wide ranging activities
but focus remained mostly limited to training aspects. As a result, planning, design,
operational and information systems at DISCOs are still very weak.

None

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
Outcome indicators that are strongly correlated to the project show positive trends.
Government of Pakistan is also committed to the reforms to make power sector and its
entities financially viable. However, given the past performance of public sector power
companies, and uneven commitment of the government for reforms the risk to
development outcome is rated as ‘Substantial’. Presently, country is facing power
shortages and relies on expensive fuel oil for power generation. Meeting energy deficit
and bringing low cost power generation would require huge investment. Simultaneously,
transmission and distribution also needs strengthening for power evacuation and dispersal.
Therefore, the situation is going to persist and it is difficult to have reliable transmission
and distribution network when the system is facing severe power shortfalls. The Bank
should also remain engaged with the IEs to draw upon the achievements, lessons learned
and capacity enhanced made possible through many years of engagement under EDTIP.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Unsatisfactory
Project objectives were well-defined and were consistent with national priorities and CPS
objectives. Preparation of the project, however, spanned over 4 years (which was too
long) and did more than required on the fiduciary side. The Bank team exercised due
diligence in establishing the technical foundation of the project. Extensive review of


                                               22
feasibility studies was done by the bank team. The Bank performance in ensuring quality
at entry, however, is rated as Unsatisfactory because of following shortcomings:

     •   The risks to the project were adequately identified but were underestimated.
     •   The indicators measured overall performance of the entity but failed to measure
         interim progress of the project. The indicators were not directly linked to the
         project intervention and failed to measure the development objectives.
     •   The Bank team identified several control issues pertaining to financial
         management e.g. (i) no systematic coding system for tagging of fixed assets, (ii)
         lack of financial independence; and (iii) lack of controls in the billing system.
         Despite these issues the FM arrangements were rated as satisfactory and neither
         the risk matrix nor the legal covenants captured these major risk factors.
     •   Some of the bidding documents were prepared in advance but needed revision and
         lot of time was spent on iterations.
     •   Adequate operating procedures were not put in place for strict adherence to the
         Procurement Plan. During implementation, there were recurrent issues like
         iterations in documents, leakage of procurement related confidential information,
         delays in implementing PAP, unusual bidding patterns – possible indicators of
         collusion, irrational delays in processes, etc.
     •   The long time spent on preparation was counterproductive to some extent as other
         agencies completed the preparation and approval process while the Bank was still
         appraising and therefore EDTIP was competing for candidate investments.
     •   Four years given for implementation by the appraisal team was too ambitious for
         a distribution projects and did not account for the complexities involved and
         unexpected events.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Unsatisfactory

Comprehensive review missions were conducted annually during the first two years and
every six months thereafter including field visits that covered wide area. Covering five
separate IEs having project components spread over a large area of two provinces was a
major issue affecting the quality of oversight. Despite these difficulties the Bank’s
technical, safeguard and fiduciary teams provided regular support and made some
positive contributions as described below:

     •   Technical support was extended from the Bank side in assisting the DISCOs to
         revise the specifications according to internationally accepted standards. In order
         to expedite the process different DISCOs were encouraged to lead in updating
         different specifications. 18 The revised specifications were adopted by all the


18
 IESCO took the lead in updating the Technical specifications relating to ST grid station equipment and
LESCO took the lead with respect to GIS equipment.

                                                   23
    DISCOs for inclusion in the bidding documents. The exercise helped in reducing
    time taken for BD / BER approvals and contract implementation. The prominent
    concerns addressed were: (a) The specifications were revised and simplified in
    accordance with the latest “International Electro-technical Commission”
    specifications to facilitate large scale participation and competition, (b) a number
    of internationally accredited Testing facilities were required to be specified, from
    which manufacturers could present successful testing results carried out as per
    specification for the purpose of acceptance of the procured/installed item, and (c)
    where a specification required an equipment as manufactured by a particular
    manufacturer, (due to technical performance history or other valid reasons), the
    specification was revised to add the words “or equivalent”. This meant that if a
    prospective Bidder could provide the same or better quality equipment with
    respect to technical specification his entry into competition was not be restricted
    by a particular make. Main findings of the detailed technical review of four
    representative ICBs (one from each DISCO) are discussed in Annex 10.
•   For procurement the Bank team closely interacted with all IEs and reported the
    issues and their mitigation measures in every aide memoire issued after a
    supervision mission. However despite the constant follow-up with IEs on
    mitigation measures it had only limited results due to absence of ownership,
    inadequate structure for knowledge/ learning retention and capacity building. The
    IPR report of the project however discussed the Bank’s team performance as
    satisfactory based on a sample of 27 contracts.
•   During the implementation phase, the Bank’s safeguard team worked closely with
    the IEs for the effective safeguard implementation. The Bank’s safeguard team
    conducted trainings for the IAs’ safeguard personnel and also carried out
    extensive field visits during the implementation supervision missions. Guidance
    was also provided for effective field monitoring, comprehensive documentation,
    preparation of QPRs, and conducting third party validations.
•   While initial orientation on social safeguards was delayed from the Bank’s side,
    regular support was provided during the subsequent stages. The Bank’s safeguard
    team conducted trainings for the IAs’ safeguard personnel and also carried out
    extensive field visits during the implementation supervision missions. Guidance
    was also provided for effective field monitoring, comprehensive documentation,
    preparation of QPRs, and conducting third party validations.
•   The Bank also provided clear guidance on development of Standard Operating
    Procedures for compensation payments and organized workshops to create
    consensus and build awareness. However, the DISCOs were not able to reform
    their compensation assessment process and continue to implement the earlier
    procedures.
•   Improvements were made on Bank’s advice in asset management especially in
    depreciation rates and charging of overheads to capital work in progress. This
    benefitted the IEs in financial terms as these costs are included by NEPRA in
    calculating the distribution margin.



                                        24
Implementation support missions identified almost similar issues and raised those with
the government as well for appropriate remedial action. Though IPR report of the Project
has rated Bank performance during implementation as satisfactory the Bank did not take
a stronger stance against mishandling of procurement, delay in finalizing the bidding
documents, and repeated reneging of the remedial actions. Due to poor performance
project restricting was inevitable but was done too late as a result underlying issues were
not addressed in a timely manner. Consequently, the project performance did not improve
and the Bank decided to close the project because of its unsatisfactory status despite
several requests for extension from the IEs. Also, EDTIP experience compares very
unfavorably with ADB that committed around US$ 800 million under the distribution
multi-tranche financing facility (MFF) and the Bank could not commit US$ 250 million
even with more time. One reason why Bank experience is not as good as ADB is because
ADB had monitoring consultants for each DISCO, reporting to ADB – and also to the
DISCOs – in place, with financing while the Bank did not and therefore its supervision
was weak and inadequate.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
Given Unsatisfactory rating both for quality at entry and supervision, the overall Bank
performance is also rated as Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
Although the government’s commitment to the PDO was high its support to continue
with the reforms during implementation phase remained low. Despite the early successes
with respect to the restructuring of the sector and establishment of a regulatory
framework and attracting substantial private sector investment, efforts to improve the
overall supply efficiency and commercialization of the WAPDA successor companies,
GENCOs and DISCOs in particular, remained lethargic. The development of the
competitive wholesale electricity market (an indicative trigger for APL2) still has a long
way to go. Electricity supply has not kept up with demand and from a generation capacity
surplus situation in 2002 shortages started to emerge by 2005 during peak periods and
during the winter, when hydro generating capacity was low. By 2012, the supply demand
gap in the NTDC power system reached a maximum of 6,000MW. The cost of generation
increased rapidly because of the increasing proportion of thermal generation in the
system combined with external factors such as increases in international fuel prices, a
weakening of the Pakistan Rupee and decrease in domestic natural gas available to the
power sector. Tariff revisions did not keep up with the rapidly increasing cost, leading to
inadequate revenue for timely payments to IPPs and fuel suppliers (also referred as inter-
corporate arrears or circular debt) and subsidy bill also increased constraining federal
budget. The DISCOs never became creditworthy and private investment in the power
sector started to dry up. All of the above factors contributed to the deep and enduring
crisis the power sector in Pakistan is facing today. Based on preliminary estimates, the
poorly performing electricity sector is thought to have reduced GDP growth by two
percent a year for the past several years.
                                            25
The problems and potential solutions to the recovery of the Pakistan energy sector are
well understood but until recently the political will to undertake deep structural reforms
has been wanting. Government is now trying to address these challenges by accelerating
the power sector reforms 19, albeit too late to save the project. Therefore, government
performance in support of the project is rated as Unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
Despite being largely in compliance with fiduciary and safeguard requirements (as shown
in paras below) considering significant delays in project implementation and resolution of
implementation issues which were in control of the DISCOs reflect poorly on their
commitment to achieve development objectives. Though some IEs have performed better
than the others even their performance is not up to the mark and therefore their collective
performance is rated as ‘Unsatisfactory’. As explained in the sections above most of the
delays are not directly attributable to IEs performance but deficiencies in capacity to
monitor and address operational bottlenecks were major contributors to the unsatisfactory
outcome of the project.

Environmental Safeguards. The IEs established safeguard units within their respective
organizations and engaged environmental and social safeguard specialists within these
units. Environmental aspects were incorporated in the construction contracts and
ESA/ESMP compliance was made a contractual obligation for the contractors. The
safeguard units carried out regular field monitoring and on-going trainings for the IA
personnel as well as for the consultants and contractors. They also produced quarterly
progress reports on a regular basis. However, the ESA/ESMP compliance remained
patchy and inconsistent primarily due to inadequate awareness of environmental
safeguards at the management level within the IAs and also because of lack of experience
at the consultant and contractor level. The entities also conducted third party validations
but most of these assessments were ineffective and inconsequential.

Social Assessment. At the start of the Project, there was no institutional mechanism in the
DISCOs to implement social issues. Each entity created Environment and Social
Implementation Cells which played a key role in raising awareness on social issues. They
also played a key role in creating awareness at the field implementation level (among
contractors). Each DISCO also hired a Third Party Monitoring Agent that provided
feedback on implementation of social safeguards on the ground. Third Party Monitoring
Reports indicated slow but gradually improving standards of compliance on social
safeguards. An example was the regular maintenance of systems for complaint redressal
at each site. The ESICs also gradually built a presence to perform several other key
functions such as the maintenance of database on compensation payments. However, the
Project continued its existing system of using the land revenue officers (Patwari) and


19
  Early actions by the government have included settling PKR 4.8 billion circular debt in June 2013,
adopting a National Power Policy in July 2013, and increasing tariffs by 32% in August and October 2013.
                                                   26
concerned SDO as the assessors of compensation payments for Transmission Line work.
The ESIC was not part of this process and could not play a role in prompt assessment,
public consultations and outreach on the assessment process and replying effectively to
public grievances in this regard. This impacted on the efficacy of ESIC.

Financial Management: The IEs remained compliant with the financial covenants albeit
with some delay in submission of audited financial statements. NTDC submitted its
audited financial statements for FY2012 and FY2013 after the due dates for which Bank
had to invoke remedial measures.

Procurement: As per the Independent Procurement Review conducted by the Bank
through M/s Ernst and Young, which is based on a sample of 27 contracts, the
compliance by IEs with Bank’s Guidelines and procedures was only 26%.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
Performance of both the Government and the IEs is rated as unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)
Mixing Reforms and Investments
The project was designed as an APL that coupled investment and reforms. An important
lesson relearned through this operation is that it is better not to load investment project
with policy reforms. It is better to do an investment project and then complement it with
broader sector reforms and governance reforms of the utility.

Project Design.
Design of the project should be flexible so that during implementation the Bank can agree
as much change as possible with the implementing entity without requiring
administrative approvals and formal amendments to the project legal agreements. This
would make project restructuring e.g. dropping sub-projects and picking up others,
shifting funds from one entity to another and from one category to another easy and
simple for effective implementation. This flexibility would also allow to create
competition among IEs by comparing their performance and success can be reinforced by
routing more financing to the entities that are performing comparatively better than the
others.

The implementation delays could have been avoided if the key issues were identified and
addressed during the design stage through either lending or non-lending technical
assistance. For example, preparation of technical specifications should have been done at
the design stage so that by the time the project is approved it is ready for implementation
at least for the first year.

At the design stage, careful consideration must be given to relationship between the
articulation of the PDO and the information needed to be able to measure progress
against that PDO. There are two distinct but related lessons that can be drawn:
                                            27
   •   First is the importance of linking the PDO to indicators that are available to the
       project. The PDO for EDTIP was generic, overambitious and mixed investment
       and reforms. Comprehensive measurement of such a complex and wide ranging
       PDO would have required a broad range of indicators. The utilities, which were
       poorly performing, did not have access to reliable information with which to
       measure those parts of the PDO which they could influence. For those parts of the
       PDO over which they had no influence they did not have either the means or
       incentive to collect data. The lesson is that indicators should be limited to those
       that can be measured reliably based on existing information or that which can be
       reliably developed as a result of improvements in data collection that result from
       the project.
   •   Second, where it is clear that measurement of the PDO cannot be supported by the
       data available from the implementing agencies, and are unlikely to become
       available during the project, early action is needed. In the case of EDTIP, one
       option could have been to restructure the PDO to something simpler and which
       could have been reliably measured with the data available from the implementing
       entities. A second option could have been to provide funds to support improved
       data collection efforts (for example through the development of SCADA
       systems). It would probably not have been feasible to add implementing entities
       or other means by which both actions and measurement of their effects relevant to
       the reform aspects of the project, and hence this option should have been dropped.

Implementation.
When new utilities are created after unbundling, they face the challenge to re-align their
structures and processes to function as corporate entities. This is a huge change
management exercise and most utilities require hand-holding support. In this case,
therefore, it may have been better to start at a smaller scale with only one or two utilities
(NTDC and one DISCO) instead of five, help them develop a Business Plan to identify
priorities and provide them with Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening
support during the project preparation period. This experience in parallel to consultation
workshops involving utility officials would have helped develop a robust project design
and the project could have been expanded with additional financing.

Use of Consultants/Owner’s Engineer. In utilities facing governance problems, the use of
consultants in all phases of the processes for implementation of investments in electricity
infrastructure (preparation of technical specifications and bidding documents,
participation in the evaluation of proposals, supervision of execution of works, etc.)
should be mandatory. The consultants would constitute a small portion of the total budget
and can serve a dual purpose. On the one hand, consultants will assist the client to
properly carry out operations in all stages. On the other hand, will be the “eyes and ears”
of the Bank’s project teams to monitor that the rules for procurement and supervision are
actually applied and enforced.

Timely preparation of ESAs strictly in accordance with the Bank’s requirements was the
key towards achieving the overall safeguard compliance for the EDTIP. On the other
hand, the Bank’s safeguard team did not consistently carry out follow-up of the actions
                                           28
agreed during the ISMs. Use of consultants as mentioned in above point could have
helped resolve these issues and to build the capacity of the IEs and their safeguards
personnel.

Utility Management. It is unrealistic to design and implement a project that requires
change in governance with an existing management team. Therefore, change in
management should be a component of the project and if the management is not in favor
of the needed reforms there are two options – either drop that utility (meaning Bank
should have been tougher during implementation) or ring fence actions to fund capacity
building in a systemic way.

Adequate staffing and effective internal audit are critical for good financial management.

Other Project Specific Lessons Learned
A very similar project of Asian Development Bank (ADB), US$ 800 million multi-
tranche power distribution enhancement investment program, is one of the better
performers in its portfolio and has also performed better than the EDTIP. Comparing
Bank experience with other financiers could help improve future operations not only in
the electricity sector but in other sectors as well. Similarly, close donor coordination
would also help address common issues faced during implementation. For example, the
issue of On Load Tap Changer (OLTC) in particular also affected few other
DISCOs/contracts not financed by the Bank.

Also related to the issue of OLTC, the matter of equivalence of technical characteristics
for OLTC created an ambiguity which was used by local manufacturers to effectively
keep at bay competition from other manufacturers of main equipment from outside the
country. A clear stance by the Bank not to use a ‘brand name or equivalent’ in the
bidding documents particularly if standards to define technical characteristics were
available could have avoided this controversy and delays.

In case of ELR sub projects on the 11kV distribution side, pilferage prevention measures
have shown to be more cost effective than technical energy loss reduction measures
particularly if installation of capacitors is exhausted and high loss area is targeted. For
example, the ABC sub project in HESCO, though the most costly pilferage prevention
measure, has an average cost of US$ 0.141 invested per kWh saved annually recurring.
The overall technical energy loss reduction measures in MEPCO cost US$ 1.233 invested
per kWh saved annually recurring. For a comprehensive electricity distribution project
pilferage reduction measures should therefore be given due consideration while deciding
on allocation of resource.

The key lesson learned was to link critical institutional reform on social and
environmental safeguards with the Project’s progress. Institutional reform on social
safeguards, particularly on compensation payments, remains critical to the DISCOs
functioning as modern, efficient entities embodying good practices on social issues.
There needs to be a greater upfront assessment of appetite for reform and a systematic
system to implement and monitor them.

Except for NTDC all companies submitted their project completion reports. NTDC could
not do so because it had only one project which is not complete. The ICR report is based
on the data and information provided by the IEs and as such their issues and suggestions
are reflected in this report. The summary of borrower ICR is given in Annex 7.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
The project funded Secondary Transmission and Grid (STG) system expansion and
Energy Loss Reduction (ELR) program in four 20 of the nine public sector distribution
companies, one grid station and associated transmission line of National Transmission
and Dispatch Company (NTDC) and provided technical assistance to the four DISCOs,
NTDC and MOWP. There was also a component on Energy Efficiency but it was
dropped in 2012 restructuring. The outputs and outcomes for each component are
discussed below:

Component A – Strengthening Distribution Network
As shown in Table 2.1, 75 sub-projects under this component were completed by the
Project Closing Date (PCD). This represents 66% of the total number of sub-projects and
82% of the awarded. 23 number of sub projects valuing about US$ 32 million were not
awarded and another 16 sub-projects again valuing US$ 32 million could not be
completed by the PCD. It is estimated that expenditures of about US$ 15 million
associated with these on-going subprojects went beyond the PCD and will be funded by
IEs themselves 21. In terms of value, DISCOs were able to complete about 61% of the
subprojects that were awarded.

Secondary Transmission and Grid (STG): Number of grid Stations (new, augmentation,
conversion and extensions) completed under the project is 53 out of 59 (awarded). Details
are given in Table 2.2. All the augmentations, conversions and extensions barring couple
with litigation issues have been completed and commissioned. There are few new grid
stations that were under construction at the time of project closing and are likely to be

  All IEs were informed that the Bank will only finance the work completed, goods delivered or services
rendered up to the PCD. Expenditures incurred after the PCD will be financed from IEs own resources.

 completed by September 2014. These are Bahter More and Gangal in IESCO, Saggian
 and Mominpura in LESCO and DG Khan in MEPCO. In addition, there were four high
 value STG contracts that despite being at final stage of award when the project was
 restructured in June 2012 could not be awarded – these include two new grid stations
 (Askari X and Punjab University) and 40MVA power transformers in LESCO that were
 not awarded because of pending LESCO Board approval and were later scrapped by the
 LESCO Board and 200kVA distribution transformers contract in MEPCO that could not
 be awarded because of the stay order by the High Court.

Electricity Loss Reduction (ELR): Supply and installation of Aerial Bundled Conductors
(ABC) in HESCO could not be completed. The contract was awarded in June 2012 but
pace of work remained slower than planned. This was because of the difficult work
environment and during the initial period of implementation lot of time was spent on
building consumer awareness regarding this project. As of PCD, 1282 job orders out of a
total of 1707 were completed and the overall physical progress is estimated to be 60%.
IESCO has completed the ELR component. MEPCO has procured all the material funded
under the project and implementation is being done by MEPCO and is expected to be
completed by October 2014. LESCO did not have any ELR component under this project.
Outcomes: The two key indicators to measure the outcome of the Component A were: (i)
amount of electricity handled by the network, (ii) level of T&D losses (technical and non-
technical) and (iii) non-collection.
(i) Amount of electricity handled by the network remained less than anticipated due to
supply shortfall. Therefore, even the targets revised downwards in 2012 could not be
achieved with an extended time frame. As shown in Table 2.3, the amount of electricity
handled was expected to grow at the rate of 5.9% originally (FY12 Target), was revised
down to yield 2.2% growth (FY13 Target) and was able to achieve only 1.1% growth
(FY13 Actual). This is because the generation during FY07 to FY12 practically remained
stagnant around 95 tera-watt-hours (TWh) and it is extremely difficult to improve
distribution reliability without having adequate generation capacity. Number of
consumers in the four DISCOs, however, grew at 4.5% from 9.4 million in FY07 to 12.2
million in FY13 and this indicator exceeded the target. The data provided indicates that
there has been no improvement in reliability and quality of supply, mainly on account of
being over taken by 6-8 hours of service interruption due to load-shedding in a day in
peak summer and winter seasons. Increase in number of consumers and allowing load
growth of existing consumers without corresponding increase in generation mainly
contributed to increase in load shedding duration. Figure 2.1 shows that while demand
has continued to grow and there is some addition in the installed generation capacity, the
production has remained almost at the same level for the past several years.

(ii) T&D losses show a declining trend and the entity-wise performance is mix as only
IESCO and MEPCO were able to achieve the revised target losses. While, HESCO and
LESCO have failed to meet the loss targets revised upwards in June 2012. Within the
overall losses the ST or 132kV systems losses have generally shown improvement in
most of the DISCOs due to capacity expansion under EDTIP, whereas the losses on 11kV
side have either increased or reduced only marginally.
 (iii) At the time of appraisal, DISCOs had very good collection rate 22 – 98/99% in
IESCO, LESCO and MEPCO and 86% in HESCO. The investments in STG and ELR
were not directly related to improvement in collection particularly when there is no
evidence that while selecting the ST expansion or 11kV ELR project any emphasis was
given to the revenue losses. For example a new grid station (STG) in an area where
collection is better will improve the average collection rate. Despite the missing link the
project assumed that the collection ratio in HESCO will improve to 90% and for others it
will remain close to 99%. On the contrary the collection ratios show a declining trend,
which is steeper in case of HESCO. The decline in collection can primarily be attributed
to administrative issues but the situation was exacerbated due to increase in cost, change
in consumer mix, law and order, etc. The indicator relating to collection in a way could
be linked to Component C (capacity building) and/or dropped Component D that
involved smart metering. For example, capacity building could have included imparting
training skills, providing equipment/transport facilities to disconnection/reconnection
personnel and introducing better commercial accountability systems. Remote monitoring

     Revenue collected as a percentage of revenue billed during the year.

                                                       35
and disconnection facility by means of installation of smart meters would have been even
more effective in improving revenue collection.
In summary, the objectives of Component A have not been met fully even though some
of the issues were not in direct control of the DISCOs’ management.


Component B – Transmission Network
This component involved construction of a new 220kV grid station at Kassowal and
associated transmission lines to reduce the loading at Yousufwala and Vehari grid station
and remove the bottleneck to supply power to MEPCO. Two separate contracts for
transmission and grid station were awarded - transmission line is complete and physical
progress of grid station is about 79%. The grid station component has passed the
scheduled completion date by about 20 months and is now expected to be completed by
December 2014. Portion of the expenditure going beyond the PCD to be met by NTDC is
estimated to be about US$ 6 million. At completion, the component is expected to
achieve its output in terms of reduced loading and providing capacity for load growth at
adjacent grid stations of Vehari and Yousufwala where growth is still restricted due to
overloading as at the time of appraisal.


Component C – Technical Assistance - TA
The objective of the TA component was to strengthen the capacity of the IEs through
procurement of expertise, IT solutions, and specialized studies. The TA component was
mainly used by the DISCOs for training purposes and therefore as part of 2012
restructuring a large portion of the TA component (US$ 4 million) unlikely to be utilized
was reallocated to the MOWP TA, to support some urgent priorities, including the
preparation of programs for power trade with neighboring countries. The scope of TA
component, however, remained limited to hiring of few individuals to analyze tariffs and
subsidies and provided general support/advice to the MOWP and therefore additional
US$ 2 million were cancelled from the MOWP TA component in 2014 to be reallocated
to the Pakistan program.
Besides hiring of individual and trainings the TA component was used to hire an
international procurement advisor (IPA). This was to address the weaknesses highlighted
in the procurement system identified during appraisal. The hiring of the IPA was delayed
and the DISCOs have yet to adopt the procurement manual prepared by the IPA. In
addition, some portion of the TA component was used to carry out pilot studies by
Alternative Energy Development Board. The TA component should have been utilized
during the initial phase of the project to overcome the issues and build the capacity so
that the project could be implemented effectively and efficiently. On the contrary,
trainings and other activities were carried out towards the end of the project and therefore

                                            36
these activities also failed to derive the expected benefits of supporting the
implementation of the Project. This component, therefore, has made very little
contribution and only a small fraction of what was envisaged at the time of appraisal was
achieved.
Other development partners, particularly USAID, are supporting the DISCOs in the areas
indicated in the appraisal document e.g. corporate governance, financial management,
inventory and asset management, demand management, corporate planning etc.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The main benefits of the project are to be derived from the increase in sales due to
enhanced transformation and transmission capacity and lower power purchases due to
reduction in losses. Other benefits include improvement in the quality of supply e.g.
reduction in breakdowns and outages, improved voltage profile, and loading but these
could not be quantified because of absence of adequate and reliable data. For comparison,
the results of economic and financial analysis, at appraisal, are presented in Table 3.1.

Financial Analysis/Return
The distribution margin (DM) determined by NEPRA allows the return on net assets
equal to DISCO’s weighted average cost of capital 23. The financial return of the project
of 17% (on-lending rate in rupee terms) is thus assured provided DISCOs meet the target
for collection and system losses. Regardless of their low collection rates DISCOs retain
their DM in full while payments to NTDC/CPPA for the power procured are either not
made or gets delayed. Over the last five years the trade debts have increased by manifolds
even in good DISCOs like IESCO 24 and their current ratios are also less than 1 making
these companies financial unviable without the government support. While impact of
non-collection does not appear directly in the income statements, DISCOs also accrue
losses if they fail to meet NEPRA target for system losses. NEPRA has progressively
reduced these targets overtime and most DISCOs are unable to meet these targets by wide
margin and therefore DISCOs are unable to recover the actual costs and as shown in
Table 3.2 are in perpetual loss. The results are erratic because DISCOs use cash system


23
  The DM, determined by NEPRA for company as a whole, covers O&M cost, depreciation and
provide a rate of return which is equal to the weighted average cost of capital. Similarly, project
specific distribution margin will cover its O&M cost, depreciation and a rate of return equal to
17% which was the on-lending rate for the IEs for this loan and therefore project specific DM
could be significantly different from the average. The DM for new investment would be higher
compared to average which included fully depreciated assets.
24
  Accounts payable turnover for IESCO has increased from 100 days in FY08 to more
than 200 days in FY13. The performance of other three DISCOs is expected to be even
worse.

                                                38
of accounting and timing of notification of distribution tariffs could vary these margins
significantly e.g. regulated losses in one accounting cycle are recovered during the next
cycle and vice versa. The ELR component would tend to reduce these losses as the
benefits from ELR arise out of reduced number of units to be purchased and consequent
reduction in power purchase cost for meeting the same demand will increase the financial
benefits or reduce the losses by reducing the implied penalty of not meeting the NEPRA
target.

The EDTIP was missing a comprehensive revenue protection program while the legal
covenants to ensure financial viability of the entities were either not met or were met with
significant delay. As a result the financial performance has deteriorated and sector needs
broad reform measures for sustainable investment in transmission and distribution
companies.

Assumptions for Economic Analysis
The analysis is based on the actual/latest estimates provided by the IEs in respect of
works completed or expected to be completed using IEs own resources. For few variables
where actual data was not available PAD assumptions have been retained. The major
assumptions are described below:

   i.   In the absence of actual data for taxes, duties and transfer payments capital costs
        were converted to economic values using the percentages derived from capital
        and economic costs estimated at appraisal. Entity-wise percentage of taxes, duties
        and transfer payments to estimate economic cost are: HESCO 23%, IESCO 8%,
        LESCO 11% and MEPCO 14%.
 ii.    The PAD estimated O&M costs as percentage of capital cost ranging from 2% to
        4%. Same percentages were applied for the ex-post analysis, as these percentages
        are close to current averages.
 iii.   Valuing reduction in losses: The reduction in losses will displace the marginal
        fuel cost which is assumed to be Furnace Oil (FO) based generation being most
        expensive and last in the dispatch merit order. The average energy charge for FO
        based thermal generation in NEPRA tariff determination for FY14 is PKR
        18.25/kWh and is taken to measure the economic benefits of energy saved
        through ELR sub-component. The benefits of ELR (in terms of annual units
        saved) would increase annually due to load growth; however this aspect has not
        been included for a conservative estimate.

                                            39
  iv.        Valuing incremental sales: The PAD conservatively assumed average DM
             ranging from Re 1 – 1.50/kWh as the proxy for the economic value of distribution
             services including the increase in sales. The same methodology is used for the
             ICR. However, consumer surplus is a relevant measure of benefits for non-grid
             electricity alternatives and a sensitivity analysis is done using the difference
             between willingness-to-pay and cost of supply as an estimate for consumer
             surplus:
                 a. Based on the WTP survey of 142 consumers in six districts in Punjab
                     (2011) and updated in 2014 for Dasu Hydropower Project Stage 1
                     appraisal the weighted average WTP is estimated to be PKR 32.9/kWh.
                     For a conservative estimate it is assumed that the grid electricity can be
                     supplied through most expensive FO based thermal generation adjusted
                     for 20% Transmission & Distribution losses, 10% non-collection and PKR
                     1.1/kwh DM. Based on this the consumer surplus is estimated to be PKR
                     6.3 (WTP: PKR 32.9 minus Cost of Supply: PKR 26.6).
   v.        Costs and benefits are projected over a 30 year period from 2009 to 2038.
  vi.        A discount rate of 10% is used to calculate the net present value, same as in the
             PAD.
vii.         Measuring Project Benefits. The project comprises of two distinct and separate
             activities: (i) Provision of enhanced transformation capacity 132/11 kV at the Sub
             transmission (ST) Level along with any associated ELR benefit due to 132kV
             Transmission network and (ii) Energy Loss reduction at 11/0.4 kV Distribution
             level, downstream of 132 kV. The project appraisal and other documents did not
             provide adequate details regarding how the energy saved through ELR component
             and incremental sales derived from the STG component were estimated. However,
             for the ICR the methodology to calculate the benefits in terms of additional sales
             and units saved is explained below:
                 a. Capacity enhancement at 132 kV is targeted to provide additional
                     capacity where existing capacity has been saturated and further load
                     growth of existing consumers or access to new consumers cannot be
                     technically accommodated. The main benefit of such projects is increase
                     in sale revenue by regaining denied load growth and consumer addition. It
                     is measured in terms of the additional units sold on account of Load
                     growth now made possible by the additional capacity created through the
                     project. In case of new grid stations it is assumed that 40% of the newly
                     installed capacity will be taken over from the nearby overloaded grid
                     stations and with a 7% Load growth, 7% of 40%= 2.8% of capacity
                     utilization will result in the additional annual sales to the extent of
                     additional capacity utilization made possible through the new capacity
                     added. 25 Similarly in case of enhancement of capacity of an existing Grid



25
    Additional sales for a 20 MVA new Transformer capacity addition = 20*0.9*0.4*8760*0.6/1000 =37.84Million kWh, where 0.9 is the factor to
convert MVA to MW, 0.4 is portion of capacity utilized in the first year after installation, 8760 is the number of hours in a year and 0.6 is the Load factor
to obtain the units sold in the year out of 8760.


                                                                            40
   station, if the capacity is enhanced by 100%, which is generally the case,
   the enhanced capacity Transformer will be already loaded to 50% on
   installation and with a 7% Load growth, 7% of 50%= 3.5% of capacity
   utilization will result in the additional annual sales to the extent of
   additional capacity utilization made possible through the new capacity
   added. Data of actual year wise MVA capacity addition was obtained from
   the DISCOs. Moreover, new Grid stations can provide associated ELR
   benefits due to reduced length of transmission lines and reduced loading
   on existing transmission lines. Data regarding annual kWh loss reduction
   in units, calculated on the basis of applying standard ELR estimation
   methodology, was provided by DISCOs.
b. ELR Distribution subprojects are targeted to reduce technical losses in
   distribution lines at 11kv and 0.4 kV. The number of such completed sub-
   projects is large (603 in IESCO and 91 in MEPCO). Therefore, where data
   was available, kWh loss reduction in units, calculated on the basis of
   applying standard ELR estimation methodology, was provided by DISCOs.
   Where work wise detailed data was not available or too large to collect
   and compile, sample data of a few works was obtained. The average
   energy loss reduced per sub project was estimated and was applied to total
   works completed in that category in order to obtain total unit reduction on
   annual basis. Such ELR works also included other categories of ELR
   measures such as installation of capacitors or replacement of old/ defective
   meters with new digital meters. The annual units saved from all the sub-
   projects were combined to provide the annual units saved on account of
   ELR.
   In the case of HESCO, ELR sub projects were targeted to reduce only
   Pilferage Loss, by installing Aerial Bundled conductor and service cables
   (ABC) in selected areas where direct hooking to low voltage lines for
   pilferage was taking place. The ELR ABC project in HESCO also
   included installation of new digital meters and associated equipment
   required to replace defective meters of existing consumers or provide
   meters to consumers who were not being metered earlier. The cost of the
   project was therefore taken in totality as ABC along with associated
   equipment and meters. For calculating benefits from ABC, the difference
   between units sold in the project area, for a certain period after completion
   of the project was compared to the units sold for a similar period prior to
   the initiation of the project .The difference was considered as the reduction
   in energy Loss or units saved on account of the project. This assessment
   does not include the increase in sales due to genuine consumption
   replacing pilferage, and therefore provides a rather conservative estimate
   of units saved.
   Another benefit of the ABC project is reduced Load on Distribution
   transformers (DT), as a consequence of the project, resulting in lesser
   damage/ burn out of DTs. This benefit has been calculated on actual basis
   as cost of number of DTs saved from damage due to lower loading. It is
   assumed that without the project, damage to a certain percentage of
                                   41
               installed DTs would have continued each year. Some benefits also accrue
               because of lower loading on distribution Lines serving the project area and
               consequent reduction in technical losses. However because of the
               difficulty in obtaining any record of Loading on Low tension Lines and to
               keep the estimate of benefits on the conservative side, this portion of
               benefits has also not been included.

viii.   Costs figures used for economic and financial analysis are not consistent with the
        component-wise costs in the PAD. It is probably because the financial and
        economic analysis was not updated to reflect subsequent changes in the project
        components. This, however, should not affect the cost benefits calculation and the
        resultant returns. The ICR analysis is based on the actual costs incurred up to the
        project closing date and assumes that remaining costs will be incurred by IEs
        themselves (50% each in FY14 and FY15) to complete the ongoing sub-projects.
        Costs are summarized in Tables below:

Entity-wise Economic Analysis
The additional sales in terms of GWh as a result of STG component are significantly less
compared to appraisal estimates even after accounting for reduction in costs/scope of
work. On the other hand reduction in power purchase due to ELR component were
underestimated for MEPCO, not estimated for IESCO and were assumed for LESCO
which did not have an ELR component. ELR savings for HESCO are about the same
after adjusting for costs. The ERR for HESCO and IESCO with larger savings achieved
through ELR component have exceeded the appraisal estimate by 2-3 times mainly



                                            42
because of more than three times increase in its value 26. MEPCO also had a larger share
of ELR component and its ERR is significantly above the hurdle rate but it couldn’t
achieve the same level of savings as in IESCO and HESCO. LESCO that had an STG
component only has very low ERR particularly when valued at the average distribution
margin. The returns become significant when the additional sales are valued at consumer
surplus. If the benefits of additional sales are valued using consumer surplus approach
(see assumption ‘iv’ above) the ERR for LESCO increases from 4% to 29% and for
MEPCO from 19% to 32%.

HESCO has the highest return among all DISCOs because of its ELR component entirely
targeted to pilferage reduction measures. As the share of STG increase the return would
tend to reduce e.g. ERR for LESCO is only 4% with only STG component which is
entirely a capacity enhancement project. The consolidated performance of all four
DISCOs is summarized in Table 3.2 and entity-wise results are summarized in Table 3.3
to 3.6.

The NTDC component had only one 220/132kV new Grid station that has not been
completed and therefore precise economic analysis was not possible. The project was
awarded in March 2010 and was to be completed by Aug 2012 and is now expected to be
completed and commence operation by December 31, 2014 after a delay of more than 2
years. These delays are expected to substantially reduce the economic benefits of this
component e.g. at appraisal a delay of 2 years after incurring full project cost reduced the
ERR by one-third from 33% to 22%.

The delays in project implementation (except in the case of NTDC) did not have a major
impact on the ERR because both cost and benefit streams were delayed by the same time
period. There were few instances in which line or the grid could not be energized because
of some litigation or other issues after most of the costs were incurred but its impact on
the overall returns was negligible. Cancellation or no award reduced the NPV and didn’t
impact the ERR because neither the cost nor the benefits were accounted.

  The purchase price assumed in FY14 tariff determinations by NEPRA for the four
DISCOs ranges from PKR 11.09 to 11.67 which is more than three times the purchase
price of PKR 2.85 to PKR 3.60 assumed in the PAD.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The ICR is based on the data and information provided by the Implementing Entities.
HESCO, IESCO and LESCO also shared their experience of the project as part of their
project completion reports, which is summarized below. The comments received from
IEs on the Bank’s ICR have been incorporated in the report.

HYDERABAD ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY (HESCO)
a) Following issues faced during the implementation of the project:
   i.    Right of Way.
   ii.   Natural Climate impact such as flood, heavy rains etc.
   iii.  The material of the project issued against another sub-projects.
   iv.   Less participation of bidders in Turnkey projects.
   v.    Un-availability of project vehicles for the monitoring of the project progress
         activities.
   vi.   Law and order situations in the project areas.
   vii.  Inadequate expertise regarding procurement under World Bank guideline at
         the start of project.

b) Lesson Learnt:
   • The project was successful in that it provided a substantial increase in physical
      infrastructure and well below the budgeted cost. The projects' economic and
      social impacts will be significant.
   • In the implementation of project activities under World Bank PMU was
      established. No project performance management system was established to
      handle such a large project scattered across the whole Province except Karachi.
      Many of the sanctioned positions in the Project Management Unit (PMU)
      remained unfilled for longer spells.
   • There is a need to introduce some incentives for holding the manning on strength
      over the entire project period and to discourage the transferring of trained PMU
      staff to other units. Long term assignments should not be entrusted to staff close
      to retirement age and/or service. The Executing Agency should ensure that the
      proper logistic as well as good office conditions including the state –of-the-art
      working tools are provided to the PMU.
   • However, following are improved:
      1. Improved procurement skills as per guidelines of World Bank.
      2. Environment and Social activities has been started in all the projects.
      3. Engagement of consultants for Design and monitoring of projects has
          enhanced the capability of HESCO Engineers for capacity buildings of
          Engineers.
      4. Specific trainings provided by the World Bank.
      5. Grooming of the engineers with the interaction of World Bank Missions.
      6. Learned the best practices used all over the world.


                                          50
c) Suggestions & Implementation of Similar Projects
The overall Capacity of HESCO would need to be developed for enhancing their
functional and managerial skills by imparting regular training on Project Management
tools, Procurement processes, Contract management, Environment and Social safeguards
implementation and Legal and Regulatory framework compliance. The aforesaid
measures will resultantly, improve the functional role of HESCO to get on the projects of
multifaceted nature and magnitude.


ISLAMABAD ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY (IESCO)
a) Critical Issues
As is inevitable in every project life cycle, procurement packages under APL-1 of EDTIP
have had its share of bottlenecks and road bumps. Although each one contributed to the
head wind and delayed the project tasks, yet through hard work, dedication and guidance
of World Bank, things finally took shape and the project objectives are, slowly but surely,
materialized. Lessons are learnt and utilized as guidance for the success of future
endeavors with World Bank and other donor agencies projects. The experience gained
has been put to an effective use and the previously committed mistakes have been
minimized. Some of the critical issues, which had been a source of concern, are:
      –     Less or no participation by bidders.
      –     Late finalization and submission of Bid Evaluation Report (BER) by the
            Consultant due to his heavy workload.
      –     Delay on part of World Bank in issuance of NOC for bidding documents.
      –     Lesser prices quoted for the identical items in other DISCOs by the same or
            different bidders.
      –     Amendment in WAPDA/IESCO specifications for certain electrical
            equipment by World Bank.
      –     Delay in according approval of BER by World Bank.
      –     Government policies.
      –     Non-availability of vehicles for project monitoring.
      –     Lack of incentive for PMU.

b) World Bank Performance
The World Bank provided continued support and assistance for ensuring timely project
implementation. The bank also closely and regularly monitored the project (APL-I)
progress through review measures, Quarterly Progress Reports and provided useful
advice in several areas including procurement. World Bank also ensured timely funds
disbursements and promptly responded to the requests for procurement and contract
approvals for the smooth execution of the project.
The World Bank overall performance during the project period was remained satisfactory.

c) Lesson Learnt
As it is natural that every project has some bottlenecks which are faced during execution
and caused for the delay of a project.


                                            51
As far as the Electricity Distribution and Transmission Improvement Project (APL-I) is
concerned, some difficulties during procurement and execution of sub-projects were
experienced by PMU but due to hard work, dedication and guidance of World Bank, the
project objectives were slowly but sure achieved.

However, it was observed and experienced that proper planning, trained personals and
effective monitoring mechanism play a vital role in implementation of any project.
IESCO followed the same strategy and successfully completed almost all the sub projects
without any failure.

LAHORE ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY (LESCO)
a) Summary of issues faced during implementation
   1- Availability of land was main issue which has alternately been resolved by
      selecting the alternate piece of land.
   2- Right of way problems raised by the TEPA/LDA while the selection of feeding
      transmission lines route which was resolved after negotiations with the top
      management.
   3- There was inordinate delay in the finalization of tender for procurement of power
      transformers because of controversy pertaining to the selection of OLTCs to be
      used in these power transformers which subsequently resulted in scraping the
      tender.
   4- Price preference allowed to local manufacturers for World Bank loans being less
      than the GOP/PPRA rules applicable when using own resources was challenged
      in the court and remained pending even though PPRA rules require to follow
      donor guidelines for donor funded projects.
   5- Late finalization and submission of Bid Evaluation Report (BER) by the
      Consultant including inconsistency in recommendations.
   6- Delay in procurement approvals e.g. deferment of agenda points in BOD meetings
      and repeated dissolution and reconstitution of BOD.
   7- HR issues: posts of deputy managers in PMU often remained vacant which may
      be because PMU engineers in LESCO did not get the allowance given in other
      DISCOs. In addition, Chief Engineer (Development) LESCO was reporting to the
      Technical Director whereas in other DISCOs he was directly reporting to CEO.

b) Achievement of project objectives
   1- The objective of the project was to add additional MVA capacity in the system to
      reduce the overloading of existing Power transformers. By the implementation of
      05 number 40 MVA Power transformers in the system 14x5 = 70 MVA capacity
      was added and overloading at the existing transformers removed.
   2- Similarly additional consumers were added due to this enhanced capacity at grid
      stations. Similarly by the extension of 26 MVA power transformer at one location,
      overloading of existing transformers <' t that grid station was reduced and
      additional consumers were also accommodated.
   3- By the installation of 02-No AIS Grid Stations along with feeding transmission
      lines (ready for commissioning), the overloading of nearby existing grid stations
      shall also be reduced.
                                           52
c) Lessons learned and suggestions for future planning and implementation of
   similar projects.
   1- Land should be purchased well before the start/execution of projects and should
      also be free from litigations.
   2- The coordination of all government and semi government departments on the
      level of top management should be maintained before the start of work.
   3- The comprehensive specifications for power transformers especially on OLTCs
      should be spelled out before the tendering process to avoid any complication at
      later stage.

MULTAN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY (MEPCO)
a) Lessons Learnt
World Bank APL-I was the first project which MEPCO undertook with any international
donor agency. MEPCO, therefore, learnt a lot regarding World Bank policies, rules,
regulations regarding procurement, loan agreement requirements, social and safeguards,
withdrawal and payments etc. As MEPCO now has clear understanding any further
business engagement with World Bank will be smooth. Through the World Bank project,
capacity building of MEPCO employees especially regarding ICB procurement, social
and safeguard issues has been enhanced.

b) Conclusion
MEPCO has gained heavily through World Bank (APL-I) financing. MEPCO network,
(both distribution and transmission) has improved with this project and its capacity has
enhanced. As, company has the largest network in Pakistan, therefore, investment
proposed under APL-II would if done, can further enhance the system capacity, reduction
in losses and provide better service to its customers. It is, therefore, requested that the
W.B. may consider more investment in MEPCO in following projects:-
      –     Construction of new G/Stations.
      –     Augmentation of Distribution Transformers.
      –     11KV Rehabilitation and new 11KV feeders.
      –     Improved meter reading project.

Annex 10. Review of procurement and technical aspects based on a sample of 4
ICBs (one each from IESCO, MEPCO, HESCO and two from LESCO)
General.
During the initial stages of the procurement process, the Bank, observed that the technical
requirement/specification used by DISCOs for procurement, were, not updated in line
with the latest International standards and the approval/testing process of the high voltage
testing was restricted to Tests carried out in a particular Laboratory or in a testing Lab
within the country. The specifications were reviewed by the Bank and with the input and
participation of Technical staff of DISCOs, the specifications for main Electrical
equipment and the items manufactured outside the country were revised in accordance
with the latest International technical standards. The revised specifications were adopted
by DISCOs for the purpose of procurement under WB EDTIP. The main objective of the
exercise was to ensure that the Technical specifications are in no manner restrictive to
competition or favorable to a particular vendor. The prominent concerns in this context
that were addressed in the process were: (a) DISCOs had adopted the technical
specifications for Sub Transmission part of their system from NTDC. The adopted specs
needed to be reviewed to ensure their conformity to latest Internationally accepted
specifications so that International manufacturing firms do not feel restricted in
competition with respect to any outdated or specific requirement. (b) Test results
accepted only from tests carried out in a particular testing Laboratory restricts
international competition and (c) Certain equipment specified to be acceptable only if
manufactured by a particular manufacturer restricts competition. Regarding (a) The
specifications were revised and simplified in accordance with the latest “International
Electro technical Commission” specifications to facilitate large scale participation and
competition, with respect to (b) a number of internationally accredited Testing facilities
were required to be specified, from which manufacturers could present successful testing
results carried out as per specification for the purpose of acceptance of the
procured/installed item, and for (c) where a specification required an equipment as
manufactured by a particular manufacturer,( due to technical performance history or other
valid reasons), the specification was revised, in accordance with the Bank guidelines, to
add the words “ or equivalent”. This meant that if a prospective Bidder could provide the
same or better quality equipment with respect to technical specification his entry into
competition should not be restricted by a particular make.
Causes of delay and other relevant points are discussed in detail for each of the ICBs as
follows:

IESCO, ICB-18.
ICB-18 was a “Turnkey” project relating to “Design, construction and testing of a 132/11
kV Grid station complete with control building and associated Civil works and
equipment”. The scope involved a number of Electrical equipment which were mostly
manufactured outside the country. IESCO staff had sufficient experience in procuring
individual items based on their standard specifications; however the technical design
/specifications had to be reviewed and revised to bring them in line with International
standards and conformity to the Bank guidelines. The qualification regarding experience
and handling of turnkey projects and the requirement of the Grid stations being in
successful operation for a certain period prior to Bid opening date was also considered.
                                             56
As a trade-off between achieving wholesome competition and avoiding risk of non-
performance by less experienced firms, the experience requirement was brought to a
reasonable level. The process of consultation with the DISCOs and finalizing the revised
specification, for the main equipment comprising the turnkey project of ICB, used a
substantial part of the scheduled project initiation to completion time. The delay in
submission of final “Bidding documents” by IESCO can be attributed to a large extent on
such a capacity building exercise, but the process resulted in establishing a model set of
Bid Documents for IESCO as well as other three DISCOs. The benefit of the exercise,
apart from capacity building of the DISCOs, has been realized in the shape of facilitating
adequate participation in bidding and timely completion of the contract after award. In
the final context none of the technical requirement/specifications caused any restriction in
the competitive process of bidding. Main delay occurred due to the time taken in (i)
Initiation and finalization, issuance of “No objection” to the Bidding Document, (ii)
Takeover/change of ownership of the Transmission and Distribution business of the
Lowest Bidder, after the Bid submission date, which involved the scrutiny of a lot of
documentation and consultation, seeking expert advice regarding Legal aspects and
conformity to WB guidelines.(iii) Handing over of site by IESCO to Contractor said to be
caused due to reasons beyond control of IESCO.

Sample LESCO, ICB-630-01.
ICB-630-01 was a “Turnkey” project relating to “Design, construction and testing of a
132/11 kV Gas insulated Sub-station (GIS) complete with control building and associated
Civil works and equipment”. As in the case of IESCO, the technical design
/specifications had to be reviewed and revised to bring them in line with International
standards and conformity to the Bank guidelines. A lot of initial time was used in the
process of consultation and finalizing the revised specification, for the main equipment
comprising the GIS turnkey project, involving revisiting and revisions of the Bidding
documents. The exercise, however, facilitated adequate participation in bidding and
provided essential capacity building of concerned staff for expeditious finalization of Bid
Documents for future such projects. None of the technical requirement/specifications in
this case caused any restriction in the competitive process of bidding. Other reasons of
delay in implementation process were (i) Approval of BoD of LESCO was awaited to
finalize Letter of Award to lowest responsive bidder and (ii) Payment of 10% advance
and handing over of site by LESCO to Contractor. Post award of contract, the delay in
implementation has been on account problems, altercation between Main contractor and
sub-contractors.

Sample MEPCO, ICB-12.
ICB-12 comprised of “Procurement of 11/0.4 kv, Distribution Transformers (DTr)”
25,50,100 and 200 kVa DTrs as Lots I,II,III and IV respectively.
Main delay occurred due to the time taken in (i) Dealing with the issue of suspected
collusion by Local manufacturers in the first Tender opening (ii) Expiry of Bid Validity
period on account of time taken in clarification sought by WB and response by MEPCO
in second Tender opening and (iii) Local firms entered into Litigation against MEPCO
over price preference to foreign firms in third Tender opening.

                                            57
The technical specifications for the items procured under ICB-12 were based on
internationally accepted specifications (IEC, updated specs). These specs were not
restrictive in any manner and did not contribute to the delay in the procurement process.
This is evident from the fact that a number of foreign firms participated in the bidding
process, even though retendered twice. None of the Local or foreign firms raised any
worthwhile objection to the technical aspects of the specs. The only objection, relating to
the technical aspects was made by the Local firms in the petition to court, that Stage
inspection was not required for foreign firms but required in case of local firms. This
aspect was clarified by MEPCO to the Court that the relevant IEC specs applicable in the
case do not require stage inspection for both Local as well as foreign firms.
This item of procurement was historically purchased from a few prequalified firms whose
total production capacity hardly met the total requirement of all the DISCOs within the
integrated Power company status. The demand for the product was thus shared with
respect to the production capacity of the firms. Absence of price competition from
International firms provided a comfortable working arrangement within the Local
manufacturing industry. As International firms were allowed to participate in the
competitive process based on internationally accepted technical specification standards,
the comfortable hold of the Local firms over the sharing of demand was disturbed.
Foreign firms were therefore considered strong competitors to take away some of the
share of demand. The attempt at collusion to quote the same price by five local firms in
the first tender and four local firms approaching the Courts to intervene in the matter of
awarding contract to a foreign firm declared as the Lowest evaluated bidder for Lot IV, in
the third tender in spite of price preference to Local firms, speaks of the threats perceived
by local firms in the shape of competition by foreign firms. The matter of award of
contract to LERB for Lot IV is still held up due to litigation. Local firms have thus
successfully put on hold the award of contract to a foreign firm on the ground of anomaly
between the Bank guidelines and statutory orders issued by the Government to promote
the Local manufacturing industry. Any anomaly in this context is required to be resolved
if future hindrance to International competition is to be avoided.

Sample HESCO, ICB-ELR-05.
ICB-ELR-05 comprised of “Supply, Installation and testing of Aerial Bundled conductor”
(ABC) to replace bare overhead conductors in the 0.4 kV distribution network and
installation of associated equipment/meters procured by HESCO through other ICBs. The
purpose of the sub project was to eliminate direct hooking of the bare conductors and
thereby prevent direct pilferage from overhead low tension Lines. The scope of work
comprised of supply and installation of 800 km of ABC cables/ feeders and 2159 km of
services and associated equipment and installation of 15,900 27 number new
meters/equipment associated with installation of ABC.
Main delay occurred due to the time taken in (i) finalizing the mode of procurement,
alternatives of turnkey project or own procurement, procurement and installation of
meters and service, mode of storing procured/ inspected equipment and procedure for


27
     12,013 and 3,893 meters were installed to existing and new applicants.

                                             58
handing over of any equipment procured by HESCO to the contractor, (ii) procedure for
installation /removal of network, safety measures, (iii) finalizing technical specifications
for the equipment involved in line with internationally accepted standards and (iv)
difficulty in implementation, resistance by interest groups/persons.
The technical specifications for the items procured under ICB-ELR-05, were based on
internationally accepted specifications. These specs were not restrictive in any manner
and did not contribute to the delay in the procurement process. Local firms did not have
adequate experience in the supply and installation of the insulated conductors, therefore
competition was expected only among foreign firms/ manufacturers of the specific items
and accessories required for its’ installation. The Bid documents were designed to
facilitate adequate competition from the limited number of experienced firms available in
the international market, who were willing to invest and work under the particular
working conditions in the project area within HESCO. Though 8 number (2 foreign and 6
local) firms purchased the Bid documents only two foreign firms participated in the
bidding, in spite of three extensions in Bid opening date. None of the firms raised any
objection to the technical aspects of the specs. 60% of the project has been completed and
the remaining is expected to be completed from HESCO’s own resource by end
December 2014. This ICB was a pilot project, particularly targeted to reduce pilferage.
The project completed so far has established the benefits as well as practicability of the
project. Such projects therefore need to be replicated in HESCO as well as other DISCOs
for improvement in financial sustainability as well as operational reliability.
