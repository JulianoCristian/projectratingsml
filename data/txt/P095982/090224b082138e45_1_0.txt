                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the APL1 project are to: (i) strengthen the capacity of the distribution and transmission networks to meet increasing electricity demand in the selected
                         areas more efficiently and with better reliability and quality; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity of the selected distribution companies and support other priority
                         areas of the power sector reform.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The Government and the Implementing Entities (IEs) continue to accord high priority to Objectives of the Project - to enhance the capacity of four distribution companies (HESCO,
                         IESCO, LESCO and MEPCO) and the transmission company (NTDC) to meet increasing electricity demand with greater efficiency, reliability and quality; and to strengthen their

                         Overall progress under the Project remains slower than planned. The level of commitments (contract signed) is more than 80% of the revised Loan/Credit amount, and about 67%
                         has been disbursed. Most of the contracts are likely to be completed by the project closing date but there are four high value contracts that have not been awarded. In addition, there

                         are some on-going sub-projects that are experiencing delays and at current pace of progress are expected to go beyond the project closing date. The Bank will only finance the
                         portion of the works completed or the goods delivered by the project closing date.

                         There is a need for further cancellations from the Loan and Credits, as contracts amounting to around US$ 35 million have not yet been awarded, and will therefore not be completed
                         by the revised Closing Date - February 28, 2014. These include contracts with an estimated cost of around US$ 20 million for LESCO, about US$ 4 million for MEPCO, about US$ 5
                         million under the Government's TA component, and around US$ 5 million in un-programmed amounts. The mission has agreed with the Government on a time-frame for submission
                         of a request to cancel these amounts from the Loan and Credits.

                         All IAs have started compiling data on the results – as of October 2013 63 sub-projects (i.e. 54%) have been completed under the Project. These include, inter alia: (a) the
                         completion of ten new grid stations; (b) conversion, augmentation or extension of 29 existing grid stations; (c) commissioning of about 20 transmission lines to connect those grid
                         stations to the networks; and (d) conversion, augmentation and/or extension of a further 14 grid stations by February 2014.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government should submit the request to the Bank as soon as possible for cancellation of funds that are not expected to be utilized by the Project Closing Date. The contracts
                         which have not been awarded and sub-projects that are unlikely to be completed by the closing date should be canceled. The Bank will only finance the portion of the works
                         completed or the goods delivered by the project closing date.
