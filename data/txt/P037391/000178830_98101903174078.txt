INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND REC(IDMNDATION OF TIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND FOR A HIGHIAY PROJECT
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $4.1 million to the
Republic of Iceland for a highway project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.    The Bank has made seven loans to. or guaranteed by,the Republic of
Iceland. The projects for which these loans were made have been satisfactor-
ily completed.
3.    The proposed project, the first for the transportation sector, origin-
ated in a Transport Survey, commissioned by the Government, which was com-
pleted in 1968. The Government's request for a loan in November 1968 was
based on the recommendations of this survey. Following an identification
mission in May 1969, and a preparation mission in December 1969, an appraisal
mission visited Iceland in April-May 1970 and found the proposed project to
be satisfactory.
4.    Negotiations were held in Washington in August 1970.   The delegation
from Iceland consisted of Mr. Brynjolfur Ingolfsson, Secretary General,
Ministry of Communications; Mr. Sigurdur Johannsson, Director of Roads, Pub-
lic Roads Administration; and Mr. Bjorn Tryggvason, Manager, Central Bank
of Iceland.
5.    The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Iceland as at
August 31, 1970:

6.    No other loan proposal for Iceland is expected to be submitted to the
Executive Directors for approval within this fiscal year.
7.    IFC has had no operations in Iceland and noneis contemplated in
the near future.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
8.    Borrower:            Republic of Iceland
Amount:              The equivalent in various currencies of
US $h.1 million
Purpose:             To assist in financing the construction and im-
provement of primary roads and the purchase of
highway maintenance equipment
Amortization:        In 20 years, including a four-year period of
grace, through semi-annual installments beginning
April 1, 1975 and ending October 1, 1990
Interest Rate:       7-1/4 percent
Commitment Charge:   3/4 of 1 percent
Estimated Economic Return on the Project:   17 percent
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.    An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Highway Project -
Iceland" (PTR 57a) dated September 17, 1970 is attached.
10.   In the past, coastal shipping was the dominant mode of domestic
transport in Iceland. However, since the beginning of this century, an
extensive network of motorable tracks and roads has been constructed. As
a result, road transport has now become the main mode of transport. There
are no railroads and although domestic aviation has been growing rapidly,
it is still a relatively minor goods carrier.
11.   As a result of the topography and dependence on the fishing industry,
the road system of some 12,000 km is concentrated mainly in the coastal
plains. Apart from some 50 km in the Reykjavik area, it is to gravel
standards. Responsibility for the construction and maintenance of public
roads is vested in the Public Roads Administration (PRA), which is in turn
responsible to the Ministry of Communications. It is competently staffed.
PRA will retain local consultants for the supervision of construction of
the proposed project.



-3-
12.   The proposed loan would help finance:
(i) the construction and improvement to two-lane surfaced standards
of approximately 14 km of the Vesturlandsvegur and 34 km of the
Sudurlandsvegur. The Vesturlandsvegur is the main highway going
north from Reykjavik linking the capital with the western,
northern and eastern parts of Iceland. The Sudurlandsvegur is
the main highway going south linking Reykjavik with the main
agricultural area.
(ii) supervision of construction by consultants; and
(iii) the replacement of selected items of old and uneconomic highway
maintenance equipment, and the purchase of snow-clearing equip-
ment for use on surfaced roads (largely on the project roads).
13.   The project is estimated to cost a total of US $7.7 million equivalent,
of which the construction and improvement works account for US $6.5 million,
construction supervision for US $0.7 million and maintenance equipment for
US $0.5 million. The foreign currency component is estimated at US $h.1
million equivalent, which is the basis for the proposed loan.
14.   Loan funds would be disbursed on the basis of the estimated foreign
exchange costs:
(i) 50 percent of actual payments to contractors for highway con-
struction works;
(ii) 50 percent of actual payments to consultants for supervision; and
(iii) 100 percent of the c.i.f. price of highway maintenance equipment.
Any surplus funds remaining   under the proposed loan would be cancelled.
Procurement will be carried out under full international competitive bidding
and in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
15.   The policy of the Government is to encourage industrialization so as
to diversify the economy and exports, and to minimize the dependency on the
fishing industry which leads to severe economic fluctuations because of the
uncertainty of fish catches. The development of industries around Reykjavik,
together writh the gravitation of population to the area, has already pro-
duced heavy traffic loads on the main routes near the capital. This will
increase with further development of industry. The Transport Survey gave
high priority to the replacement of these heavily trafficked gravel sections
with modern surfaced highways. The project is economically justified.
Based on savings in vehicle operating costs alone and the estimated traffic
growth rate over 20 years, the investment in the two roads would yield an
overall rate of return of 17 percent, ranging from 11 percent to 25 percent
for individual sections.



- 4 -
16.   Since the construction of roads in Iceland is very closely tied to
satisfactory weather conditions, it is important that the contracts be
awarded prior to the onset of winter.  Therefore, PRA awarded two contracts
in mid-September. PRA has followed the Bank's procurement guidelines, and
the relevant documents are satisfactory to the Bank. Financing of payments
under these contracts made from September 1, 1970 onwards appears justified
because any delay in contract award would have adversely affected the pro-
posed project. The amount of retroactive financing involved covers advances
for mobilization only and is about US $150,000.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUENTS ATD AUTHORITY
17.   The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Iceland and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the pro-
posed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Loan Agreement conforms to the general pattern of loan agreements for
similar projects.
PART V - THE ECONO\Y
18.   An economic report dated October 31, 1969 on "Current Economic
Position and Prospects of Iceland" (EMA-la) was distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors on November 12, 1969 (R69-216). A basic data sheet is
annexed.
19.   Iceland's economy has been excessively dependent on the fishing in-
dustry.  Fishing accounts for about 20 percent of Iceland's GNP and about
90 percent of her exports. Fish catches, always uncertain, fell drastically
in 1967, causing unemployment, a substantial decline in real incomes and a
large deficit in the balance of payments. The Government re-established
external equilibrium by devaluing the currency by over 50 percent and by
implementing appropriate fiscal policies. As a consequence of the drastic
devaluation, there was a marked rise in prices in 1969, consumer prices
rising by 23 percent. However, restrictive monetary and fiscal measures
ensured a much slower increase in the first half of 1970.
20.   In thelong run, diversification of the economy, especially through
industrialization, is the only effective solution for the alleviation of
its fundamental weakness. However, if new industries are to be introduced,
capital requirements, including those of the public sector, are going to be
greater. Although some of this capital will come from abroad, some will
have to come from domestic savings. A reform of the fiscal system might
contribute to this end: the efficiency of tax collection could be improved
by greater administrative centralization and by increasing emphasis on the
more important taxes while abolishing a great number of low-yield taxes.
Some of these reforms, which were also suggested in an IMF study, have
recently been implemented and sales taxes, especially, have been increased
considerably.



21.   There is awareness in Iceland of the economic problems which have to
be faced and attempts are being made to cope with them in a responsible
way. A restructuring of the economy will require foreign assistance, and
will put increasing pressure on the balance of payments. The external
debt burden is still moderate; external debt is at present slightly over
$100 million and service payments amount to some 10 percent of export earn-
ings. Iceland appears, therefore, to be eligible for external public
borrowing which would assist it in utilizing its growth potential.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOIMENDATION
23.   I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
