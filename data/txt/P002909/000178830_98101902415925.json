It would address the most urgent sector\n            needs. It would ensure the flow of foreign exchange needed\n            to prevent further deterioration of telecommunications\n            services, rehabilitate telecommunications capacity back to\n            about pre-war levels, allow the utilization of some idle\n            capacity existing in the system, and attain acceptable\n            standards of postal service. It would also place the initial\n            building blocks of institutional development - sector\n            legislation, accounting and financial control, and\n            comprehensive training. The Project has three main\n            components, namely rehabilitation of telecommunications,\n            postal and common services, technical assistance, and two\n            years' worth of imported spare parts and materials."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
