cooperatives established\n            prior to 1966 on 185,000 ha and provide additional capital\n            inputs to state farms, now under the Office des Terres\n            Domaniales (OTD), intended for eventual absorption into the\n            cooperative movement. Investments financed under the project\n            would include farm buildings, livestock buildings, farm\n            machinery, small irrigation equipment, tree crop\n            establishment, range pasture improvement, soil and water\n            conservation, livestock, managerial and technical assistance\n            and feasibility studies. The project is geared to the\n            production of hard and soft wheat as the major cash crop\n            supplemented by forage crops and livestock."}, "docdt": "1967-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
