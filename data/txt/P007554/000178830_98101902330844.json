and control pollution. The Bank loan\n            will finance the foreign exchange component of FONEI\n            financing over a period of about two years. The project will\n            also help finance a training program on industrial project\n            evaluation and supervision for financial intermediaries and\n            FONEI's staff. A national study of human resources and\n            technical and vocational training needs for further\n            industrial development will be included in the project. The\n            project presents a low level of risk with respect to the\n            soundness of subprojects it will finance since FONEI is a\n            mature financial institution; its institutional objectives\n            may take longer to achieve. On the whole, the project\n            presents a moderate level of risk."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
