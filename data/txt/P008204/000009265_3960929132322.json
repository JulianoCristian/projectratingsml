to\n            assist the government in developing a social sector strategy\n            to redirect its social expenditures into well-targeted and\n            efficient programs, by financing high priority activities,\n            within the framework of its Social Sectors Action Program.\n            The project supports: (a) rehabilitation and development of\n            the primary health care network, including provision of\n            basic health and nutrition services for pregnant and nursing\n            women and children under six years of age; (b) development\n            and expansion of pre-school education, focused on the\n            lower-income urban and rural areas; (c) information,\n            education and communications services for health, nutrition,\n            and education promotion; and (d) improvement of the\n            government's capacity to design, plan and implement\n            social programs and to monitor the effect of such programs."},
