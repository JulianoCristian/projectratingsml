                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an update of the June 2010 project ISR since a full implementation mission cannot take place because of the prevailing social and political crisis. The information for this ISR
                         is based on discussions and contacts with Ministry of Education officials until December 2010.
                         To date, the PASEF has facilitated the acquisition of 2,597,730 manuals for grades 1 and 2 (CP) and 3,828,485 manuals for the grades 5 and 6 (CM). For the CP level, distribution of
                         manuals was done in the fall of the 2010-2011 school year. Regarding the CM level, distribution of manuals has been delayed for logistical reasons. However, the Ministry of

                         Education has reached agreement with the armed forces (UN Forces, French Forces and Ivoirian Forces) to support this distribution by providing the necessary vehicles. Overall, the
                         project will assist the country to achieve a ratio of 3 books per student at CP level and 5 per student at CM level. Training of teachers on the use of textbooks took place between

                         process. A new tender was launched for the acquisition of software and hardware designed to enhance the work of the administration. A $ 1.5 million contract for the rehabilitation of
                         3 CAFOP (Bouake, Man and Khorogho) has been signed and work should start soon if the situation in the country permits. Overall implementation status is assessed as being
                         moderately satisfactory.
