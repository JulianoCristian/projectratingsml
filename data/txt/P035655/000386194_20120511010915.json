The closing date for\n            the project will be extended from August 31, 2011 until\n            August 31, 2012. The original credit was in the amount of\n            US$53.3 million and approved on May 29, 1998. The purpose of\n            this extension request is to: (i) allow for the completion\n            of contracts that have already been entered into but have\n            not been completed due to delays resulting from the\n            political situation in the country; (ii) provide much needed\n            education inputs in the post crisis environment; and (iii)\n            complete ongoing activities necessary to achieve the Project\n            Development Objectives (PDO). The extension of the closing\n            date will also support progress toward meeting the\n            Heavily-Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) completion point\n            related to textbooks, namely that '90 percent of the\n            students enrolled in all public primary schools have\n            received three textbooks covering French, mathematics, and\n            civic education, during at least the school year immediately\n            preceding the completion point'. The government had\n            purchased textbooks covering French, mathematics and civic\n            education which it intends to distribute for free to\n            students enrolled in public primary schools. This will be\n            the fifth and final extension and will result in a\n            cumulative extension of nine years and eight months from the\n            project's original closing date, requiring Regional\n            Vice President Approval."}, "docdt": "2011-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
