improve the efficiency of the\n            road and railway systems in Macedonia. The main components\n            of the project include: 1) the improvement of the\n            Tetovo-Grupcin road to lower transportation costs; 2) the\n            maintenance of the arterial and regional roads; 3) the\n            design and supervision of the pilot maintenance program; 4)\n            the supply of equipment for the Fund for National and\n            Regional Roads (FNRR); 5) the provision of technical\n            assistance and training for FNRR; the supply of equipment\n            for the Macedonia Railways (MR); and, 6) the provision of\n            technical assistance and training for MR. The project will\n            support the restructuring of MR's organization and\n            improve its financial viability. Likewise, road management\n            improvement will be supported through the provision of\n            information management systems, low-cost maintenance\n            technologies, and planning tools, as well as technical\n            assistance and training to FNRR. Key policies and\n            institutional reforms will be supported through the\n            implementation of an Action Plan aimed at restoring long\n            term viability of MR, and, the formulation of investment and\n            maintenance programs to FNRR."}, "docdt": "1999-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
