The lessons\n            learned indicate that institutional changes were important\n            in this project. Initially, in the FYR of Macedonia, there\n            was a gap in understanding of the concept and content of\n            railway restructuring between the Client and the Bank staff\n            and its consultants. In post command economy countries it is\n            difficult for Government entities to accept and put into use\n            the idea of freedom to manage. A review of major investment\n            decision (the railway IT) during the project led to its\n            elimination and project restructuring. Reviewing,\n            integrating and processing the several consultants'\n            work into an appropriate intervention is time-consuming but\n            important work."}, "docdt": "2005-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
