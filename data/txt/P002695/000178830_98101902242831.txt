REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR THE MWANZA TEXTILE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$15.0 million to the United Republic of
Tanzania to help finance the expansion of the Mwanza cotton textile project.
The loan would have a term of 22 years, including five years grace, with
interest at 8.5% per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be relent to
the Mwanza Textile Ltd. (MTL) for 13 years, including four and one-half
years of grace, at an interest of 10% per annum; MTL would bear the
exchange risk. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (Kuwait Fund)
has agreed to provide an equivalent amount to the Government to cover the
remaining US$15.0 million foreign exchange required for the project, on
a parallel financing basis. The Kuwait Fund loan would be made to the
Government for 22 years, including five years of grace with interest at
4% per annum and would be onlent to the MTL on terms and conditions
similar to the Bank loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last full economic report on Tanzania (AE-26) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 22 and June 22, 1972. This was followed
by an economic updating report (30-TA) distributed on December 11, 1972
and which was especially prepared for the East African Consultative Group
meeting on Tanzania of January 1973. A basic economic mission is scheduled
for late 1975. An agricultural sector report was issued on December 10,
1974. An industry and mining sector report and a report on the fiscal
aspects of Tanzania's recent decentralization of Government was distributed
in April 1975. The Consultative Group for East Africa met recently on
April 22-23, 1975 to discuss the progress and prospects of the Tanzanian
economy and the need for additional resources to support the Government's
development policy. Country data are provided in Annex I.
3.        Tanzania has a one-party system which is embodied in the
constitution. The party, TANU, is a well-organized mass party and is actively
engaged at the grass roots in the promotion of popular involvement in the
national development effort, and within the party democratic principles are
being strictly adhered to. In economic policy-making, the long-term objective
of social equality prevails over economic interests of minority groups; some
progress towards reducing inequality of income distribution within the
category of employed workers has been made, but large gaps continue to exist
between urban and rural standards of living.



4.        Between 1968 and 1973, GDP increased 4.8% per year in real terms.
Exports of goods and services in constant prices grew 2.8% per year during
the same period. Domestic savings were maintained at about 18% of GDP.
Investment increased from 19% of GDP to 23% with public sector investment
rising to 80% of the total investment in 1973. Annual price increases
were moderate to low. Current Government receipts more than doubled, but
current expenditures increased at similar rates so that budgetary savings
stagnated. While imports, especially of capital and intermediate goods
grew rapidly, export earnings grew very slowly and the increasing current
account deficits were financed by a rapid increase of public capital inflow,
largely on concessional terms.
5.        The level of domestic savings and investment is substantial and
is evidence of a serious commitment to development. The growth of GDP is
probably not commensurate with the investment effort. This is largely due
to the large amount of investment that went into slow gestation infra-
structure and social services. This wvas exemplified by the investment of
about $200 million in the Tan-Zam railway, the largest single project
undertaken in Tanzania, and by the difficulties encountered in mounting
investment in agriculture. The stagnation of agricultural export volumes
and very slow growth in food production were the most worrisome problems.
However, prudent domestic financial management, increasing inflow of
external aid on concessionary terms, together with a rather sharp terms of
trade improvement in 1973, made it possible to maintain a high investment
rate while reserves, at the end of 1973 stood at a healthy $145 million
which was then the equivalent of four months' imports. Indeed, the economy
appeared in relatively good shape before the events of the winter of
1973-74.
6.        Three events occurred then which resulted in a drastic change in
the overall balance of payments of Tanzania. First, import prices rose
sharply; most particularly petroleum prices. Other import prices increased
an estimated 15 to 20%. The increased cost of petroleum imports in 1974
compared to 1973 is about $70 million.    Second, the 1973 rains failed in
many parts of the country resulting in a substantial reduction in food
production in 1973-74. This became evident in january and February 1974
necessitating substantial increases in imports of basic food items in 1974.
The drought became general in 1974 necessitating continued high levels of
food imports from September 1974 to August 1975 when the new crop harvest
begins. It is estimated that food imports in 1974 cost about $150 million
compared to an annual average in 1970-72 of $40 million. The stagnation
of food and agricultural export volumes in 1974 was largely attributable
to the drought and weakness of Government agricultural policies.
7.        The overall balance of payments was in surplus in 1972 and 1973
but the net result of the events of 1973-74 described above is that
reserves declined by $89 million in 1974 to a level representing about
two weeks' imports. The upward trend of import prices, high food imports
and stagnant agricultural export volumes are expected to continue into
1975 resulting in an estimated balance of payments deficit of about $150
million. The Government has secured financing of the gap through a $30
million Bank Program Loan of December 20, 1974 (Loan No. 1063 TA) and
other multilateral and bilateral sources.



- 3 -
8.        The projected size and persistence of the balance of payments
deficit necessitate strong policy action. The Government has begun a
program of investment restructuring, administrative changes, and reduction
in the rate of growth of consumption that forms the basis of a sound
program for the solution of the medium-term problems. Under this program,
the Government has made substantial progress in reallocating public invest-
ment from infrastructure development to the directly productive sectors of
agriculture, industry and mining. The single largest economic weakness is
the slow growth of agricultural production. Several steps have been taken
to increase output. The Government has raised producer prices so as to
provide greater incentive. Retail prices have been brought near world
parity. Project planning and implementation is being improved by adminis-
trative changes within the Ministry of Agriculture that will enable
Government staff to be more effective. The negative impact of villagization
on output is being reduced through more careful planning. The Government
is reducing unnecessary non-development related recurrent expenditure and
is using taxation and wage/price controls to reduce the rate of growth of
private consumption.
9.        The balance of payments problem is likely to persist through the
end of this decade in spite of concentrated Government actions. Accordingly,
Tanzania will require additional balance of payments assistance in 1976 and
1977, and a continued capital inflow in excess of the foreign exchange
component of high priority projects if it is to achieve its development
targets. Financing of some local expenditures will therefore be justified.
10.       Tanzania is one of the three Partner States belonging to the East
African Community. The 1967 Treaty for East African Cooperation is one of
the most far reaching and comprehensive economic cooperation agreements in
existence among sovereign states. However, in practice the degree of
economic integration and cooperation among the Partner States is much less
than what was envisaged in the Treaty. Political developments in the
Partner States have created tensions within the Community and impaired the
growth of interstate trade. These difficulties have been compounded by
the balance of payments crisis which currently faces all three Partner
States.
11.       Tanzania's overall debt service ratio is currently about 6%.    In
terms of outstanding commitments, the Bank Group is Tanzania's largest
creditor followed by Sweden, the People's Republic of China, Canada, Denmark,
the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany. Including a notional
one-third share of the debt of the East African Community Corporations,
the IBRD is presently holding 14% of Tanzania's outstanding external debt
and IDA 16%; the IBRD share is expected to rise to about 20% in the next
five years, and the IDA share to remain about the same. Debt service
payments to the Bank are about 10% of total debt service payments; the
corresponding share for IDA is about 2%. These two figures are projected
to rise to about 20% and 3%, respectively, by 1980. Most capital aid to
Tanzania is made available on very favorable terms and a declining share
of the total is tied to procurement in the donor country. Suppliers'
credits have been kept to the minimum.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TANZANIA
12.       Tanzania joined the Bank, IDA and IFC in 1962.    Beginning with
an IDA credit for education in 1963, 19 credits and seven Bank loans
amounting to $274.8 million have so far been approved for Tanzania. In
addition, Tanzania has been a beneficiary of nine loans, totaling $229.8
million, which have been extended for the development of common services
operated regionally by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda through their association
in the East African Community. The only IFC investments in Tanzania to
date, totaling $4.7 million, were made in the Kilombero Sugar Company in
1960 and 1964. This Company encountered financial difficulties and in
1969 IFC and other investors sold their interest in the Company to the
Government. Annex II contains summary statements of Bank loans and IDA
credits to Tanzania and the East African Community organizations as of
March 31, 1975 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Our lending program, reflecting the emphasis the Tanzanian
Government is placing on agricultural development, has increasingly
focused on directly productive activities in the rural sector. Up to
the end of FY72, 10 out of 14 loans and credits have been made for
infrastructure. All but one of the loans to the East African Community
organizations, of which Tanzania is a beneficiary and co-guarantor, have
been extended for improvements in transportation and communications.
However, the approval by the Executive Directors of the Flue-Cured
Tobacco Project (Credit No. 217 TA), in October 1970 opened a new phase
in our lending for more directly productive activities. The Smallholder
Tea Development Project (Credit No. 287 TA) and a Second Livestock
Project (Credit No. 382 TA) were approved in March 1972 and April 1973,
respectively. A Cotton Development Project (Credit No. 454 TA), a
Cashewnut Development Project (Loan No. 1014 TA) and the Kigoma Integrated
Rural Development Project (Credit No. 508 TA) were approved in 1974.
Maize and fisheries projects are scheduled for appraisal in June of this
year. Preparation for the Tabora rural development project and a forestry
project are underway.
14.       Tanzania is developing an institutional structure, stressing
greater regionalization and development o' ujamaa villages, designed to
promote and respond to development initiatives. These institutions are
still in their formative stages, and related organizational and staffing
difficulties have sometimes resulted in the project delays referred to in
Annex II. Tanzania's education and training programs are expected to
solve the manpower problem in the longer run, but meanwhile there will
continue to be a need for technical assistance in planning and implementation
if the difficulties in executing projects are to be overcome. The Govern-
ment has taken steps to speed up recruitment of needed expatriate technical
expertise and is giving priority to improving project implementation. At
the request of the Government, about 15 technical staff have been supplied
by Agricultural Development Services (ADS). With the further assistance
of the Regional Mission in Eastern Africa, project implementation is
expected to improve. Discussions of a technical assistance project to



- 5-
aid project preparation are underway with the Government. The proposed
fifth education project will help improve project implementation and
Government administration by providing, among other things, training for
village and cooperative managers, bookkeepers, and accountants.
15.       The urban Sites and Services Project (Credit No. 495 TA)
approved in July 1974 marked the Bank Group's first lending to Tanzania
for urban development. The Credit for the Tanzania Investment Bank
(Credit No. 460 TA) was approved in February 1974 and has now been fully
committed. A second loan is scheduled for appraisal later this year. A
Highway Maintenance Project (Credit No. 507 TA) was approved in August
1974. A proposed project for industrial estate development at Morogoro
is presently under preparation. In view of the overall balance of payments
difficulties presently being faced by Tanzania (see above paragraphs) a
Program Loan (Loan No. 1063 TA) was approved in December 1974.
16.       The difficulties facing the East African Community Corporations
referred to in paragraph 10 have affected the Bank's lending program for
the Community. As a result of the agreement between the Partner States
in July 1974 on measures to rehabilitate the East African Railways
Corporation the Executive Directors approved a proposal on November 5,
1974 to allow the EARC to use the uncommitted portion of Loan No. 647 EA,
amounting to about $7.4 million, for consulting services and to help
support an emergency investment program. However, since EARC corporate
funds are not being transferred in accordance with the agreed formula and
Sh 60 million, out of a total of Sh 150 million the Partner States agreed
to inject into EARC, have not been paid, the EARC's right to make withdrawals
from the Loan Account of Loan No. 647 EA was suspended in February 1975,
pending action on both these issues. Furthermore, in the current state of
uncertainty regarding the future structure of the Community Corporations,
appraisal of further proposed Community projects for Corporations which
may have structural changes have been postponed until the issues mentioned
above have been clarified. The Bank has throughout this difficult period
provided assistance to facilitate solutions to the problems facing
Community Corporations. This effort is continuing but in view of the
fundamental and complex nature of the problems involved it would be
reasonable to expect that the process of resolving these problems will not
be an easy task.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
17.       The manufacturing sector in Tanzania accounts for only 10% of
GNP but is increasing in importance. The average growth rate of value
added by the sector from 1964-72 was 9.8%. The share of manufacturing
employment in total non-agricultural wage employment increased from 12.5%
in 1964 to about 19% in 1971 and the total number of jobs in registered
manufacturing enterprises employing 10 or more was about 55,000 in 1971.
Industrial investment increased from T Sh 150 million in 1966 to T Sh 157.2
million in 1971.



-6-
18.       The strongest growth in the period 1965-71 has taken place in
the non-food consumer goods industries with their share in total
manufacturing value increasing from 22% to 41%, with the largest expansion
taking place in industries producing textiles, beer, cigarettes and radios.
In intermediate goods industries the principal growth was in petroleum
refining, printing and publishing, glass, cement and fabricated metal
prpducts. More recently there was a significant expansion in the interme-
diate goods industries by the establishment of a tire plant, a fertilizer
factory, a steel rolling mill and a farm implements factory. The capital
goods industry is still quite small and consists mostly of commercial
vehicle assembly, repair and body construction plants and a few factories
for the manufacture and repair of a limited range of industrial machinery.
This industry is however rapidly expanding in terms of output and its
share in the value of total manufacturing output increased from 1.3% in
1965 to 7.5% in 1971.
19.       Since independence in 1962, Tanzania has followed a pattern of
industrial development concentrating on establishing or expanding
industries for import substitution. Consequently the imports of consumer
goods have been reduced from 54% of total commodity imports in 1961 to
27% in 1971. The Government's long-term industrial development strategy
aims to broaden the base of industry beyond pure import substitution and
aims at a gradual structural transformation of the economy by giving
priority to industries that process domestic raw materials for consumption
in the home market and by requiring that traditional exports are locally
processed as far as can be economically justified. As many of the most
obvious import substitution projects have already been implemented, the
future program includes expansion of the existing industries, in particular
textile production, as planned under this project, sugar production,
partly financed under Credit No. 513 TA and Loan No. 1063 TA and cement.
In addition to investment in import substitution industries, some export
oriented projects such as processing of cashewnuts, financed under
Loan No. 1014 TA, sisal spinning, leather tanning and leather goods have
already been undertaken and have potential for further expansion. In
the mining sector, phosphate, soda ash, rare materials from local sands,
iron ore, coal and natural gas are examples of mineral development
possibilities. The strategy also emphasizes the development of domestic
machine tool manufacturing and maintenance capacity with the promotion
of metal engineering industries and training of industrial engineers. A
component of this strategy will be the establishment of an integrated
steel mill in Chunya district based on domestic coal and iron ore reserves.
This project is under preparation and will be financed by the People's
Republic of China's bilateral assistance. The scope, size and timing of
the project is currently under examination.
20.        In the Industry and Mining Sector Mission report, which was
distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1975, the Bank has raised
issues concerning the improvements required in the productivity of existing
state manufacturing enterprises and the need for increasing the efficiency
of the public sector. There is also the need for the Government to specify
the exact role of the private sector. Since the Arusha Declaration (1967)



- 7 -
and the acquisition by the Government of majority interest in all
important manufacturing enterprises and financial institutions most
industrial activity is now in the public sector and all major projects
started after 1967 have been in the public sector. Nevertheless the
contribution of private firms is appreciable and accounts for about 25%
of the value added and 50% of the employment in the sector. There is
need, therefore, for the removal of uncertainties to the future role of
private investment so that this sector, which has considerable potential,
can also assist in industrial development.
21.       After the Arusha Declaration, nationalized industrial enter-
prises were regrouped in the National Development Corporation (NDC).
Subsequent to 1970 the Government split several state corporations from
NDC including those dealing with agricultural processing, tourism,
forestry and textiles. These have been grouped into holding companies
which manage existing enterprises and promote new projects through
equity investments in their respective sectors. This step towards
decentralization has helped considerably in reducing delays and in
developing responsible management at the parastatal level but further
steps need to be taken to strengthen management at the firm level to
bring about the further devolution of responsibility to this level. The
critical shortage of competent and experienced middle-level Tanzanian
managers is a perennial problem and a large number of enterprises are
still dependent on expatriate personnel. This dependence is expected to
continue beyond 1980 which has been mentioned as the target year for
national self-sufficiency in technical manpower. However, with the
intensive programs underway in the different parastatals as well as the
seven management training institutions for different levels of skills,
effective steps would have been taken to train sufficient Tanzanians to
reduce the present dependence on expatriate management.
22.       Tanzania has several institutions providing finance for industry;
the most important of these is the Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB) which was
the recipient of a Credit of $6 million in January 1974 (Credit No. 460 TA).
As estimated 25% of all new investment in the manufacturing sector is
channeled through TIB and the Bank has made good progress in building up
capacity to appraise projects and to form independent judgments on the
financial and economic merits of projects submitted for financing. TIB
loan commitments in 1974 totaled T Sh 53.7 million and disbursements
T Sh 42.7 million. TIB also makes some equity investments. The Tanganyika
Development Finance Company Ltd. (TDFL) is smaller than TIB and the
principal banking source for private investment. It was established in
1962 and is owned in equal shares by the Government and British, German and
Dutch aid agencies. Because of its limited resources TDFL concentrates on
small projects; individual loans rarely exceed T Sh 3 million and its
operations amount to about T Sh 10 million per year. Industrial investments
can also be financed by the East African Development Bank (EADB), created
in 1967, which has a Bank Loan of $8 million made in 1972. EADB's charter
excludes it from financing tourism, transportation and agricultural
projects. Its operations in Tanzania have amounted to about T Sh 14
million per year.



The Textile Industry
23.       Tanzania's textile industry has expanded rapidly in the last ten
years and now ranks first in the manufacturing sector accounting for 25%
of employment, 13% of value added and 11% of the value of output in the
industrial sector as a whole. Employment in the textile industry is at
present around 17,000 with an additional 3,000 employed in the garment
industry. Starting from almost complete import dependence for textiles
in 1966 Tanzania has now achieved more than 65% national self-sufficiency.
Expansion of the textile industry is a key element in Tanzania's industrial
strategy (referred to earlier in para. 19) of gradually restructuring the
economy by linking the pattern of production more closely to domestic
resource availability and local demand. The production of exportable surpluses
is seen as a logical extension of this strategy once the major portion of
domestic demand has been satisfied.
24.       Tanzania's cotton is of the medium-long staple variety which
enables the manufacture of a quality fabric. At present only 15% of the
domestic cotton production is used by the local textile industry and the
rest is exported as raw cotton. Consumption of cotton and other fabrics
in Tanzania is still very low and stands at only 7.9 meters per capita
per annum, as compared to 8.8 meters for Africa as a whole (excluding
South Africa) and 15.7 meters in all developing countries. Actual
consumption of woven fabrics has increased from 78 million meters in 1966
to 114 million meters in 1974. Of the 1974 fabric consumption 76 million
meters was locally produced and 41 million meters imported at an estimated
cost of about $40 million. The proposed project and other minor expansions
currently underway, would almost eliminate import needs for cotton fabrics
for the projected consumption level up to the early 1980s. Production
costs of cotton textiles in Tanzania are comparable to those in major
producing countries and ex-factory prices are approximately the same as
the C.I.F. costs of imported fabrics, using an appropriate shadow exchange
rate. In addition to the cotton fabric imports which would be substituted
through the proposed project, imports of blended fabric material of about
30 million meters per year are estimated in the near future. The Government
is therefore considering the next major textile project to produce blended
materials. Tanzania's cotton is ideally suited for this type of fabric and
there appear to be export possibilities for such material specially to other
East African countries. An amount of US$200,000 has been provided in the
proposed project to prepare the technical and economic feasibility report
for such a project and to also examine the potential export markets for
fabrics made in Tanzania. The Government has agreed, that, as part of
the continuing dialogue on the development of the textile sector, it will
exchange views with the Bank on the conclusions of the study and apply
these conclusions to any major expansion of the textile industry (Section
4.02, Loan Agreement).
25.       The National Textile Corporation (Texco) which was created in
January 1974 and to which all the textile industry activities were
transferred from NDC is responsible for the textile sector in Tanzania.
Texco is organized as a holding company and exercises overall responsibility for



-9 -
management, production, planning and expansion programs of its eight
associated and subsidiary companies including MTL, the beneficiary of
the proposed loan. The authorized capital of Texco is T Sh 500 million
(US$70 million) of which T Sh 70 million (US$10 million) is paid in.
The share capital is fully owned by the Government. Texco's Board of
Directors is chaired by the Minister of Industries and Commerce and consists
of nine members including the Managing Director of Texco. The marketing
of all products manufactured by Texco companies is carried out by the
National Textile Industries Corporation (Natex), a wholly owned subsidiary
of Texco. Natex is also responsible for imports and exports of yarn,
fabrics, garments, as well as other textile articles and agricultural
bags. The garment manufacturing and knitting industry consists entirely
of small production units in the private sector.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       An Appraisal Report entitled "Mwanza Textile Project" is being
distributed separately. A Loan and Project Summary is provided as Annex III
to this report.
27.       The project was identified in April/May 1974 out of three
textile projects for which feasibility studies were submitted to the Bank.
It was appraised in the field in November 1974. Negotiations for the
proposed loan were held in Washington on April 28, 1975. The Tanzanian
delegation was headed by Mr. Kazaura, Principal Secretary, Ministry of
Commerce and Industries.
Project Scope and Location
28.       The project consists of an expansion of the existing MTL plant
situated eight kilometers from the town of Mwanza on Lake Victoria (see
map). Mwanza town has a population of 50,000 and is the headquarters of
one of the 20 regional administrations into which the country is divided.
The town is at a distance of about 1,100 km (by air) northwest of
Dar es Salaam and is connected by rail, road and air services to the rest
of the country and by steamer services on Lake Victoria to Kenya and
Uganda. The existing MTL plant has a capacity of about 25 million linear
meters/year of cotton fabrics and started production in 1968. Through
the proposed project the production of MTL will be expanded by another
20 million meters per year of finished fabrics. The Project wculd add
about 28,000 spindles and 580 looms as well as bleaching, mercerizing,
dyeing and printing equipment to the existing fac-ilities taking into
account that the existing mill is not entirely balanced. The project
would be built adjacent to the existing MTL plant in space which was
originally earmarked for such an expansion. The existing MTL plant uses
modern although conventional equipment and has a relatively high standard
of quality and efficiency. The proposed expansion will use new and
similar conventional machinery.



29.       Mwanza is located in Tanzania's cotton growing belt and there
will be sufficient supplies of raw cotton for the increased production,
as at projected full production levels the mill will require 38,000 bales
of cotton per annum out of the cotton crop estimated at 500,000 bales
for 1980. Additional water consumption required for the project will be
made available from the municipal water supply system. The power supply
is provided by the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) and the
additional power required for the project will be provided under an
expansion program presently underway by TANESCO with financing from TIB
and bilateral sources. The Government has agreed (Section 4.03 of the
Loan Agreement) to cause TANESCO to complete its expansion program in
time to allow sufficient power to be provided for the efficient operation
of the integrated plant. Appropriate measures will be taken and special
equipment selected for the project to avoid adverse effects on ecoloyv
and occupational health.
Project Costs and Financing
30.       The total financing required for the project, including interest
during construction, is estimated at US$44.3 million of which US$30 million
wculd be in foreign exchange.   Price escalation of 12% in 1975, 10% in 1976
and 8% in 1977 for foreign and 30% per annum for local expenditures has
been provided for in the cost estimates, amounting to a total of US$9.1
million. The unusually high percentage rate for local price escalation
is based on past and estimated future rises in local construction costs.
The cost estimates also include a 5% physical contingency of US$1.3 million
(this is relatively low since the project scope is well defined and the
equipment to be procured is fairly standard), working capital requirements
of US$4.6 million, US$0.4 million for study and training and US$3.5 million
for interest during construction.
31.       The proposed Bank loan of US$15 million would cover half of the
foreign exchange financing required for the project. The Kuwait Fund has
agreed to participate in the financing of the project on a parallel
financing basis with the Bank and would provide the remaining US$15 million.
The Kuwait loan would finance the foreign exchange costs for the spinning
plant and equipment, civil works and erection costs and the Bank loan
would be applied to cover the foreign exchange costs of the other equipment
(weaving and processing), engineering and consultancy services and interest
during construction on the Bank loan. The proposed Bank loan of US$15
million would be made to the Government for 22 years including five years
grace and at an interest of 8.5% per annum, terms which are considered
appropriate on country grounds. The Government would onlend the loan to
the TTL for 13 years, including 4-1/2 years grace and would charge an
interest rate of 10% per annum; MTL would bear the exchange risk. The
proposed Kuwait Fund loan of US$15 million equivalent (Kuwaiti Dinars 4.5
million) would also be made to the Government for 22 years, including
five years of grace, at an interest of 4% per annum. The onlending terms
to MTL for the Kuwaiti funds would be similar to the Bank loan. The
finalization of the financing arrangements between the Kuwait Fund, the



- 11 -
Government, Texco and MTL would be a condition of effectiveness for the
Bank loan (Section 6.01(c), Loan Agreement). This will be the first
Kuwait Fund investment in Tanzania and is expected to be followed by other
joint or parallel ventures with the Bank especially in the industrial
sector.
32.       The local funds of US$14.3 million equivalent required for the
project would be provided through an increase in MTL's equity by US$14.1
million equivalent and US$0.2 million equivalent through the companies'
internal cash generation. The equity would be provided by the Government
to Texco which would in turn increase the equity of MTL, thereby increas-
ing Texco's shareholdings in MTL from 40% to 90%. Assurances have been
obtained from the Government and Texco that equity funds would be made
available to MTL on a time schedule determined by the requirements of
the project (Section 3.01(d), Loan Agreement).
Implementation and Training
33.       The project will be implemented by MTL under the general
supervision and control of Texco. Both Texco and MTL suffer from a
shortage of locally experienced and qualified technical personnel. MTL
has currently 26 expatriates at the upper and middle management levels
and this need for expatriates will continue at least during the period
of implementation and in the early stages of operation. Adequate assist-
ance from consultants is also crucial for the successful implementation
and operation of the project. MTL has agreed to enter into a contract
with Saigol Brothers of Pakistan, who undertook the feasibility study
for the project, to act as the engineering firm for the project with
responsibility for project engineering, purchasing, start-up operations,
personnel training and project management for the implementation of the
project (Section 2.02(i), Project Agreement). Saigol Brothers will be
responsible for the completion of the project according to an agreed
timetable as well as for the training program. Texco and MTL have also
agreed (Section 2.02(a)(ii), Project Agreement) to employ Gherzi Textil
Organization (Switzerland), as technical adviser who would provide
assistance in project management and implementation control mainly in
supervising the work of the engineering firm in all phases of construction,
erection, start-up operations and integration with the existing MTL
operations. MTL has also agreed to make arrangements, acceptable to the
Bank, for technical management to operate the project during a period of
three years after project completion (Section 2.02(d), Project Agreement).
34,       Texco and MTL have also developed a systematic job-related
training program which was discussed during negotiations. Under this
program a sufficient number of Tanzanians with appropriate education
and experience will be selected and trained at the Pakistan College of
Textile Technology in a specially designed intensive course followed by
training in one of the Saigol textile mills in Pakistan. Thereby qualified
operators in the different specialities will be made available at the
start-up of the mill from the existing MTL cadre and those trained by
Saigol. The estimated foreign exchange cost of such a training program
(US$100,000)has been included in the proposed loan.

Procurement and Disbursements
35.       Equipment and materials financed out of the proceeds of the Bank
loan will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank guidelines except for (1) small items costing less
than US$50,000 equivalent which may be purchased through international
shopping on the basis of suitability, availability and price considerations
following approval by the Bank of the list of items involved, and (2)
proprietary equipment necessary for efficient plant operation and items
in limited supply which are critical to the timely completion of the
project and which are estimated to cost not more than US$2 million and
which may be procured following bidding from restricted lists of qualified
suppliers, with prior approval of the Bank. Equipment financed by the
Kuwait Fund loan would be procured internationally according to its own
procurement guidelines. Subject to prequalification, local contractors
after local bidding would carry out the civil works, in part financed by
the Kuwait Fund. An agreement will be entered into with the Kuwait Fund
to specify the timing of procurement, method of disbursements for both
the Fund and Bank, joint supervision and exchange of information to
enable prompt and smooth implementation. A schedule of estimated disburse-
ments is included in Annex III. The Bank loan would cover the foreign
exchange cost of equipment and services under the Bank financed portion
of the project and interest during construction on the Bank loan. To
begin project implementation as soon as possible MTL, with the Bank's
approval, is expected to enter into agreements with the textile engineer-
ing firm and the technical advisory team. It is recommended that retro-
active financing for eligible expenditure on these agreements up to an
amount of $150,000 incurred after April 1, 1975 be included in the loan.
Operating and Financial Performance of MTL
36.       MTL's operating performance has steadily improved since it
started operations in 1968. Capacity utilization in 1974 was almost 90%
and some marginal increase in output is expected in 1975 when total
production would reach 22.7 million meters. The profit situation of the
company in 1974 was satisfactory and further improvement is expected in
1975 because of improvements in operations as well as favorable price
changes for inputs and outputs.
37.       MTL's profitability would improve substantially on account of
the project. Net income after taxes will increase from T Sh 7.8 million
in 1977 to 18.0 million in 1979 and 28.1 million in the years thereafter.
The more than proportional increase in sales value and earnings is due
to switching to more sophisticated products as well as to economies of
scale from the expansion. Net income before taxes as a percentage of
sales which was only 5% in 1974 is expected to increase to more than 10%
in 1975, mainly as a result of higher textile prices and lower cotton
prices which only in part affected 1974 earnings. After completion of the
project, net income after taxes as a percentage of sales would be at about
twice the level of the existing operations. As a result of the good
earning potential of the project, the financial ratios of MTL show quite



- 13 -
satisfactory levels despite substantial additional debt financing. The
debt service coverage remains about two times after the heavy loan repay-
ments on the existing operations in 1975 and 1976. The current ratio
would improve from 0.8 in 1974 to a satisfactory level of 1.5 in 1975 as
a result of internal cash generation and the increase in share capital.
The debt to equity ratio would be about 60:40 from 1976 until 1979 when
as a result of beginning debt repayments, it would start to gradually
improve. It has been agreed that Texco and MITL will maintain a debt to
equity ratio of 60 to 40 and a current ratio of 1.5 (Sections 4.03 and
4.04, Project Agreement).
38.       Since MTL's profitability and sound financial situation will
largely depend on the Government's policy of pricing inputs and outputs
the Goverrnment has agreed to ensure that MTL -- operating efficiently --
obtains sufficient revenues to cover all its costs, service all its debts
and earn a reasonable return on its invested capital (Section 3.02 of
Loan Agreement). MTL has also agreed not to declare or pay any dividends
u-ntil the project has been completed and thereafter only if by so doing
the current ratio would not fall below 1.5 (Section 4.05, Project
Agreement).
Financial and Economic Return
39.       The incremental financial return of the project amounts to 24.2%
before and 19.4% after taxes. It is relatively high partly because the
project is an expansion using existing infrastructure and partly because
existing machinery can be used more effectively in combination with the
project.  As usual, the return is most sensitive to changes in revenues.
The return after taxes would decrease to 17.3% if a 1C% reduction of
textile prices is assumed. If investment costs went up 15% combined with
a one year delay in project completion the return would drop to 13.9%.
If the ultimate capacity utilization of the project were to be only 80%,
the return would decrease to 17.7%.
40.       The project faces technical, managerial and commercial risks.
However, the technical and managerial risks should be limited in view of:
(i) employment of an engineering firm for project implementation, (ii)
employment of experienced technical advisers, (iii) MTL's experience with
similar existing operations, (iv) outside assistance for operations and
job-oriented training program, and (v) allowance for a relatively long
implementation period and a well-defined capital costs estimate. Much
will depend on the effective meshing of local and expatriate expertise.
The commercial risk should be minor in view of the opportunity for
import substitution and the Government's assurances on pricing.
41.       The economic rate of return of the project is a satisfactory
16% using international prices for the tradeable inputs and outputs. MTL
has a good production performance and capacity utilization of the plant
in 1974 was about 90%. Although the project will initially be producing
primarily for the domestic market in the past five years Tanzania has
exported to neighbouring East African countries between 2 to 4 million



- 14 -
meters of cotton textiles per year and there is potential for larger
exports at internationally competitive prices. The study included in the
project will thoroughly investigate this potential market and recommend
the investment decisions required for the further development of the
textile sector. Substantial indirect benefits from the project will be
derived from the employment of an additional 1,200 workers, provision
of training and expertise for Tanzanians and additional industrial activity
in a less developed region of the country.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY

D. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONl/
(As of May 1, 1975)
There are currently 16 projects under execution in Tanzania
ACRICULTURAL SECTOR
Credit No. 217 TA - Tobacco Prolect: $9.0 million Credit of October 9,
1970; Closing Date - September 30, 1976
As a result of the Tanzania Government's intention to complete
its villagization program by 1976, the process has been accelerated and
a total of about 7,200 families have been moved to villages in the
tobacco complexes, bringing the number of project farmers to 10,000.
As a result of these vigorous efforts, it is now likely that the appraisal
target of 15,000 farmers will be reached by 1975. Strict measures to
enforce minimum tobacco acreages per familv are expected to contribute
to increased tobacco production. However, yields per hectare and
quality of leaf have been below anticipated levels. Improvements are
required to strengthen the extension and cooperative services. Pro-
vision of water supplies and social infrastructure are progressing well.
Credit No. 287 TA - Smallholder Tea Project: $10.8 million Credit
of March 3, 1972; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
This project has experienced serious management problems both
at headquarters and in the field which have largely contributed to the
shortfall in planting achievements, currently 45% of target. Insuf-
ficient and poor quality field supervision with inadequate control
and guidance from headquarters have resulted in poor husbandry practices,
low yields and poor quality of leaf produced. Of the four tea factories
established or improved under the project, only one is performing
satisfactorily. These problems are being reduced since all senior
extension staff positions have been filled and monthly visits are being
made to each project area. Financial management is improving and
disbursements accelerating after the appointment of a Chief Accountant,
Cost Accountant and Internal Auditor.
1/      These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in par-
ticular, to report any problems which are being encountered,
and the actions being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Page 5 of 9
Credit No. 508 TA - Kigoma Rural Development Project: $10.0 million
Credit of August 21, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1980
The credit became effective in November 1974. Government
has designated two national parastatal marketing corporations to per-
form the input delivery and crop marketing functions under the project
rather than the Kigoma Cooperative Union which would have required a
financial reorganization. Possible changes to legal documents
are being studied. TRDB remains the lending channel for IDA funds
under the project. The Operations Manager (henceforth designated
Project Manager), Financial Controller and Land-Use Planner are now
on site and heavily involved in planning implementation; several other
appointments remain to be filled. A large acreage (relative to
previous years) has been planted with cotton and a variety of steps
are necessary (now underway) to market it effectively. The Project
Management hopes that 30 project villages will qualify for loans under
the project starting in September. However, this goal may be an
optimistic one in view of the need for a trained bookkeeper and
extension worker and preparation of a Village Site Feasibility
Report for each project village as a prerequisite'to its borrowing
under the project.
Credit No. 454 TA - Geita Cotton Project: $17.5 million Credit
of January 17, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1982
The conditions in which the project will operate were radically
changed by the decision effective April 15, 1974, that farmers through-
out the district should immediately move into villages. The move
was poorly planned and in the short-run will adversely affect production
of cotton and food crops. Although in the long-run villagization
could well be advantageous to the project as savings in mechanization,
extension and credit staff could be achieved, the initial implementation
of the project will be delayed. A mission from RMEA is reviewing the
project and their report is awaited.
Loan No. 1014 TA - Cashewnut Development Project: $21.0 million
Loan of June 24, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1981
The lowest bids for the five processing facilities to be
constructed under the project were considerably in excess of the ap-
praisal estimate for the project component. Following detailed
discussions between the Government and contractor, the cost has been
considerably reduced by deletion of non-essential items so as to not
affect the aims of the project. The Government has requested deletion
of a rural water supply and a community education center; with these
changes, the loan funds will be sufficient to finance 66% of the
project as compared to 69%, at appraisal.

Credit No. 513 TA and Loan No. 1041 TA - Kilombero Sugar Development
Project: $9.0 million Credit and $9.0 million Loan of September
27, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1979
The project was declared effective February 24, 1975. The
Government is currently making good progress toward ambitious project
goals. Civil works bid documents are in an advanced stage of prepara-
tion. Contracts are being let for some goods and equipment; measures
to reduce possible cost overruns on the civil works components are
being considered by the Government.
Credit No. 382 TA - Second Livestock Development Project: $18.5
million Credit of May 23, 1973; Closing Date - DecemLber 31, 1977
The credit was declared effective on September 28, 1973
but so far implementation has been extremely slow. IDA disbursements
to date have been limited to technical services and it is only during
the past four - five months that the development of cattle ranching
and marketing has started to get under way. The meat processing
component of the project was recently scaled down by almost a third
of appraisal proposals because of increase in costs. However,
overall progress should improve now that responsibility for project
implementation has been transferred to the newly established Livestock
Development Authority.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Credit No. 149 TA - Second Education Project: $5.0 million Credit
of May 29, 1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
Most project schools are complete and all are scheduled
for completion by July 1975. Completed schools are adequately furnished
but not yet fully equipped. Procurement and installation of the
remaining furniture and equipment is in progress. The project has
experienced a minor overrun of $0.4 million.
Credit No. 232 TA - Third Education Project: $3.3 million Credit
of February 5, 1971; Closing Date - June 30, 1975
Contracts for all 13 project institutions have now been awarded
after retendering made necessary by high prices of the original
quotations. As a result, the project is about 18 months behind schedule.
Procurement of furniture and equipment and the fellowship training
program are progressing satisfactorily. A cost overrun of about
$0.45 million is expected.

Page 7 of 9
Credit No. 371 TA - Fourth Education Project:    $10.3 million Credit
of April 13, 1973; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
A substantial cost overrun, possibly as much as $13 million,
for civil works is being discussed within the Government. The Govern-
ment has decided to defer the construction of three secondary schools
in the project to reduce building standards and to seek additional
financing from bilateral aid donors.
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Credit No. 460 TA - Tanzania Investment Bank Project: $6.0 million
Credit of February 13, 1974; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
The credit has been fully committed. A follow-on project is
under consideration.
POWER SECTOR
Loan No. 715 TA - Kidatu Hydroelectric Project: $3.0 million Loan of
December 14, 1970 and $5.0 million Supplementary Loan No. 712-2 TA
of June 24, 1971; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
Construction work for this project is nearly complete. The
project is on schedule and the first unit came on stream in March
1975 and the second is expected to be completed by July 1. A mission
visited Tanzania in April to appraise the second stage Kidatu power
project.
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
Credit No. 265 TA - Third Highway Project: $6.5 million Credit of
August 6, 1971; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
After long delays in completing tender arrangements, the
contract for the Mtwara-Masasi road was made at nearly three times
the appraised cost. Most of the overrun is covered by a $4.4 million
loan from ADB and use of the $1.8 million balance from the Bank's
Second Highway Project (Loan No. 586 TA). Construction of this road
is proceeding satisfactorily.
Feeder road construction in Geita and Mara has been slowed by
shortages of local funds, fuel, materials and personnel. This has
received the attention of the Ministry of Works and some improvement
has been effected.
Consultants' feasibility studies for Kilombero and Kilimanjaro
are proceeding satisfactorily.

Page 8 of 9
Credit No. 507 TA - Highway Maintenance Project:    $10.2 million
Credit of August 21, 1974; Closing Date - June 30, 1979
The project was declared effective on November 20, 1974.
Recruitment of expatriates required for implementation is being discussed
by the Government with the Crown Agents. Tender documents for the
first batch of equipment are being prepared by the Ministry of Works.
URBAN SECTOR
Credit No. 495 TA - Sites and Services Project: $10.0 million
Credit of July 12, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1978
The project was declared effective in October 1974 and
has made a good start. Contract for infrastructure construction
at two sites have been awarded; tenders for two other sites have been
received, and contract documents for the remaining two sites are being
completed. Tender prices were high on the initial bids but are becoming
competitive as more sites are tendered. At present total project
costs are estimated to exceed appraisal estimates by about 3%.
Training program for technical staff of Ministry of Lands, Housing
and Urban Development commenced in March 1975. A consultant has been
appointed for Monitoring and Evaluation of the project.
PROGRAMI LOAN
Loan No. 1063 TA - Program Loan: $30.0 million Loan of December
20, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
The loan is fully disbursed. The Government continues to
implement policies designed to relieve the balance of payments dif-
ficulties. A Bank mission will visit Tanzania in July to review the
effect of the implementation of such policies. Although the Government
has been successful in finding other sources to assist in financing
the balance of payments gap, the overall resource gap will be larger
than anticipated at appraisal owing to a more rapid deterioration in
the terms of trade than expected.
There are currently six projects under execution by the East
African Community.
TRANSPORT SECTOR
Loan No. 674 EA - Third Railways Project: $42.4 million Loan of May
25, 1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
This loan was suspended on February 13, 1975. The reasons for
suspension and conditions for lifting the suspension are discussed
in Parts I and II of this report.



ANNEX II
Page 9 of 9
Loan No. 638 EA - Second Harbours Project: $35.0 million Loan of
August 25, 1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
The Harbours Corporation is in a healthy cash position overall
although there have been problems in transferring funds from regional
offices to headquarters. It is now expected that the project will be
completed by the end of 1975.
Loan No. 865 EA - Third Harbors Project:    $26.5 million Loan of
December 18, 1972; Closing Date - June 30. 1977
A delay of six months is expected in completing civil works
under this project. Cost overruns have been experienced in some project
items. The situation is under study by the Corporation, which will
shortly issue a plan for speeding implementation.
DEVELOPMENT BANK
Loan No. 843 EA - East African Development Bank Project: $8.0 million
Loan of June 28, 1972; Closing Date - May 31, 1976
Operations of the Bank have been decentralized with a resulting
strengthening of the Bank's supervisory capability. Mtanagement problems
associated with decentralization have largely been rectified so that
the pace of Bank operations is expected to quicken in FY76. Nearly
$6.5 million of the loan has been committed, and a second loan is being
considered for appraisal.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Loan No. 675 EA - Second Telecommunications Project: $10.4 million
Loan of May 25, 1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1975
Problems within the EAC have only marginally affected the
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation due to the considerable
existing decentralization of operating authority. Deterioration of the
corporate cash position and rate of return has been slight in comparison
to other Community Corporations; the situation will be improved by a
rate increase allowed by the Community in February 1975.
Loan No. 914 EA - Third Telecommunications Project: $32.5 million
Loan of June 22, 1973; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
Procurement is generally on schedule with $20 million committed
and the balance near tender stage. All major items are expected to
be completed by mid-1975, except two microwave links which, due to
long lead time for delivery, will be delayed by 18 months.
