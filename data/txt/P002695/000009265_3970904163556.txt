PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TANZANIA - MWANZA TEXTILE PROJECT
(LOAN 1128-TA)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project consisted of a major expansion of a Government-owned
textile mill in Mwanza in Western Tanzania.  It was based on the Government
textile sector plan developed in 1973 which had as a major goal the
country's becoming self-sufficient in woven cotton fabrics based on the
country's cotton resources.
The project was completed seven months behind schedule with a
cost underrun of 20X compared to appraisal estimates. Most of the delay
was caused by inability to transport materials efficiently from Kenya due
to the border being closed. Successful project implementation was largely
due to the efficient project management provided by the Engineering Company
and the Technical Advisor as well as cooperation and coordination provided
by the Texco and Mwatex personnel (paras. 3.07-3.10, 3.14).
The project met its main objective, increased textile output
under efficient conditions, and availability of trained staff. However,
shortly after successful commissioning, the mill suffered from shortages of
power, water and fuel due to the generally depressed economic situation in
the country and to a major technical problem in the power plant that
supplies electricity to Mwatex. Production deteriorated during 1979-1982
and from November 1982 until mid-1983, the mill was closed due to lack of
power. Production was resumed in mid-1983 (paras. 4.01-4.04).
The project's viability is difficult to assess given the low
output due to factors outside the mill's control. The FRR and ERR are
calculated at 9.2% and 8.9% compared to appraisal estimates of 24.2% and
16.1%, respectively. The lower figures are a result of the low output
during the 1979-1983 period and the expectation that the mill will only be
able to achieve a two-shift operation instead of the forecast three shifts
at appraisal due to a shortage of foreign currency required to purchase
dyestuffs, chemicals and spare parts. At the time of project preparation,
appraisal and approval, neither the Bank nor, for that matter, other
donors, anticipated the severe difficulties which would face Tanzania's
economy in the late 1970s and 1980s, and the foreign exchange problems
which caused drastic shortages of fuel, power and imported input materials
(paras. 5.01-5.04, 6.01-6.03).
The most important lessons  learned from the experience in this
project were: (a) given adequate financial and human resources a project
can be implemented within the appraised time schedule and capital costs,
but subsequently it cannot be efficiently operated unless maintenance of
infrastructure and foreign exchange required to cover the costs of imported
inputs can be assured; (b) any project with no prospects for export
earnings or dependable allocation of foreign currency and structurally
requiring a significant amount of imported inputs for indefinite periods of
time is highly vulnerable to foreign exchange constraints, and the risks
associated wlth potential deterioration of the country's economy should
have been taken into consideration at the time of appraisal (although this
is obviously difficult to predict); and (c) the need to provide training on
a long-term basis to provide trained local staff for operations without
external assistance (para. 7.02).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TANZANIA - M1ANZA TEXTILE PROJECT
(LOAN 1128-TA)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Tanzania's textile industry which was virtually non-existent prior
to 1965, grew rapidly during the subsequent ten years, and by 1975 accounted
for about 25% of employment, 13% of value added and 11% of output in the
manufacturing sector as a whole. By 1974, Tanzania produced about 76 million
meters (mm) of woven fabrics accounting for about 67Z of domestic consumption
(89% of cotton fabric consumption).
1.02      After the Arusha Declaration (February 1967), the Government adopted
a policy of controlling and directing all major industrial activities,
including textile manufacturing, through parastatal organizations. The major
textile companies were incorporated into and operated as subsidiaries of the
National Development Corporation (NDC). In January l974, all four large
integrated textile companies, as well as the manufactmring of garments and
Jute bags, were transferred from NDC to a new parastatal company, the National
Textile Corporation (TEXCO). TEXCO was organized as a holding company
controlling the majority of shares and exercising complete responsibility for
overall management and production of its subsidiary companies, and planning
and expansion of the sector.
1.03      Cotton, the major raw material of Tanzania's textile mills, is
produced locally. Of an annual production ranging from 45 to 70 thousand
metric tons (TNT), in 1974, less than 20% was consumed locally by the textile
mills. The rest was exported, constituting Tanzania's second most valuable
crop and export earner. In 1973, the Government developed a long-term
industrial strategy aiming at a gradual restructuring of the economy by
linking the pattern of production more closely to domestic resource
availability and local demand. Within the framework of this policy, expansion
of the textile sector was given high priority by the Government. The
objective of the planned expansion was to enable Tanzania to become
self-sufficient in woven cotton fabrics and achieve a small exportable surplus
by 1980. The plan included elimination of production bottlenecks and minor
expansion of Friendship, Kiltex and Sunguratex plants, and doubling of the
capacity of Mwatex textile mill in Mwanza.
1.04      Early in 1974, the Government of Tanzania requested Bank financing
to cover part of the foreign exchange expenditures for a project to expand the
annual production of Mwatex by 20 mm to 43 mm per year. The project was
appraised in September 1974 and approved by the Board in June 1975. The cost
of the project was estimated at TSh 314 million (US$44.3 million equivalent).
The financing of the foreign component included a US$15 million loan from
IBRD and a US$15 million loan provided, on the basis of the Bank's appraisal
of the project, by Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED). Local
financing was made available in the form of equity by TEXCO. The Mwanza
Textile Project (MTP) was the Bank's first industrial investment in Tanzania.
At the time, the only other Involvement of the Bank Group was a US$17.5
million IDA Credit approved in January 1971 to help finance a cotton
cultivation development project in Geita District of the Mwanza region.



1.05      MTP (Mill No. 2) was completed in October 1978, i.e. with a minimal
delay of about seven months, at lower cost than the appraisal estimates and
achieved higher capacity utilization within the first three months of
operation than forecasted. At that time, TEXCO requested, and on the basis of
a detailed action program submitted by Mwatex, the Bank agreed that the unused
balance of the Bank loan (US$2.2 million) should be used for proviston of
spare parts and rehabilitation of the weaving and processing equipment in the
original Mwatex plant (Mill No. 1). A similar arrangement was made regarding
the unused portion of the KFAED loan regarding spinning equipment and at the
time of the closing of the Bank loan (12/31/81) an additional US$1.7 million
of the Bank funds and US$0.7 million of KFAED funds was spent for
rehabilitation of the Mill No. 1. Also, TEXCO contributed TSh 4.7 million
(US$ 0.5 million equivalent) for repairs of roofs and floors in Mill No. 1.
1.06      In 1979 and subsequent years, Mwatex experienced severe operational
problems due to shortages of fuel, power and water in the Mwanza region.
Shortages of fuel and power in Tanzania have been wide-spread in recent years
due to the critical foreign exchange situation. In the case of Mwatex, the
situation has been exacerbated because of the plant's location at the end of a
600-mile long single track railway from Dar-es-Salaam, and repeated failures
of the newly erected, Nyakato power station nearby (Mwatex's source of
electricity) due to technical problems (para.4.02).
1.07      In addition to MTP, TEXCO has invested in five other textile
projects, four of which are still under construction. Currently, the sector,
due to acute shortages of fuel, power and spare parts, is operating at about
40% of the installed capacity and the future prospects of the sector depend
heavily on the success of the recently formulated National Economic Survival
Program (NESP) and the Structural Adjustment Program for 1983/85.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal, Approval and Loan Effectiveness
2.01      The expansion of the Mwatex plant in Mwanza was part of the
Government's policy to enable Tanzania to become self-sufficient in woven
cotton fabrics. At the time the project was identified (April 1974), Mwatex
was one of the best textile mills in the country with satisfactory operating
performance and relatively high product quality. TEXCO, the parastatal
organization fully owned by the Government and responsible for the textile
sector, submitted to the Bank a well-prepared feasibility study carried out by
a leading Pakistani textile manufacturing company. The MTP was preappraised
in August 1974 and appraised in November 1974 (Appraisal Report No. 743-TA
dated May 5, 1975).
2.02      At the time of appraisal of MTP, there were two major issues of
concern to the Bank. The first related to the Government's plans to proceed
with construction of a new textile plant at Musoma, construction of which was
scheduled to be concurrent with the expansion of Mwatex. The Bank's position
was that before embarking on another major project in its textile industry,
Tanzania should undertake a special market and marketing study to establish
the long-range market potential for its cotton fabrics. The Bank was also
anxious to impress upon the Government that, because of resource constraints



and shortage of trained technical personnel, Tanzania would be well advised to
develop the textile industry at a more realistic pace. The second, related to
TEXCO's intentions to award the project engineering contract for
implementation of the MTP to a Pakistani firm despite the fact that the
company had never executed or operated a project outside its own country. The
first issue was resolved as the Government agreed to carry out a study of the
possibilities of marketing textiles manufactured in Tanzania in other
countries and applying the conclusions of such a study to any major future
expansion of the textile industry. On the second issue, the Bank agreed to
the appointment of the Pakistani firm as the Engineering Company responsible
for the implementation of the project, provided that, in addition, TEXCO would
employ an experienced textile consulting company to act as a Technical Advisor
to provide specialized assistance and supervise the implementation of the
project on behalf of the sponsors. TEXCO agreed to this approach. The loan
was subsequently approved by the Bank's Executive Directors on June 3, 1975
and became effective October 6, 1975.
B. Project Description and Objectives
2.03      The project consisted of the expansion of an existing integrated
textile plant (Mill No. 1) at Mwatex in the cotton growing region of Mwanza,
about 600 miles north-west of Dar-es-Salaam. The project (Mill No. 2) was
built adjacent to Mill No. 1 on land already owned by Mwatex. The project
added 27,648 spindles and 578 looms to the existing facilities, as well as
related bleaching, mercerising, dyeing and printing equipment. Civil works
consisted of construction of about 23,000 m of covered floor space, addition
of two 1.5 NW transformers and two extra boilers, each with capacity to
generate 6 tons per hour of steam. The main objective of the project was to
increase the annual spinning capacity from 3,360 to 6,540 tons of yarn and
weaving and finishing capacity from 23 to 43 million meters to provide
additional 20 million meters of woven cotton fabrics for the domestic market.
The project's objectives also included improved capacity utilization and a
training program designed to train a sufficient number of qualified staff of
Mwatex in textile technology and implementation of a study of the
possibilities of marketing textiles manufactured in Tanzania in other
countries (para. 2.02).
III. PROJECT INPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The civil works were finished in May 1978, and MTP was mechanically
completed in October 1978 and commissioned in December 1978, about nine months
behind schedule (Annex 1). The delay was mostly due to the problem of
transportation of building materials, specifically steel structures, across
the Tanzania-Kenya border which was closed, due to political reasons, in
February 1977. As stated above, a key objective of the project was to improve
overall capacity utilization. Early in 1974 prior to project appraisal, a
four-shift (168 hours/week) operation was introduced in all TEXCO textile
mills, including Mwatex, and capacity of the new facilities was calculated
accordingly. However, the four-shift operation was abolished after two years
due to the reluctance of the labor force to work on Sundays as well as
negligible production gains, and in 1977 all mills converted to a six-day (144



hours) week. Consequently, the new mill at full capacity could produce 2,726
tons of yarn and 17.1 million meters of fabric. In the first three months of
operations (January-March 1979), the yarn and fabric production from Mill No.
2 amounted to 594 tons and 3.7 mm. On this basis, the overall capacity
utilization in the first three months of operation was about 87%, i.e above
the appraisal estimates. But subsequently in 1979-81, due to shortages of
fuel, power and water, the capacity utilization deteriorated to about 50-60%.
At the same time, the technical efficiency of the mill, whenever it was
operating, was satisfactory and only in one department (weaving) slightly
below the appraised estimates.
3.02      Another objective of the project-carrying out of a training
program--has been implemented and altogether about 130 mechanics, supervisors
and technologists have been successfully trained locally, and 14 outside the
country. Finally, studies of the textile market and the feasibility of the
cotton-polyester plant were completed in June 1977 and resulted in
identification and eventually financing by the Bank of the next textile
project in Tanzania (Morogoro Textile Project - SAR 1893a-TA).
B. Project Scope
3.03      There were no significant deviations from the appraised scope of the
project. However, because of an underrun in the cost of the project, about
US$2.9 million was used for the rehabilitation of the equipment and buildings
in Mill No. 1. The rehabilitation of the equipment and supply of spare parts
for Mill No. 1 was technically and economically justified and agreed to by the
Bank.
C. Project Management
3.04      For the purpose of the project implementation, TEXCO formed a small
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) composed of three officials with a
background and some experience in civil works, textiles and finance. TEXCO
entered into a contractual arrangement with the Pakistani firm (para. 2.02) to
act as the Engineering Company to implement the project, including design and
engineering, procurement, construction, erection, start-up and initial
operations, and personnel training. In addition, TEXCO retained an
experienced textile consulting firm from Switzerland as Technical Advisor.
The main responsibility of the Technical Advisor was to assist the TEXCO PIU
and management of Mwatex in supervising the work of the Engineering Company,
specifically developing the plant and machinery design, procurement of
equipment, construction activities, training of management personnel and
commissioning of the new mill. The decision to use a Technical Advisor
appears to have been a right one, as the personnel of the PIU was not fully
adequate to manage all project implementation activities by themselves.
Eventually the local staff involved were assigned to other tasks, so the
implementation of the project was supervised by the staff of the Technical
Advisor reporting directly to the Managing Director of TEXCO. The lesson
learned from this experience is not a new one. By using enough qualified
expatriate assistance, a project has been implemented in a relatively timely
fashion and within the approved budget, but its contribution to institution
building, i.e assisting the country in developing capability to plan and
implement new projects has been limited, mostly because of a shortage of
qualified personnel.

D. Training
3.05      The most recent data (9/30/82) indicated that the staff of mwatex
was 3,624, up from 2,400 at the time of the project ldentification In 1974,
below the high of 4,186 in 1978, and very close to the appraisal projection of
3,600 (Annex 2). In order to cope with its expanded activities, TEXCO has
developed, in cooperation with the Engineering Company and the Technical
Advisor, a detailed job-related training program for the operators,
supervisory personnel and management which was accepted by the Bank in
September 1976. The program included on-the-job training for additionally
recruited operators as well as specialized training for mechanics, foremen and
supervisors. Also, selected high school graduates were sent to Pakistan
College of Textile Technology in Lyalpur, Pakistan for a specially designec
3-month training program. In addition, seven suitable candidates were sent to
textile colleges in UK and FRG.
3.06      The on-the-job training program of the operating personnel over a
three-year period (1977-79) covered 1,043 people. About 40 mechanics, 25
foremen and 75 supervisors were trained by the staff of the textile machinery
equipment procured for the project. Also, 14 staff members were trained In
Pakistan and seven obtained Higher Diplomas in Textile Technology from
colleges in UK and FRG. The total cost of training amounted to TSh 3 million,
plus US$0.3 million in foreign exchange. The program can be considered as
only partly successful as it has not produced enough highly qualified weavers
as reflected in somewhat lower than appraised technical efficiency of the
weaving mill, and occasionally, low capacity utilization due to shortage of
weavers. An important lesson for any future textile project is that the
problem of training a sufficient number of highly skilled weavers, in view of
the critical importance of their performance on the efficiency, capacity
utilization of the plant and quality of the product, has to receive special
consideration in formulation of the training program.
E. Use and Performance of Engineering Contractors and Consultants
3.07      The cooperation between TEXCO, the Engineering Company and the
Technical Advisor, and the management of Mwatex was quite successful as
indicated by the underrun in costs and a relatively short delay in the
completion of the project. The supervision missions also reported that the
management of TEXCO expressed satisfaction with the progress of the work and
the performance of the consultants' personnel, and recognized that the Bank's
insistence that both an Engineering Company and a Technical Advisor had to be
used during project implementation was essentially correct.
3.08      The performance of the Engineering Company was satisfactory as it
was able to call on the manpower and experience of its operating companies in
Pakistan. Their main strength was a good experience in textile technology and
civil engineering, and they were able to maintain good relations with local
contractors, local labor and Mwatex and TEXCO management. However, their
knowledge of foreign equipment was limited to the types used in Pakistan and
assistance of the Technical Advisor with their international experience was
most useful in procurement activities. In addition to supervising and
assisting the Engineering Company, the Technical Advisor was most helpful in
dealing with Government authorities regarding the problems of transportation



-6-
of material from Dar-es-Salaam to Mwanza, the power and water authorities,
keeping of records and report writing. Essentially, in view of the relative
weakness of the TEXCO team, the Technical Advisor also acted as the management
agent and coordinated all aspects of the implementation. They have performed
their work well and were awarded a contract (Part C of the project) for a
marketing study and feasibility study of the cotton-polyester plant. The
total cost of the engineering and technical assistance to the project (not
including the studies) amounted to US$1.3 million, the same as projected in
the appraisal estimates, and included about 1,200 man-weeks on the site.
3.09      As stipulated in Article 2(d) of the Project Agreement in August
1978, Mwatex entered into contractual arrangements for technical management of
the expanded plant. The firm that was the Engineering C.ompany was also
selected for this assignment. The original three-year contract was extended
until August 1983. The management team consists of 12 expatriates (about 4X
of the total number of personnel listed as administration and management) but
including such key positions as Plant Manager, Technical Manager, Financial
Manager and Department Heads. Within the limitations imposed by the shortages
of power, water and fuel, the management team has been considered both by
TEXCO and Bank missions to be doing an excellent job under very difficult
circumstances. This has been particularly important because the performance
of Kill No. I in the period 1976-1978 deteriorated very badly, due to a
drastic reduction of the number of expatriate technicians and administrative
personnel, imposed by the personnel localization policies of the Government.
F. Implementation Schedule
3.10      The mechanical completion of MTP was seven months behind the
appraisal schedule and the commissioning nine months behind schedule (Annex
1). Most of the delay was due to the political situation as the
Tanzania-Kenya border, o-er which most of the construction (steel structure)
material had to be transported, was closed in February 1977. Consequently,
civil construction work was completed only in March 1978, about thirteen
months behind schedule. Also, some problems were experienced with customs
clearance of equipment in the port and the office of the Bank Representative
in Dar-es-Salaam was most helpful in resolving the misunderstanding regarding
the Government's waiving of custom duties on equipment for the Bank financed
project. There was little problem with procurement and ocean freight but the
local transportation from Dar-es-Salaam to Mwanza along single track railway
provided some difficulties which resulted in a large amount of additional work
in frequent changing of the erection schedules, but due to close cooperation
between the Engineering Company and machinery suppliers, no additional delays
took place. As a matter of fact, the interval between the completion of the
civil works and mechanical completion was cut to five months as compared with
seven months projected during appraisal. The commercial production started in
December 1978, and in the first sixty days of 1979, the production of the new
mill reached the completion requirement as stipulated in Article I(e) of the
Loan Agreement.
G. Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.11      Procurement of equipment and services was carried out in accordance
with World Bank guidelines. Except for a few items that were proprietary
equipment, about 95% of the contract was awarded through international



- 7 -
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures_ All specifications, tender documents
and instructions to the bidders were prepared by the Engineering Company,
reviewed by the Technical Advisor on behalf of TEXCO, and approved by the
Bank. Altogether, about 900 companies applied for prequalification and about
300 were prequalified in 35 categories. This included about 50 companies
prequalified in six categories to supply spinning equipment financed by KFAED
which had adopted identical procurement procedures. Although the contracts
were awarded to companies in 12 countries, the top three (Japan, FRG and
Switzerland) received 60% of the orders (Annex 3). As far as the civil works
were concerned, two contracts were awarded through competitive bidding to
local companies-one for site preparation and another for excavation, concrete
and erection of the buildings. The steel structure was awarded through ICB to
a Yenyan company.
3.12      Evaluation of the bids, award of the contracts and supply of
equipment proceeded smoothly, and by the end of 1977 practically all machinery
and equipment was delivered to the site.  There were few problems with
erection, performance tests and commissioning of the machinery and equipment.
Only in one cate,ory (high speed cards) did the equipment procured by KFAED
fail to reach the expected level of performance, and a few additional units
had to be purchased as KFAED and TEXCO were not inclined to press claims
against the supplier. During the whole procurement procedure, the Bank
received only one complaint from a bidder on one package who claimed that the
contract was unjustly awarded to a higher-priced competitor. A subsequent
investigation indicated that the offer of this bidder was unresponsive and the
complaint was withdrawn.
H. Environmental Aspects
3.13      As there are no Tanzanian standards for pollution control, the
project was designed to meet international standards for gaseous and liquid
emissions. The new steam boilers were equipped with automatic regulating
devices to ensure maximum combustion so as to control the discharge of carbon
monoxide in the fuel gases. Similar modifications have been made in the
existing boilers.  The cards in the new mill were equipped with floor wLste
exhaust filters and air filters have been installed in the spinning and
weaving sheds to reduce the level of dust in the working areas. Additional
settling tanks were installed to treat effluent from the converting
operations, so the possibility of the waste being discharged into Lake
Victoria has been eliminated.
I. Costs, Disbursements and Financing
3.14      The cost of the project was US$6.1 million below the appraisal
estimates (Annex 4). A summary comparison of the actual capital costs with
the appraisal estimates is presented below:

Actually, the cost of the project as appraised was US$35.3 million, but
subsequently US$2.9 million was used for rehabilitation of Mill No. 1.  The
figures indicate that two significant differences between the appraisal
estimates and the actual costs related to equipment and civil works. In the
case of equipment, neither physical nor price contingencies were utilized,
which accounted for most of the savings. There were three major reasons for
lower than expected prices. One was the use of ICB procedures. For example,
prices for similar equipment procured for a textile plant in a neighboring
country in the same period, but procured on a negotiated basis, averaged
30-40% higher. The second is that in the general inflationary environment of
the 1975-76 period, the years following the major increase in energy costs,
the textile industry and its suppliers experienced acute economic difficulties
resulting in a surplus capacity, lack of orders and low prices. On the other
hand, the cost of the civil works exceeded the appraisal estimates, including
contingencies, by 83%, mostly due to higher than expezted increases in the
price of building materials and delays in construction due to the closing of
the Tanzania-Kenya border. The third reason is the strong performance and
cooperation of the Engineering Company and the Technical Advisor.
3.15      Allowing for one year delay, disbursement of the loan followed the
pattern of the appraisal estimates (Annex 5) quite closely. The portion of
the Bank loan related to the project (US$12.8 million) was disbursed by the
end of 1979. Subsequent disbursements in the 1980-81 period were in
connection with the cost of rehabilitation of Mill No. 1. The last
disbursement was made on 02/01/82, one month after the loan was closed on
12/31/81, and the balance of US$0.5 million was cancelled in October 1982.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Production
4.01      The operating performance of Mwatex and MTP has been closely linked
to the problems of shortages of power, fuel and water. Originally, Mwatex
started operations in 1968, and, in 1970, achieved production of 12.3 mm which
was gradually increased to 22.6 mm in 1974 and 22.7 mm in 1975, at which time
Mi-1 No. I was operating at maximum capacity on 4 shifts (50 weeks per year,
168 hours per week). Dmring the period of project implementation, production
of Mill No. 1 declined to 19.1 mm in 1976, and about 16 mm in 1977 and 1978.
While the problems at the time appeared mainly to be due to lack of spare
parts, poor maintenance, low productivity and a lack of qualified personnell/
(in 1977 and 1978, respectively), there was also a loss of about 0.3 mm and
2.0 mm of fabric production due to shortages of water, fuel and power.
Problems with power supply were also mentioned in the Staff Appraisal Report.
At the time of appraisal, the Tanzanian Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) was
operating six 1.5 MW units at Nyakato (Mwanza), but had under construction an
additional four diesel generators expected to be ready in 1976. This was
projected to increase the supply of power from 7.5 to 22.5 MW, adequate to
meet Mwatex's increased needs (from 5 to 10 MW), together with those of other
consumers in the area. Supply of electric power sufficient to ensure the
efficient operation of the Hwatex integrated textile plant was also made a
Covenant of the Loan Agreement (Section 4.03), with the Borrower.
4.02      The expansion of Nyakato power plant was completed in 1978, but
supply of power did not improve because of the worsening fuel supply
situation.   In the years 1979-81, power was cut repeatedly, and 9.8 mm total
of potential Mwatex production was lost. Also, 6.0 mm of production was lost
due to water shortage as the municipal pumping station was incapacitated due
to the lack of power and spare parts. In addition, 7.4 mm of production was
lost due to direct shortage of fuel to operate Mwantex's boilers for steam
generation. Details of down time and resulting losses of production and
revenues are presented in Annex 6.
1/ The number of expatriates was drastically reduced at the end of 1974 when
the contract with the  textile consulting firm managing the plant was
terminated.



- 10 -
4.03      The Bank missions which visited the Mwanza project in 1979, 1980 and
1981 reported alarming deterioration of the operating performance of Mwatex
due to shortages of power, fuel and water, and the most unsatisfactory state
of affairs was being highlighted in the Project Progress Reports. Several
letters were sent by the Mwatex management to TEXCO pointing out the loss of
production and heavy financial losses in 1979, 1980 and 1981. Similar letters
were sent to TEXCO from the Bank and copies to the Principal Secretaries in
the Ministries of Industry and Finance, but in view of the wide-spread
shortages of fuel and power in the country, no remedial actions were taken by
the Government, and it has become apparent that it may not be realistic to
expect the Government to be able to honor its commitments to the Bank
regarding supply of power to Mwanza until there is a general improvement in
the economic situation of the country. Actually, the problems of Nyakato
power plant have not been limited to the shortage of fuel.   The last
supervision mission (November 1982) learned that from the time the plant was
commissioned in 1978, the generators had been repeatedly stopped for
adjustments to eliminate vibration, and prolonged stoppages were necessary to
realign the crankshafts. Finally, in 1962, the problem was traced to faulty
foundations and the plant was closed for major rehabilitation, including
rebuilding of the foundations and regrinding of the crankshafts. The work was
expected to be completed in stages during 1983, which would allow Mwatex to
operate one shift beginning in March, two shifts in June and reinstate full
production in November 1983. (This schedule may be optimistic due not only to
power problems, but also to other problems such as lack of foreign exchange
for procurement of spare parts and dyestuffs). In the meantime, output of the
old Nyakato plant is down to 5 MW which is barely sufficient to satisfy the
domestic needs of the consumers in the area.   It is to be noted, however,
that the existence of the technical problems at Nyakato were not communicated
by Tanesco to Mwatex or TEXCO until late 1982, and during the entire period,
all concerned were under the impression that power interruptions were entirely
due to shortage of fuel.
4.04      In the first three months of operation of the MTP (January-March
1979), the project achieved 86.5% capacity utilization. Subsequently, due to
shortages of power, water and fuel, the production deteriorated and for all of
1979, the project operated at 64.3% capacity utilization. In 1980 and 1981,
the capacity utilization was further reduced to about 50%. In 1982, Mwatex
was non-operational most of the time and finally production was completely
discontinued on October 14, 1982, following the closing of Nyakato for major
repairs (para. 4.03). It is important to point out, however, that during the
operational period of the MTP (Iill No. 2) the technical efficiency in the
weaving mill was gradually improving, and in the spinning mill it remained
close to 90% throughout 1979-1982, i.e. at the level exceeding the appraisal
estimates which is considered excellent for developing countries. Also, while
capacity utilization of Mill No. 1 has been deteriorating, the technical
efficiency, as a result of the supply of spare parts and new management in the
1979-1982 period, had improved. A summary of Mwatex's operating performance
is presented below, and details of capacity utilization and technical
efficiency are shown in Annex 7:

B. Market Development
4.05      Consumption of textile fabrics in Tanzania has shown a slower growth
than expected at the time of the project appraisal. The Bank appraisal
missions projected that the local production would reach 122 mm in 1982 and
that the consumption would increase from 7.9 to 8.7 square meters per capita.
Actually, while the capacity increased to about 144 mm2/, with the
deteriorating economic situation of the country and ensuing shortages of
energy and input materials, the production of textiles decreased steadily from
the 73 mm produced in 1975, and in 1982 only 58 mm were produced. Also, due
to foreign exchange restrictions, imports of textile products were drastically
reduced and, in 1982, the fabric equivalent of the imports was about 24 mm.
Apparent consumption was about 4.5 mm of cloth, about 5 square meters per
capita, one of the lowest levels in the world.
4.06      To increase revenue and reduce consumption, the Government
drastically increased the prices of textile fabrics and imposed high sales
taxes amounting to over 100% of the value ex-factory. For example, a linear
meter (116 cm wide) of printed fabric (Kitange) which at the time of appraisal
sold for TSh 7.0, currently sells at TSh 32.5, including TSh 17.3 of the sales
tax; while during the same time the average industrial wage increased from
about TSh 3.0 to TSh 4.3 per hour. At the same time, the Government made an
effort to develop foreign markets, but with the exception of a barter deal
with Mozambique in 1979 and 1980, the exports to nearby countries amounted to
500-600 tons, worth about US$3 million. The details of production, export and
imports are presented below:

4.07      Textile consumption generally is a direct function of GDP and the
above figure of decreasing per capita consumption reflects, in part, the
difficult economic conditions now prevailing in the country. Even when the
immediate utility problems of Mwatex are solved (para. 4.03), it is difficult
to forecast a rapid return to full output at Mwatex or a dramatic increase in
the overall textile sector's output until economic recovery is underway in
Tanzania.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Incremental Financial Rate of Return
5.01      In order to evaluate the success of MTP in terms of financial rate
of return (FRR), the effects of 'external- factors, i.e. factors outside the
control of the project and plant management such as persistent shortages of
fuel, power and water, have to be separated from the usual project parameters
such as delay in implementation, number of shifts worked or variations in
capital costs. Also, to calculate FRR, assumptions have to be made when MTP
will be back in operation, and at what rate of capacity utilization.
5.02      Assuming a rapid resumption of power in 1983 and a full three-shift
operation in 1984, FRR of the project would be 12.9% in constant terms. If,
however, the "external" factors contributing to the shortage of fuel, power
and water were removed, FRR would have been 21.3%, compared with the appraisal
estimate of 24.2%. Other factors such as lower number of shifts worked and
delay in commissioning had only a minor effect on reducing FRR and accounted
for 1.7 and 2.3% decrease, respectively, in FRR, while lower than anticipated
capital costs increased FRR by 1.1%.
5.03      It appears, however, that operation of MTP beyond a two-shift level
is not likely until there is a significant economic recovery in the country.
If the plant operates one shift for six months in 1983 and two shifts in 1984
and afterwards, which is a most likely scenario, then FRR would be 9.2%. On
the other hand, if, due to the general economic situation in the country, only
one-shift operation can be sustained, FRR would be 3.3%.
5.04      The assumptions and calculations of the FRR are, as shown in Annexes
8 through 10, based on the actual investment costs, the actual sales and
production costs until 1982, and the projected sales and production costs from
1983 and onward. Annual net sales and production costs attributable only to
NTP were not provided by Mwatex. The incremental net sales and production
costs to the project have been estimated by prorating MTP's share of Mwatex
fabric production with consideration for better quality products and lower
average production costs of the new mill. The project cost and benefit
streams are then adjusted to 1975 US dollars after incorporating changes in
the foreign exchange rate.

5.06      The overall financial position of the company deteriorated from 1976
due to: (i) replacement of highly qualified expatriates in key operational
and accounting positions with Tanzanian nationals, in some instances, of
limited professional experience; and (ii) shortage of fuel, power and water
in early years of operation of Mill No. 2 (the Project). The net profit fell
from TSh 7.2 million in 1975 to a net loss of TSh 24.2 million in 1981. The
debt/equity ratio decreased to 83/17 by 1981. Debt service coverage was below
1.0 most of the period, forcing the company to finance debt service payments
with short-term borrowings.
C. Financial Prospects
5.07      The company has not prepared financial projections, !n part, due to
its present extreme difficulties.  At present, TEXCO and ultimately the
Government, is meeting the financial obligations of Mwatex. The company's
short-term financial outlook is not good. However, the company's ability to
service its debt is expected to improve in the near future, as it re-starts
its operations. Annual debt service requirements of the company are currently
estimated to be about TSh 40 million (US$4.4 million equivalent). The company
can meet its minimum debt service requirements plus cash break-even if it
achieves a capacity utilization of about 40% (one-shift with occasional
t-bo-shift operation), which is likely to be achieved during 1984, at the
earliest. By 1984, the company should be able to service its foreign debts at
the present exchange rate, but a major devaluation, as well as the present
high debt structure may require a restructuring of the company's finances. At
the time of the completion mission (Nlovember 1982) none of these possibilities
was being addressed by Mwatex or TEXCO and the mission was not able to obtain
a full analysis on the future of the company.
5.08      The financial problems are not limited to Hwatex but exist in the
textile sector as a whole, and the solution must be addressed by TEXCO. The
November 1982 mission advised TEXCO that it should assess its overall



- 14 -
operations considering the potential overcapacity (if and when all plants
currently under construction are completed), the severe shortage of foreign
exchange (for spares and chemicals), the social problem of laying-off workers,
and try to develop a cost minimization operating scheme that would extend
through the present economic period. The program should consider whether
increased exports of yarn or cloth (not dyed) is possible, to assist TEXCO and
the country in servicing at least part of its external debts. TEXCO
undoubtedly would need significant levels of experienced consulting assistance
in achieving this goal.
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A. Economic Rate of Return
6.01      The revised economic rate of return (ERR) for the project is 8.9%,
compared to the appraisal estimate of 16.1%. The main reason for the lower
return is lower than forecasted capacity utilization in the early years of
operation due to the shortage of fuel, power and water, while other factors
such as a longer than expected implementation period and a lower production
capacity due to abolition of four-shift operation have only a minor effect on
ERR. If the -external' factors contributing to the shortage of fuel, power
and water during 1979-1983 were removed, the ERR would have been
14.2% compared with the appraisal estimate of 16.1%. The remaining deviation
from the appraisal estimate results from a delay in commissioning of the
project and the abolishment of four-shift operation, whose adverse impact on
the ERR have been mitigated by the lower than estimated capital costs.
6.02      As with the FRR (para. 5.03), sensitivity tests on lower levels of
operation were made. If the plant resumes operation on one shift-for six
months in 1983,3/ two shifts in 1984 and afterwards, the ERR would be 4.8%.
6.03      The calculations of ERR are shown in Annexes 13 through 15.
Financial cost and benefit streams are adjusted using economic shadow prices.
The calculations of shadow prices are as follows: for tradable goods,
economic prices are border prices (f.o.b. price for cotton and c.i.f. prices
for fabric) For electricity, the economic price of US$0.078 per KWh is
assumed. For non-tradables, i.e. mostly salaries and wages, a shadow price of
75% of the actual rate is assumed as in the Appraisal Report. Further,
whenever applicable, transfer payments to the Government (custom duties and
sales taxes) are excluded. Also, sensitivity tests on the effect of
production costs indicated that an increase of 10% in annual production costs
would lower ERR by 2.1%.
B. Foreign Exchange Savings and Earnings
6.04      The foreign exchange savings and earnings in 1981, expressed in
constant 1981 dollars, is estimated at US$3.3 million. This figure would be
increased to US$4.0 million when full capacity operation is achieved.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
7.01      At the project level, the institutional performance of Mwatex has to
be divided into three periods. The first was when Mill No. I was managed on a
3/ The plant reportedly resumed one-shift operation in May 1983.



- 15 -
contract basis by an expatriate textile consulting company until early 1976.
The second was when the company was operated by predominantly Tanzanian
personnel until August 1978, and the third has been since August 1978 when
both Mill No. 1 and 2 have been managed by an expatriate management team.
During the first period, the mill achieved a high capacity utilization and
technical efficiency, and 6% return on sales before taxes. During the second
period, the number of expatriates was reduced from 23 to 8 people who were
hired on individual contracts and responsible to the Tanzanian management.
During that time, supervision, maintenance and labor discipline deteriorated
markedly, resulting in a drastic decrease in production, quality and profits.
As stipulated in the Project Agreement, since the completion of the MTP,
Mwatex has been operated by the Pakistani management team and, within
limitations imposed by power, water and fuel shortages, the performance of
Mwatex has been considered satisfactory. Therefore, if the performance of a
company is defined in terms of results achieved by a local management team,
the rating of institutional performance of Mwatex would be quite low. On the
other hand, all textile companies in Tanzania (except Friendship) are operated
by expatriate management, as the qualified local personnel required to fill
the key 15-20 technical, administrative and financial positions in the textile
companies are not available locally. In this context, Mwatex compares well
with other companies operated with expatriate management.
7.02      Also, the performance of TEXCO has been strongly affected by
shortage of qualified personnel. At the time of appraisal, TEXCO employed
twenty five expatriates on a contractual basis. These expatriates were later
released and the Project Implementation Unit formed by TEXCO was not fully
effective, so the supervision of the Engineering Company implementing the
Project was carried out by the staff of the Technical Advisor, reporting
directly to the Managing Director of TEXCO. More recently, TEXCO staff has
been strengthened by a UNIDO team whose personnel are filling top technical,
operational, merketing and financial positions.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
A. Overall Performance and Relationship with Borrower
8.01      The Government of Tanzania requested Bank assistance for the textile
sector in May 1974. Pursuant to this request, the subsector was included in
the Industrial and Mining Sector Survey carried out by the Bank in September
1974. The Mwatex Project was appraised in November 1974, and Board Approval
was granted in June 1975, 13 months after the formal request. In view of
considerably longer loan processing time for other projects, 13 months
interval for MTP from the date of the request to Board Approval shows that the
Bank made a special effort to respond quickly to the Borrower's needs. The
effort is especially significant as MTP was the Bank's first industrial
project in Tanzania and also the first textile project ever undertaken by the
Industry Department.
8.02      In order to expedite the implementation of MTP, the Bank agreed to
use the same engineering firm which prepared the feasibility study, but
prudently insisted that the capability of Mwatex and TEXCO to supervise the
implementation of the project should be strengthened by retaining an
experienced international company of textile consultants as Technical
Advisor.



- 16 -
8.03      The Bank's relationship with Mwatex and TEXCO throughout project
preparation and implementation was excellent and was aided by TEXCO's
provision of a team of local professionals (the PIU) who provided liaison with
TEXCO and the Government in the initial and most critical stage of the
project.
B. Performance in Project Preparation, Formulation and Implementation
8.04      The Bank helped to prepare the project by carrying out the sector
survey, helping to establish priorities in the sector and identifying MTP as
the project with the best chance of providing the needed additional production
of textiles in the shortest possible time, and at relatively low cost. The
Bank also made a valuable contribution to the success of the project by
correcting some of the assumptions of the feasibility study regarding prices
and equipment capacity, labor productivity, technical efficiency, as well as
in preparation of tender documents, machine specifications and reviewing of
the bid evaluation procedures. The Bank also assisted TEXCO in preparation of
the terms of reference for the contracts with the Engineering Company,
Technical Advisor and Textile Consultants who implemented the study of export
marketing prospects, as well as the contract for Technical Management of the
company after MTP completion. Finally, the Bank exercised a careful
monitoring of the project progress reports, mounted six supervision missions
during the 42-month period of project implementation, and assisted Mwatex in
formulating a program of rehabilitating Mill No. 1, using the balance of IBRD
and KFAED loans.
8.05      The Bank played an important and successful role in bringing in
co-financing (para 1.04), to enable the project to proceed without delay and
with minimum use of the Government's foreign exchange reserves.
8.06      The Bank correctly identified training as a key element, and a
substantial training program was included. However, as indicated earlier, the
amount of training should have been larger (para. 3.05).
8.07.     On the debit side, the Bank failed to anticipate and made no
attempts to ensure orderly localization of key personnel in TEXCO and Mwatex
management, which, in retrospect, had rather deleterious effects on Mwatex and
the entire textile sector.
8.08      At the sector level, the Bank had correctly raised the issue of the
Government's plans regarding other expansions in the cotton textile sector
(para. 2.02). After extensive discussions at all levels within the Bank on
whether it was appropriate or feasible to set limits on expansion, the
compromise language of Section 4.02 of the Loan Agreement was reached
requiring the Borrower to carry out a study of export possibilities for
Tanzania's textiles, and applying the conclusions of the study to any major
expansion of the textile manufacturing industry (Annex 16). Although the
letter of the covenant was followed, the spirit was not. In the ensuing years,
in addition to the Bank sponsored Morogoro Textile Project, designed to
satisfy Tanzania's need for polyester-cotton blends as recommended by the
study, three other cotton text'le projects were undertaken by TEXCO with no
apparent regard to the excess capacity being built. The Bank was not



- 17 -
consulted and while it is not clear that a stronger position regarding sector
planning and investment strategy was achievable in practical terms, at least a
consultation clause on overall planning and development could have resulted in
a continuous dialogue with TEXCO regarding limitations of the country
resources and a realistic supply/demand balance of textile products.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
A. Overall Assessment
9.01      In the overall assessment of the project, a clear distinction has to
be made between the implementation and subsequent operation of the project,
especially as the onset of severe shortages of fuel, power and water coincided
(beginning of 1979) with the completion of the project. The Mwanza Textile
Project could be considered one of the best Bank projects in Tanzania in terms
of implementation. Very close attention was paid to time schedule and cost
control. Civil works, machinery procurement and training programs have been
completed with minimum delay and, overall, within the appraised cost. The
plant has a proven capability to produce cotton woven fabrics at low cost and
relatively high efficiency, and quality suitable for domestic and export
markets in neighboring countries. On the other hand, the plant still cannot
be effectively operated without assistance of an expatriate management team.
As a matter of fact, the appraisal mission anticipated that the plant would
require foreign assistance after completion and an appropriate covenant
(para. 3.09) regarding technical management was made part of the Project
Agreement. However, neither the Bank, or, for that matter, other donors,
adequately anticipated the severe difficulties which would face Tanzania's
economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s, or the foreign exchange problems
which caused drastic shortages of fuel, power, spare parts and other input
materials which have been responsible for the subsequent operational problems
in Mwatex and the entire textile sector.
B. Lessons for the Borrower and the Bank for Similar Projects
9.02      Lessons learned from the experience in this project were:  (a) given
enough financial and human resources a project can be implemented within the
appraised time schedule and capital costs, but it cannot be effectively
operated unless maintenance of infrastructure and supply of vital inputs can
be assured; (b) as far as infrastructure is concerned, the technical probles
of Nyakato power plant could be considered force majeure but at the same time,
the fact that electricity supply to Mwatex was dependent on the operation of a
single power plant ratber than a multiplant grid was not taken into
consideration in evaluation of major risks associated with the Project; (c)
the risks associated with the condition of the water pumping station in Nwanza
and its dependence on the power supply were not recognized; {d) a major
reduction in the number of expatriates in Mwatex and TEXCO was not recognized
as a major risk; in retrospect, a correct strategy should have been to
establish and finance a major management training program and to localize the
key positions in the sector more gradually until such a program was completed;
(e) not enough attention was given to labor training, in particular the
difficulties in training the adequate number of critically important weaving
operators; (f) at the time of appraisal, Mwatex and the sector were operating



- 18 -
at 168 hours per week (four shifts/seven days per week), and it was assumed by
the appraisal mission that this would become the norm in the sector; the
lesson here is that in Tanzania, as in many other developing countries, due to
social pressures the operation of a seven-day working week is not likely to be
achieved; and (g) the current deterioration of Tanzania's economic situation
and, particularly, the drastic foreign exchange shortage, probably could not
have been predicted in 1975; however, the lesson here is that any project with
no prospects for export earnings or assured allocation of foreign currency and
requiring a significant amount of imported inputs annually (dyes, chemicals
and spare parts), is highly vulnerable to foreign exchange constraints, and
risks associated with possible deterioration of the country's economy should
have been taken into consideration.
9.03      In summary, implementation of the project itself has been successful
mainly because Mwatex and TEXCO used expatriate help from established firms
and worked harmoniously with them. The Bank, in addition to financing, has
rendered valuable assistance in project identification, preparation and
implementation. Neither TEXCO, Mwatex nor the Bank placed enough emphasis on
using the presence of expatriates to train local management or to establish a
comprehensive training program for technical, administrative and financial
personnel.   Also, the risks associated with the fragility of Tanzanian
infrastructure and the foreign exchange situation were not recognized.
