Some lessons\n            learned included: an Adaptable Program Lending (APL)\n            instrument in conjunction with a sound planning or\n            analytical effort are an appropriate approach to ensure the\n            success of infrastructure projects characterized by the\n            incremental implementation of proven technologies. The\n            flexible APL approach facilitated also carrying on a\n            procurement plan that adapted its design to market\n            conditions and consequently achieved greater competition.\n            Projects including both policy reform and infrastructure\n            (physical) components pose additional challenges that\n            require synchronized design and implementation. Two issues\n            to consider in this respect are: providing a carefully\n            designed technical assistance for specific parts of the\n            reform agenda, and the coordination of both policy reform\n            and physical components could benefit from a more specific\n            definition of performance indicators. The active role of the\n            government is paramount in addressing the conflict between\n            economic growth and environmental protection objectives. The\n            challenges faced by executing agencies during a reform\n            process justify an additional support tailored to their\n            specific needs. The evaluation of long-term results requires\n            a Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) effort beyond project\n            closure and broad in scope."}, "docdt": "2012-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
