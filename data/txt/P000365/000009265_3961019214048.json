Some\n            lessons learned included: to continue in a direction which\n            has become inappropriate is likely to result in poor\n            implementation and performance and lack of achievement of\n            the Project objectives. In such a case, the Project ought to\n            be adjusted or restructured where necessary. Technical\n            assistance should be provided in an environment which is\n            committed to building on the expertise thus provided. This\n            requires a strong leadership capable of developing and\n            implementing a human resource development strategy. Capacity\n            building has to be considered on a long-term basis. Training\n            is most useful when immediately applicable in the day-to-day\n            work environment. When the sector lacks strong leadership\n            and commitment to efficiency and accountability, the role of\n            the institution in charge of road maintenance needs to be\n            concentrated on planning, programming, budgeting and\n            supervising road maintenance works. Work execution should be\n            contracted-out to achieve better efficiency and adequacy\n            between the program of works and available resources.\n            Financing of road maintenance inputs (gasoil, spare parts)\n            as done under the project should definitely be discarded."}, "docdt": "1996-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
