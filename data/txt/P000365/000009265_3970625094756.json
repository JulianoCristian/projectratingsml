objectives of the Sixth Highway\n            Project are: (a) to increase road transport capacity, while\n            reducing transport cost and protecting past investments in\n            the paved highway network; (b) to consolidate past efforts\n            in institutional development for the transport sector; (c)\n            to strengthen PNMGC's management system to improve\n            productivity and resource utilization control; and (d) to\n            strengthen Labogenie's operational and research\n            capacity. The project consists of: (a) physical development\n            of the paved highway network, containing the following\n            elements: (i) a 4-year pavement strengthening program\n            through bituminous overlays and partial realignment; (ii)\n            upgrading gravel roads; and (iii) consultant services and\n            preparation of feasibility studies and detailed engineering;\n            and (b) institutional development in the transport sector."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
