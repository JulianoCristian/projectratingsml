(a)  to increase road transport capacity, while
reducing transport cost and protecting past
investments in the paved highway network;
(b) to consolidate past efforts in institutional
development for the transport sector;
(c)  to strengthen the management system of PNNGC
to improve its productivity and its control
of resource utilization; and
(d) to strengthen Labogénie's operational and
research capacity.
To reach these objectives the project consists of:
(a) physical development of the paved highway
network, containing the following elements:



- viii -
(i) a four-year pavement strengthening
program (about 600 km) through bitu-
minous overlays and partial realign-
ment where necessary;
(ii) the upgrading of about 150 km of
gravel roade to paved standards; and
(iii) consultant services for the super-
vision of (i) and (il) above and the
preparation of feasibility studies and
detailed engineering of future road
upgrading projects;
(b) institutional development in the transport
sector, containing the following elements:
(i) technical assistance to MINEQ to
improve road investment planning and
maintenance planning and execution;
(ii) technical assistance to MINT to
improve sector planning and road
safety, including buildings and
equipment for vehicle inspection;
(iii) technical assistance to PNMGC to
improve its management and operations;
(iv) training for MINEQ, MINT, PNMGC, and
Labogénie personnel together vith
selected fellowships; and
(v)   improvement of operational and train-
ing facilities in MINEQ, PNMGC and
Labogénie, including buildings,
equipment and teaching aids.
Benefits and Risks:   The principal benefits expected from the project
would be increased transport capacity, reduced
transport costs and protection of previous invest-
ment in the sector. A major non-quantifiable
benefit would be the improvement of the sector's
planning and management capabilities expected from
project training and institution-building activi-
ties. Other non-quantifiable benefits vould be
savings of time, lover road maintenance costs, and
increased net value of agricultural produce. The
principal risks associated with the project
concern financing, costs, institutional develop-
ment and traffic grovth. Despite interest from
public agencies and private banks in cofinancing
this project, external financing may not be



- ix -
sufficient to cover all foreign exchange costs.
In this case, the Government has agreed either to
reduce the scope of the road strengthening compo-
nent or to finance the gap from its own resources.
Continued strong competition among contractors i8
expected to keep construction costs within reason-
able bounds. The institutional risk that PNMGC
vould fail to improve its performance is slim as
measures to implement its action plan are already
underway. The momentum of Cameroon's economic
grawth minimises the risk of any significant
slow-down in recent rapid growth of traffic
volume.

SMIH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTIO<
1.01      The Governuent of Cameroon has requested Bank assistance for a
highway project aimed at: (a) physical development of the paved highvay
network ln line with Cameroon"s rapid economic grouth; and (b) institu-
tional development in the transport sector and particularly the highLay
subsector. The proposed project which vould be the Bank Group's Seventh
Project iu the highvay sector (including one feeder road project and the
fourteenth in the transport sector.  It follows logically from the
Fourth Eighway Project (Loan 1723/Credit 926-Qi) and the Fifth Righvay
Project (Loan 2180-CM). 1/
1.02      The basic objectives of the Fourth Highvay Project. approved
in June 1979, vere: (a) 1nctitutional development through the establish-
ment of a Road Planning Unit at the Roads Directorate (DR) and a three-
year training program for road maintenance staff; and (b) improvement of
the unpaved highvay netvork through a four-year road maintenance and
rehabilitatlon program, assistance to domestic contractors and pre-
investment studies. The project, vhich vifl be completed in 1985, has
provided a basic maintenance system for the unpaved network.
1.03      The Fifth Highvay Project, approved in June 1982, vas substan-
tially based on preinvestment studies carried out under the Fourth
Righvay Project. The objectives of the project were to: (a) assist
Cameroo« in upgrading the economically important Douala-Edéa-Yaoundé
road; (b) improve the country's capacity for road rehabilitation and
transport planning; and (c) prepare a maintenance and strengthening
program for the country's paved network. The work on the Douala-Yaoundé
road is progressing satisfactorily and should be completed by the end of
1985. Folloving initial delays ln selection of consultants, the studies
under (b) and (c) are also progressing satisfactorily.
I/ Annes 1 provides a brief description of past Bank Croup iending for
transportation projects ln Cameroon, including major comments from
Project Performance Audit Reports.



- 2 -
1.04      The proposed project, vith an estimated cost of US$ 295
million equivalent, would continue and build on the past assistance to
the highway sector, particularly-the Fourth and Fifth Higbway Projects.
It vould include tvo major components: (a) a four-year first phase of a
maintenance and strengthening program for the paved netnork and the
upgrading of two highvay sections to paved standards; and (b) institu-
tional development through technical assistance and training for the
main agencies in the highvay subsector as vell as the Ministry of
Transport (KM)T. The proposed project, with its heavy emphasis on
overcoming the remaining major institutional veaknesses in the highvay
subsector as vell as on preserving and upgrading the paved network in
the face of rapid economie and traffic groath, is based on a transport
sector strategy paper recently prepared by the Bank.
II.  iHE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System /
1. Transport Netvork
2.01      Cameroon is one of the large.:t (population of about 9.4
million in 1983), and most prosperous (per capita GNP cf about US$800 in
1983) countries in West Africa. With a continued prudent approach to
the expansion of oil and gas production and the use of oil revenues
combined with further development of agriculture and forestry, Cameroon
could be facing a period of rapid and sustained econo-mic growth; fairly
raFid growth in fact already took place during the Fourth Plan period
(1977-1981) when the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by over 8%
annually in real terms.
2.02      Cameroon' s transport system is export/import-oiiented and
focuses on Douala, the main port and commercial center. Most exports
and imports are shipped through Douala, mainiy to Yaoundé, the capital
and to Northern Cameroon and the Chad border via the road/rail Trans-
cameroon route and to the North West via the Douala-Bafoussam corridor.
Chad to the north relies on the Cameroon transport network for its
principal access to the sea and the international markets. The Central
African Republic (CAR) to the east is finding it increasingly attractive
to transport high-value/low-volume goods via the Cameroonian transport
links which are shorter and faster than the competing links via Congo.
2.03      The transport infrastrur:ure consists of about 65.000 km of
highways, of vhic7 50Z are unclassified earth roads and tracks and only
4% are paved; 1,143 lm of railways (comprisinsR the 943 km Transcameroon
Line from Douala to Yaoundé and Ngaoundéré and the 200 km Western Line
2/ Details on the transport sector nt-twork and sector issues are given
in the Transport Strategy Paper of February 29, 1984 (Ref. 1 of
Douments available in the Project Fil.).



-3-
from Douala to Nkongsamba); one principal port at Douala and four minor
ports; a main international airport at Douala, with a second one at
Garoua, together with a dozen smaller domestic airports.
2.04      While the transport network vas greatly extended and improved
duriug the Third and Fourth Plan periods, the network is still rather
rudimentary for a country the size of Cameroon and vith strong grovth
prospects. This is particularly true for the highway network. There i8
a great need, recognized in the Fifth Plan (1982-1986), to upgrade parts
of the network, particularly paved highways, to handle more economically
the existing and rapidly increasing traffic volumes. The proposed
project, together vith several other important transport sector projects
presently under execution or in an advanced stage of preparation, vill
help to improve the transport situation.
2. Transport Sector Planning and Policy Formulation
2.05      Despite improvements. there is still a general veakness in
analytical and policy-making capabilities, in the data base for economic
decision-making and planning, and in the technical and economic eval-
uation based on an assessment of demand. This general veakness in
planning and policy formulation exists also in the transport sector.
MINT. established in 1970. is in charge of transport policy formulation
and overall transport sector planning.  The MKnistry of Equipment
(MINEQ) is responsible for the planning, construction and maintenance of
the highuay network. The Xinisstry of Plan and Regional Development
(MIhPAT) is responsible for overall planning. MINM suffered until
recently from: (a) the absence of a formal and adequately staffed unit
directly responsible for transport planning, coordination and study
(Planning Unit); (b) the lack of a sound data base on transport supply
and demand and operating performance; (c) the shortage of motivated and
qualified personnel due to the Ministry's inability so far to attract
and retain adequate personnel; (d) the existence of two other planning
ceaters (MINPAT and INhEQ), which are better staffed and generally more
influential; and (e) an insufficient perception of the need for and
nature of a sector policy package. Steps are, hovever, undervay to
overcome (a), (b) and (e) (para. 2.06 below). Complementary measures
for (b), (c) and (e) have been included in the project (para. 3.10).
2.06      During the last three years the Bank has intensified its
discussion vith the Government concerning appropriate measures to
develop transport sector planning capabilities.  The Goverument's
option, in 1981, vas to develop complementary capacities in MINT and in
MINEQ, the first focussing on overall sector and aviation, railways,
port/shipping and road transport subsector planning, vith the second
focussing more on highvay sector project planning.  The Bank supported
this approach. A Planning Division (DP) in the DR of MINEQ vas esta-
blished in mid 1982, with technical assistance provided under the Fourth
Highvay Project. In early 1985 the Minister of Transport establlshed a
Transport Planning and Coordination Unit in the Office of the Secretary
General, headed by an economist, Chef de Service, complemented by six
young economistb and tvo lawyers. Proposals have been made for Presi-
dential approval to upgrade the unit to a division headed by a director.

Under the Fifth Highway Project, the Bank is financing technical assist-
ance for initial operation of this Unit at MINT. At loan negotiations,
the Government agreed to review vith the Bank by November 30. 1985 the
specific institutional measures it proposes to take to further
strengthen transport planning and coordination. With regards to the
Bank assisted technicdl assistance to MINT, the Government agreed to
review uith the Bank by November 30 of each year: (a) the vork carried
out during the preceding year; (b) the vork program for the subsequent
year; and (c) follow-up action taken or planned regardlng major recom-
mendations arising from the technical assistance.  The Fifth Highvay
Project is also financing technical assistance for the preparation of a
national transport survey which is expected to provide a sound basis for
decisions on many sector policy questions such as cost recovery and
tariffs for parastatal enterprises as vell as sector operations and
investment requirements. At loan negotiations the Government agreed to
review vith the Bank the recommendations arising from the Transport
Survey and to consult with the Bank on follow-up actions regarding their
implementation. The Government also agreed to exchange views annually
with the Bank regarding its investment program in the sector.  The
technical assistance provided under the Fifth Bighvay Project is insuf-
ficient in extent and time to assure a viable and self-sufficient
planning entity at MINT and to assure necessary follow-up actions to the
Transport Survey. Therefore, and in response to the Gc>vernment's
request during negotiations, the proposed project provides for a con-
tinuation of technical assistance to MINT as vell as fellovships for
complementary training (paras. 3.10 and 3.11).
B. The Road Transport Subsector

1. Road Network and Traffic -/
2.07      The 65,000 km road network of Cameroon (see map IBRD 18425)
gives a road density of 0.14 km per 1m2 which is in line with that of
other countries in the Region (Nigeria 0.13, Ivory Coast 0.14 km per
km 2)

Rounded 
Although the overall road density is comparable with that in neighboring
countries, the paved network i linited, accounting for only about 4Z of
the network versus an average of about 15% in the Region (23% in
Nigeria, 8% in Ivory Coast). The road network is most developed around
Douala, Yaounde and Garoua while elsevhere large parts of the country
are still isolated or served by the most rudimentary infrastructure.
2.08      The condition of the network varies from good to poor. As a
result of improved maintenance under the Fourth Highvay Project. the
conditions of the national. provincial and departmental gravel network
ls improving. Much of the feeder roads network (rural roads and un-
classified earth tracks) is, however, impassable for part of the year.
The condition of the paved netvork is also deteriorating as a result of
age, rapidly increasing traffic volumes and excessive vehicle loads and
is therefore in need of strengthening.
2.09      Traffic volumes vary significantly by type of road (Nap IED
18545). In 1982 it averaged about 950 vehicles per day (v.p.d.) for the
paved network; in the case of the gravel and earth roads the averages
vere about 150 v.p.d. for the national roads. about 100 v.p.d. for the
provincial roads and about 75 v.p.d. for the departmental roada. The
feeder roads network had an estlmated average of about 15 v.p.d.
Comparable information is not available for other years.  It is,  ow-
ever, clear that overall traffic has been increasing relatively quickly
in recent years in line vïth the rapid economlc growth. Fuel consump-
tion increased by an average of about 9% p.a. between FY1972 and 1983
(Azuex 2-1).
2.10      The motor vehicle fleet (excluding two-vheelers) vas estlmated
at 98,200 in 1982 with a grovth rate of about 7% between 1971 and 1982
and even faster over the last 5 years (Annex 2-2).
2.11      Although detailed information is not available, it is clear
that the road transport industry has been developing rapidly in recent
years. In 1984 some 7,400 registered individuals or companies vith



about 12,240 vehicles were engaged in road transport, of which 55 had
more than 10 vehicles. The industry has developed under a generally
liberal regulatory framework. A draft decree on road transport regu-
lations has recently been prepared.  The draft which contains mild
requirements regarding licensing, registration. safety, insurance and
some organizational aspects, appears appropriate for the current devel-
opment of road transport in Cameroon. 4/
2.12      The Government is beginning to pay increasing attention to the
question of road traffic safety. In 1983 MINT engaged a consortium of
Dutch consultants and traffic safety specialists to evaluate the
existing situation and prepare a road traffic safety program.  Based on
the consultant's study, the Government has requested that the Bank
finance under the ongoing Fifth Righway Project, a road safety program
related to the high standard Yaoundé-Douala highway. The Government
also requested during loan negotiations for the proposed project that
the Bank assist in financing a program of road safety and vehicle
inspection (para. 3.10).
2. Administration and Management
Ministry of Equipment (MINEQ)
2.13      MINEQ is responsible for public buildings and the highway
sector. It is also involved in technical education through its National
Public Works School and is the Ministry responsible for the two auto-
nomous agencies: the National Equipment Pool (PNMGC) and the National
Civil Works Laboratory (Labogénie). MINEQ's DR plans, constructs a2d
maintains the classified roai network. DR has a central office in
Yaoundé with a planning division and sub-directorates for new construc-
tion, mintenance and feeder roads.  It acts through the ten provincial
offices and their maintenance and feeder road services (Annex 2-3).
While the organizational set up of MINEQ and DR is adequate and the
balance between central management and decentralized authority is sound.
its main veakness is the lack in the number of experienced intermediate
level managers.  The public service salary level and competition from
the private sector for qualified staff makes it difficult for MINEQ and
DR to recruit and retain highly qualified engineers and other special-
ists.
2.14      As a way of overcoming the constraints imposed by civil
service salaries and encouraging greater efficiency, consideration has
recently been given to the transformation of DR into an independent
National Highway Authority or, as a first step, to establish a separate
National Authority for the administration of the paved network. The
Government has requested the Bank to include in the pavement survey

intermodal transport in Cameroon (Ref. 9).



- 7 -
financed under the Fifth Highway Project, a study of the advantages and
disadvantages as vell as alternative solutions for the establishment of
such a Highway Authority. The study vill be available in the second
half of 1985.
National Equipment Pool (PNWGC) 5/
2.15      PNMGC, an autonomous agency under the tutelage of M MEQ, rents
out equipment to Government agencies (95% of its activities) and the
private sector. MINEQ rents at least 80% of its equijoment from PNMGC,
the remaining 20% being either rented from private firms or belonging to
MINEQ.  PNMGC is responsible for the procurement and the maintenance of
this equipment. While its status is suitable to its purpose and needs
only minor improvements, it has considerable difficulties regarding
organization, management and personnel; its organization chart is not
vell suited to its operations; PNMGC's management information system
does not produce reliable information for internal control of opera-
tions, decision-mxaking and financial management; the upper level staff
ïs under the civil service status, on temporary assignment in PNNGC, and
therefore has little experience vith management, and a lov level of
motivation; for lover level staff, the revard and motivation systems do
not provide the necessary incentives. These issues vill be addressed
vithin the framework of technical assistance for management, staff
motivation and performance evaluation proposed under the project.
2.16      Under the Fourth Righway Project and from various other
donors, PNMGC has received a considerable amount of road maintenance
equipment over the 1982-1984 period. Partly as a consequence of PNMGC's
management difficulties, equipment maintenance capacity is poor.
Present equipment availability is only about 65% and there is a high
risk that it may drop below 50%, vith the effect that the lack of
operational equipment vould become a major bottleneck for the implement-
ation of road maintenance.
2.17      Until 1983, PNMGC's revenues covered essentially vorking
expenditures, vith a working ratio above 78% and an operating ratio
fluctuating around 130Z. With the delivery of the equipment of the
Fourth Highway Project in FY1983, the situation changed significantly:
revenues increased by more than 100% between FY1982 and FY1984, as the
capacity constraint due to insufficient equipment vas removed, while
working expenditures increased by 35% only. As a result, cash genera-
tion increased from CFAF .3 billion to CFAF 1.6 billion. Concurrently,
annuaId'epreciation increased sharply from CFAF .5 billion in FY1982 to
CFAF 2.5 billion in FY1984 while PNMGC's operating ratio remained at
about 130%. The replacement needs being limited over the 1981-84
period, PNMGC has been able to accumulate CFAF 1.7 billion in an escrow
account opened under the Fourth Righway Project for future replacement.
The necessary capacity increase for improved road maintenance is
5/ More detail on PNMGC are included in Document 6-b in Project File.

expected to result mainly from a higher equipment availability, rather
than an increase in fleet size. Therefore, only some special equipment,
workshop equipment, tools and spare parts vill be financed under the
project.
2.18      To improve the equipment pool's performance the project vill
assist in implementing a time and target specific action plan through
359 man-months of technical assistance.  The Action Plan vas agreed vith
PNMGC's management and the Government during negotiations. The action
plan is described in detail in Annex 2-4. Its main objectives are to:
(a)   increase productivity through staff motivation and
training;
(b)   raise and maintain at 80% the proportiov of equipment
available for use at a given time;
(c)   enhance managerial autonomy and efficiency through a
revision of its internal organization;
(d)   improve financial autonomy and cost recovery through
tariff adjustment; and
(e)   transfer maintenance of specific road equipment to the
private sector vhen the private sector is able to carry
out such vorks efficiently and-at a lover cost to the
Government.
The above objectives vill be achieved in two stages: in the short run,
PflMGC and the Government, vith the help of consultants, vill address the
institutional issues and implement statutory and organizational changes;
in the longer run, productivity improvement and financial efficiency
targets vill be achieved, vith technical assistance financed under the
proposed project. Consultants for the first phase of the action plan
are being selected and are expected to start vork by August 1985.
2.19      PNMGC being an autonomous entity organized on a commercial
basis, the funds provided under the proposed loan for operational
equipment vill be on-lent by the Government to PNMGC under terms accept-
able to the Bank, over six years (the approximate economic life of
operational equipment), vith one year of grace. As PNMGC's activities
are for the maintenance of collective and social assets, and the Govern-
ment is lender and at the same time the main customer, the re-lending
rate vill be equivalent at least to the Bank rate vithout premium on the
portion of the loan for operational equipment. The foreign exchange
risk vill be borne by the Government. During negotiations, under-
standings vere reached vith the Government and PNMGC on this
arrangement.
2.20      PNMGC's present accounting system is not satisfactory, and was
rejected by the private auditor on the basis of technical shortcomings.
A reorganization of the accounting procedures, financed under the Fourth
Righway Project, is presently underway. and the accounts are expected to
be auditable from FY1985 onward.

National Civil Works Laboratory (Labogénie) 6/
2.21      Labogéniee, like PNMGC an autonomous agency under the tutelage
of MINEQ, is in charge of materials testing and soil Investigations for
buildings and road construction. Labogénie charges a fee for its
services and in 1983, its`total revenues had reached about CFAF 1.6
billion, with a positive net result. Its main cllents are the Covern-
ment and parastatals (70Z).  Labogénie's organization and management
are satisfactory and do not require changes (Annex 2-5). Its commercial
perspectives are good, thanks to a growing market and a good quality of
services. The proposed project vould include a component for expansion
of Labogénie's facilities and for fellovships to enable it to meet
increasing demand (see para. 3.09).
2.22      Accounts are kept satisfactorily on a commercial basis.
Rovever, the Covernment agreed during negotiations to make Labogénie
include in its balance sheet from FY1985 onvard buildings and equipment
supplied by the Government and presently in use, at their current value.
2.23      The present financial situation is satisfactory, vith the
income statement showing a small profit (Annex 2-6). Hovever, the
Government agreed during negotiations to make Labogénie reduce its
receivables from 13 months of revenue in FY1983 to a maximum of 8 months
in FY1986.
2.24      In order to mnintain a suitable profitability to finance its
future grovth, the Government agreed, during negotiations to make
Labogénie take all necessary measures, including working capital control
and tariff adjustment to maintain a ratio of profitability of sales
(complement to 1. of working ratio) above .10 7/ in FY1986 and above .15
fram FY1987 onward. This target can be achieved vithout tariff adjust-
ments above inflation, provided costa are kept at a reasonable level
(Annex 2-6).
3. Engineering and Construction
2.25      Cameroon's variety of climatic, topographic and geotechnical
conditions makes the selection of appropriate road design standards a
difficult and complex undertaking. The Sub-directorate of New Works
vithin the DR is responsible for the design and construction of the main
road network. It employs consultants for major design works and the
supervision of construction, and associates the Labogénie to both design
and quality control of construction. So far Cameroon relies on French
61 Document 7 in Project File provides more detail on Labogénie.
7/ With no more than 10% of revenues covering depreciation and
financial charges, the remaining 90% financing expenses directly
related to operations (personnel expenditure, consumptions and
general expenses.



- 10 -
specifications and standards for geometric, pavement and structural
design, adapted by consultants for specific projects. Efforts are,
however, underway and supported by this project to develop and issue
Cameroonian standards and specifications which would take into account
the particular conditions prevailing in Cameraon.
2.26      Contracts for major civil work projects are awarded generally
on the basis of prequalification and competitive bidding and ln the case
of works financed by international or bilateral assistance subject to
the procurement guidelines of the agency involved. While the Sub-
directorate of New Works prepares the prequalification and tender
documents, the Central Tender Board (DCM) is in charge of revieving and
finalizing the documents, prequalifying contractors, inviting tenders
and making recommendations on contract award. Althoug1. the MINEQ is
represented at DCM Board meetings, the decisions <-aached there do not
always take into account the legitimate technical interests of the
Ministry. This, together with a shortage of qualified staff and appro-
priate procedures vithin DCM sometimes cause delays in procurement.  The
recent reorganization of DCM and technical assistance to be provided
under the Second Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1168-CM) should
alleviate this problem. The Government has also requested the Bank to
participate in a procurement seminar in Yaoundé.
2.27      Most of the major contractors are local subsidiaries of
European firas.  Prices are competitive.  In a few instances, the
Government, in an effort to reduce quickly the-backlog of paved road
rehabilitation and new construction, resorted to negotiated contracts.
Hovever, the Government is realizing that this award procedure is
uneconomic since the potential gain in time is more than made up by the
increase in cost and therefore should only be used in emergency situ-
ations.
2.28      The country's domestic small and medium-sized contractors
(about 350) vork primarily in building construction and participate only
marginally in civil vorks, due to difficult access to capital. insuffi-
cient equipment, lack of experienced staff, inadequate management
capability and limited Governuent support. The ongoing Fourth Highway
Project is addressing this problem by providing work cut to the size
corresponding to the domestic contractors' capacity and their technical
capabilities. Works are still underway but a preliminary evaluation
indicates that the situation vith respect to domestic contractors
remains unsatisfactory. Further Bank assistance in a follcw-up project
will be needed once a review of the financial sector scheduled for
FY1986 is completed and the major bottleneck for the amall contractors'
development--difficult access to capital--has been clearly assessed.

4. Maintenance
2.29      DR is responsible for maintaining all classified roads.
Within the DR the Sub-directorate of Maintenance-plans and monitors road
maintenance operations for the national, provincial and departmental
road network. The actual execution of maintenance operations is carried
out at the provincial level for mechanized maintenance (regravelling,
grading) whereas manual maintenance (filling of pot holes, cleaning of
ditches and drainage structures) is done at the subdivisional level.
This system vas set up under the Fourth Highvay Project and is vorking
satisfactorily. The level of road maintenance expenditures and future
requirements are discussed further in para. 2.38. Maintenance of the
unclassified network is under the responsibility of local authorities
whose efforts are rather aleatoric and depend mainly on the initiatives
of individual Prefects and village Chiefs.
2.30      Maintenance and construction of classified rural roads is the
responsibility of the Sub-directorate of Feeder Roads vithin the DR.
Again, maintenance and construction are planned and monitored at the
central level vhereas the actual execution is carried out at the provin-
cial level. The provincial services for feeder roads have been created
only recently (May 1984) and are not yet staffed adequately to meet all
needs of feeder road construction and maintenance. This situation vill
be addressed in a follow-up project to the ongoing feeder roads project,
which had equipped and staffed one of the provinces on a pilot basis
Il the meantime, agricultural project units such as SODECOTON and
SODECAO will have to continue to look after feeder road construction and
maintenance in their project area.
2.31      The maintenance of the paved road netwGrk is the responsibil-
ity of the Sub-directorate of Maintenance through the provincial main-
tenance services. In an effort to improve paved road maintenance, two
special services for the maintenance of paved roads in the Northern
Provinces vere established in May 1984 vith German Technical Assistance.
Pending the outcome of the ongoing discussions about the creation of a
National Road Authority, it is unlikely that further special services
vili be established. Hovever what is needed, and supported by the
project, is a Central Unit for the planning and monitoring of routine
and, in particular, periodic maintenance work for paved roads. This
Pavement Management Unit would base itself on the results of the ongoing
pavement survey and vould, in close cooperation vith Labogénie, keep the
survey up to date and program maintenance operations to maintain the
capacity of the paved network at an adequate level. To permit a smooth
transition from the pavement survey to the pavement management unit, the
Government has recently established this unit, and staffed it vith two
Cameroonian engineers and technical assistance.

5. Training 8/
2.32      Tvo basic problems affect the efficiency of the road subsector
institutions: (a) the shortage of qualified engineers and technicians
(out of a total of 171 approved graduate engineer positions only 82 are
filled and for senior technicians only 100 out of 216 positions are
filled), and (b) the lack of consistent staff planning and on-the-job
training. The Government has concentrated its efforts on increasing the
number of entry level engineers and technicians for the sector with good
results. It is estimated that by 1987 most of the vacancies vill be
filled. Therefore the project vill only address the staff planning and
on-the-job training aspect in MINEQ, PNMGC and Labogénie.
MINEQ
2.33      Within the Ministry there is a training division bu- its
activities are limited to prepare civil service promotion examination
papers and other ad hoc assignments whereas the staff planning and staff
development functions are not attended to, because of lack in know-hov.
The project vill assist in strengthening the training division and in
redirecting its attention to staff planning and development.
2.34      Under the Fourth Highway Project a training center for road
foremen, equipment operators, truck drivers and mechanics vas establish-
ed in Akonolinga and has so far recycled successfully more than 500 road
maintenance staff. The initial design vas that of a temporary produc-
tion and training center but its success and its ability to attract
trainees from all provinces and even from the private sector warrants a
more permanent installation, vhich vill now be provided under the
project.
PNfGC
2.35      PNMGC has no officer in charge of staff planning and training.
With the exception of a few fellovships financed by the Bank, PNMGC has
made no effort to upgrade its staff despite the existence of a mecha-
nics' training center in Douala and an equipment operators training
center in Yaoundé. Both centers are operating below capacity mainly
because PNMGC's management did not select and release staff for training
in the Centers. PNMGC's management has nov realized the substantial
training needed by its staff and has requested the inclusion of a
training component in the project.
Labogénie
2.36      Staff planning and training efforts have been adequate in the
past, due to good management and the training component of the Fifth
8/ Annex 2-7 provides more information on this point.



- 13 -
Highway Project. In view of Labogénie's strong expansion in the past
and into the future, further training efforts will be necessary in the
form of fellowships and training facilities included under the project.
6. Road Financing and Cost Recovery _/
2.37      Road investment and maintenance expenditures vere rather even
during the rYI977-81 period, averaging some CFAF 22.5 billion per year
but thereafter more than quadrupled to their present level of CFAF 94.2
billion (Annex 2-8, Table 1) as shown below:
Road Construction and Maintenance Outlays ln Cameroon, FY1984
(CFAF millions)
Construction                     76,647
Maintenance Expenditures         13,558
Personnel and Overhead            4,000  (est.)
Total             94&=05
The development of road maintenance expenditures alone during the
FY1977-84 period is shown graphically in Annex 2-9. As a result of
increased Government revenues the share of construction expenditures
financed from the investment budget and special accounts (basically from
oil revenues) have increased in recent years from about 47% in FY1979 ta
77% in FY1984 while the share of foreign financing has declined corres-
pondingly.
2.38      Road maintenance allocations have been increasing reasonably
over the last years in line with DR's absorptive capacity. Table 2 of
Annex 2-8 shows future maintenance expenditure needs, which take into
account improved maintenance standards in line with Cameroon's economic
growth. In order to maintain Cameroon's road network at an adequate
level of transport capacity at appropriate cost, the Government agreed
during negotiations to discuss vith the Bank annually. not later than
April 30, the draft maintenance program for the folloving year through
FY1991.  In this connection the Government vas provided with an estimate
of future annual maintenance expenditures (including personnel and
overhead) to be used as target figures in establishing the annual
maintenance budget as summarized in the followlng table and detailed in
Annex 2-8, Table 2.
9/ Annex 2-8 provides more information on this point.

1990                             28.1
2.39      In the past, revenues from gross road user charges (import
duties and taxes on new vehicles, spare parts and tires, fuel as vell as
other taxes or fees) vere traditionally at about the same level as
actual expendïtures on highway maintenance and highway administration
plus the bulk of new construction expenditures. Even after adjusting
downward the gross road user revenues by excluding the average level of
import duties and adjusting upwards the actual maintenance expenditures
to reflect an appropriate level of routine and periodic maintenance it
is clear that the road user revenues so adjusted (Annex 2-8, Table 3)
and when taken at their present level and increased by 10% p.a. exceed,
over the next few years, the estimated cost of maintenance, including
personnel, as vell as the average cost of road strengthening by a margin
of about 40% (Annex 2-8, Table 4). In July 1984 the Government intro-
duced a special fuel tax of CFAF 7 oer liter of super and CFAF 5 per
liter of regular gasoline. This represents a strengthened cost recovery
in the sub-sector. The question of road user charges, including the
structure of these charges, is being studied as part of the Transport
Survey (para. 2.06). Domestic fuel prices, both gasoline and diesel
exceed border prices and are not subsidized.
C. Bank Involvement in the Transport Sector
2.40      The Bank's past strategy for the transport sector has focussed
on the expansion of the transport network and capacity in line with the
rapid economic development and traffic growth of domestic and, to a
lesser extent, transit trade of land-locked Chad and CAR. It has been
linked with institutional developments, particularly at the sub-sectoral
level. Project implementation has generally been good in the port
sub-sector, reasonably good in the railway sub-sector and mixed but with
a marked improving trend in the highvay sub-sector. Formal mechanisms
for sector policy formulation and investment planning remain relatively
weak but this has not lead to major distortions or misuses of funds.
Measures are undervay under the Fifth Highway Project to improve the
situation as described in para. 2.06.
2.41      In line with the Bank's overall strategy for Cameroon the
country's favorable growth prospects and increasing transport demand and
the high priority given by the Cameroonian Administration to the trans-
port sector, the Bank vill continue active participation in this sector.
This involvement vould reflect the obvious need for further institu-
tional and operating efficiency improvements as vell as the high



- 15 -
priority of maintenance, upgrading and selective expansion of the
transport network.  According to the sectoral priorities indicated in
the Cameroon Transport Strategy Paper, the Bank's strategy for the
sector should continue to focus on institution building.
III. TRE PROJECT
A. Proj ect Objectives
3.01      The proposed project, building upon the past involvement in
the sector. would be a stepping stone for a broad based sectoral
approach in future lending. As reflected in paras. 1.04 and 2.41 above
the main justifications for Bank participation in the project are the
foeus on road maintenance and upgrading and the strengthening of insti-
tutions as well as the broadening of the financial sources available for
the development of this priority sector.
3.02      The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)   to increase road transport capacity, -ihile reducing
transport costs and protecting past investments in the
paved highway network;
(b)   te consolidate and build upon the institutional devel-
opments, particularly regarding transport planning and
road safety; highway planning; maintenance planning and
execution; and training begun under previous highvay
projects and thus provide a considerable element of
incremental institution building;
(c)   to strengthen the management system of PENGC. increase
its productivity. and inprove its control of resource
utilization; and
(d)   to strengthen Labogénie'Et operational and research
capacity.
B. Project Description
3.03      To achieve these objectives the project consists of two main
elements, the physical development of the highway network and the
inætitutional development of the highway sector administration and
agencies.
1. Righway Network Development
3.04      Pavement Strengthening.  The pavement survey financed under
the Fifth Highvay Project has identified about 540 km of roads which in
viei of their age and the heavy traffic they are carrying need strength-
ening. About 60 km of additional roads are likely to be added during
the detailed studies. Necessary vorks vary between a 5 cm bituminous



- ,6 -
overlay and the reconstruction of entire pavement sections. lu some
instances, realigiment of the road vill  also be necessary.  Technical
and economic criteria for the design of the road sections considered
(Annex 3-1) vere agreed vith the Government during negotiations.
3.05      Road Upgrading.  As part of a graduai expansion of the paved
netvork two road sezctions have been se.lected for upgrading to paved
standards.  These -oads have higl priority in the Goverument's current
investment program, ar-e of importance to two Bank financed agricultural
projects and are ec-z-omically vell justified. The road between Ebolova
and hbalmayo (107 km) vould open the South by providing an aU veather
paved link betveen the capital Yaoundé and Ebolowa the provIncial
capital of the Southern Province and center of commercial activities.
The road betweeu Kumba and Maufe is the main road axis of the South
Western Province, a rich agricultural area. The project vould finance
the Kumbe Bakundo-Mfaitok II section (Lot 3) of this road, Lots 1 and 2
being currently under construction vith French supplier financing.
Detailed engineering studies for Lot 3 are underway. Design standards
ar2 consistent vith the standards used for other paved roads in Cameroon
and are appropriate for the forecast traffic. They are based on a
design speed of 80 km/h and a maximm grade of 6% vhich exceptionally
may be as high as 8.5%. The pavement viii consist of a gravel sub-base,
a crushed stone base and a triple bituminous surface treatment or 7cm
bituminous overlay where varranted by heavy traffic. The pavement viii
be 7.4m vide vith 2.Om shoulders.  The design standards vere agreed
during negotiations.
3.06      Consultant Services.  The road strengthening and the road
upgradlng works vill be supervised by consultants under terms of refer-
ence and conditions agreeable to the Bank. For the preparation of a
future project, consultants vill also be employed on terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Bank to carry out feasibility and detailed
engineering studies for roads which vill be identified as needing
upgrading under the ongoing transport survey. During negotiations the
Goveroment agreed to propose for Bank review and conculrrence the terms
of reference for preinvestment and engineering studies to be carried out
under the project.
2. Institutional Development
3.07     EMIEQ. To alleviate the problema of s;_f shortages and to
facilitate the processing of contracts and the supervision of consul-
tants and contractors the project provides one engineer for four years.
In continuation of the Fourth Highvay Project sud to maintain the
present level of maintenance planning and mr.aitoring for gravel roads
the project also includes f inancing of a highly experienced maintenance
expert, vho vould vork in close cooperation vith the Sub-Director of
Maintenance as vell as two engineers for the supervision and monitoring
of road maintenance vork and a mechanic for the scheduling of equipment
maintenance. As a follow-up to the ongoing pavement survey, the Govern-
ment las established vithin the DP a pavement mrnagemen.. unit, vhich
viii monitor in close cooperation with Labogénie the development of the
paved network by collecting all relevant data necessary to program the



- 17 -
maintenance, resealing or strengthening vorks, according to the demands
of traffic and vear and to make the best use of available funds. The
project provides for 36 man-months of technical assistance to this unit
and soue equipment such as roughness measuring devices and vehicles.
Finally, the project provides for several short term missions of manage-
ment and accounting consultants, to assist the Hinistry in setting up an
adequate and efficient management information system, improved personnel
management and improved budgeting and cost accounting procedures.
3.08      PNMGC. To prevent PHMGC from becoming a serious bottleneck
for the implementation of road maintenance, a massive input of technical
experts in in-line positions is required in the short term (300 man-
months). Parallel to this, off-line advisors vill provide technical
assistance for long-tern institution building, including job design,
staff incentive systems, and management information systems (69 man-
months). In order to permit a better monitoring of consultant perform-
ance over the four years of the project, technical assistance has been
divided into four phases (Annex 2-4), each phase being assigned achieve-
ment indicators.  Proceeding to the next phase vill be conditional upon
satisfactory completion of the preceding phase. Consultants vill be
employed under terms of reference and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank (Annex 2-4).
3.09      Labogénie.  In an effort to develop and issue Cameroonian
standards and specifications for road construction, the project includes
research facilities and equipment and provides for studies and technical
assistance In this connection.
3.10      MINT. To reinforce and complement the institutional develop-
ments taking place under the Fifth Righway Project regarding transport
planning and road safety (paras. 2.06 and 2.12) the project vould
include related buildings, equipment, tecbnical assistance and feUov-
ships. The project vould provide about 24 months of technical assist-
ance in transport planning. It vould also provide about 8 mAn-months of
technical assistance to prepare and implement a first phase of a vehicle
certification and inspection system as part of MNTM' road safety
program. Finally, the project vould include 2 man-months of consultants
services to prepare and implement a program of training seminars for the
road transport industry.
3.11      Training. Within MINEQ four Cameroonian university graduates
would undergo training in staff planning and the planning and execution
of training schemes. The training would be delivered by a consultant
who vould make short term visits and training sessions over a one year
period. The two trainees best qualified out of the four vould later
receive fellowships in suitable foreign organizations. The Government
vill also select a senior staff in PNMGC who would fill the currently
vacant post of Chief of the Training Service. The candidate vould
undergo the same training as M-EQ candidates. Furthermore, consultants
vould design and implement a training plan for the technical and mana-
gerial personnel of PN GC. Training for Labogénie would mainly consist
of providing fellowships for some 10 engineers and technicians. Fellov-
ships would also be awarded and financed under the project for about 15



- 18 -
selected staff in MINEQ, 14 selected staff from PNMGC and 6 staff from
IMIT. The Gevernment agreed during negotiations to communicate by
December 31, 1986 the names, qualifications and curricula vitae of the
candidates for training and fellovships in MINEQ, PNKGC, Labogénie and
MMNT. For the three first institutions the project vould provide
training equipment and the construction of training facilities, in
particular for the Akonolinga Training Center and Labogénie. During
negotiations the Government agreed to submit to the Bank for approval
the draft and final architectural plans, and the costed equipment list.
Once the training officers are in place, the equipment purchased and the
facilities improved or constructed, the training of PM§CC and Labogénie
staff vill be carried out partly vith available Cameroonian staff and
partly vith consultants financed by other agencies (FAC). For the
Akonolinga training center, MINEQ vill continue to be assisted by an
expatriate traier in the training of road maintenance personnel. For
details on training ln the highway subsector, see Anuex 2-7.
3.12      Operational Facilities.  To permit fast and timely interven-
tion for equipment maintenance PNMGC is establishing provincial repre-
sentations and vorkshops. One of these uorkshops included in PNMGC's
investment plan and strategically important is situated in Kumba and
will be financed under the project. Similarly, to improve road safety,
KIMT is planning to establish regional vehicle inspection centers. The
proposed project vould include facilities and equipment for ten centers,
one in each province.
C. Cost Estimate
3.13      The estimated total cost of the project, net of taxes and
duties is US$295 million equivalent. The estimated foreign cost compo-
nent is US$200 million representing about 68Z of total costs. Cost
estimates are in January 1985 prices. The Government has exempted all
construction, consultant and technical assistance contracts from taxes.
Thus the component of local taxation is negligible and has not been
considered in the estimates. Cost estimates are based on preliminary
engineering and recent bid prices for all civil vorks; on a preliminary
equipment list and supplier quotations for the equipment; and on the
going rate for Consultant Services including supervision of construction
and technical assistance. An allowance of 10% has been added for
physical contingencies and the price contingencies are based on an
average rate of inflation of 8.0% in FY1986 and 9% annually from FY1987
onvard. Detailed cost estimates are shown in Annex 3-2.
D. Flnancing Plan
3.14      Financing by the Bank and other co-lenders would cover 100% of
estimated foreign cost or US$200 million, while the Governuent would
finance all of the local cost or US$95 million. Currently, the Bank
envisages a loan of US$125 million including a B-Loan to be arranged at
an appropriate later stage. While some multilateral or bilateral
institutions and many private banks have shown interest in cofinancing



- 19 -
through direct supplier credit or other arrangements, no firm decisions
have been made so far. Since pavement strengthening and road upgrading
vill be subdivided in about 12 lots, of about US$20 million each (see
Annex 3-1) the Bank should take a flexible approach by financing all of
the equipment (this is mainly small and diverse equipment, tools and
teaching aids, and therefore difficult to put together in major packages
suitable to attract other financing agencies). the buildings and con-
sultant services, and decide on the financing of the particular civil
vorks lots only while other cofinancing falls into place during procure-
ment procedures. The Bank loan vould finance all items which did not
attract private financing. If the response of the private and other
cofinanciers vent beyond present expectations, proceeds of the World
Bank loan could be used to finance an extension of the road strength-
ening prograxai, provided investment criteria set forth below (para. 4.03)
vere met.

Technical assistance and consultants' services vould be procured in
accordance with Bank guidelines. All procurement decisions vhose
estimated cost exceed US$300,000 equivalent vould be subject to the
Bank's prior review. The procurement process vill rpmain somewhat open
for the rcad strengthening and upgradiug components. to permit institu-
tions interested in cofinancing to apply their own procurement methods
for certain lots. For example, the first road strengthening package
could be financed by the Bank, to give reference for further tendering.
For remaining lots of the road strengthening and construction compo-
nents, bidders would be requested to submit price quotations on a cash
basis, with the option of separate financing offers.  The bid documents
vould make it clear that the Government vould have the option of taking
financing teras into account in evaluating those packages for which it
decided not to use Bank funds. By contrast, for those packages to which
the Government decided to allocate Bank funds, bids would be evaluated
on the basis of price alone in accordance with the Bank's procurement
guidelines. On receipt and evaluation of bids, the Govermnent would
then decide which packages should be financed by cofinanciers and which
by Bank funds. Even a negotiated contract with supplier f inancing (as
in the Fifth Righvay Project) is thinkable, as long as the negotiated
prices are in line with prices obtained through competitive bidding.
Regarding items to be financed by the Bank, contracts for items costing
less than US$50,000 and not exceeding a cumulative total of
US$2.5 million can be procured through international shopping. vith
price quotations from at least three suppliers from at least twc differ-
ent countries. Items costing more than US$50,000 and less than
MS$500,000, and not exceeding a cumulative total of US$5.0 million can
be procured following local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to
the Bank. During negotiations, the Government agreed to apply the above
procurement methods.
F. Implementation
3.16      Implementation of the project will be the responsibility of
MINEQ through the DR for the road strengthening and upgrading components
and through PNMGC, Labogénie and MINT for the other project elements.
MINEQ vill be assisted by consultants in the project implementation in
particular in the supervision of the road strengthening and upgrading
works to be carried out by contractors. Implementation of the project
is expected to start in the second half of 1985, and the project is
expected to be completed In mid 1990. Annex 3-3 shows the implement-
ation schedule for the project.

the disbursement profile for West Africa Transportation projects (see
graphic in Annex 3-4).
3.18      A condition of disbursement on works, equipment, fellowships
and technical assistance for PNMGC will be that the on-lending agreement
betveen the Govermment and PNMGC bas been signed and approved.

H. Reporting and Auditing
3.19      During negotiations the Government agreed that MINEQ, PNMGC,
Labogénie and MINT would submit: (a) quarterly reports to the Bank on
project implementation and expenditures; (b) a final report on the
implementation experience and project achievements within six months of
the Loan Closing Date.
3.20      The Governnent also agreed to have the accounts in Labogdnie
and the Project accounts in MINEQ and MINT audited annually. PNMGC also
agreed to have its accounts audited annually. All audits would be
conducted according to auditing standards satisfactory and by auditors
acceptable to the Bank. The audited accounts would be submitted to the
Bank vithin 6 months folloving the end of the fiscal year audited.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Ceneral
4.01      Prom an economic point of view the main objectives of the phy-
sical work components of the project are to increase the road transport
capacity, reduce transport costs and protect past investments in the
paved highway network. Separate economic evaluations have been done for
the three main physical components. No attempt has been made to quanti-
fy the economic benefits from the institutional development and related
equipment components which account for about 10% of the project costs.
B. Economic Evaluation  10_
1. Upgrading of the Mbalmayo-Ebolova and the Kumbe Bakundo-Mfaitok II
Road Sections
4.02      The quantified benefits from the upgrading of the two road
sections to paved standard are the reduced vehicle operating costs and a
reduction in distance. Based on estimated end 1984 construction costs,
a 2 1/2 years construction period, estimated end 1984 vehicle operating
costs, estimated traffic growth of 10% tapering off to 7% and a 20 years
economic life, the Mbalmayo-Ebolova road would yield an Economic Rate of
Return (ERR) of 16%. With a combined 10% increase in construction costs
and a 10% reduction in benefits the component would still yield an ERR
of 13%. The Kumbe Bakundo-Mfaitok II road section would yield an ERR of
15Z. With a combined 10% increase in construction costs and a 10% re-
duction in benefits the component would still yield a 12% ERR. Pot4-
tial time savings, savings in road maintenance costs or alternatively
further road deterioration and potential increases in net value of
agricultural production were not considered. The above ERR's are
10/ More detail on the economie evaluation is given in Annex 4.



- 23 -
therefore likely to understate the actual economic return from this
project component.
2. Pavement Strengthening
4.03      The roads to be strengthened each year have been selected on
the basis of the ongoing pavemennt survey. As only a preliminary eco-
nomic evaluation and the preliminary engineering of the first yearl's
program vas available at loan negotiations, the Covernment agreed that
the results of the final economic evaluation and engineering studies
vould be revieved jointly betveen the Government and the Bank and that
no section shoving an ERR of less than 12Z vould be included in the
program to be carried out vith Bank assistance. The preliminary
economic analysis for the first four roads gave EURs of 15-40%.
3. Combined
4.04      Pending the rates of return for the pavement strengthening
component it is not possible to calculate a combined rate of return for
the three civil vorks components. With a cut-off ERR of 12Z it can,
however, prudentlv be assumed that the average ERR for this component
vauld be at least 15% and that the combined ERR of the three civil works
components vould therefore also be at least 15%. The initial benefits
vould accrue to vehicle operators. With a generally competitive road
transport industry the reduced vehicle operating costs should be re-
flected in lover transport charges snd generally passed on to consumers.
C. Risks
4.05      The main risks of the project's physical component concern
project costs and traffic growth. Continued strong competition among
contractors is likely to keep construction costs at reasonable levels.
The generally sound economic policies of the Govermuent, the availabi-
lity of important oil revenues and the emphasis given to agriculture and
infrastructure development are expected to produce continued rapid
traffic grovth in the future. In fact, the popular pressures for rapid
economic development through increased use of oil revenues could result
in faster than expected traffic growth in the short to medium term fol-
lowed by a lover grovth in the medium to long tern.
4.06      On the institutional development side of the project the main
risk c. ceras PNMGC's failure to improve its performance, which vould
have serious repercussions on road maintenance. In order to limit this
risk, the plan of action for PNNGC provides for a substantial input of
technical assistance in operational positions and for the development of
alternative private sources of services for equipment maintenaice and
hiring. Also, to permit the monitoring of progress made by the techni-
cal assistance in developing PNGCC's munagerial and operational capa-
city, a pha8ed approach has been devised and the consultants' and
P«MGC's performance vill be revieved after completion of each phase.



- 24 -
4.07      Despite indications given by public agencies and private banka
of their iuferest in cofinancing this project, external financing might
not be sufficient to cover its foreign exchange cost. If by end
March 1986, the financing plan has not been completed, the Government,
in agreement with the Bank, vould finance the gap out of its ovn
resources, or reduce the progran of road strengthening.
V. AGREEMENTS
5.01      During negotiations, the following vas discussed and agreed
upon with the Government and incorporated as covenants in the Loan

REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
PAST BANK GROUP ACTIVITIES IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.        The Bank and IDA have loaned Cameroon about US$349 million for
the transport sector: US$70.5 million for railway projects, US$49 mil-
lion for port projects, and US$218.5 million for highway construction
and maintenance projects, and US$11.0 million for a feeder road project.
The transport sector represents the largest share (43%) of the Bank's
past commitments in the Cameroon, closely followed by the agriculture
sector (41%).
First Railway Project (Loan 687-CM, US$5.2 million, 1970)
2.        Track renewal and rehabilitation, new freight cars and spares,
reconstruction of the Japoma Bridge, and consulting services for the
Douala-Yaoundé realignment were provided by this loan. Financial cove-
nants were not met due to overestimates of potential productivity and
traffic volumes, and underestimates of staff costs. The rolling stock,
track and consulting services components were executed satisfactorily.
The bridge reconstruction ran into technical difficulties which had to
be resolved under the Second Railway Project (Loan 1038-CM).
First Highway Project (Loan 663/Credit 180-CM, UJS$21.0 million, 1970)
3.        The project included construction of the Ngaoundéré-Garoua and
the Tiko-Victoria Roads, feasibility studies and final engineering of
the Garoua-Mora and Douala-Kekem Roads. Engineering problems with the
drainage design resulted in construction delays which led to cost over-
runs due to inflation. These vere borne by the Government. The Project
Performance Audit Report (No. 1574, April 29, 1977) on the project con-
cluded that, in addition to reducing delays in project implementation,
the Government should better coordinate transport activities. Prelimi-
nary improvements vere made under the Technical Assistance Project and
the Third Highway Projects and it is further being followed up under the
Fifth Highvay Project.
First Douala Port Project (Credit 229-CM, US$1.5 million, 1971)
4.        The projcct provided for an industrial quay at Bonaberi and
improved log handling facilities at Douala. Operating costs increased
more rapidly than projected and target operating ratios vere not met in
addition to a number of other credit covenants. The physical execution
of the project vas satisfactorily completed in 1974 with some delays.
The Project Performance Audit Report (No. 1604, May 24, 1977) for the
project concluded that, despite a two-year delay in the completion of



- 28 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 5
the works (due in part to Government procedures for prequalification of
tenderers and contract awards), the project succeeded in removing
serious bottlenecks in the Cameroonts port capacity. It also concluded
that the project had contributed significantly to the definition of a
long-term port development strategy, including improvements in the
institutions concerned and in the financial situation (even though the
covenanted financial objectives vere not fully achieved).
Second Righway projert (Loan 935/Credit 429-CM, US$63 million, 1974)
5.        The project covered the construction of three roads to paved
standards: (a) Pont du Noun (Bafoussam)-Foumban Road (50 km);
(b) Garoua-Mora Road (258 km); and (c) Douala-Kekem Road; as vell as a
road maintenance study and technical assistance. The road maintenance
study and reconnaissance study of forest evacuation roads were completed
in May and December 1978, respectively.  The roads vere coipleted satis-
factorily by July 1978 with the exception of the Garoua-Figuil section
(95 km) of the Garoua-Mora Road which ve agreed with the Government to
postpone. The cost of the project doubled due to inflation in 1973/174.
A supplementary credit of US$15.0 million was approved in March 1976 to
help alleviate the burden imposed on the Government by the project's
cost overrun.
Second Railway Project (Loan 1038-CM, US$16.0 million, 1974)
6.        Additional rolling stock and equipment, partial financing of
the reconstruction of the Japoma Bridge, track renewal and consulting
services vere included under this project.  Diffi-ulties at the bridge
site have been resolved but due to recession of tue timber market,
financial targets vere not met. Exchange depreciation has necessitated
supplementary financing for part of the equipment and the consulting
services under the Third Railway Project.
Third Railway Project (Credit S-4 CM, US$2.3 million, 1976)
7.        The project included a feasibJlity study and detailed engi-
neering for the Pouala Station and marshalling yard, as well as finan-
cing for part of the equipment and the consulting services from the
Second Railway Project. The feasibility study, detailed engineering for
the new station, and design study for the running shed and maintenance
facilities vere completed satisfactorily. Additional technical assist-
ance is needed to fully implement the consultants' recommendations.
This engineering credit has been refinanced under the Fourth Railway
Project. The Project Performance Audit Report on the Second and Third
Railway Projects (No. 3056, June 30, 1980) concluded that the projects'
purpose vas largely achieved but that the reestimated economic rate of
return is 10% against 13% estimated at appraisal due to shorter useful
life of track, renewal vorks and lower than expected productivity of
rolling stock. Compliance vas met on most of the loan covenants, but
the financial targets were not fully met because of rapidly rising costs
and lower than expected traffie.

Second Douala Port Project (Loan 1321/Credit 657-CM, US$25.0 million,
1976)
8.        The principal components of the project vere: a new fishing
port and ship repair facility upstream from the existing port, a new log
port and one ro/ro and two container berths downstream with scope for
future expansion, and channel dredging. Construction vas started in
December 1976 and completed in 1982. The higher total cost for the proj-
ect vas covered by financing from ONPC and the Government. The loan and
the credit have been fully disbursed. The Project Completion Report on
the project (No. 4942 of February 14, 1984) concluded that the project
had been successful. It noted that the large number of co-financiers
caused difficulties during the decision making process and that differ-
ent disbursement procedures placed an administrative burden on ONPC. It
also noted that changing consultants between project preparation and
project execution, as vell as the insufficient technical expertise of
the field supervisory staff caused some difficulties and delays.
First Technical Cooperation Project (Credit 673-CM, US$4.5 million,
1977)
9.        The project consists of advisory consultants' services to the
Ministries of Economic Affairs and Planning, Agriculture, Transport,
Equipment, Energy and Mining for investment planning, policy analysis
and project processing. In the transport sector the project provided
one economistlp'anner in the MINT and a second economist/planner in
MINPAT who have finished their assignments.
First Feeder Road Project (Loan 1494-CM/Credit 749-CM, US$11.1 million,
1977)
10.       The project includes establishing a Central Feeder Roads Unit
vithin the Roads Directorate and a four-year program of construction,
improvement, rehabilitation and maintenance of about 2,000 km of feeder
roads, including equipment purchase and operation, office and workshop
construction and staff training in equipment operation and labor-
intensive methods. The project's implementation is behind schedule
because the executing agency in charge of the feeder roads vas badly
administered, it personne] poorly qualified and the outcome of t'e tech-
nical assistance less than expected. At the Bank's insistence the exe-
cuting agency vas reorganized in mid-1982 after which a reduced road
construction and rehabilitation program (reduced by about 50Z) is being
executed.
Third Highvay Project (Loan 1515-CM> US$16.5 million, 1978)
11.       The main component of the project, the construction of the
Garoua-Figuil Road to paved standard, vas completed in 1979. Technical
assistance to the MOT helped carry out an origin-destination survey with
the first phase having been conpleted in September/October 1980 and the
final phase in mid-1981 and also provided a transport adviso:   A
US$5.6 million cost overrun, mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations,

vas covered by the Government. The Project Coupletion Report for the
Second and Third Righvay Projects (July 17. 1980) concluded that the
impact of the substantial increase in project cost on the economic bene-
fits vas considerably expiated by a larger than expected increase in
traffie using the roads. The reestimated rates of return for the tvo
projects vere about the same as expected during appraisal (20%). The
Project Completion Report also noted that progress in developing
transport-related institutions has been slow compared vith considerable
progress made in upgrading the land transport system over the last
decade.
Fourth Hig`way Project (Loan 1723/Credit 926-CM. US$48.0 million, 1979)
12.       The project includes a training program for staff and vorkers
for road maintenance, maintenance of about 17,000 km of roads and rehab-
ilitation of 1,700 km through force account and domestic contractors,
civil vorks equipment, technical assistance to the domestic construction
industry, two permanent weighing stations, and pre-investment studies
for the Fifth Righway Project and forestry evacuation roads. Implement-
ation of the project is satisfactory.
Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1734/Credit 936-CM, US$47.0 million, 1979)
13.       The project includes construction of the marshalling yard,
track and rolling stock, civil works, training equipment, consulting
services and refinancing of Credit S-4 CM. The project became effective
January 1980. Civil works at Douala Station have been completed al-
thcugh delayed by about 18-24 months due to unfavorable veather and
unexpectedly poor soil conditions. Workshop modernization has also been
delayed by a similar period due to the late avarding of contracts and a
design revision which vas necessary to increase capacity to meet current
maintenance requirements. Implementation of the consultants' proposed
improvements of administrative and managerial functions are progressing
satisfactorily. Following the completion of the construction of a new
training center, technical assistance for training trainers will com-
mence soon. Railway finances are still unsatisfactory, due to the late
and insufficient tariff increases. Railway management has improved over
the past two years and a contract plan is being negotiated vith the
Government. The uncontrolled recruitment of labor has been stopped.
Traffic has grown rapidly in the last three years close to forecast
levels. Locomotive availability is also close to target.
Fifth Highway Project (Loan 2180-CM, US$70.0 million, 1982)
14.       The project consists of: (a) the construction of the Edéa-
Yaoundé Road (181 km) and the construction of nev buildings for
Labogénie; (b) consultants' services to supervise the road construction
works, to prepare a national transport survey and to evaluate the paved
road network; and (c) technical assistance to ihe Ministry of Equipment,
the Ministry of Transportation and to Labogénie. After an initial delay
in awarding a contract for the Bank-financed section, the road cona-
truction vorks for the Ed-a-Yaoundé Road are well underway. All of the
contracts for consultants' services have been awarded. Cofinancing for

the road construction works is provided by the Kuwait Fund, Islamic Bank
and Abu Dhabi Fund; the Governments of Canada and the Netherlands and
private banks in the Netherlands to a total of US$91.5 million.
Third Douala Port Project (Loan 2259-CM. US$22.5 million, 1983)
15.       The project consists of: (a) the construction of three berths
with a varehouse; (b) provision of cargo handling equipment, tugboat and
various navigational aids; (c) data processing services and equipment;
and (d) studies and technical assistance to ONPC. The loan vas declared
effective on December 22, 1983. Contracts for civil works and their
supervision have been avarded and work is in progress. Construction of
the tugboat is starting. Consultants have been selected for the studies
and technical assistance. Specifications for other equipment are under
preparation.

plan viil be organized in two phases. The technical assistance program to
PUNGC vill cover (a) operations and on-the-job training, (b) management.
staff motivation and performance evaluation; and (c) preparation of a
training plan.
Phase 1: Immediate Measures
PNMGC vill employ, not later than December 31, 1985, a consultant
to carry out an in-depth diagnosis of its technical operations
and to establish the program and objectives to be implemented
under phase 2.
Phase 2: Medium-term Measures

consultant in personnel management and motivation, and
(il) a consultant in order to revise its general accounting
system .
(b)   PNMGC vill employ. not later than December 31, 1986, a con-
sultant in order to set up a management information and
cost-accounting system.
(c)   PUMGC will discuss and agree vith the Bank regarding the
implementation of reconmendations made by the consultants
hired under (b) ln Phase 1 not later than May 31, 1986 and
take all the necessary measures for implementing the
recommendations made by the consultants under (a) and (b)
above, and appoint qualified counterparts.
(d)   PNMGC vill follov a finanaial policy enabling it to finance

TECHNICAL ASSIS'CANCE
1.       Technical Assitance to PIMGC will cover:
(i) Technical assistance for operations and on-the-job training
(ii) Management, staff motivation and performance evaluation
(iii) Preparation of training plan
Each part will be covered under separate terms of reference, in
consideration that no single firm can cover adequately all three areas.
(i) Technical Assistance for Operations
Technical assistance for operations will be divided into three phases:
-   Firstly, a small technical team wlll take charge of mainte-
nance management, in order to avoid an imminent collapse of
equipment maintenance. This is an emergency operation not
aimed toward institution building. At the end of this phase,
the consultant will prepare, in the light of the experience
accumulated and his assessment of PNMGC's capacity, annual
realistic objectives for maintenance operations and rate of
availability. These objectives will be achieved during the
phase 2 with an expanded technical assistance team.
-   In a second phase, the consultant will proceed with an in-
depth technical and administrative reorganization of opera-
tions. With the help of a Cameroonian counterpart, identified
during the first phase, he vill set up all the necessary sys-
tems for controlling staff productivity, efficient maintenance
operations, maintenance scheduling and following cost of
equipment. At the beginning, this phase will address
essentially organization of operations, while on-the-job
training--the third phase-yill be emphasized after the
training Plan--prepared simultaneously--will have been
defined.

(ii) Management, Staff Motivation and Performance Evaluation
This component has been designed under the following considerations:
-  Among PNMGC's upper and intermediate level staff, only the
Director is motivated in improving management. The rest of
the staff is still in the mental framework of the public ser-
vice, and consider PNMGC as a short incident in their career
as civil servants. A managerîal reorganization has little
chances of success, except if the upper and intermediate level
staff is sensitized to modern managerial techniques, and a
suitable motivation system is devised.
-  The present organization chart of PNMGC is not suitable for a
satisfactory management, and needs to be redesigned. In addi-
tion, there is no job description to define the responsibil-
ities and tasks for the key positions, no communication system
and no manual of administrative procedures. These gaps should
be filled for the managerial positions under the technical
assistance for management. For technical positions, it can be
done under technical assistance for operations.
-  At the lover level, the staff evaluation and motivation system
should be revised, to take into consideration individual per-
fornance; and
-   In order to implement a suitable performance evaluation and
rewarding system among other things, PNMGC's MIS has to be
improved.
The technical assistance for management, staff motivation and perform-
ance evaluation would therefore comprise the folloving sub-components:

(iii) Preparation of Training Plan
The preparation of a training plan is needed:
-  for higher levelastaff, in order to strengthen their manager-
ial and technical capacity, under the new organization scheme,
tand in parallel with technical assistance for operations ((i)
above) and management ((ii) aboye). Training for this
category of staff vill be conducted essentially outside, and
tailored after the reorganization scheme proposed under (ii).
-   for lover level staff, for refresher courses, and individual
career development. The plan for this category of staff vill
be essentially in-house, in connection vith technical assist-
ance for operations.
In addition, technical assistance will be needed for organizing the
training systea and training unit.
Preparation and implementation of the training plan vill be support-
ed by sending 14 selected people on training abroad through project-
financed fellowship.  These people vill come essentially from the tech-
nical departments.
The terms of reference for this coponent vill be prepared folloving
the first phase of technical assistance for operations.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR OPERATIONAL ASSISTANCE
1. INTRODUCTION
Au Cameroun le matériel de transport et de terrassement uti-
lisé par les services provinciaux des routes est la propriété du Parc
National de Matériel de Génie Civil (en abrégé PNMGC) dont la Direction
est située à Yaoundé.
Le PNMGC est un établissement public à caractère industriel et
commercial placé sous la tutelle du Ministère de l'Equipement et qui
loue son matériel aux utilisateurs publics (essentiellement les services
provinciaux des routes) ou privés qui le souhaitent.
Le PNMGC dispose de son autonomie de gestion sur le plan admi-
nistratif, commercial et financier, et est organisé suivant un système
comparable à celui des entreprises de location de matériel et d'outil-
lage.
Pour entretenir sa flotte de matériel, le PNMGC dispose:
-   d'un atelier central à Douala; -
-   de six ateliers situés à Garoua. Yaoundé, Douala,
Bafoussam, Bamenda et Bertoua. Il est prévu d'élever
prochainement les ateliers de Yaoundé et Garoua au ni-
veau de celui de Douala;
-   de deux ateliers de moyenne importance situés à
Ngaoundéré et Ebolowa;
-   d'un atelier de moyenne importance en cours de démarrage
à Maroua.
L'approvisionnement en pièces de rechange est assuré par le
Service des approvisionnements actuellement basé à Douala, via le Maga-
sin Central de Douala et les magasins auxiliaires situés aux différents
points de consommation.
Jusqu'en 1982, la flotte de matériel du PNMGC comptait environ
350 engins, mais dans le cadre du IVème Projet Routier Camerounais fi-
nancé par la BIRD, cette flotte s'est accrue d'environ 650 unités sans
accroissement correspondant de la capacité des services de la mainte-
nance du matériel.
Pour faire face à l'augmentation considérable de la charge de
travail qui se présentera dans les prochaines années, le PNMGC a décidé
de recourir aux services d'une équipe de consultants dont le role sera



- 43 -
ANNEX 2-4
Attachment 2
Page 2 of 11
d'améliorer l'efficacité des activités de maintenance du matériel en
termes de disponibilité des engins et de coÛt de fonctionnement.
Idéalement, les consultants feront partie de firme ayant une
activité effective et permanente dans le domaine de l'entretien du maté-
riel de transport et/ou de terrassement. Une association d'un bureau
d'étude avec de telles firmes pourrait également être prise en considé-
ration.
2. PROGRAMME D'INTERVENTION DU CONSULTANT
Les services d'assistance technique visent à l'intervention du
consultant pour améliorer le fonctionnement du PNMGC, en 2 phases dis-
tinctes, qui devront s'enchaîner sans qu'il y ait de discontinuité no-
table entre celles-ci.
L'intervention du consultant s'étendra sur une période d'en-
viron 3 ans et sera menée en collaboration étroite avec une équipe d'ho-
mologues camerounais à désigner par la Direction du PNMGC. Les princi-
pales taches de cette équipe mixte sont explicitées ci-dessous:
DURANT LA PREMIERE PHASE dont la durée est d'environ 4 mois:
-   prise de connaissance du fonctionnement du PNMGC et
identification détaillée des principaux problèmes;
-   définition des mesures proposées pour remédier aux ca-
rences constatées;
-   discussion et établissement avec la Direction du PNMGC
et la Banque Mondiale d'un calendrier-programme détaillé
de mesures à mettre en place dans le cadre du 6ème Pro-
jet Routier, avec détermination des objectifs à
atteindre.
LA DEUXIEME PHASE DU PROJET, consistera à implanter les me-
sures et à prendre les actions nécessaires à La réalisation des objec-
tifs définis de commun accord à la fin de la première phase. La durée

3. PORTEE ET SERVICES
3.1. OBJET DE LA PHASE 1:
L'objet de la phase 1 est d'établir un diagnostic approfondi
sur le fonctionnement technique du Parc et de la préparation d'un plan
de réformes à mettre en oeuvre ultérieurement.
3.1.1. IDENTIFICATION DETAILLEE DES PROBLEMES DU PNMGC
Le Consultant sera chargé de:
-   l'identification détaillée du fonctionnement du système
de location-maintenance du PNMGC (relation avec les uti-
lisateurs, responsabilités, périodicité et contenu des
différents échelons de maintenance, organisation des
ateliers, etc...)
-   l'inventaire quantitatif et qualitatif du matériel.
Pour le matériel nécessitant des interventions du niveau
4 et supérieur, établissement d'un devis et d'un délai
estimatif de réparation (précision + 20% sur devis);
-   l'évaluation de la charge de travail pour chaque centre
de maintenance (délégations, sous-délégations, bases,
atelier central, etc...);
-   l'inventaire et évaluation qualitative des moyens tech-
niques (locaux, équipements fixes et outillages) exis-
tart dans les différents centres de maintenance;

ANNEX 2-4
Attachment 2
Page 4 of Il
-   l'évaluation des documents et données exploitables en
vue de l'établissement d'un système centralisé de ges-
tion du matériel.
3.1.2. DEFINITION DES MESURES A PRENDRE
Les identifications et les évaluations ci-dessus mentionnées
aboutiront à des recommandations basees essentiellement sur les points
suivants:
-   définition d'un programme de réparation ou de réforme
des équipements. Ce programme tiendra compte: de l'âge
du matériel, du coÛt et des délais de répara-
tion/réhabilitation, du coût probable d'exploitation
après réhabilitation, des stocks de pièces de rechange
disponibles en magasin et/ou des possibilités d'approvi-
sionnement de telles pièces;
-   définition des modifications éventuelles à apporter au
système de maintenance des équipements. Ceci portera
essentiellement sur:
- l'organisation du fonctionnement des différents cen-
tres de maintenance et les méthodes de travail;
- la périodicité et le type des différentes opérations
d'entretien à effectuer;
- le niveau de responsabilité et les limites d'autorité
des différents centres de maintenance;
- la spécialisation éventuelle de certains de ces cen-
tres notamment ceux de Douala et Yaoundé;
- la définition des opérations et des types d'équipe-
ments à sous-traiter éventuellement dans le secteur
privé.
Dans l'établissement de ces recommandations, on tiendra compte
notamment:
-   de la localisation et de l'éloignement relatif des cen-
tres de maintenance;
-   des difficultés de transport et communications;
-   de la quantité et du type de matériel à entretenir;
-   de la quantité et de la qualification de la main-
d'oeuvre disponible à court et moyen terme;
-   des caractéristiques des installations fixes et des ou-
tillages;



- 46 -                     ANNEX 2-4
Attachment 2
Page 5 of Il
des possibilités du secteur privé dans le domaine des
révisions et des grosses réparations.
Compze tenu de ce qui précède, on définira:
-   les objectifs à atteindre en terme de disponibilité
technique du matériel;
-   la charge de travail des différents centres de mainte-
nance sur la base des taux d'utilisation réelle du maté-
riel;
-   les effectifs et la qualification du personnel corres-
pondant à la réalisation de ces objectifs (adéquation
charge de travail effectif en personnel).
Ceci permettra de définir:
-   un éventuel programme d'embauche
-   un programme de formation de la main-d'oeuvre existante
et/ou de celle à embaucher.
-   les améliorations/modifications qui devront être appor-
tées aux installations existantes, à leurs équipements
et leur outillage.
-   le coÛt et le délai de réalisation estimés de ces tra-
vaux et améliorations;
-   l'ordre de priorité pour la réalisation de ces travaux;
-   les travaux pouvant être réalisés par les moyens du
Parc, (existants ou à créer) ou devant être effectués
par les entreprises;
-   les améliorations à apporter au système "approvision-
nement-gestion des stocks;"
Cette définition tiendra compte des travaux et analyses déjà
faits précédemment dans ce domaine.  Recommandations concernant la mise
en place éventuelle, d'une gestion informatisée.
-   les informations devant être collectées au niveau des
différents établissements et transmises à la Direction;
-   les statistiques et les indicateurs de performances
techniques et commerciales à tirer des informations
transmises;
-   les méthodes et le personnel nécessaire à l'exploitation
des données transmises aussi bien du point de vue tech-
nique que commercial;



- 47 -
ANNEX 2-4
Attachment 2
Page 6 of Il
-   la nécessité éventuelle d'un support informatique et le
cas échéant, définition des principes d'utilisation et
d'application en collaboration avec les autres services
concernés;
-   les recommandations concernant la réaffectation de cer-
tains équipements en fonction de la demande du marché et
de l'analyse des données statistiques et commerciales
disponibles.
3.1.3. PROGRAMME DES MESURES A METTRE EN APPLICATION
A ce stade, les recommandations établies par les experts et
leurs homologues seront examinées par la Direction du Parc, en liaison
avec la Banque Mondiale.
Ces discussions déboucheront sur:
-   la sélection des actions à mener et des objectifs à
atteindre parmi ceux qui auront été proposés;
-   l'établissement d'un calendrier détaillé et réaliste des
actions à mener;
-   l'évaluation définitive des besoins en assistance tech-
nique en précisant les profils des postes à pourvoir, la
durée de l'intervention, et les attributions de cette
assistance technique.
3.2. OBJET DE LA PHASE II
Les activités de la phase Il consisteront essentiellement à
mettre en place et à exécuter les mesures définies conjointement à la
fin de la phase I.
Il est estimé en première approximation que la mise en appli-
cation de ces mesures nécessitera le concours d'un programme d'assis-
tance technique d'environ 300 homme-mois à répartir sur une période
d'environ 30 mois.
4.  RAPPORT
Durant la Phase I, le Consultant présentera mensuellement un
rapport succint d'activités. Ce rapport fera le point sur l'état
d'avancement de l'étude ainsi que sur les difficultés éventuelles ren-
contrées par le consultant dans le déroulement de sa mission.
Un rapport p-<visoire sera soumis à la Direction du PNMGC au
plus tard 14 semaines après le début de la Phase I. Copie de ce rapport
sera envoyée a la BIRD.  Le rapport final sera présenté deux semaines
après les discussions concernant les actions à mener au cours de la
Phase Il. Ce rapport final servira de programme de travail pour la
Phase II.

SIXTH RIGRWAY PROJECT
TRAINING
(Righway Subsector)
A. Training Institutions
1.        The main training institutions providing skilled personnel for
the highvay sector are:
Training Institution                 Sklll
Lycées Techniques                    Entry Level Technician
(Technical Secondary Schools)
PNMGC Training Center, Douala        Retraining for mechanics
P!NGC Training Center, Yaoundé       Drivers and Equipment operators
NI-EQ Training Center, Akonolinga    Nechanics (preventive maintenance)
2quipment operator
Road foremen
Labogénie                            Scil mechanics, Material testing
Technicians
ENSTP (MINEQ's National Public       Sub-engineers, draftsmen,
Works School)                        surveyors, civil and public vork
engineers (first degree level)
Ecole Polytechnique (National        Civil, mechanical and electrical
Polytechnic attached to              engineers and architects (first and
the Yaoundé University)              second degree levels)
2.        The Douala PNMGC :enter has the potential for providing excel-
lent training for mechanics for the highway sector. It could handle up
to 30 trainees per month, or 360 trainee-munths per year, with its pre-
sent staff of four instructors, yet the 1983 training load was ouly 170
trainee-month. Major causes for this underutilization are: (a) hap-
hazard procedures for selection of trainees; (b) no dormitory or eating
facilities at the Center; (c) insufficient salaries and living allow-
ances often not paid on tlme; (d) staff at the Center are not permitted
to participate in administrative decisions affecting the Center and its
operations; (e) existing audlo-visual equipment is old and in need of



- 81 -
ANNEX 2-7
Page 2 of 5
replacement; and (f) courses in general mechanics and machine tool
operation cannot be taught due to lack of equipment. In general. the
Center is professionally run by two qualified Cameroonian and two French
instructors. With the construction of a dormitory and mess hall, the
addition of required shop equipment, and the addition of two more
instructors, this Center could accommodate up to 540 trainee-month of
instruction per year. The number of personnel trained vould be easily
absorbed by PNMGC, other Government agencies and the private sector.
3.        The PNMGC Drivers and Equipment Operators Center in Yaoundé,
by contrast, has virtually ceased to operate because of lack of equip-
ment and a lack of committment in PNMGC management to support the center
financially and to pirovide an adequate number of trainees. Its staff
nov mostly travels around Cameroon retesting drivers who had previously
passed through the school, and renewing their licences.
4.        The Production and Training center at Akonolinga was esta-
blished under the Fourth Highway Project and has trained between 1981
and December 1984 some 600 road maintenance vorkerz:
Road Foremen               80
Equipment Operators       205
Drivers                   170
Service Mechanics         120
Repair Mechanics           12
587
A.N a training and production unit the Akonolinga center is cost effect-
ive.  During the 1981-1984 period, about 100 km of earth inad were cons-
tructed at the same cost as a private contractor vould have charged just
te rebuild the road vithout providing any training. Thus the training
of the 600 road maintenance workers has been virtually cost-free.
5.        Labogénie has probably the most successful staff planning and
trair-.ing record cf all the highway sector institutions, thanks largely
to many years of good management, and the training component financed as
part of the technical assistance package under the Fifth Highway
Project.
6.        The Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Travaux Publiques (ENSTP)
trains senior technicians and sub-engineers in civil engineering,
urbanism, cartography, and agricultural eng<.neering. A degree level
(Grade Ai) can only be obtdined in civil engineering. The first set of
civil engineers (about 30 in number) will graduate in 1985, and MINEQ
hopes to get about 20 of these who have signed 10 year service
agreements with it. The ENSTP Director estirates that about one-third
of graduates of all categories and levels will take up positions in
MINEQ.
7.        The highest level of engineers in Cameroon (Grade A2) is only
trained at The Ecole Nationale Polytechnique of the University of
Yaoundé, ancl MINEQ has se far beer unable to retain any of these



- 82 -
ANNEX 2-7

graduates in its service, because of poor civil service conditions.
Students are accepted on the basis of their entrance examination per-
formance, either for the short course (3 years for the Ai engineering
degree), or the long course (5 years for A2).
B. Assessment of Current Training Efforts
8.        A review of current training efforts in the highway sub-sector
lead to the following general conclusions:
- The sub-sector (like the rest of the civil service) is
so short of qualified engineers and technicians that
training efforts have been concentrated almost exclu-
sively on increasing the numbur of entry level engineers
and technicians for the sector.
- There has been very little on-the-job training or staff
upgrading, especially of professional staff.
- The Government's efforts to produce entry level
engineers are successful. Bank assistance should
therefore concentrate on the two areas currently
neglected, namely staff planning and on-the-job
training.
C. Objectives of Training Component
9.        Ehe training component of the proposed project aims at:
(a)   getting Cameroonian offictals in the sub-sector trained
and interested in the planning and execution of staff
training.
(b)   connecting on-the-job training with the implementation
of a suitable personnel incentive scheme (set Annex 2-1,
Attachment 4) in order to ensure:
(i) that staff is motivated by training;
(ii) that it will make the best use of acquired qua-
lifications; and
(iii) that it will remain in the highway sector for a
sufficient time period to make per-onnel plan-
ning significant.
(c)   continuing staff upgrading efforts which have proved
successful (e.g. in Akonolinga and Labogénie), but to
also extend such efforts to professional staff in MINEQ
and PNMGC; and



- 83 -
ANNEX 2-7
Page 4 of 5
(d)   improving basic training of mechanics and engine drivers
at PNNGC's tr lning centers in Douala and Yaoundé;
D. Detailed Description or Training Component
10.       In MINEQ's Roads Directorate (Planning Division) two young
Cameroonians have been identified as suitable for training to undertake
economic plaoining of highways with the assistance of engineers working
in other divisions of the Highvays Department. The objective of the
training vould be to teach these two staff members the methodologies of
highvay planning, as vell as the identification, preparation, appraisal,
and supervision of highway projects. The two would therefore be sub-
jected to training in the project cycle, either at the EDI, or in an
organization providing EDI-type project cycle courses. Folloving that,
they will be sent to work (one at a time) for a period of one year as
project staff in a reputable firm of highway engineers, where they will
be put through hands-on experience in project planning, under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank. Before the start of the training, the
two vould sign an undertaking to work in the Highways Department for
five years following the completion of their training.
_i.       For MINEQ' Trainin- Division four Cameroonian university gra-
duates have to be identified to undergo training in staff planning and
the planning and execution of training schemes. -There is currently
practically no staff planning in the highway sub-sector, and the reasons
for training as many as four staff members are to (a) take full advan-
tage of the visits of the training consultar.t - it vould cost him no
more to train four than to train one or two; and (b) make some of the
trained staff available later for staff planning and training duties in
other sub-sector institutions. Initially the consultant would make four
visits of one month each spread over a year period, to Cameroon. During
each visi., he -7ill spend about one week teaching the four Cameroonian
staff together in a group, techniques of staff planning, and the plan-
ning and execution of training programs, then one week with each of the
staff members review'ing their work and assisting them to perfect the
techniqutb. To make this learning process realistic, each Cameroonian
vould be allocated responsibility for planning and training in a speci-
fic department or seLvice of MINEQ, with all being taught how to coordi-
nate the whole exercise for MINEQ. After the one year of the consult-
ant's visits, the >wo trainees best qualified would be dispatched (not
more than one at a time) to suitable foreign organizations identified
and arranged by the consultants for practical training in the techniques
learned. At the end of their training, the most successful vould be
given responsibility for overall staff planning and training for MINEQ.
12.       For the Akonolinga road maintenance production ari training
center, the project vould complete the provision of essential bui'ding
and equipment begun under the Fourth Highvay Project. The projecL would
(a) replace the existing wooden dormitory with a more permanent struc-
ture; (b) provide a cafeteria or dining room; and (c) provide for slight
expansion of the renter, as vell as possible overlap of the timing oF
some courses.

ANNEX 2-7
Page 5 of 5
13.       At PNMGC head off tce, the objective is to introduce staff
planning and on-the-job training which currently do not exist. First,
PNMGC should, as soon ae possible, appoint a university graduate who
would be trained to fill the currently vacant post of Chief of the
Training Service. He would receive on-the-job training by four visits
of one month each by a training expert over a period of one year, to be
followed by secondment to a suitable overstas institution for six months
of practical experience in the techniques of staff planning and train-
ing. Before the training starts, the officer should sign an undertaking
to serve PNMGC for at least five years after the training. Secondly,
consultants vould design an on-the-job training plan to be iniplemented
under phase 4 of technical assistance (see Annex 2.4).
14.       The major bottleneck for the functioning of PNMGC's two train-
ing centers--inadequate management attention--would be removed through
the introductior. of staff planning. Futhermore, the project would pro-
vide badly needed equipmaent and facilities for the two centers- Douala
would receive boarding facilities, audio visual teaching aids and de-
monstration equipment. For the Yaoundé center classroom facilities vill
be improved and basic equipment to teach drivers and equipment operators
vill be supplied.
15.       At Labogénie the project would assist in financing the cons-
truction of a new training and research center with a holding capacity
of about 50 students and the procurement of teaching and research equip-
ment.

SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
ROAD USER CHARGES AND COST RCOVERY
Road Expenditures
1.        Following a decline in current terms of road maintenance and
construction expenditures during the late 1970's, expenditures for both
started to increase rapidly in FY 1981 and FY 1982 (Table 1 of this
Annex). Road maintenance expenditures, including personnel and over-
head, increased from CFAF 6.2 billion in FY 1980 to CFAF 17.6 billion in
FY 1984 while construction expenditures increased from CFAF 14.3 billion
to CFAF 76.7 billion. As a result of the improved financial situation
in Cameroon, particularly new oil revenues, the increased expenditures
were financed mainly from national sources. Thus the share of construc-
tion expenditures financed over the investment budget and, more recent-
ly, over special accounts (transfer of cil revenues), rose from 45Z in
FY 1977 to 62Z in FY 1982 and 77% in Fr 1984.
2.        Even with the significant increase in recent years, main-
tenance expenditures have not yet reached an adequate level, particu-
larly for periodic maintenance of the paved network; as indicated in
para. 2.37, the Goverument should at loan negotiations agree to consult-
ation with the Bank regarding the level of future maintenance budgets.
In FY 1984 actual maintenance expenditures, including personnel and
overhead. amounted to about CFAF 18 billion as compared vith an esti-
mated appropriate level of about CFAF 21 billion. Table 2 of this annex
indicates the estimated level of future maintenance requirements (in
1984 prices), rising to about CFAF 33 billion by FY 1994. To this may
be added an average expenditure of about CFAF 10 billion, (in 1984
prices) per annum for pavement strengthening.
3.        No estimates are presently available regarding future cons-
truction expenditures beyond the current 1981-86 Plan Period; prepara-
tion of the next plan should be starting early 1985. As far as the
transport sector (including the highway sector) is concerned, the plan
preparation should be able to dra' on the assessment of future needs
being carried out under the recently started Transport Survey
(para. 2.06).

.
Road Users Revenues
4.        Revenues from road user charges consist mostly of import
duties and taxes on nev vehicles. fuel Il and lubricants, spare parts
and tires, as well as annual vehicle registration taxes. These revenues
have been estimated at CFAF 44 billion in- FY 1982, the last year for
which sufficiently detailed information is available, and projected at
CFAF 52 billion for FY 1983 (Table 3 of this Annex). As it can be
argued that import duties on vehicles and spare parts should only be
considered as true user charges to the extent that the duty rate exceed
the average duty rate on all imports (the "basic" component being
considered as general revenues) an adjusted road user revenues estimate
was also made. This amounted to about CFAF 33 billion in FY 1982.
Cost Recovery
5.        The adjusted road user revenues (C-AF 33 billion) in FY1982
exceeded the estimated adequate level of routine and periodic mainte-
nance costs, including personnel and overhead (about CFAF 19 billion)
und the cost of pavement strengthening (CFAF 8 billion). The same
appears to hold true FY 1983 and is likely to hold true for FY1984-
FY1988 (Table 4 of this Annex).
6.        Effective July 1984 the Goverament introduced a special fuel
tax of CFAF 7 per liter of super and CFAF 5 per liter of regular gaso-
line. This should increase road user revenues by some CFAF 2 billion in
1/  A conceptual problem concerns the taxation of fuel following the
change in 1981 from imports to domestic production since reliable
information is not available regarding the Goverument revenues
received from domestically consumed fuel. For lack of alternative
data, the estimated import duty on fuel has been used as a road
user revenue, also for the subsequent years. In FY 1982 this
amounted to CFAF 15 billion or 1/3 of the user revenues. This
estimate probably understates the Government revenues actually
received from domestic fuel sales.  An indication of the order of
magnitude of these revenues can be derived as follows. According
to one order of magnitude estimate the Governent's revenues from
oil vere about CFAF 195 billion in FY 1983. Assuming that the
Government receives approximately the same revenues per ton from
domestically sold fuel and from exported fuel (1.3 and 4.4 million
tons respectively in FY1983) one can estimate Governnent revenues
of some CFAF 45 billion from domestically consumed fuel. An
alternative approach would be to calculate the differences between
retail prices and estimated border prices plus wholesale and retail
margins plus local storage and transport costs and to consider this
as a road user charge. In FY1982 this latter is estiimated at
CFAF17 billion as compared vith an estimated fuel tax revenue of
CFAF15 billion. Both of these methods show that the proxy method
used by DP is conservative.

FY 1985. This iS a step in assuring reasonable cost recovery ln the
future.
7.        In the meantime the question of road user charges and cost
recoverr is being studied under the Transport Survey. This vill analyze
not oal.y the overall level of cost recovery but vill also look at its
structures. As indicated iu para. 2.06 the Government should at loan
negotiations agree to consultations regarding ^he findings and recom-
mendations of the Transport Survey and the measures they plan to take
regarding these recommendations. This would include measures concerning
cost recovery in the highway sector.
Fuel Prices
8.        Retail prices of super and regular gasoline in Douala and
Yaoundé vere in July 1984 respectively CFAF 174 and CFAF 163 per liter;
the retail price for diesel vas CFAF 139 per liter. Prices vere above
border prices and did not involve subsidies.

ANNEX 4
Page 1 of 3
REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
SIXTU RICRWAy PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
General
1.        From an economic point of view the main objectives of the phy-
sical vork components of the project are to increase the road transport
capacity, reduce transport costs and protect past investments in the
paved highvay network. This annex discusses the economic justification
for the two main physical components (items B and C of the Project
S1mnary).  No attempt has been made to quantify the economic benefits
from the institutional development components (items A, E (3) and F of
the Project Summary), nor of the supplementary tools and training
equipment and future studies (items D and E 2 of the Project Summary)
which combined account for about 10% of the project costs. These latter
components are, however, essential to increase the capacity and cost
effectiveness of the existing institutions and therefore avoid a gradual
breakdown in the existing highway maintenance capacity with declining
road standards for both the paved and unpaved network and increasing
transport costs. They vill also help improve investment planning and
prepare potential future projects.
2.        As indicated in para. 2.01 Cameroon is undergoing a period of
rapid economic growth through agricultural development and, in recent
years, increased oil revenues. GDP in constant prices increased by an
average of about 6.0% annually during the last 11 years vhile road
transport, as reflected by fuel consumption increased by about 9% p.a.,
indicating an elasticity of about 1.5. In line vith somewhat faster
economic growth in recent years, fuel consumption rose by about 10% p.a.
as did the estimated vehicle fleet.
Economic Evaluation
Pavement Strengthening
3.        This component involves a four-year progran of pavement
strengthening of existing paved roads, which as a result of age and
increasing traffic volumes and vehicle loads are beginning to
deteriorate. The roada to be strengthened each year vill be selected on
the basis of an ongoing consultant pavement management study using the
Bank's HDI model. The results of the study vill be reviewed jointly
between the Government and the Bank and the annual programs vill be
submitted to the Bank for prior approval. During the loan negotiations
the Governaent should agree to this procedure and that no section
shoving an ERR of less than 12% vill be included in the progran to be
carried out vith Bank assistance, unless the Bank has specifically

ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 3
agreed to its inclusion (e.g. in the case of very short connecting
sections or in cases of important non-quantified benefits).
4.        Until completion of the evaluations of the paved netvork it is
not known for sure which sèctions would be included. Based on the
mission's inspection of the paved network, it is clear that several
roads are ln need of strengthening and selective improvements. The
mission generally agreed with the tentative selection made by the
consultants and the Goverument. These are listed in Annez 3-1 together
with their 1983 traffic volumes-ranging from about 400 vpd to about
3,000 vpd. The roads ln the west generally have higher traffic volumes
than those in the north.
Upgrading to Paved Standards
(i) Mbalmayo-Ebolowa Road
5.        This road section forms part of the road linking the capital
of Yaoundé vith the agricultural and forestry areas in the southern part
of Cameroon and Gabon and Equatorial Guinea to the south. The existing
road from Yaoundé to Mbalmayo (48 km) is paved but narrow and in fairly
poor condition. It vill be upgraded under a separate project to be
financed by the Goverument. The existing road section fro« Mbalmayo to
Ebolova (112 km) is an earth road which becomes difficult to pass during
the rainy season. Traffic volume in 1982 averaged about 200 vpd with
about half light traffic (private cars, taxis and pick-ups) and about
hali heavy (Table 1 of this Annex).
6.        The influence area or the road has a population of about one
million of which about 560,000 are in larger Yaoundé. Excluding
Yaoundé, the population is mostly rural. Except for tertiary industries
linked with the administrative and commercial role of Yaoundé, the
region depends on agriculture as a major supplier for Yaoundi and on
forestry. A rural development project for the region is presently under
preparation. There is also significant potential for further forestry
developments.
7.        The quantified benefits from the upgrading of the Mbalmayo-
Ebolowa road to paved standard are the reduced vehicle operating costs
associated with lmprovement from categories 2 to 5 (Table 2 of this
Annex) and a reduction in distance (5 km). Based on estimated end 1984
construction cost3, a 2 1/2 years construction period, estimated end
1984 vehicle operating costs, estimated traffic growth of 10Z p.a.
tapering off to 7% p.a. and a 20 years economic life, this component
vould yield an ERR of 16%. With a combined 10% increase in construction
costs and a 10% reduction in benefits the component would still yield an
ERR of 13% (Tables 3 and 4 of this annex). Alloving for time savings
vould increase the above ERRa by about 1% point. Potential savings in
road maintenance costs or alternatively further road deterioration and
increasing vehicle operating costs in the vithout case vere not consi-
dered, nor vere potential increases in net value of agricultural pro-
duction. The above ERR's are therefore likely to underatate the actual
economic return from this project component.

(ii) the Kumbe Bakundo-Mfaitok II Road
8.        This road section forms part oi the Kumba-Mamfe Road (190 km).
It is the -min link between the northern and southern part of the South
West Province, a rich agricultural area. The influence area of this
road has a population of about 430,000, mostly rural. The economy is
primarily based on agriculture (both traditional and modern-rubber,
bananas, palm oil, thé) and forestry. The road also forms a section of
the Lagos-Mombassa Transafrican Bighway. The road has been divided into
4 lots of which the first tvo lots (4.6 and 50.8 km respectively) are
being constructed vith Goverument financing. Lot 3, Kumbe Bakundo-
Mfaitock II (49.5 km) vould form part of the proposed project. Lot 4
Mfaitok II-Bachud Akagbe (on the main vest-east road between the
Nigerian border-Mamfe and Bamenda) vould be constructed by the Govera-
ment. The existing road is an earth road which becomes very difficult
to pass and partially closed to heavy traffic during the rainy season.
This is particularly true for a difficult mountainous part.
9.        The quantified benefits for the upgrading of the Kumbe
Bakundo-Mfaitok Il road section to paved standards are the reduced vehi-
cle operating costs (Table 3 of this Anmex) and a reduction in distance
(from 49.5 km to 48 km). Based on preliminary end 1984 construccion
costs (which may possibly be reduced during detailed engineering), a
2-112 years construction period, estimated end 1984 vehicle operating
costs, estimated traffic grovth and a 20 year economic lfe, this compo-
rent would yield an ERR of 15%. Sensitivity results are shown in Table
4 of this annex. Potential time savings, savings in road maintenance
costs or increasing vehicle operating costs as a result of deteriorating
road conditions because of rapidly increasing traffic volumes in the
vithout case vere not considered, nor vere net value aaded from agri-
cultural productions. The above ERR is therefore likely to understate
the actual economic return for this component.
Combined
10.       Pending the rates of return for the pavement strengthening
component it is not possible to calculate a combined rate of return for
the civil works components or the project as a whole. With a cut-off
ERR of 12Z it can, hovever, prudently be assumed that the average ERR
for the pavement strengthening would be at least 16% and that the
combined ERR of the three civil ~;orks components would therefore also be
at least 16% and the overall return on the project. including the cost
of institutional development and other iteim for which no benefits vere
quantified, vould at least be 15%.
