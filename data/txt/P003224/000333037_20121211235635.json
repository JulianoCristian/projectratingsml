The staff said that the credit\n            was part of the Bank's support for Zambia's\n            program of rapid liberalization and extensive privatization\n            to stimulate private sector led growth coupled with\n            increased attention to social services and other direct\n            poverty alleviation measures. In view of the uncertain\n            macroeconomic environment, effectiveness and disbursement\n            will take place when evidence of strong macroeconomic policy\n            implementation was available. This will be accomplished by\n            sending Bank staff with the August International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF) mission to examine end-June performance against\n            fund targets, progress in structural reform, and prospects\n            for continued strong performance. As explained in an\n            updating note distributed the previous week, determination\n            on the effectiveness condition will be based on the findings\n            of the mission. The Bank will also increase efforts to renew\n            the dialogue between the Government and bilateral with the\n            hope of a resumption of bilateral financing and allowing a\n            sustainable reform program to be maintained. With respect to\n            the credit itself, the staff said that it focused on some\n            new areas of emphasis, namely procurement reform and\n            informal urban settlements, and followed up on some\n            continuing issues such as the privatization of the national\n            copper company (ZCCM). The Government had already taken\n            strong action in these and other areas, including increasing\n            the administrative efficiency of the sale and transfer of\n            leaseholds, tariff reductions, and spending in the social sectors."}, "docdt": "1996-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
