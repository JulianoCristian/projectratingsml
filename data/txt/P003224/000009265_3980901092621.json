(ICR) for the Zambia Second Economic and Social\n            Adjustment Credit (ESAC II). The objective of the project\n            was to support Zambia's economic reform program and to\n            aid in the reduction of poverty by promoting broad-based,\n            private sector-led growth and improving the delivery of\n            vital social services. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) adjustment for\n            low income countries, especially those facing external\n            shocks like Zambia, is a long and arduous process; (ii)\n            future operations should aim at fewer, and probably more\n            critical, conditions, particularly in an election period;\n            (iii) it may be important in adjustment operations such as\n            ESAC II to identify at the design stage the likely\n            implementation bottlenecks and to provide, for instance\n            through a Technical Assistance loan, the resources needed to\n            help enhance implementation capacity of the government; (iv)\n            The nature of Non Govermental Organizations (NGOs) as a\n            heterogeneous group and the complexity of the government and\n            NGO relationship make it difficult for adjustment lending to\n            be an effective instrument for dealing with government and\n            NGO issues; and (v) Future International Development\n            Association (IDA) operations will have to give more\n            attention to issues of budgetary planning and management if\n            expenditures for social programs are to be protected."}, "docdt": "1998-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
