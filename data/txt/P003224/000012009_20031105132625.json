  the Implementation Completion Report (ICR), rating the\n            Economic Recovery and Investment Promotion Credit (ERIPC) as\n            moderately satisfactory, the Second Economic and Social\n            Adjustment Credit (SESAC) as unsatisfactory, and the Public\n            Sector Reform and Export Promotion Credit (PSREPC)\n            moderately satisfactory; however, sustainability ratings\n            gave mixed results, for the audit upgrades sustainability\n            for the ERIPC from uncertain to likely, though downgrades it\n            to unlikely for both the SESAC and PSREPC projects, while\n            institutional development impacts are rated modest in all\n            three projects. Major lessons o f general applicability are\n            conveyed as follows. When pressures to maintain a Client\n            current on the service of its external debt, have a major\n            impact on lending decisions, it is incumbent upon Management\n            to discuss these pressures, and any impact they had on the\n            timing, content, and size of a proposed operation with the\n            Board at the time of loan presentation. \"Stroke of the\n            pen\" measures are an unreliable indicator of Borrower\n            commitment to undertaking deeper structural reform. Uneven\n            macroeconomic performance sharply reduces the expected\n            long-term benefits of structural reform, and cripples the\n            prospects for private sector-led growth. Efforts to\n            diversify Zambia's production base have not succeeded,\n            in part because non-price constraints, such as poor\n            infrastructure, weak governance, and public sector\n            inefficiency, have not been adequately addressed."}, "docdt": "2003-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
