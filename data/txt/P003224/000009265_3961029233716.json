Zambia's economic reform program designed to address\n            the serious levels of poverty through promoting widely\n            shared, private sector-led economic growth and improving the\n            delivery of vitally needed social services. In particular,\n            the project will support measures that will: a) more firmly\n            establish a stable macro economic environment; b) improve\n            the competitive position of exporters and rationalize the\n            structure of effective protection by revising the tariff\n            structure; c) strengthen markets, in particular by\n            accelerating the implementation of land market reforms\n            approved by Parliament in 1995; and d) improve the delivery\n            of vital social services by strengthening budget priorities\n            for and within the social sector ministries and by further\n            development and implementation of policy reforms in these\n            areas. The main benefits of this project will be increased\n            economic growth, employment, and poverty reduction arising\n            from a more competitive private sector, a more efficient\n            public sector, sustained human resource investments, and\n            more effective safety net provisions."}, "docdt": "1996-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
