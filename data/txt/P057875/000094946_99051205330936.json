Building\n            Project will strengthen the Government's capacity to\n            facilitate and regulate mining activities, and increase\n            private investment in the sector, which will provide a sound\n            basis for exploitation, over the long term, of the\n            country's natural resources potential. The main\n            components provide for: 1) Capacity building, which will\n            restructure and strengthen the Ministry of Mines and\n            Industry (MMI) towards mining law enforcement. This includes\n            organization and staffing of key administrative units with\n            new procedures, staff training, supply of equipment, and\n            rehabilitation of facilities. Additionally, proper computer\n            based cadastre and mine reporting systems will be\n            established, together with explicit criteria and\n            non-discretionary procedures for granting/foreclosing of\n            mining rights; 2) Geologic infrastructure, which includes\n            the preparation of digital geological maps, and, development\n            of a data base for compilation/update of geological\n            information. Supporting the geological mapping, a geophysic\n            airborne survey will be implemented. Supervision will follow\n            the integration of this component, with a final processing\n            and printing of the digital mapping; 3) Environmental\n            management system, to include capacity building at MMI, for\n            monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations.\n            Studies will assess and monitor social, cultural, and\n            economic impacts on local communities."}, "docdt": "1999-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
