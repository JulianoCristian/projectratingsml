The Mining Sector\n            Capacity Building Project (PRISM) received counterpart funds\n            in a timely manner, especially because of a close working\n            relationship maintained between the Project Implementation\n            Unit (PIU) and the Ministry of Finance. Institutional\n            development impact can only be achieved with strong\n            Government ownership. Autonomous institutions should be set\n            up, if possible, in a transparent manner, and should follow\n            clear and specific procedures. Adequate supervision and a\n            strong relationship between the task team and the Project\n            management team are essential to achieve the realization of\n            project outcomes and full disbursement. Stability of task\n            team engaged in project supervision is very important to\n            maintain a working relationship with the PIU/Government\n            actors. The PRISM was implemented under an independent PIU,\n            rather than through the MMI, even though this arrangement\n            was initially considered. The PRISM team worked closely with\n            its contracted consultants, assured timely delivery of\n            contracts and was also heavily involved in negotiations of\n            larger contracts."}, "docdt": "2005-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
