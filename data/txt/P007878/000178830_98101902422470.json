Paraguay enjoys a\n            comparative advantage, and to help improve the incomes and\n            living conditions of small- and medium-scale farmers.\n            Specifically, the project is designed to improve\n            farmers' access to financial resources by: (a)\n            establishing a country-wide agricultural credit program in\n            BNF to finance long-term credit for on-farm investments and\n            short-term credit for operating costs; and (b) continuing\n            the efforts initiated under the Bank-financed Industrial\n            Credit Projects to strengthen BNF's staff, services and\n            associated facilities for agricultural credit operations."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
