and biological species in Madagascar and assist\n            in implementing the National Conservation Strategy and\n            Forestry Policy, adopted respectively in 1984 and 1985.\n            Specifically, the project includes three components:  (a)\n            Forestry Department reinforcement through institutional\n            strengthening and human resource development activities, and\n            support to the forest valley development, seed collection\n            and research programs.  They further involve (b) natural\n            forest protection of forest reserves, and creation of a new\n            National Park in the Andasibe region; and a (c)\n            reorientation of the Mangoro plantation including a\n            sylvicultural program for long term sawlog production.  The\n            project will be carried out over a period of 7 years."}, "docdt": "1988-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
