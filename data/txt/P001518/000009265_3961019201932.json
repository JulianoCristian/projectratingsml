The objectives were\n            adequately achieved in the first years of the project. The\n            project has maintained satisfactory relations with the World\n            Bank, despite differences in opinion from time to time as to\n            the role the project should play to better ensure its\n            long-term viability in view of realities prevailing in the\n            country. Frequent changes in the members of supervision\n            missions, particularly when total, do however pose problems\n            in understanding the project's evolution, or desired\n            evolution, and its environment, and in making optimal and\n            timely decisions. The recent establishment of an\n            interlocutor in the field can only enhance relations between\n            the borrower and the financial institution. More attention\n            needs to be paid to the initial appraisal of projects,\n            particularly in analyzing socioeconomic factors that have,\n            or could potentially have, a significant and irreversible\n            impact on implementation of the project and its future, such\n            as fire hazards and sources of energy available for processing."}, "docdt": "1996-03-19T00:00:00Z"}
