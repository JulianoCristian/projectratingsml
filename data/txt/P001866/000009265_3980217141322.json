Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) devote adequate time and effort to build\n            understanding and ownership of reforms at both the political\n            and the administrative levels, and effectively involve the\n            Borrower in supervising the reform program; 2) carefully\n            assess the sequencing and timing of the reform program and\n            explicitly link the corresponding institutional support to\n            the implementation timetable of the reform program; 3)\n            maintain continuity within the Bank team throughout\n            preparation, appraisal end supervision, and carefully build\n            and maintain relations with counterpart staff, working with\n            them as a team; and 4) ensure there is good coordination\n            with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and donors, right\n            from the beginning."}, "docdt": "1997-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
