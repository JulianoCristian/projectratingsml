Private Sector Development Credit\n            Project will support the structural measures needed to\n            accelerate the development of the private sector, strengthen\n            the financial sector, and promote growth notably in two\n            sectors where private sector activity is promising: fishing\n            and mining. The credit will support a program of policy\n            reforms which are necessary for establishing an environment\n            conducive to supply-response and self-sustained growth of\n            the private sector. The reform program includes: (i)\n            unification of foreign exchange rates; (ii) strengthening\n            the legal and judiciary environment through, inter alia, the\n            revision of legal codes pertaining to business and the\n            training of judges and lawyers; (iii) reorganizing the\n            accounting and audit profession, strengthening the minimum\n            requirements for qualification and revising the accounting\n            plan; (iv) empowering the Chamber of Commerce and\n            strengthening it so it can represent private sector interest\n            vis-a-vis the authorities and help provide needed services;\n            (v) adopting and continuously enforcing new Banking Law to\n            ensure sound banking practices are applied; (vi) continuing\n            the regular issue of Treasury bills and the movement to\n            indirect instruments of monetary control; (viii) formulation\n            of a strategy for the second phase of financial sector\n            development; (ix) strengthening the surveillance of fishing\n            activities; (x) strengthening supervisory and research\n            institutions in the fishing sector; (xi) disengaging the\n            State form production and marketing of fishing activities;\n            and (xii) strengthening the framework for mining sector\n            development, including the revision of the mining code and\n            taxation applied to mining, reorganization and strengthening\n            of supervisory and regulatory institutions, and revision of\n            cadastral procedures."}, "docdt": "1995-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
