The four operations aimed at\n            promoting the development of the private sector as a major\n            engine of growth and at improving public resource management\n            to reduce poverty. PSDC and its accompanying technical\n            assistance project, the PSDCBC, addressed three areas: (i)\n            costly delays in implementing key reforms in the banking and\n            fisheries sectors; (ii) a lower than expected supply\n            response from the private sector; and (iii) persistent\n            weaknesses in public resource management. The Public\n            Resource Management Credit (PRMC) of 1996 addressed the\n            following: (i) strengthening of economic management,\n            institutional capacity, and governance; (ii) public resource\n            management through a reform of the indirect tax and trade\n            systems; and (iii) the restructuring of expenditure in favor\n            of the social sectors. The Fiscal Reform Support Credit\n            (FRSC) of 2000 aimed at: (i) extending the tax reform to\n            direct taxes to promote PSD and improve Mauritania's\n            competitiveness on world markets and (ii) deepening\n            expenditure restructuring."}, "docdt": "2004-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
