I   OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthrough excellenceand Independencein evaluation.                       I
  About this Report
       The OperationsEvaluationDepartmentassesses the programsand activitiesof the World Bank for two
  purposes:first, to ensurethe integrity of the Bank's self-evaluationprocess andto verify that the Bank's work is
  producingthe expectedresults,and second, to help develop improveddirections,policies,and proceduresthrough
  the disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, OEDannually assesses about 25 percent of
  the Banks lendingoperations. In selecting operationsfor assessment,preferenceis given to those that are
  innovative, large, or complex:those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which
  ExecutiveDirectors or Bank managementhave requestedassessments;andthosethat are likelyto generate
  importantlessons. The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessment support larger evaluation
  studies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
  Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
  PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit
  the borrowing country for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to
  validate and augment the informationprovided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
  OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED management approval. Once cleared internally, the
  PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
  sent to the borrower for review: the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
  Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


 About the OED RatingSystem
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
 The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
 sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Following is
 the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
 http://worldbank,org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
       Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
 current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
 goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
 Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
 account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
 opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
       Sustainability: The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
       lnstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improvesthe ability of a country or region
 to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
 better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
 better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
 institutionalarrangements. lnstitutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
 project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevantobjectives were achieved, or are expected to be
 achieved, efficiently. Possib/eratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
 supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
 for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
 Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
 quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
 achievementof development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
 Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

        This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on four lending
 operations to the Islamic Republic of Mauritaniafrom 1995 to 2000, to assist the country
indeveloping the private sector and inrestructuring public expenditure.

        The Private Sector Development Credit (PSDC) (Credit 2726-MAU), inthe
amount of SDR 19.3 million, was approved on May 23, 1995, became effective on
August 9, 1995, and was closed on December 31, 1997, the original date. It was a
three-tranche operation. A Supplemental Credit of SDR 500,000 from the FY96 IDA
Reflow Facility, was approved on December 12, 1995. Both the original and
Supplemental Credits were fully disbursed. Parallel financing was provided by the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund(OECF) of Japan in an amount equivalent to
US$30 million. Disbursements from the OECF were made at the same time as releases
from the IDA Credit.

        The Private Sector Development and Capacity BuildingCredit (PSDCBC) (Credit
2730-MAU), in the amount of SDR 4.7 million, was approved on May 23, 1995,
became effective on November 29, 1995, and was closed on May 31, 2000, five months
behind the original date. The Credit assistedin implementing the program supported by
the above PSDC. Ninety-five percent of the Credit was disbursed.

        The Public Resource Management Credit (PRMC) (Credit 2887-MAU), inthe
amount of SDR 13.9 million, was approved on June 20, 1996, became effective on July 30,
1996, and was closed on December 31, 1999, six months behindthe original date. The
Credit consisted of five tranches, of which two were floating, and of SDR 900,000 to
finance studies and to reimburse an advance under the Project Preparation Facility.
Ninety-nine percent of the Credit was disbursed. The Credit was supplemented by three
fundings under the IDA'SFifthDimensionProgram, for atotal of SDR 900,000, of which
SDR 400,000, SDR 300,000, and SDR 200,000 were disbursed at the same time as the
secondcore tranche, the first floating tranche, and the secondfloating tranche, respectively.

        The FiscalReformSupport Credit (FRSC) (Credit 3352-MAU), inthe amount of
SDR 22.4 million, was approved on May 23,2000, becameeffective on September 19,2000,
and was closed on June 30,2001, six months behind the original date. The Credit was of one
tranche. A Supplemental Credit, inthe amount of SDR 14.1 million, was approved on
December 22, 2000. Both the original andSupplemental Credits were fully disbursed.

       This PPAR is basedon all relevant Bank andFunddocuments and on interviews
with Bank and Fundstaff. A mission visited Mauritania in June 2003 to discuss
performance with officials who implemented the projects, representatives of civil
society, and members of the Bank resident mission.

       The draft PPAR was sent to the Government for comments. No comments were
received.

       This report was preparedby Pierre de Raet (Consultant), with PoonamGupta as
Task Manager. Agnes Santos and Janice Joshi provided administrative support.

 Summary

 1.      The four operations must be seen as part of the adjustment program initiated by
 Mauritania in the mid-1980s with the support of the Bank and the Fund. Growth resumed
 after the first reforms were undertaken but was interrupted abruptly in 1989 following a
 border conflict with Senegal and the Persian Gulf War. In 1992, the Government
 resumed its adjustment reforms with good results throughout the decade. Inaddition to
 macro-economic stabilization, substantial liberalization was achieved and the State
 reduced considerably its role in the economy. The incidence of poverty declined from
 57 percent in 1990to 46 percent in 2000, but inequality in incomes has increased over
 recent years. Mauritania adopted its poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) in 2001,
 and reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative in June 2002.

 2.      Basically, the four operations aimed at promoting the development of the private
 sector (PSD) as a major engine of growth and at improving public resource management
to reduce poverty. The Private Sector Development Credit (PSDC) and its accompanying
technical assistance project, the Private Sector Development and Capacity Building
Credit (PSDCBC), both of 1995, addressedthree areas: (i) delays in implementing
                                                              costly
key reforms in the banking and fisheries sectors; (ii) a lower than expected supply
response from the private sector; and (iii) persistent weaknesses in public resource
management. The Public Resource Management Credit (PRMC) of 1996 addressedthe
following: (i)strengthening of economic management, institutional capacity, and
governance; (ii)public resource management through a reform of the indirect tax and
trade systems; and (iii) the restructuring of expenditure in favor of the social sectors. The
Fiscal Reform Support Credit (FRSC) of 2000 aimed at: (i)     extendingthe tax reform to
direct taxes to promote PSD and improve Mauritania's competitiveness on world markets
and (ii) deepening expenditure restructuring.

3.      PSDC: the outcome is downgraded from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory
because of several important shortcomings: the foreign exchange market, though
liberalized, remains thin and plagued by anti-competitive practices from the banking
sector; the business legislation, though revisedand updated, i s applied unevenly because
most implementationdecrees are yet to be issued; support structures for PSD were not
put in place; and the banks are reluctant to provide investment funds to small- and
medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) and small entrepreneurs. The ratings of modest for
institutional development impact (IDI)and of likely for sustainability are maintained, but
the ratings for both Bank performance and borrower performance are downgradedfrom
satisfactory to moderately satisfactory, because the Bank neglected at entry to tackle the
issue of lack of competition in Mauritania, a major constraining factor to development,
and underestimated the time required to revise legislation in the particular context of a
country with two cultures. The borrower performance is downgraded because of poor
commitment to implementationin the key area of legislation.

 4.      PSDCBC: the outcome is downgraded from satisfactory to moderately
 satisfactory because, in some cases like the formulation of a financial sector strategy, or
 the strengthening of the capacity to manage the all-important fisheries sector, objectives
 were not achieved. Inother areas, such as training ofjudges and accountants, outputs
 were not of a scope or a duration sufficient to bringabout lasting results. The ID1rating
 i s downgraded from substantial to modest because little impact was achieved in the legal,
 banking, and accounting professions, while the attempt to raise the capacity of the
 oceanographic research center to manage the resources provedelusive. The ratings for
 sustainability and Bank performance are maintained as likely and satisfactory,
 respectively, but the rating of borrower performance i s downgraded from satisfactory to
 moderately satisfactory because the Government was not always able to identify and
 recruit qualified expertise, thereby causing delays, nor was it sufficiently pro-active in
 ensuring that TA led to results.

 5.      PRMC: the outcome is downgraded from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory
 becausethe intendedbenefits of the tax and trade reforms, albeit well conducted, will be
 slow to obtain due to the limited administrative capacity to effectively apply them; the
redirectingof public resources to the social sectors was only partially achieved; and the
 objective of reorganizingthe public administration was not achieved because of strong
resistance to change. The ID1rating i s also downgraded from substantial to modest
becausethe institutional impact in the revenue agencies was minimal; progress in
 adopting medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEF) was slow and insufficiently
coordinated; and the reorganization of five key ministries was unsuccessful. The
sustainability rating i s downgraded from highly likely to likely becausethe fiscal and
trade reforms will continue to depend on strong government commitment and external
support. The ratingof Bank performance i s maintained as satisfactory, but borrower's
performance is downgraded from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory because the
Government showed much less commitment to improving public resource management
than to carrying out the fiscal reform.

6.       FRSC: the outcome is downgraded from highly satisfactory to moderately
satisfactory because, although the direct tax reform was well conceivedand implemented,
a study on the marginal effective tax rate was not carried out, and, more importantly,
there was no noticeable improvement in resource management with allocations for the
social sectors lower in 2000 than in 1999. The ID1rating i s also downgradedfrom high
to modest because the restructuringof the Public Expenditure and Investment Programs
and the confection of the MTEFs were slow, poorly coordinated, and not successful in
channeling additional resources for poverty reduction. The sustainability rating i s
downgraded from highly likely to likely, because progress in public resource
management remains uncertain. The rating of highly satisfactory for Bank performance
i s downgraded to satisfactory, because as one tranche operation based on actions taken
prior to negotiations, there was little incentive to monitor the component less amenable to
leadto quick success, that is, public resource management and efficiency in poverty
reduction. The rating for borrower performance i s downgraded from highly satisfactory
to moderately satisfactory because the Government showed insufficient determination in
strengthening public resource management and in pursuingpolicies toward poverty
reduction.

   7.       The overall outcome of the PSD reform i s a mixed picture. Although a more
   favorable environment for PSD was created, the impact of the reform is still modest when
   judged against the fundamental objectives of the operations assessedhere. This i s due to
   three main reasons. First, the liberalizationprocess and the different PSD operations
   were not accompanied or followed by direct support to the executive andjudiciary
   branches and to private sector organizations. Second, the structure of the economy is
   oligopolistic given its small size and the dominant position of a small group of influential
   trading families. And third, the difficulty for the administrationto translate policy
   decisions into effective implementation. In sum, the adjustment program and the
   liberalization of markets have reinforcedthe dominant position of the privileged groups.
   This explains the apparent paradox between the goodmacro-economic performance of
   Mauritania during the 1990sand the outcome of the present operations which hadfew
   distributional effects.   '
   8.       Consideringthe above remarks, could or should the Bank have done things
   differently? Even though Bank performance i s rated satisfactory when judging each of
   the four operations reviewed here, with hindsight and taking a longer perspective, that is,
   the 1990decade, the Bank could have been more proactivein promoting a broader and
   more equitable distribution of ownership and in developing private entrepreneurship.
   When it became apparent that the privatization of banks had resulted in the creation of an
   oligopoly little inclinedto term lending, the Bank should have addressedthe issue
   through stronger conditionality in its operations and policy dialogue at the highest-level.
   Similarly, after the two country assistance strategies in the 1990shadnoted that there had
   been little supply side responseto the late 1980sandearly 1990sadjustment operations,
   the Bank should have integrated better the lessons learned in its later operations and
   dialogue. For instance, analytical work should have been launched on the prerequisites
   for PSD and on competitiveness as complement and support for stronger conditionality in
   the operations of the late 1990s.

  9.       The following are lessons of general application:

                Inprograms or projects with a heavy agendaof legal and regulatory reforms,
                the conditionality should extend to the issuance of application decrees, and
                not only to the revision of laws. Also, the texts shouldbe well adapted to
                local conditions, short, simple, and clear. Inthose programs or projects, the
                Legal Department should be involved early on in preparation and design.

                Floating tranches are useful when the time requiredto complete a task or
                adopt a measure i s uncertain or dependent on the Legislative.

                One-tranche operations based solely on actions taken prior to appraisal do not
                allow monitoring of implementation.

      this connection, it is worth noting that the downgrading of many performance indicators in the present
PPAR is largely due to the fact that the ES were exclusively basedon the implementationcompletion
reports (ICRs), which in turn clearly failed to reflect the reality on the ground.

Tax and trade reforms can be effectively implementedif they are based on
sound analytical work and careful preparation. InMauritania's case, these
reforms were based on two high quality studies and, duringpreparation, their
impact on reducingrevenues was taken into consideration. However, the
analytical work should have taken the local traditions more into account.

 1. Introduction

 1.1     The four operations covered inthis assessmentsupported the adjustment efforts of
Mauritaniaduringthe second half of the 1990s. They were part of the program, initiated
in the mid-1980, aimedat redressingmacro-economic imbalances, moving to a market
economy, and establishing conditions for sustained growth and reducing poverty.

 1.2     The Bank has financed 9 operations, including technical assistance (TA) projects,
to support the program: five up to 1995,* and four between 1995 and 2000. The latter are
assessedhere: the Private Sector Development Credit (PSDC) of 1995; the Private Sector
Development and Capacity BuildingCredit (PSDCBC) of 1995, which accompanied the
PSDC; the Public Resource Management Credit (PRMC) of 1996; and the Fiscal Reform
Support Credit (FRSC) of 2000. The sequence of the 9 operations i s infigure 1.1.

1.3     The four Credits, assessedhere, focused on three major reform areas of the
adjustment program during the second half of the 1990s: (i)            development of private
sector-led growth by removing the obstacles identified after the resumption of reforms in
1992-this was the object of the PSDC and of its accompanying TA project, the
PSDCBC, both of 1995; (ii)      improvement ineconomic management and strengthening of

Mauritania's competitive position through tax reforms; and (iii)improvement in the
efficiency and management of public expenditure to reduce poverty-these     two
components addressedthe shortcomings in public resource management revealed by the
execution of the adjustment programsince 1992 and by two Public Expenditure Reviews
(PER)inthe 1990s. They were the object of the PRMC (1996) and of the FRSC (2000),
the latter extendingand deepening the tax and tariff reforms initiatedunder the former.
Accordingly, this assessmentdiscusses the four operations in pairs: the PSDCjointly
with the PSDCBC, and the PRMCjointly with the FRSC.

 2.      Background

 Country and Economic Background

 2.1     Mauritaniai s a low-income African country on the western edge of the Sahara
 desert. Its population of 2.6 million, growing at 2.4 percent per year, i s thinly dispersed
 across a land area of over 1million square kilometers, 90 percent of which i s desert. The
 country, which i s a bridge between North and Sub-Saharan Africa, has limited agrarian
 resources but contains extensive mineral deposits, most notably iron ore; its coastal
 waters are among the world's richest fishing grounds; and oil reserves were discovered
 offshore in 2001, with commercial drilling expected to begin by late 2005 or early 2006.
 Its per capita gross national income was estimated at US$410 in 2002.

 2.2     The economy depends heavily on the exports of iron ore andfish. Inthe 1960s,
 the economy expanded rapidly, aided by favorable external conditions. Growth faltered
 inthe 1970sandthe early 1980sas these conditions turned negative, with recurring
droughts and falling mineral prices, exacerbated by inadequate.economic policies.
Duringthis period, the country borrowedheavily to finance large-scale industrial
expansion, accumulating a rapidly growing foreign debt. Growth resumed in the
mid-l980s, owing in part to good rains and the adoption of an adjustment program
supported by the Bank and the IMF. A border conflict with Senegal and the Persian Gulf
Crisis causedthe recovery to end abruptly in 1989. Enteringthe 199Os, Mauritania's
economic performance was erratic, foreign debt was high andrising, and social gains
were few.

2.3      In 1992, the Government resumed its adjustment reforms with good results
throughout the decade. Growth was robust and steady, averaging 5.1 percent between
1993 and 1996 and 4.1 percent during 1997-02. Inflation was contained to single digits
andboth the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) and the current account deficit
(excluding official transfers) narrowedsubstantially. The good performanceof non-tax
revenue i s largely due to the FishingAgreement between Mauritania and the European
Union (EU) (table 2.1). In addition to macro-economic stabilization, substantial
liberalization of the economy was achieved: price controls on basic commodities were
removed, the involvement of the State in productive activities considerably reduced, and
reforms inboth the productive and social sectors undertaken.

2.4      The good economic performance of the 1990s led to a decline in the incidence of
poverty from 57 percent in 1990 to 46 percent in 2000 and several social indicators
improved with gross primary school enrollment at 88 percent (for girls 82.2 percent), life
expectancy at birth at 55 years, and under-5 mortality rate at 116 per 1,000. HIV/AIDS
prevalence i s low at 0.52 percent. Key economic indicators are in annex A.

2.5     Mauritania adopted its poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) in 2001, setting
out the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania's (GOM) development
priorities: (i)
              accelerating private sector-led growth; (ii)developing the growth potential
and productivity of the poor; (iii)developing human resources and ensuring universal
access to basic infrastructure and services; and (iv) institutional development and
governance. Progress in the implementationof the PRSPhelped Mauritania reach the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative in June 2002, placing the country on
the path toward external debt sustainability.

 3.     Private Sector Development

 The Strategy Context

 3.1    The country assistance strategy (CAS) in mid-1990 acknowledged that Mauritania
 had made substantial progress since the mid-1980s in stabilization and structural reforms,
 despite the disruptions in 1989-92. It supported GOM's medium-term strategy o f
 (i)strengtheningexternalcompetitivenessandreducingpublicabsorption;
 (ii)
    consolidatingstructural reforms by encouraging private sector initiatives through the
 provision of adequateprice incentives, reliance on market forces, the strengthening of the
 legal and institutional framework and the reform of the financial sector; and (iii) seeking
external debt relief.

 3.2    However, the country strategy also emphasized that efforts until then had
essentially concentrated on handlingcrises and on modernizing the economy, mainly in
miningandfisheries, and that there was a neednow for abroader and longer-term
approach more focused on promoting sustainable development and reducing poverty.
Among the areas, where shortcomings hadpersisted, it noted: (i)the costly delays in
implementingkey reforms in the banking and fisheries sectors, with negative impact on
incomes and employment; (ii)    the lower than expected supply response from the private
sector and agriculture, despite the Agricultural Sector Adjustment and InvestmentProject
(AGSECAL) and the Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program (PESAP) of 1990;
and (iii)the weaknesses inpublic expenditure management and revenue mobilization.
Accordingly, one of the operational pillars of the CAS was to promote private sector-led
growth to generate a supply response.

Objectives and Design

3.3     The objective of the Private Sector Development Credit (PSDC) and the Private
Sector Development and Capacity BuildingCredit (PSDCBC) (both of May 1995), was
to accelerate private sector development (PSD) by addressing the constraints still
remaining after the resumption of adjustment efforts in 1992. They supported reforms in
six areas: the exchange and trade regime; the incentive structure for PSD; the banking
sector and its regulation; financial institutions and markets; the fishing sector; and the
miningsector. Reforms were detailed in two Letters of DevelopmentPolicy, one for
PSD, and one for the FishingSector, and are summarized in annex B.

3.4     The PSDCBC was to helpformulate and implement reforms in four areas:
financial, notably by a new strategy aimed at developing term finance and micro-finance;
legal and regulatory framework by providing consulting services and training; miningby
updating the legislation; and fisheries by strengthening institutional capacity. Assistance
was in the form of studies, training, organization and dissemination of information, and
equipment. Details are in Annex C.

3.5     The PSDC was basedon: (i)series of actions taken prior to Board approval and
                                      a
(ii) tranches,thefirstonetobereleaseduponeffectivenessandsubjecttothe
   three

                                               6


enactment of an amended Banking Law, and the second and third ones on completion of
specific actions, as follows:

    0   Release of the second tranche was subject to: (i)recovery of UM800 million in
        bad bank debts; (ii) adoption of professional standards for the auditing and
        accounting profession; (iii)  evidence that each commercial bank has met the legal
        capital adequacy requirement; (iv) evidence of an offer for sale of two public
        enterprises in the fishing sector (MAUSOV and ALMAP); and (v) increase in the
        access fees for demersal and cephalopod fishing to 8 percent of the estimated
        yield value.

    0   Releaseof the thirdtranche was subject to: (i)recovery of UM700 million inbad
        bank debts; (ii)increase in the access fees for demersal and cephalopod fishing to
        11percent of the estimated yield value; (iii) submission to Parliament of revised
        commercial, investment, and commercial and civil procedure codes; (iv)
        submission to Parliament of a revised mininglegislation; and (v) evidence that
        each commercial bank has met the legal capital adequacy requirement.

3.6     The second and thirdtranches were expected to be disbursed 12 months apart.
The Credit was expected to close by December 1997.

3.7     As notedabove, the PSDCBC was aimed at supporting the reforms. First, in view
of the oligopolistic structure of the banking sector after its privatization and of its practice
to cater to the working capital needs of the companies belonging to the commercial
groups dominating the economy rather than providing term finance to investors, the
intention was to develop a comprehensive financial strategy to promote the emergence of
SME/SMIs and micro-entrepreneurs. Second, the complexity of revisindupdating the
businesslegislationto make it compatible with modern practices while accommodating
Islamic customs required special expertise. Third, special expertise was also needed to
update the miningcode to make the regulatory framework more attractive to potential
foreign investors. Fourth, in the fishing sector, the project aimed at improving the
capacity to manage the sector more rationally, including the adequate recording of export
revenues, the proper conservation of stocks, and the strengthening of environmental and
quality control capabilities. The design of the project contained the following features:

    0  A highproportion of local costs (36 percent) reflectingefforts to: (i)maximize
       capacity-building-all    long-term consultants were to be local; (ii)involve local
       elements in the technical aspects of the work, both to promote capacity-building
       and emphasize on-the-job training through joint efforts by foreign and local
       consultants; and (iii) involve the staff of existing ministries in project
       implementation, follow-up, and coordination.

    0  The project was to be executed by different ministries or agencies based on their
       respective competence. Coordination was entrusted to the former Rehabilitation
       Unitof the Parapublic Sector, which hadbeen set upas the executingagency
       within the Ministry of Planning (MOP) (now the Ministry of Economic Affairs
       andDevelopment -MAED) for the PESAP of 1990, becauseit had acquired

                                               7


         experience in managing the adjustment program. It was reconstituted as the
         Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and was not responsible for project
         implementation, except in a few areas involving several agencies. However, it
         was responsible for overall reporting, audits, procurement, disbursement, and
         other procedures required by the Bank. In addition, it was to have two important
         functions: (i)management of a Social Communications Fund, set up to
         explain/disseminate information on the program; and (ii)   ensuring client
         consultation duringproject execution, including through workshops.

     0   Three schedules were agreed at appraisal: (i)one for implementation, listing
         intermediate target dates; (ii) for performance indicators by executing
                                       one
         agency-it   provided for ajoint annual review (progress made; work program, and
         budgets) in June of each year and ajoint mid-termreview in July 1997; and
         (iii) forsupervision,listinginputsanddocumentsneededforproject
             one
         supervision by the Bank.

 3.8     The PSDCBC was expected to be disbursed over four years, with a timetable
 linked to that of the PSDC. The project was to be completed by June 1999 and the Credit
closed by December 1999.

Relevance of Objectives

3.9      Although the objective of the two projects was fully consistent with the CAS
goals as described above, their design failed to take sufficiently into account the low level
of competition prevailing in Mauritania. Partly as a result of the small population of the
country and past feudal influence, the economy i s dominatedby oligopolies centered on
commercial interests rather than on production and investments. Anti-competitive
practices and barriers to entry are common in key sectors, such as banks, transport, trade,
and import/export. From an operational point of view, the TA project had a tall agenda,
given the multiplicity and complexity of tasks and the number of ministries/entities
involved, with the main challenge being the revision of the business legislation, which
had to meet the requirements of the western and Islamic cultures. Inthat respect, the
institutional and coordination capacity of Mauritania was somewhat overestimated at
preparation/appraisal  .

Achievement of the Objectives and Implementation

3.10    Achievement of the objectives was mixed. In several cases, implementation took
longer than anticipated. For the first two years (mid-1995 to mid-1997), TA activities
were closely associated to the timetable required to meet the PSDC tranche release
conditions. After the latter was closed, the pressure was maintained to implement the
PSDCBC according to the schedules mentioned above.

3.11 Exchange rate and trade regime. The exchange rate was unified and the import
licensing system was liberalized. A unified and market-determined exchange rate was
achieved by end-1995 with: (i)  the elimination of the preferential rate for workers'
remittances and of the limits on transfers for invisible payments; (ii)the creation of a free
market for foreign currency banknotes and travelers' checks; and (iii)the opening of six

                                                  8


 exchange bureaus operating as non-bank institutions. However, the currency market has
 remained thin and its proper functioning i s hinderedby the anti-competitivepractices of
 the banking sector. Manufacturers are reported to obtain foreign exchange for payment
 to foreign suppliers only from foreign exchange bureaus and not from banks and only at
 substantial premia. In the trade area, prior import authorizations were eliminated.
 Finally, the Central Bank of Mauritania (CBM) carried out a debt buy-back operation to
 obtain debt relief from creditors and helped commercial banks in eliminating arrears to
 their foreign correspondents.

 3.12    Incentivesfor PSD. The objective of removing obstacles to PSD was supported
 by TA activities in four sub-areas: strengthening of the legal and institutional framework,
 including training ofjudges and court auxiliaries; a feasibility study of a tax free regime
 for exporters; upgrading of the accounting and auditing framework; and support to the
 Chamber of Commerce. Reforms were partially achieved.

 3.13    Legal andjudiciary framework. Key business legislation (commercial code;
 commercial and civil procedure codes) was revised as per third tranche conditions, but
 with delay. Several revisions were completed only before the closing of the TA project.
However, many implementationdecrees were not issued as of end-2003, with the old
 laws still applicable as a result; this was for instance the case for the Commercial Code.
Also, the revised texts lack simplicity and are still not sufficiently adapted to the local
culture. The revision of the Investment Code was postponed untilcompletion of the
fiscal and tariff reform undertaken in 1997 under the PRMC (see further below), on the
grounds that it should be as close as possible to the tax code, thus providing fiscal
incentives under the common regime rather than under preferential regimes. Laws on the
organization of thejudiciary and onjudiciary fees were also revised, while the
professions of court auxiliaries were liberalized and their statutes revised with the
purpose of improving the efficiency and credibility of thejudiciary. However, the
judiciary remains very weak.

3.14     Four other measures complemented the above: a training program for judges and
court auxiliaries was implemented, but its scope and depth were much too limited; the
regular publication of the Official Bulletin was resumed and the electronic indexation of
laws initiated; three major international business conventions were ratified to bring
Mauritanian legislationto international standards; and the computerization and
strengthening of the Commercial Register was initiated.

3.15    Investment incentives. The feasibility study of tax-free regimes for new exporters,
planned under the TA project, was postponed as being more appropriately undertaken as
part of the revision of the Investment Code. Instead, a one-stop-window was set up to
facilitate applications to establish new enterprises, but it met with operational difficulties
due to the defacto suspension of the Investment Code.

3.16    Accounting and auditingframework. Professional standards for the accounting
and auditing professions and the national accounting plan were revised on the basis of
international practices and norms, as per second tranche conditions. However, revision
and adoption of the new texts took longer than expected because of delays in hiring

                                               9


 consultants. Unfortunately, the Accountants and Auditors Association was not involved
 inthose tasks. A very small training program for accountants and auditors was
 completed only under the PSDCBC.

 3.17    Institutional support to theprivate sector. Despite assistance under the TA
 operation, the chamber of commerce was not reorganized as a fully autonomous body
 representing the private sector and directing its efforts at small firms. Although revised
 statutes were adopted by Parliament inJanuary 2000, implementation decrees were still
 pending when the two Credits closed. As a result, the chamber remained inoperative with
 no membership established and no elections held. Resistance from the Government and
 the powerful employers' association prevented the chamber from evolving to a more
 inclusive body attractive to small and emerging businesses.This situation last until an
 agreement was finally reached in mid-2003, when elections here held.

 3.18   Bankingsector anditsregulation. The restructuring of the banking sector
 (which hadbeen undertaken under the 1987 structural adjustment loan (SAL)) was
consolidated but prudential regulations are not loosely enforced by CBM. According to
second and third tranche conditions, GOM recovered the commercial bank
non-performing loans (for a total of UM 1,500 million) that hadbeen transferred to a
public agency (Agence de Recouvrement des Cre'ancesBancaires - ARCB) created as part
of the restructuring and privatizationof the sector in 1993-95. Although, as per tranche
release conditions, commercial banks adheredto the legal capital adequacy requirements
providedby the new banking law, CBMi s reportedly lax in enforcing prudential
regulations. Two training programs in bank management were provided and a Center for
Bank Training created with the assistance of the French Banking Training Center.

3.19    Despite further consolidationof the banking sector, the key objectives of
improving the quality of bankingservices, fostering competition between banks, and
reinforcing the credibility of the credit system were not achieved. The oligopolistic
structure of the sector remains intact and banking services remain limited to a small
group of economic operators. With respect to the credibility of the credit system, under
the TA project, C B M established a credit risk information system (Centrule des Risques)
and a credit arrears information system (Centrule des Impaye's), with the purpose of
improving the quality of bank portfolio by allowing banks to provide and obtain
information on existing or potential clients; however, the first i s not functioning as
intended and the second i s not functioning at all.

3.20    Developmentof financialinstitutionsand markets. Financial markets were
strengthened with the gradual introduction of indirect instruments of monetary policy.
Interest rates remained positive in real terms and a nascent inter-bank money market was
developed by the regular issue of T-bills, thereby establishing a market-related interest
rate. However, one of the key objectives of the PSDCBC, the formulation of a strategy to
broaden the financial sector by providing term finance and access to credit by SMEs and
micro-enterprises, was not achieved. This was due to poor studies and lack of

                                                     10


 commitment by the authorities and C B M alike. As of early 2004, terms of reference for a
 new study had been issued by CBM.3

 3.21    Fishingsector. The systemsof awardingaccess rightsand licenses for both
 demersal and pelagic fish were adopted, thereby meeting the second and thirdtranche
 release conditions. The systems were made more transparent and led to positive results
 on revenues and competition. Surveillance capabilities were reinforced with assistance
 from Germany; the main fish marketingcompany was partially privatized; and holdings
 inthe two largest fishingcompanies were soldor reduced, according to second tranche
 release conditions.

 3.22    Inthe fishing sector, the TA project aimedessentially at strengthening the
capacity to manage the sector. It financed a survey of fishingresources, the
establishment of a monitoring mechanism for fish exports, and the strengthening of
environmental and quality control capabilities. However, the objectives of improving the
conservation and management of resources, the monitoringof export receipts, and the
strengthening of the regulatory capacity were not achieved. There were three major
shortcomings.

3.23     First, acentralized information system (Bureau Unique de Cuntrdle -BUC), a
key policy tool, was established with the purpose of monitoring foreign exchange flows
inandout of the sector but remained inoperative as the network aimedat linkingthe
different user ministries/agencies (Ministry of Fisheries, CBM, Customs) was never put
in place. Second, the strengthening of the oceanographic research center (CNROP),
aimed at conducting research in surveillance and management of resources, sanitary
control, and conservation, didnot take place due to persistent funding and management
problems; similarly, management and procurement problems prevented the strengthening
of the center's capacity to formulate environmental guidelines and ensure that quality
norms meet EUstandards. As a result, the center did not provide the needed scientific
leadership for a sound long-term development of the sector. Third, the reorganization of
the Ministry of Fisheries and Maritime Economy and the training of its staff in new
technologies, conservation priorities, and greater sensitivity to private investor needs and
concerns were not implementedas the anticipated assistance from donors did not
materialize. This latter sub-component was taken on by the PRMC as part of a wider
program of reorganizingfive key ministries (see further below).

3.24    Miningsector. With assistanceunder the TA operation, a medium-term mining
development strategy was formulated leadingto a revision of the miningcode, the
completion of the miningcadastre, and the preparation of a new tax code for the sector,
thus fulfilling thirdtranche releaseconditions. Although the texts were revisedwith
delay because of difficulties in recruitingqualified consultants, they laid the foundations
for attracting private investment into the sector. The reorganization of the Directorateof

 Inthe absence of micro-financefacilities and the difficulties of the informal sector to accesscredit, in
1997, CBM sponsoredthe establishment of an agency aimed at promotingthe creationof savings and loans
cooperatives(CaissesPopulairesd'Epargne et de CrCdit    - CAPEC).    The scheme is quite successfulwith
20 CAPECs as of January 2004, present in all provinces, and with some 30,000 members. The Bank
supported the scheme through studiesandprovisionofequipment.

                                              11


Mines and training of its staff, aimed at buildingits regulatory capacity, was delayed, as
technical assistance from other donors didnot materialize. As a result, like in the case of
the fishing sector, this sub-component was movedto the PRMC as part of the
reorganization of five key ministries (see below).

 Outcome

3.25     PrivateSector DevelopmentCredit. Theoutcomeis downgradedfrom
satisfactory in the ES to moderately satisfactory. Overall, a clearer and friendlier
business environment was put in place, but some important objectives were only partially
achieved. The exchange rate and trade regimes were liberalized, but the foreign
exchange market remains thin and subject to anti-competitivepractices by the banking
sector. Under the incentive structure for PSD, some codes were revised but not yet
implementedfor lack of implementationdecrees; the revision of the Investment Code
was postponed, but some international conventions were ratified. However, support
structures for small entrepreneurs were not put inplace. The restructuringof the banking
sector was consolidated but banking services and the enforcement of prudential
regulations remain inadequate. Financial markets were strengthened but access to credit
by SMEs and small entrepreneurs was not facilitated. Access rightsfor fishing were
made more transparent and a modern mininglegislation i s now in place.

3.26     PrivateSector Developmentand CapacityBuildingCredit. Theoutcome is
downgradedfrom satisfactory to moderately satisfactory. Achievements present a very
unbalanced picture. Under the incentive structure component, the objectives of revising
the business legislation and of associating local expertise in that revision were achieved,
as well as an improved dissemination of legal information. A modest training program
for judges and court auxiliaries was carried out but with little impact. In the banking
sector, a training center was created, but the risk and credit arrears information systems at
C B M were not made operational. The local accounting and auditing profession was not
associated with international consultants in the task of revising the national accounting
plan. A strategy for the development of the financial sector, notably for term finance and
micro-finance, was not formulated. Inthe fisheries sector, a key sector for the economy,
the objective of raising the capacity to manage the sector and lead research in the field
was not achieved. Inthe miningsector, the TA provided was key to the revision of the
legislation. This unbalancedpicture is due in part to the complexity of the tasks and the
multiplicity of the ministriedagencies involved.

InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

3.27    PrivateSector DevelopmentCredit. Therating of modest is maintained. The
clear institutional development impact of the project was on the Directorate of Mines,
which has developed clear tools to promote and manage the applications for exploration
permits. Inthe other areas, the impact was modest or negligible. For instance, in the key
area of applying and enforcing the revised and updated legislation, GOM has not been
able to harness its resources to prepare and issue most of the application decrees. The
opportunity of formulating a financial sector strategy and of buildinga strongChamber
of Commerce in support of small firms was not seized, due to administrative obstacles,

                                                 12


 vested interests, and lack of vision; in the fishing sector, the capacity to manage and
 monitor the resources was not developed.

 3.28   PrivateSectorDevelopmentand CapacityBuildingCredit. The rating of ZDZ
 is downgradedfrom substantial to modest. In the mining sector, the Directorate is now
administering the new policies and exploration permits on a day-to-day basis in a
well-managed andtransparent way. But, in other areas, the impact of the TA support was
mixed: little capacity buildingwas achieved in the legal area despite the participation of
local scholars side by side with international consultants, even though training was
providedto judges, court auxiliaries, accountants, and commercial bank personnel, their
long-term impact i s questionable because programs were too short and the curriculum too
superficial. Capacity building was not achieved in the area of formulating a financial
sector strategy, or inthe case of the oceanographic research center, which was important
because of the dominance of the fisheries sector.

Sustainability

3.29    PrivateSector DevelopmentCredit. Thesustainability is rated likely as in the
ES. The risk of reversal inoverall PSD policies is minimal. The continued commitment
of GOM to reforms was demonstrated by its determination to broaden and deepen the
adjustment agenda by restructuring and simplifying the tax and tariff systems under the
PRMC and the FRSC (see section 4), inparticular to improve private sector
competitiveness. However, GOMi s aware of the need to strengthen its civil service to
implement the reforms in a manner best responding to the needs of the private sector.

3.30    PrivateSector Developmentand Capacity BuildingCredit. Therating is
maintained as likely. Inthe areas where capacity buildingwas effective, achievements
are likely to be sustainable. This i s especially the case of the miningsector. However, in
all the other areas, sustainability i s unlikely or at best uncertain. Thejudiciary i s very
weak and i s not reported to be able to handle business disputes in a professional and
transparent manner. In the areas where training was provided, sustainability i s uncertain.
The sustainability of the banking training center depends on the willingness of the
bankingcommunity to cover its runningcosts.

Bank Performance

3.31 PrivateSector DevelopmentCredit. Bankpe~ormanceis downgradedfrom
satisfactory in the ES to moderately satisfactory. The rating is basedon the fact that,
with its intimate knowledge of the adjustment program since 1985, the Bank should have
given prominence, at entry, to tackling the issue of lack of competition in the Mauritanian
economy and designed the reform program accordingly. Although the various reform
components by themselves were well chosen, they failed to address obstacles to
competition. Also, in the design of the project, the Bank underestimated the time
required for amending legal texts, given the necessity to reconcile western and Islamic
cultures and legal traditions. Duringimplementation, Bank support was consistent and
well coordinated with the assistance providedunder the TA project.

                                             13


 3.32   PrivateSectorDevelopmentand CapacityBuildingCredit. Bankperformance
 is rated satisfactory as in the ES. Quality at entry was generally satisfactory with TA
 and other assistancewell targeted to the reform areas, although the agenda could have
been less dispersed to facilitate coordination between ministries. With hindsight, the
resources allocated to the fishing sector were probably too limited, thereby constraining
the guidance and support the Bank could have provided. The quality of the TA was
generally good, except in the case of the financial sector strategy. Bank performance
duringexecution was very intense, well organized, and well coordinated to meet the
tranche release conditions under the PSDC. The monitoring schedules proved to be very
useful to supervision missions. The latter showed initiative in devising corrective
solutions as well as openness and flexibility in changing circumstances. One design flaw
appeared during execution, that is, the decision to entrust CBM with the responsibility of
the banking sector component, which causedfrictions with the coordination unit.

BorrowerPerformance

3.33    PrivateSector DevelopmentCredit. Borrower performance is downgraded
from satisfactory in the ES to moderately satisfactory. Both at entry and during
execution, the Government showed a clear vision of the policies needed for PSD, except
for some aspects of the fishingpolicy. However, the commitment to implementation of
the revisedlegislation was not sufficient for the reforms to have a speedy impact. The
coordination unit within the Ministry of Planning performed well and delivered good
records and reports.

3.34    PrivateSectorDevelopmentand CapacityBuildingCredit. Borrower
performance is downgradedfrom satisfactory in the ES to moderately satisfactory.
Although GOM's commitment with respect to policies was firm as noted above, it was
not always able to identify and recruit highly specialized consultants, thus causing delays,
nor was it sufficiently pro-activein ensuring that the TA led to results.

 4.     Public Resource Management and Fiscal Reform

The Strategy Context

4.1     As notedin section 3, the country strategy in the mid-1990s hadpointedto
continued weaknesses in public expenditure management and revenue mobilization in
spite of the renewed adjustment efforts since 1992. It had stressed the need to strengthen
further economic management, institutional capacity, and governance, and had
recommended concerted capacity buildingin core Government services. Indeed, several
shortcomings hadbecome apparent in public resource management, such as in the
composition of revenues, the complexity and distortion of the tax and trade regimes,
weak tax collection and administration, and tax evasion. In addition, the 1994 Public
Expenditure Review (PER) hadcalled for a restructuring of expenditure infavor of the
priority sectors and a streamliningof public investment programmingand
implementation. Finally, in the area of economic management and administrative
organization, the dialogue had highlighted a limitedpolicy-makingcapacity and an
organizational structure ill-suited to the needs of a market-based economy. These issues
became the agenda of GOM's program in public resource management, which consisted
of a Policy Reform Program, supported by the PRMC, and a Capacity Building Program
supported simultaneously by grants from the EU, France, and UNDP.

4.2     The close GOWBank dialogue during this period and the good results achieved
by 1997 led to a more ambitious reform agenda for the late 1990s, that is, reducing
poverty through accelerated private sector-led growth and increased competitiveness.
This was reflectedinthe country strategy of the late-l990s, and, among the strategies to
reach those goals, actions were required on two fronts. First, the restructuringand
modernization of the public sector to better respond to the needs of the private sector.
Second, raising the volume of investment and factor productivity in non-iron ore sectors.

Objectives and Design

4.3     The Public Resource Management Credit (PRMC - June 1996) and the Fiscal
Reform Support Credit (FRSC -May 2000). Both projects aimed at addressing the
public resource management issues mentioned above. Inaddition, the FRSC supported
the policy of stepping up poverty reduction through accelerated PSD. The two projects
mustbe seen in conjunction since the FRSC was, largely, the extension of the PRMC,
mainly in the fiscal area.

4.4    Three areas were targeted for reform under the PRMC:

       resource mobilization by improving tax administration and by reforming the
       corporate and personal income tax systems, the taxation of the productive sectors,
       and the tariff system;

   0   public expenditure management by preparing a three-year public expenditure
       program (PEP); limiting the growth of the public wage bill and defense spending;
       avoiding transfers and subsidies to public enterprises (PES);strengthening debt

                                              16


        management; improving the efficiency of social services; defining a core
        three-year rolling public investment program (PIP); and enhancing the
        transparency and accountability of public finance management; and
        economic management and modernization of the administrative apparatus by
        strengthening economic management institutions responsible for policy-making
        and implementingthe reforms, especially the technical committee of the
        Interministerial Committee on Economic Policy; and by improving the
        organizational structure and administrative procedures of five core ministries
        (Finance, Planningincluding the Statistical Office, Fisheries, Commerce, and
        Industry) through audits, assessmentsof human andmaterial resource needs,
        training, and strengthening of personnel management and administrative
        functions. This latter objective was expected to lead to a reorganization of the
        entire public sector system; it was supported by TA, studies, and other activities
        provided or carried out by the cofinanciers mentionedabove.

4.5     Reforms under the first and second areas were to be consolidated and extended
under the FRSC by expanding the reform of the direct tax system; aligning direct and
indirect taxation; reducingfurther the burden of taxation by removing inefficiencies in
the tax, tariff, and associatedcodes after a study of the marginal effective tax rate
(planned for the second half of 2000 and to be implementedover 2001-02);
strengthening public expenditure management; and strengthening fiscal administration by
completing the restructuring and strengthening of the General Tax Directorate.

4.6     The reforms were detailed in two Letters of Development Policy and are
summarized in annexes D and Efor the PRMC and the FRSC, respectively.

4.7     The PRMC was designed on the basis of actions taken prior to negotiations and
on the release of five tranches, one upon effectiveness without conditions, and two core
and two floating tranches with conditionality. The core tranches were expected to be
disbursed by January 1997, and January 1998, respectively. The choice of floating
tranches was justified by the fact that, due to their complexity, the fiscal and institutional
reforms were likely to require a long time to be completed. Although no dates were set,
both floating tranches were expected to be released by mid-1999, the closing date of the
Credit. However, in case of unsatisfactory performance or non-fulfillment of the
conditionality by the expected life of the project, they were to be cancelled.

4.8    Tranches were to be released as follows:

       Release of the first core tranche was subject to: the creation of a master file with
       tax identificationnumber for each taxpayer; the preparation of an indicative PEP,
       including a rolling PIP, for 1997, compatible with the macro-economic
       framework; the extension of pre-shipment inspectionto all imports; and meeting
       the macro-economic targets for 1996, as set in the 1996-98 policy framework
       paper (PFP).

       Release of the second core tranche was subject to: the introduction of a new
       budgetary nomenclature; the preparation of a PEP for 1998, compatible with the

                                                       17


           macro-economic framework; meeting the macro-economic targets for 1997, as set
          in the 1996-98 PFP; and the submission of an action plan and timetable for the
          corporate and personal income tax reform.

          The first floating tranche was subject to the adoption of a program for the
          restructuring of the five core ministries, and the second one to amending the
          corporate and personal income tax regulation^.^

 4.9      The design of the FRSC was basedon the HighImpactAdjustment Lending
 (HIAL)model andonthe recognition of Mauritania's progressinstabilization and
 structural reforms. It was a one-tranche operation disbursed upon effectiveness on the basis
 of six tax measures incorporatedinto the 2000 budget. The reform of the direct tax system
 hadbeenprepared under the PRMCsince 1997 and was to be implemented over the
 2000-02 budget years. The first phase was supported by the FRSC, while the second and
 thirdones were to beintroduced inthe 2001 and 2002 budgets, each with the support of a
 similar IDA credit. The country strategy of the late-1990s and the internalBank report of
 the FRSC indicated that the latter was the first of a series of three quick-disbursing
 budgetary support operations over 2000-02 aimedat filling the expected yearly financing
 gap. Budgetary support under the FRSC was directed at compensating for the revenue loss
 attributable to the reduction in taxes and tariffs, and at protecting the social sectors from the
 adverseeffects of the reform. Inthe event, the FRSC was not followed by similar
 operations due to insufficient IDA funds; instead, it was to be followed by PRSCs. The
 Credit was to close by December 31,2000. It was complemented by a Supplemental
Credit of SDR 14.1 million, approved inDecember 2000, to compensate for the additional
burden causedby the increase inoil prices in2000.

Relevance of Objectives

4.10      The objectives of the two projects were consistent with the two country strategies
of the 1990s. The PRMC addressedthe goals of the first country strategy of reducing
poverty by improved public expenditure management and of promotingPSD by
redressing an inadequate structure in public resource mobilization. Through the
concomitant capacity building program, two other country strategy goals were pursued,
first, strengthening economic management to consolidate adjustment, deepen policy
reform, and achieve stabilization; second, reorganizingthe administration to support the
State inits new role in a market economy. The FRSC responded to the priority of the
second country strategy of accelerating poverty reduction through private sector-led
growth by expanding the tax and tariff reforms, thereby strengthening Mauritania's
competitive position on foreign markets,




4 Inaddition to the above monitorable conditions, and although not part of the DCA, the MOP specified
that performance would bejudged by the following key indicators: (i)   broadening o f the tax base by, inter
alia, increasing the number of registered tax paying enterprisesby 5 to 10percent per year; (ii)lowering
the statutory corporate income tax; (iii)
                                        limiting wages and salaries to 4 percent of GDP by 1998; and
(iv) promoting private investment to attain at least 11.5 percent of GDP by 1998.

 Achievementof Objectivesand Implementation

 4.11       Objectives with respect to the tax and trade reforms were substantially achieved,
 but those with respect to public resource management and the reorganization of the
 public administration were partially achieved. The five tranches of the PRMC were
 disbursedwithout waivers or amendments andits closing date postponed by six months
 to December 31, 1999. The FRSC was closed on December 31,2000, as scheduled.
 Achievements are discussed below.

 4.12      Resourcemobilization. Four areas were targeted over 1995-2002.

 4.13       Tax administration. The main improvement inthis area was the creation of a
 master file with a single taxpayer IDnumber integratingthe tax and customs databases.
 As aresult, the number of taxpayers has increased, collection has been facilitated, and
 coordinationbetween agencies improved. The system i s expected to further improve
 with the introduction of the "civil register" (&at civil), which will allow to reconcile
 information on individuals, both as "citizens" and as "taxpayers." The General Tax
 Directorate was reinforcedwith the creation of a LargeEnterpriseDirectorate,
 responsible for monitoring tax payments by large enterprises. Although both the General
 Tax Directorateand the General Customs Directorate were strengthened, they still suffer
 from a lack of competent staff, training, and equipment.

4.14       Zndirect tax reform. The reform was initiatedin 1995, by replacing several
indirect taxes with a value added tax (VAT) consisting of two rates: 5 and 14 percent. I t
was extended in 2001 by: (i)         the merger of the two VAT rates into a single rate of
 14percent and (ii)       the review of the exemption system under the VAT (SociCt6 Nationale
Industrielle et Minisre (SNIM); fisheries; Investment Code; Corporate Charters). The
reform has yet to bear fruit fully, however, because difficulties are encountered in
applying the VAT system by enterprises and the tax administration alike, due to its
complexity. The problem i s particularly acute in the provinces where the infrastructure i s
embryonic, although it exists also inNouakchott.

4.15      Direct tax reform. The reform was prepared in 1998-9g5 andimplemented over
three years (2000-02). Inaddition to widening the tax base, the objective was to make
the system more equitable, more transparent, and simpler to administer. It also aimed at
facilitating the move from the informal to the formal sector. The first phase of the reform
was introducedin the 2000 budget and constituted the conditions prior to Board
presentation of the FRSC. The reform consisted mainly o f (i)                   reducingthe corporate tax
rate (Be`ne`ficeZndustriel et Commercial - BIC) from 40 percent to 20 percent;
(ii)  increasing the percentage of the minimumpresumptive tax on fisheries and other


  The reform was basedon two studies, one by the consultant Sodeteg, the other by ForeignInvestment
Advisory Service (FIAS), carried out inconsultation with the IMF.The Sodeteg study had recommended a
single income tax, but the proposal was not adopted becauseo f difficulties in implementation. There are
still individual direct taxes on income from salaries, real estate, and interest and dividends. Since there i s a
general income tax on total income, from which is deducted the total taxation from these individual taxes,
there is double taxation on the balance. GOM will review this issue after an evaluation of the reform to be
carried out by the IMF.

  products deductible from the BIC from 25 percent to 100percent; (iii)                   reducing the
  number of brackets of the tax on salaries from 11to 5; (iv) reducingthe number of
  brackets of the general income tax from 11to 5; (v) simplifying the taxation on real estate
  income by merging two taxes; and (vi) replacingthe flat tax on profits by a synthetic tax,
  thereby facilitating the taxation of the informal sector. In 2001, the system of exemptions
  from the BIC under the Investment Code was also revised. One shortcoming under the
  FRSC was the failure to carry out the study on the marginal effective tax rate plannedfor
  the second half of 2000. Annex Fpresents the changes implementedin the direct tax
  system over 1999-2003; they are summarized in table 4.1.

 4.16     Trade reform. The reform was initiated in 1997 and completed in 2000. In
 addition to increasing revenues and widening the tax base, the objective was to reduce
 fraud and make the system more transparent and simpler. Currently, there are four rates
 on imports: 0, 5, 13, and 20 percent. In addition, there i s a uniform statistical tax of
 3 percent on imports and exports.6 The reform resulted in reducing the tariff pressure
 from 47 to 23 percent. In agreement with the IMFand the Bank, it was to be
 implementedover 3 years (1997-99), but GOMrequested an extension of one year to
 2000, so as to harmonize the rates with the common external tariff of the Union
 Economique et MonCtaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA) introducedon January 1, 2000.
 Harmonization with the Maghreb Union was never done, since trade with the Maghreb i s
 fairly limited (there are only some bilateral agreements).' The pre-shipment inspection
 system was extended to all imports.



  For fish, the statistical tax i s 3 percent for cephalopods and 11percent for pelagic; however, a study is
 planned to review export taxation on fish.
  After harmonizingits trade regime with that of the UEMOA, Mauritania's current priority is to achieve
 harmonization with WTO.

                                               20


 4.17    Publicexpendituremanagement. Since 1997, three-year rollingPEPSandPIPS,
 consistent with the macro-economic framework and reflectingsectoral strategies, have
 been prepared. The PEPprocess, managed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), was
 strengthened by consolidating all sources of financing, special accounts, andcounterpart
 funds, while aPIPmonitoringunit was established within MAED. As part of the
 transition to medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEF), the PEP and the PIP are
 being redesigned, but the limited capacity of both ministriesremains an obstacle to rapid
 progress. Five MTEFs were prepared, of which only those for education and health were
 incorporated into the 2003 budget. The budget cycle was strengthened and a revision of
 the procurement code initiated.

4.18     However, the outcome of the above measureshad little impact on the level of
 social expenditure duringthe second half of the 1990s (table 4.2). Neither project had
quantitative targets for education and health expenditures, but the budgetary support
provided by the FRSC aimed, inter alia, at protecting the social sectors from the adverse
effects of the tax reform. That objective was not met, as the 2000 allocations to
education and health were not maintained at their 1999 level. Starting in 2001, the
outcome picture i s affected by the HIPC resources made available that year. These were
directed largely to activities under GOM's poverty reductionprogram.

4.19     Economic managementand organizationalrestructuring. The policy-making
capacity of the Technical Secretariat of the Interministerial Committee on Economic
Policy was strengthened due to TA, staff development, training, and computer
equipment. However, the public administration still needs to be re-organized. Fullaudits
of the five selected ministries were carriedout to assess the changes required to meet the
needs of a market-based economy, however, only some administrativefunctions were
revised and most of the recommendations were not adopted or implementeddue to
considerable resistance from the staff.

Outcome

4.20     PublicResourceManagementCredit. Theoutcome is downgradedfrom
satisfactory in the ES to moderately satisfactory. The objectives of reforming the tax
and trade systems were achieved, with positive results in terms of reduction in fiscal
pressure and simplification in rate structure, thereby making the taxation and trade
systems more transparent and simpler to administer. However, the intendedbenefits of
the reform will only become fully apparent as the administrative capacity to effectively
apply it in all its aspects i s developed. The objective of improving public resource

                                                     21


 management and redirectingmore resourcesto the social sectors was partially achieved,
 while the objective of reorganizing the administration to make it more efficient and more
 responsive to the needs of the private sector was not achieved.

 4.21     FiscalReformSupportCredit. Theoutcome is downgradedfrom highly
 satisfactory in the ES to moderately satisfactory. The reform of the direct tax system
 proceeded as planned and was well implemented. However, it i s too early to judge
 whether reduced tax rates on income and profits will have a lasting impact on investment,
 business development, and competitiveness. There were shortcomings in other areas: the
 study on the marginal effective tax rate was not carriedout; there was no noticeable
 improvement in public resource management and budgetary allocations to the social
 sectors were lower in 2000 than in 1999.

 4.22     Figure 4.1 shows the results of the tax reform (details are in Annex G). Over the
 period 1994-2002, the fiscal pressure, measured as tax revenue inpercentage of GDP,
 was reduced from 17.9 percent to 14.3 percent (see table 2.1 above).8 Taxes on income
 and profits declined

may be limited by the fact that the analytical work was too theoretical and not sufficiently

 by raising allocations to the social sectors, was slow and burdened by administrative
 inefficiencies and problems of coordination between MOF and MAED. Progress in
 adopting MTEFs and in improvingeconomic management was also limited. Finally, the

 revamping of the public administration, was unsuccessful.

 BankPerformance

as in the ES. The Bank had an intimate knowledge of the reform programinitiated in
 1992, and, as a result, designed and sequencedthe project very well. The continuity in
 staff was a key factor in that respect. The choice of floating tranches for actions
requiring time and flexibility on the part of different branches of Government proved to
be an effective vehicle both as an incentive to progress and as a monitoring tool. During
implementation, the Bank followed closely the tax and trade reform but neglected the
public resource management component. Similarly, for the organizational audits of the
key ministries with the result of very little institutionalimprovement in that area.

4.28     FiscalReformSupport Credit. Therating of highly satisfactory is downgraded
to satisfactory. The project was a one tranche operation appraised and approved expost

incentive to monitor and support the component of the project less amenable to lead to
quick success, that is, public resource management and greater efficiency in poverty
reduction measures.

Borrower Performance

4.29     PublicResourceManagementCredit. The rating is downgradedfrom

management and, more generally, to the different institutionbuildingcomponents, for
which there was a lack of vision to harness the resourcesneeded to achieve the objective.
This is illustratedby the failure to follow through on the recommendations of the
organizational audits of the key ministries and by the weak coordination between the
different project components, especially under the capacity buildingprogram, which
proved highly demanding on the administration.

4.30    FiscalReformSupport Credit. Therating of highly satisfactory is downgraded

determination in pursuingits tax reform agenda, but failed to show the same
determination in strengthening public resource management and in vigorously pursuing
policies toward poverty reduction.

 5.      Conclusions and Lessons

 5.1     The overall outcome of the PSD reformis a mixedpicture. On the one hand, the
 four projects assessed here have undoubtedly contributedto the opening of Mauritanian
 society and created a more favorable environment for the development of the private
 sector than was the case prior to 1995. A framework has been established. On the other
 hand, judged against the fundamental objectives of the reform, the impact i s still modest.
 There were three key medium- to long-term objectives: acceleration of PSD to reduce
 poverty, improvement in public resource management to bringmore efficiency and
 equity inresource use, and increased competitiveness to place Mauritania on a stronger
 footing on world markets. The effective application of the reforms i s still recent and it
 will take several years to bear fruit. However, as of end 2003, there are few signs of an
 impact on PSD, except inthe telecom sector, where the liberalization and privatization of
 the sector under the reform of the parapublic sector have given rise to the emergence of
 small entrepreneurs. This situation i s due to three main reasons.

 5.2     First, the lack of direct support for PSD. The liberalizationprocess andthe
different PSDoperations were not accompanied or followed by direct support to the
executive andjudiciary branches to help buildthe much needed regulatory frameworks,
strengthen private sector institutions, and to assist in the formulation of industrial norms
and standards, training, development of statistical tools, all prerequisites for the
emergence of well functioning markets. The limited impact of reforms on PSD and the
spread of the informal sector are largely attributable to the lack of progress in these areas.

5.3     Second, oligopolistic practices, despite the liberalization and adjustment
achievements over the past 15-20 years. Oligopolies dominate some of the major markets,
such as banks, transport, domestic trade, and impordexport, andbarriers to entry are
common. Inparticular, the relu,ctanceof the banks to extend investment resources beyond
members of the commercial groups to which they belong is major obstacle to PSD. In
recent years, inequality in incomes has increased, with the Gini coefficient rising from 33.8
percent in 1996 to 39 percent in2000. In such a climate, reforms are hardto translate into
actual benefits among the population at large, in terms of emergenceof new entrepreneurs,
creation of employment, increasein incomes, and lower prices. The issue of lack of
competition inMauritania i s a critical one deserving immediate attention.

5.4     Third, difficulties intranslating policy decisions into effective implementation.
This is illustratedfor instance by the delay inpreparing and issuingthe application
decrees of the revised legislation, with the result that, after several years, some of the old
legislation i s still being applied.

5.5     The relatively modest impact of the overall liberalization of the economy and of
the operations assessed here on broad PSD raises the issue of how to explain the good
performance of the economy over the 1990s as evidenced by the macro-economic
indicators (see section 2). It appears as a paradox. The adjustment policies undertaken
since the mid-1980s had undoubtedly a strong impact on the capacity of the influential
traditional trading groups to reinforce their dominant position in the economy, by
expanding and diversifying their activities. This point is illustrated by the fact that each

                                                      26


of these groups bought a commercial bank when the State-owned banks were sold inthe
late 1980sand early 1990s. This greatly facilitated their reach to other activities, but with
little trickling effect to the rest of the population.'

5.6       Considering the above remarks, could or should the Bank have done things
differently? Even though Bank performance i s rated satisfactory when judging each of
the four operations reviewed here, with hindsightand taking a longer perspective, that is,
the 1990decade, the Bank could have been more proactive in promoting a broader and
more equitable distribution of ownership and in developing private entrepreneurship.
When it became apparent that the privatization of banks had resulted in the creation of an
oligopoly little inclinedto term lending, the Bank should have addressedthe issue
through stronger conditionality in its operations and policy dialogue at the highest-level.
Similarly, after the two country strategies of the 1990shadnoted that there hadbeen little
supply side response to the late 1980s(SAL) and early 1990s(PESAP and AGSECAL)
adjustment operations, the Bank should have integrated better the lessons learned in its
later operations and dialogue. For instance, analytical work should have been launched
on the prerequisites for PSD and on competitiveness as complement and support for
stronger conditionality in the operations of the late 1990s.

Lessons

5.7      The following are lessons of general application.

     0   Inprograms or projects with aheavy agendaof legal and regulatory reforms, the
         conditionality should extend to the issuance of application decrees, and not only
         to the revision of laws. Also, the texts should be well adapted to local conditions,
         short, simple and clear. Inthose programs or projects, the Legal Department
         should be involved early on in preparation and design.

     e   Floating tranches are useful when the time requiredto complete a task or adopt a
         measure i s uncertain or dependent on the Legislative.

     0   One-tranche operations based solely on actions taken prior to appraisal do not
         allow monitoring of implementation.

    e    Tax and trade reforms can be effectively implementedif they are based on sound
         analytical work and careful preparation. In Mauritania's case, these reforms were
         basedon two high quality studies and, duringpreparation, their impact on
         reducingrevenues was taken into consideration. However, the analytical work
         should have taken the local traditions more into account.



 Inthis connection, it is worth noting that the downgrading of many performance indicators in the present
PPAR, compared to the evaluation summaries preparedby OED, is largely due to the fact that the latter
were solely based on the ICRs, which, in this case, clearly failed to reflect the reality on the ground.
