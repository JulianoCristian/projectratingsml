Operation Type       First in a series of two programmatic Development Policy Loans (DPLs)

Main Policy Areas         In line with priorities set by the Government, this First Programmatic
                          Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan
                          would support the implementation of reforms in three key areas: (a) budget
                          predictability and stability, (b) social security liability management, and (c)
                          disaster risk financing.
Key Outcome Indicators    (a) Improved budget predictability and stability:
                           The Central Government fiscal deficit is reduced to 3.2 percent of GDP
                              (Gross Domestic Product) in 2013.
                           Central Government non-oil tax revenue is increased to 12.5 percent of
                              GDP in 2013.
                           An annual evaluation report of the medium term debt management
                              strategy has been published by 2013.
                           90 percent of payments in the National Budget System are effectuated
                              through the Treasury Single Account (TSA) in 2013.
                          (b) Improved social security liability management:
                           Reimbursements to health insurance companies from FOSYGA for
                              medical services (procedures and medicines) outside the Mandatory
                              Benefit Package of the contributive regime do not exceed COP 2,400
                              billion by 2013 (recurrent expenditure).
                          (c) Improved disaster risk financing management:
                           The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has implemented three
                              financial instruments to mitigate natural disaster risks by 2013,
                              consistent with the recommendations of the national Disaster Risk
                              Financing Strategy.
Program Development       Enhanced fiscal sustainability and strengthened resilience of economic
Objective(s) and          growth. The programmatic DPL operation supports the long-term Country
Contribution to Country   Partnership Strategy (CPS) outcome of improved fiscal, financial, and
Partnership Strategy      social risk management under the ‘inclusive growth with enhanced
                          productivity’ CPS theme.
Risks and Risk            The proposed operation is subject to two types of risk: economic and
Mitigation                reform implementation. Commodity prices may fall, external financing
                          conditions could deteriorate and the global recovery may falter. Given the
                          high level of ambition of the fiscal reform agenda, there is a risk of slower
                          progress in politically contentious areas of the Government program.
                          However, in light of a favorable political economy context, the overall risk
                          classification is considered low.

                    IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
        FIRST PROGRAMMATIC FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND GROWTH
           RESILIENCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN TO COLOMBIA

                                      I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      The Government of Colombia has requested a First Programmatic Fiscal
Sustainability and Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan for US$300 million. The
DPL is the first of a series of two operations supporting the fiscal management program1 of
the Government of Colombia in the context of increased commodities production (oil and
mining), mounting long term social sector liabilities, and rising fiscal risks associated with
natural hazards. The request underscores the Government’s continued interest in engaging
with the World Bank to support its efforts in improving fiscal management.

2.      The reform program supported by the loan series seeks to enhance fiscal
sustainability and strengthen growth resilience. The program includes a series of measures
that can be grouped along three main policy reform areas: (a) improved budget predictability
and stability, (b) improved social security liability management, and (c) improved disaster
risk financing management. The introduction of a fiscal rule with a stabilization fund seeks to
reduce and limit the structural fiscal deficit. A tax reform aims to increase revenue collection
and improve the efficiency of the tax system. Both measures will improve budget
predictability and stability, which are the cornerstone for sound macroeconomic management
of an economy which is increasingly relying on commodities. The commodity bonanza
increases popular demand for government spending, particularly in the social sectors. A law
that reforms the health insurance system and related cost-controlling administrative measures
will improve the management of social security liabilities. A final set of measures are
expected to strengthen the management of disaster risk financing, including the
implementation of a national disaster financing strategy.

3.      The fiscal management program of the Santos Administration represents a
substantial effort in addressing Colombia’s fiscal challenges and merits the support of
the Bank. This document discusses the fiscal challenges that Colombia is facing to manage
the commodity boom, social security liabilities and the risks associated with natural hazards
(see Annex 1). These challenges, which are mainly structural in nature, have built up in
recent decades. As the Santos Administration came to office in August 2010, it outlined a
fiscal reform program. Some challenges will inevitably remain even after successful reform
implementation due to political economy constraints. Nonetheless the proposed fiscal
reforms represent substantial progress in tackling these challenges.

4.      The Bank is committed to a long-term engagement in support of the
Government’s fiscal management program. The proposed operation is fully consistent
with the Bank’s new business model in Colombia, which emphasizes a strategic and
integrated client engagement in support of selected development outcomes through three main
lines of business, including financial, knowledge and convening services. Specifically, Bank
support to the fiscal management program in multiple sectors contributes to ‘improved fiscal,

1
 The term ‘fiscal management program’ refers to the Program supported by this development policy operation,
as summarized in the policy matrix (Table 9) and as described in the Borrower’s Letter of Development Policy
(Annex 2). The Program is a subset of the government’s overall strategy.
                                                     6
financial and social risk management’ within the ‘inclusive growth with enhanced
productivity’ theme of the FY12-16 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).

5.     Bank engagement in Colombia on the fiscal management objectives supported by
this operation goes back more than a decade. The following examples are illustrative (see
Table 7 in Section IV for an overview):

(a) Budget predictability and stability.
     Tax and expenditure administration: The Bank has provided technical assistance to
       support reforms in revenue administration and public expenditure management
       through three technical assistance loans.
     Economic modeling: A Bank team is working to improve the Computable General
       Equilibrium Model of the National Planning Department to better account for
       increased commodities production and the implications of the new fiscal rule.
     Commodities management: The Bank shared the findings of the regional
       commodities flagship study with President Santos and his cabinet in August 2010.
     Debt management: To mitigate the exposure to interest rate risks, the Government
       and the Bank have collaborated to fix the interest rate on its IBRD portfolio.

(b) Social sector contingent liabilities.
     Health: The Bank is supporting civil society to develop a dialogue with the
       Constitutional Court on rights to health and is also working closely with universities.
     Pensions: The Bank has provided technical assistance to the National Planning
       Department and the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit in modeling the country’s
       pension liabilities.
     Contingent liability management: The Bank and the Government have carried out a
       review of the manuals for valuation and management of contingent liabilities.

(c) Disaster risk management (including financing).
     Post-disaster financing: Support on disaster risk financing has grown out of an
        increasingly maturing engagement on all aspects of disaster risk management that
        originated with the support in reconstruction financing after the 1999 earthquake.
        Ongoing projects finance inter alia the design of risk financing strategies.
     Ex-ante disaster risk financing: Colombia was one of the first countries to take a
        CAT DDO (Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option) DPL after this new product was
        launched by the Bank. This US$150 million loan provided Colombia with an
        immediate source of liquidity during the recent La Niña emergency.
     DRM knowledge and convening services: This includes a Country Disaster Risk
        Management Analysis, support to the design of the national disaster financing and a
        workshop on disaster risk financing.
     Agricultural risks: The Bank has organized a public-private sector dialogue on the
        development of the agriculture insurance market and is providing advice on the
        development of a sector-wide risk management strategy. An Agricultural Sector Risk
        Assessment is also being undertaken.

A. Economic Developments
6.     Prior to the global economic crisis, Colombia experienced a period of broad-
based and accelerating economic growth. GDP growth increased steadily from 2.5 percent
in 2002 to 6.9 percent in 2007, averaging 5.0 percent (compared to the regional average of 4.1
percent). An improved security situation and a favorable external environment were the
major driving factors. Supported by stronger confidence, the share of investment relative to
GDP rose from 17.3 to 23.0 percent in 2002-07, bringing the investment level from sub-par to
above the regional average. Rising commodity prices fueled export growth2, although the
economic expansion was mainly based on buoyant domestic demand led by the private sector.
Consumption and investment contributed roughly equally to economic growth and, on the
supply side, the growth process was relatively broad-based across economic sectors. Capital
inflows led to a reserve build up and a gradual appreciation of the Peso. Foreign direct
investment (FDI) gross inflows surged from US$2.2 billion in 2002 (2.2 percent of GDP) to
US$9.1 billion (4.4 percent of GDP) in 2007. In line with regional trends, Emerging Market
Bond Index spreads declined from about 600 to 160 basis points in 2001-07.

7.      Fiscal outcomes improved in 2002-07 as a result of policy discipline and
accelerating growth. The combined public sector deficit was reduced from 3.1 percent of
GDP in 2002 to balance in 2005, while staying below one percent of GDP in 2006-07. The
Government’s medium-term fiscal framework, introduced in 2003, guided fiscal
consolidation, achieved through higher tax revenues and restraint on current spending. An
appreciating local currency reduced the cost of servicing foreign-currency denominated debt.
These outcomes contributed to reduced public sector and external vulnerability and improved
debt sustainability. Total public debt declined from 47.0 percent of GDP in 2002 to 32.7
percent of GDP in 2007, while public foreign-currency denominated debt decreased from 25.3
percent of GDP to 13.7 percent over this period. Sound debt management reduced exposure
to exchange, interest rate and rollover risks. Growing domestic capital markets financed the
bulk of private investment and helped keep private external debt low.

8.      Colombia was not affected too severely by the global economic crisis. The
economy had already begun to slow down in early 2008, as monetary and fiscal policies were
tightened to address overheating. The global crisis produced a fall in investment which
declined from 23.4 to 22.7 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2009, while net FDI reduced
from 3.4 to 1.7 percent of GDP. Economic growth slowed down to 3.5 percent in 2008 and
1.5 percent in 2009, which compares well to the 1.7 percent contraction in regional GDP in
2009. Weak exports and worker’s remittances were more than offset by a fall in imports and,
as a result, the external current account deficit narrowed in 2009. The external deficit was
largely financed by foreign direct investment. The Peso depreciated sharply in the beginning
of 2009, but recovered quickly and was above pre-crisis levels by mid-2009. With only
moderate intervention, net international reserves remained broadly constant. Rollover rates of
private external debt only declined moderately and contingent reserves from the International

  Oil exports increased more than 250 percent in 2000-10, mainly as a result of higher prices (volumes started to
rise from 2008 onwards). Coal exports rose by 600 percent in this period as output doubled and prices tripled.

9.      Fiscal outcomes deteriorated in 2007-09 as a result of lower revenues and higher
spending. The combined public sector deficit increased by two percentage points of GDP to
2.7 percent of GDP in 2009 while public debt rose by 3½ percentage points to 36.3 percent of
GDP. On the revenue side, declining taxes resulting from the economic slowdown were
offset by rising oil-related revenues given favorable world market prices. Colombia did not
implement any specific fiscal stimulus package as in other countries. Public investment rose
in 2009, but largely as a result of capital spending by regional governments making up for
budget under-spending in 2008. Rising public spending in 2007-09 was therefore largely
explained by higher transfers to subnational governments and to the social security system
(health and pension).

10.     A strong macroeconomic framework helped cushion the impact of the external
shock. Monetary policy responded swiftly, as the policy rate was lowered by a total of 700
basis points to 3.0 percent in a series of steps from mid-2008 to mid-2010 in the context of
lower inflation and declining economic activity. Bank lending rates fell, but credit to the
private sector decelerated sharply (to about one percent growth at end-2009). Fiscal policy
also contributed to support demand through higher public consumption and investment.
Countercyclical policies were combined with a flexible exchange rate regime, which acted as
a shock absorber helping to counter the deceleration in external demand.

11.     An appropriate regulatory response contributed to financial sector resilience.
The largely domestically-owned and locally-financed financial system did not experience
major strains from the global financial turmoil. Colombian banks did not have complex off-
balance sheet financial instruments and had limited cross-border linkages. The corporate
sector’s strong balance sheets and the moderate levels of household debt also helped avoid
financial distress. Financial regulatory measures, some of which were supported by a
previous DPL3, contributed to financial sector resilience. At end-2008, banks reached
agreement with the Superintendent to retain a portion of their 2008 profits, thereby increasing
their capital adequacy ratio. In early 2009, the authorities raised the effective coverage of the
deposit insurance, improved risk-based deposit insurance premia, and introduced a new
liquidity risk management system. In July 2009, Congress approved a financial sector law
increasing the flexibility of pension fund portfolios and enhancing consumer protection. In
September 2009, counter-cyclical provisioning became more rules-based and bank-specific.
Finally, a law introducing International Financial Reporting Standards was approved.

12.     By 2010, the Colombian economy had largely recovered from the 2008-09
slowdown. Private domestic demand, supported by higher consumer and investor confidence
and access to cheap credit, led the recovery process. On the supply side the renewed
expansion was spear-headed by the mining and financial sectors, while manufacturing and
agriculture lagged behind. Economic growth increased by 4.3 percent in 2010 compared to
1.5 percent in 2009. However, the recovery in Colombia has been comparatively slow
relative to Latin America (6.1 percent growth) and other emerging markets (7.3 percent). A

disruption in the trade relations with the Boliviarian Republic of Venezuela (previously the
second largest export market) partly explains this.4 Exports to this country fell by around 70
percent in 2010, a situation that is estimated to have reduced the GDP growth rate by ½-1
percentage points. Finally, while the country was hard hit by heavy rains and landslides
owing to the La Niña effect towards the end of 2010, this does not appear to have
substantially dented the process of economic recovery, though it has had important fiscal and
social implications (see Box 1).

13.     The Colombian foreign-currency bond credit rating was recently upgraded to
investment grade by all three rating agencies for the first time since 1999. Standard and
Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch cited Colombia’s resilience against internal and external shocks
and favorable medium-term growth prospects as the main upgrade rationale. The ongoing
fiscal reforms which demonstrate Colombia’s commitment to cautious fiscal policies were
also instrumental.

14.     As the recovery phase consolidates, Colombia is facing economic policy dilemmas
similar to those experienced by other Latin American countries.5 On the one hand, the
authorities face the challenge of keeping inflation expectations anchored in the face of higher
economic activity and observed inflation. On the other hand, international capital flows are
exerting appreciation pressures on the Colombian Peso. As the economy went though the
recovery phase in 2009-10, the monetary authorities maintained the policy rate at a
stimulative 3 percent. This was feasible given modest inflation (within the 2-4 percent target
range) and a pace of economic expansion below full potential. Since end-February 2011,
however, the Central Bank has initiated a process of neutralizing the monetary stimulus by
raising the policy rate by 125 basis points on account of strong credit growth (about 20
percent) and increased economic activity. Higher interest rates, however, add to the rate
differential that is attracting short-term capital inflows and causing currency appreciation.
The Colombian Peso rose by about 6 percent in the first half of 2011.

15.      The Colombian Government has taken a range of different measures to
smoothen the currency appreciation. Colombia operates a flexible exchange rate policy
and the objective of interventions is to smoothen exchange rate adjustments towards its
fundamental equilibrium value. The key policy measure includes a Central Bank program to
purchase at least US$20 million per day. The program has been effective since mid-2010 and
it is due to expire in end-September 2011.6 To sterilize the excess liquidity, the Central Bank
is selling stocks of its Treasury Bills (TES) and the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit is
issuing short-term Bills.       In end-2010, the Government announced a package of
complementary measures: (a) to encourage imports, average import tariffs were lowered from
12.2 to 8.3 percent; (b) to discourage external borrowing by firms, a tax exemption on the
interest payments of foreign currency borrowing was eliminated, and; (c) to reduce dollar
inflows, the Government maintained dividends from Ecopetrol (US$1.5 billion) offshore.7
Finally, to avoid excesses in domestic financial markets, the authorities have also taken a

  The other important explanation is statistical: the modest negative impact on Colombia’s growth from the
global crisis (compared to other countries) implies a relatively lower rebound in growth during the recovery
phase.

  Colombia’s intervention, in percentage of GDP, is limited relative to other countries in Latin America.

  Recent announcements suggest that the Government may increasingly avoid monetization of dollar earnings.

range of macro-prudential measures, including: higher ceilings to foreign investment of
pension funds, counter-cyclical provisioning, tighter loan-loss provision, limits to net open
positions of financial institutions, and increases in reserve requirements.

16.     An expansionary fiscal stance in 2011 is mainly due to higher emergency
spending. The combined public sector deficit is projected to rise by about ½ percent of GDP
between 2010 and 2011, compared to a projected decline of ½ percent of GDP in LAC68
(Figure 1, panel a). Declining deficits throughout Latin America can be explained by the
gradual withdrawal of counter-cyclical stimulus as output gaps have become positive. The
fiscal adjustment path in Colombia is relatively slower on account of a still-negative output
gap. Moreover, extraordinary spending on humanitarian aid and reconstruction investment of
about 0.4 percent of GDP explains most of the rise in the fiscal deficit in 2011 (See Box 1).

17.      Colombia has ran a structural fiscal deficit in recent years, which became evident
in the overall balance as the economic cycle turned in 2009. The combined public sector
accounts posted near balance in 2005 and 2008 with small deficits in the intermediate years
(Figure 1, panel b). Fiscal outcomes, however, benefitted from above-potential growth in
2006-07 and record oil prices in 2008. The combined public sector structural balance 9,
meanwhile, moved from balance in 2005 to a deficit of 2.0 percent of GDP in 2008. In 2009,
as the economy decelerated and oil prices fell, this structural fiscal imbalance surfaced in the
(unadjusted) overall combined public sector deficit, which declined substantially from 0.1 to
2.7 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2009. Transfers to social security (pensions and
health) and to subnationals, rising from 6.6 to 8.1 percent of GDP in 2005-10, are an
important reason for the structural fiscal imbalance. A new fiscal rule, which forms part of
the Government’s fiscal management program, sets targets for reducing the structural fiscal
deficit in the medium term, as discussed in detail in Section III.

18.     Expenditure rigidities constitute an important challenge in fiscal adjustment.
Estimates suggest that up to 86.2 percent of the expenditures in the general government
budget are rigid or inflexible as a result of legal or constitutional commitments which pre-
assign spending or earmark government revenues to specific purposes.10 This reduces the
ability of the Government to implement fiscal adjustments or to reallocate public spending
towards its priority areas. Aside from interest payments on public debt (27 percent of total
spending) and the public payroll (10 percent), budget rigidities owe primarily to transfers to
subnational entities (16 percent), pension spending (15 percent), and future infrastructure
spending commitments (9 percent). Finally, fiscal commitments to long-term infrastructure
projects have risen from 2 to 9 percent of total spending over the past decade.

                Box 1. The Impact of La Niña and the Government’s Response
At the end of 2010, Colombia experienced some of the heaviest and prolonged rainfall in recent history
leading to widespread flooding and landslides. The rains, which peaked in November and December 2010 and
re-emerged in April/May 2011, are attributed to the meteorological phenomenon known as La Niña. Almost three
million people have been directly affected through losing their home or being seriously deprived from most
essential public services. Damages include the destruction of 341,000 homes, 813 schools, 15 health centers, and
flooding of 15 percent of arable land while up to 44 main roads had to be shut down.

The Government’s response was swift, but eventually faced legal challenges. The Santos Administration
declared a 30-day State of Emergency on December 7, 2010, which was extended for an additional 30 days on
January 7, 2011. During this period, the Administration enacted more than 40 Presidential Decrees that aimed to
deal with the emergency. The policy measures included: (a) the option of selling up to an additional ten percent of
the Government’s stake in Ecopetrol (from a stake of about 90 percent) to finance post-disaster reconstruction
projects, (b) an increase in the rate and base of the wealth tax for individuals and firms, (c) the creation of a semi-
autonomous Adaptation Fund to manage the reconstruction effort. Some emergency decrees were eventually
declared invalid by the Constitutional Court. In particular, the Court ruled against the 30 day extension of the
emergency and about a dozen individual decrees on the grounds that they did not comply with the requirements
and procedures outlined in the Constitution and the law for their enactment. Measure (a) is therefore currently
awaiting Congressional presentation while (b) and (c) were reviewed and ruled constitutional by the Court.

The fiscal response was rapid and based on sound principles. Ex-ante financing was available through reserve
funds and a DPL with Catastrophic Deferred Draw Option with the World Bank (US$150 million), which covered
part of the immediate liquidity needs. The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit defined a four year financing
plan (Table 2) announced just one month after the declaration of emergency, which is much faster than what is
typically observed in other developing countries. Recurrent spending (such as humanitarian assistance) is financed
by recurrent revenue sources, while capital spending will be financed through sale of public assets. No additional
borrowing is expected. The impact of the emergency on the central government fiscal deficit is estimated at 0.2
percent of GDP in 2010 and 0.4 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012. The emergency spending plan has been
incorporated in the projections presented in Table 1, using a more conservative estimate than what is presented in
Table 2 in light of expected capacity constraints in reconstruction project execution.

The growth impact of the disaster was modest and inflationary pressures proved temporary, but the poor
were negatively affected. GDP data for the final quarter of 2010 do not suggest a substantial short-term economic
impact, though this may emerge in subsequent quarters (leading indicators suggest a decline in industrial
production and construction). Agricultural output, which was expected to be negatively affected, actually
increased by 4.2 percent on account of strong coffee output. The inflationary impact of the emergency became
apparent since December 2010, but food price inflation has since declined gradually. The majority of the 3 million
people affected by the crisis are likely to be poor. Some of these people have lost physical and productive assets
without having recourse to an insurance mechanism. Agricultural workers were temporarily laid off, leading to
important losses of income. Workers whose livelihoods depend on now dysfunctional infrastructure are
experiencing similar effects. Relocated families are unlikely to be economically productive in their temporary
location and are now primarily dependent on government cash and in-kind support.

B. Poverty and Social Outcomes
19.     Economic growth in recent years has been accompanied by poverty reduction.
Between 2002 and 2009 poverty fell from 53.7 to 45.5 percent, while the proportion of the
population that could not satisfy basic nutritional needs (the extreme poor) declined from 19.7
to 16.4 percent (Table 3 refers). While this is a positive development, Colombia’s progress in
reducing poverty given its economic performance since 2002 falls below that of regional
peers. Moreover, poverty levels remain relatively high given the country’s income per capita.
In part, this is explained by an unequal distribution of income, as reflected by the Gini
coefficient, which is among the ten highest in the world. Food prices are also relatively
higher in Colombia, as a result of high cost of transport related to limited competition in the
transport sector and lack of alternatives to road transport given a difficult topology.

20.     Despite high income inequality, there is evidence of an improvement in the
equality of opportunities. The World Bank Human Opportunity Index, which captures
access to basic services for children while adjusting for the fairness in its distribution among
the population, places Colombia above the regional average. Encouragingly, between 1997
and 2008, there has been significant progress in terms of improving children’s opportunities
to receiving health care, attending preschool, completing middle and high school, and having
access to electricity and telephones. While significant challenges remain (in terms of food
security, nutrition, education and health quality, access to water and victimization),
improvements in the equality of opportunities of children may eventually translate into better
inequality and poverty outcomes for the next generation of Colombians.11

C. Macroeconomic Outlook
21.     Colombia has a robust macroeconomic framework, which rests on three
mutually re-enforcing pillars: (a) a responsible fiscal policy based on a credible medium-
term fiscal framework, supported by the introduction of a new fiscal rule, (b) a monetary
policy based on an inflation targeting regime complemented by a floating exchange rate with
moderate interventions, and (c) sound macro and micro prudential policies combined with a
solid financial system. This framework provides a solid basis for the country’s future
economic prospects. In the short to medium term, aggregate demand are likely to be boosted
by consumer and investor confidence, the government reconstruction program, as well as
rising commodity exports.

                   Box 2. The impact of Higher Food and Commodity Prices in Colombia
As a net exporter of food, Colombia can reap benefits from higher agricultural prices. In 2010, the country
exported around US$5.7 billion (14 percent of total goods exports) of agricultural products and processed food
and showed a food trade surplus of US$1.9 billion (0.7 percent of GDP). The main export product is coffee
(US$2.2 billion), followed by vegetables and fruits (US$860 million) and sugar (US$674 million). In spite of
the commodity boom, Colombian agricultural exports have lost global market share, declining from an average
0.68 in the period 1995-1999 to 0.55 in 2000-2009. Nonetheless, Colombia has a great potential to expand
agricultural production and exports and the Government is taking measures to increase productivity.

In contrast with global trends, food price inflation in Colombia is declining. Food price inflation fell from
4.8 percent to 3.6 percent between January and May 2011. As of May 2011, food inflation contributed by 1.0
percentage points to the overall rate of 3.0 percent (the weight of food items in the Consumer Price Inflation
index is 28.2 percent). This trend is consistent with IMF (2011) estimates of the pass-through from world to
domestic food prices. Colombia has the lowest estimated pass-through among major Latin American economies
(about 0.1), which is not statistically significant. Local food prices could, however, increase in the future since
the impact of the last global food price shock in 2008 appeared with a time lag (see Figure 2, panel a). Given
that poor people devote a higher share of their household budgets to food, they experience a higher rate of
inflation than the rest of the population when food prices rise. In May 2011, annual inflation of low income
groups was 41 percent higher than high income groups and 8 percent higher than the middle income group.

Colombia is a net exporter of oil, coal, gas, and metals, and experiences benefits as well as challenges of
higher prices. In 2010, export of these commodities reached US$25.6 billion and contributed by 63 percent to
total goods exports and by 73 percent of foreign direct investment (US$4.9 billion). Commodities also
contribute by about 12 percent to total fiscal revenues. Higher commodity prices increase export and fiscal
revenues thereby improving both the external current account and fiscal balances. On the other hand, higher
foreign exchange inflows add to appreciation pressures, which potentially undermines the competitiveness of
non-commodity exports. Colombia can also not escape the negative impact of higher oil prices on the global
economic recovery, and is particularly sensitive to developments in the US – its largest trading partner. Recent
measures taken by the government to manage commodity revenues, such as the introduction of stabilization
funds at the national and subnational levels, are supported by this operation and discussed in Section III.

The inflationary impact of higher global oil prices is modest owing to government intervention, but local
fuel prices are likely to increase in the future to ensure fiscal balance. In 2008, the Government abolished
direct fuel price subsidies and introduced a Fuel Price Stabilization Fund, which works on the following basis.
During periods of low global prices, local pump prices are kept relatively higher and this gives rise to savings.
In spells of high oil prices, local prices are raised, but not fully, with the difference paid for by drawing down the
savings of the Fund. Given this mechanism, local transport prices have only followed the rise in global crude oil
prices to some extent in recent months (see Figure 2, panel b). Econometric estimates of the pass-through
suggest that it is the lowest in the region (after Mexico) at about 0.175 and statistically significant, according to
the IMF (2011). While the mechanism may work well in theory, the timing of its implementation gave rise to
only a limited period of relatively low world prices and savings accumulation followed by a period of high
prices. As a result, the Fund recently exhausted its savings in end-2010 and registered a deficit of COP950
billion or US$530 million in end-April 2011. To avoid fiscal imbalances, further local price increases would
thus be necessary.
                                                                                                               16
22.     However, Colombia is not immune to economic shocks and some external
vulnerabilities persist. Despite solid fundamentals, Colombia’s near-term macroeconomic
outlook could be adversely affected if commodity prices fall, external financing conditions
deteriorate or the global recovery falters. (These risks are explained in more detail in Section
VI). A two-year Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangement for 500 percent of quota (US$6.2
billion) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved in May 2011 would provide
Colombia with reasonable cover in an adverse external scenario. In addition, as an attractive
investment destination, Colombia may experience large short term capital inflows that could
lead to exchange rate over-shooting and inflate asset bubbles.12 The authorities are managing
these risks through a tighter monetary policy to control credit growth, foreign exchange
interventions to facilitate a smoother exchange rate adjustment path and dynamic provisioning
rules for banks.

23.     The projections described below focus on the short and medium-term outlook.
They incorporate the expected impacts of the 2010 La Niña episode, the Government
reconstruction program (see Box 1), recent tax and tariff reforms (Table 5), the latest
prospects for the global economy, including higher commodity prices (see Box 2), as well as
recent Central Bank monetary and exchange rate policy announcements. The baseline
projections are summarized as follows:

    Growth and inflation. Given the ongoing economic recovery, real GDP is expected to
     expand by 4.6 percent in 2011 and converge to 4.5 percent in the medium term. Private
     consumption and private and public investment are expected to sustain domestic demand
     growth in the short run. Inflation will stay on target (3 percent) over the projection period,
     but will be slightly higher in 2011, as explained in Box 2.

    Fiscal accounts. The Central Government fiscal deficit is projected to decline from 3.9
     percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.3 percent in 2014 – an adjustment of about 1½ percentage
     points of GDP. The fiscal adjustment will take place through a combination of enhanced
     revenues and reduced expenditures. On the revenue side, the adjustment arises from tax
     reform measures (supported by the DPL and discussed later). On the spending side, the
     adjustment will mainly take place in the form of reduced recurrent transfers while
     accommodating higher investment spending. These adjustments will enable the
     Government to meet its target for the central government structural deficit of 2.3 percent
     of GDP by 2014, stipulated in the fiscal rule. In light of Colombia’s solid track record of
     fiscal management, the authorities are expected to take the necessary corrective policy
     measures needed to meet their commitment under the fiscal rule.

    External accounts. The external current account deficit widened during the 2010-11
     recovery as imports accelerated and factor income outflows increased. In the medium
     term, the external deficit will narrow again as imports moderate and commodity exports
     continue to benefit from solid international prices and higher volumes. The deficit is
     largely financed by net foreign direct investment.

   The price index of new residential properties in Colombia rose by 9.25 percent in 2010, while prices of
existing properties rose 6.1 percent, according to data from the Central Bank.
                                                   17
D. Debt Sustainability

24.     A Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that the trajectory of public debt
is declining in the baseline scenario. The DSA was prepared by IMF staff in May 2011 in
the context of FCL renewal, and is consistent with the macroeconomic assumptions outlined
in Table 1 (see Annex 4 for details). In the baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to decline from 36.7 percent in 2010 to 33.7 percent in 2015 (of the Combined
Public Sector, net). Given the large share of central government debt on fixed-terms and in
local currency, interest rate and exchange rate shocks have a modest impact on the debt
trajectory. The debt outlook is also not severely affected by shocks to economic growth or the
primary balance. Contingent fiscal liabilities represent the single most important risk to debt
sustainability, although the simulated shock of a ten percent of GDP increase does not alter
the declining debt trajectory. In sum, public debt sustainability is not a major concern in the
medium term.

25.     In summary, Colombia’s macroeconomic policy framework is deemed adequate.
Medium-term fiscal policy remains prudent, in part as a result of policy reforms supported by
this operation, with proposed fiscal adjustments starting from 2012. Monetary and exchange
rate policies are also supportive of macroeconomic and financial stability.

           III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S FISCAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

26.    President Santos assumed office in August 2010 with a strong political mandate
that gave his National Unity coalition a clear majority in Congress. Juan Manuel Santos
won the second round of the Presidential poll by more than seventy percent of the vote. The
National Unity coalition, which he heads, controls about eighty percent of the seats in
Congress. President Santos campaigned on a continuation of former President Alvaro Uribe’s
democratic security and economic policies. The elections demonstrated the maturity of
Colombia’s democratic process and reflect a strengthening of political institutions.

27.     The Santos Administration registered several significant achievements early on
in the first term. This includes the restoration of diplomatic and trade relationships with the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which had been broken off shortly before the second round
of the Presidential elections in July 2010. Relationships were also fully normalized with
Ecuador. Finally, an agreement with the United States increases the likelihood that the
bilateral Free Trade Agreement negotiated in 2008 will eventually be implemented. Overall,
these positive developments have helped boost the approval ratings of the President and
strengthened the national unity coalition.

28.     On the basis of a strong electoral mandate and congressional majority, the Santos
Administration has launched an ambitious reform program. To consolidate the fiscal
stance and manage windfalls from commodities production, Congress has approved a new
fiscal rule, a reform of the royalties system, and a proposal to make fiscal sustainability a
Constitutional criterion. To enhance revenues and improve competitiveness, tax exemptions
were reduced, loopholes closed, and import tariffs lowered. Legislation has been passed to
reduce informality and encourage youth employment. A new legal framework is being
introduced to improve the performance of the health system, including the enactment of an
                                              18
ordinary Health Law in 2011. Finally, to compensate victims who have been harmed by
actions occurring as a result of conflict, a Law (Ley de Victimas) is pending President Santos'
approval.

Colombia’s Fiscal Challenges

29.     The fiscal management program, which forms a core part of the Santos
Administration’s reform agenda, aims to tackle the country’s major fiscal challenges.
Colombia has made good progress on the fiscal front over the past decade, as illustrated by
the decline in public debt, but important challenges remain. These challenges can be divided
into three main areas: (a) budget predictability and stability, (b) management of social
security liabilities, and (c) disaster risk financing. Each of these challenges are discussed
briefly below. For a detailed analysis and discussion please refer to Annex 1.

      Budget predictability and stability. Increased economic and fiscal reliance on
       commodities production (oil, coal, gas and metals) raises macro-fiscal policy concerns
       at both national and subnational levels, including budget volatility, currency
       appreciation, and other related Dutch Disease effects. The associated rise in royalties
       payments also raises policy questions of how best to transform natural resources
       wealth into development progress that could benefit a broader segment of the
       population.
      Management of social security liabilities. The commodity bonanza is likely to
       increase popular demand for social spending. Existing social security obligations,
       however, already constitute substantial long-term fiscal challenges for Colombia.
       Health care costs have risen owing to a strong expansion in subsidized coverage, rapid
       growth of services provided outside the Mandatory Benefit Package, and a policy to
       harmonize the Mandatory Benefit Package for all individuals. Meanwhile, pressures
       on the pension system arise from demographic change, migration of members from the
       defined contribution to the defined benefit system, and low coverage owing to high
       labor informality.
      Disaster risk financing. A final set of challenges relate to the economic and fiscal
       costs of natural hazards, which are on the rise. The recent La Niña emergency clearly
       illustrate the fiscal risks involved owing to the losses to public assets, including
       infrastructure, and the need to compensate the vulnerable population.

30.    The fiscal management program is supported by the Bank through a multi-
sectoral, programmatic package of financial, convening and knowledge services. Table 4
provides an overview of the key fiscal issues in Colombia. This includes an identification of
the source of fiscal pressures and their magnitude. The table also shows the set of policies
implemented by the Government to address them and how the Bank is supporting the reform
agenda through different types of services, including the DPL series.

A. Budget Predictability and Stability
31.     The government is taking measures to improve budget predictability and
stability. The introduction of a fiscal rule with a stabilization fund seeks to reduce and limit
the structural fiscal deficit. A tax reform increases revenue collection and improves the
efficiency of the tax system.13

Fiscal Rule

Prior action for DPL I: The Borrower has presented to Congress, for approval thereby, the
Fiscal Rule Bill of Law. Indicative trigger for DPL II: The Borrower’s Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit has issued the implementing regulations of the fiscal rule.

32.     Policy challenges associated with commodities production can be effectively
addressed through fiscal rules, stabilization funds and a flexible exchange rate policy,
according to the World Bank’s regional flagship study (2010). These policy instruments help
to enhance budget predictability and stability in countries that are economically and fiscally
dependent on natural resources production (see Annex 1). Colombia is the fourth largest oil
producer in Latin America (0.8 million barrels per day), is among the top ten in global coal
production (90 million tons annually) and the Government is expecting an increase in oil and
coal production of about 75 percent over the next decade (see Figure 1, panels c and d).
Fiscal revenues related to commodity production, which also include gas, nickel and precious
metals, may increase from about 1 to about 2 percent of GDP in this period. While
Colombia’s economic and fiscal dependency on commodities is moderate, the Government is
nonetheless determined to manage these resources prudently. In September 2010, the
incoming Santos Administration presented a fiscal rule bill of law to Congress. The bill
draws upon a technical proposal developed jointly by the Central Bank, the Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit, and the National Planning Department (2010). The Bill of Law
was approved by Congress on June 14, 2011.

33.     The new fiscal rule aims to ensure fiscal discipline, facilitate a counter-cyclical
fiscal policy, and improve the management of commodity revenues. The initiative can be
summarized as follows: The government is targeting a central government structural deficit
of 1.0 percent of GDP by 2022, including interim targets of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2014 and
1.9 percent of GDP in 2018.14 The structural deficit, in turn, equals the overall deficit
adjusted for economic, commodity cycles and extraordinary items. Counter-cyclical fiscal
stimulus is permitted if the projected growth rate falls at least two percentage points below the
long-term growth rate. The bill also sets up a Macroeconomic and Fiscal Savings and
Stabilization Fund to reduce the budgetary and macroeconomic impact of commodity cycles.
Exemption clauses apply such that the Government can temporarily deviate from the rule in



13
   In addition to these measures, Congress has also approved two constitutional amendments. The first measure
proposes the introduction of fiscal sustainability as a criterion under the Constitution. In practice, for example,
this will require judicial rulings to explicitly consider their fiscal implications, thus helping to underpin the fiscal
consolidation sought by the Government. The second measure is a reform of the royalties system to ensure more
equitable access to royalties resources by all municipalities and departments in Colombia. See Annex 1 for more
details.
14
   Note that this implies that targets are aligned with the political cycle.
                                                          21
exceptional circumstances.15 Finally, an independent consultative technical committee will be
established. These elements are discussed in more detail below.

34.      The Rule targets the central government balance as it is the major contributor to
the deficit and debt accumulation of the nonfinancial public sector. To illustrate, eighty-
seven percent of the combined public sector debt stock arises from the central government.
Similarly, the combined public sector deficit is essentially the result of a deficit on the central
government accounts, as the rest of the public sector has historically registered a fiscal
surplus. It should be noted that the IMF, in its 2010 Article IV consultation, had
recommended a more comprehensive concept of the public sector, which also included
decentralized agencies, state owned enterprises and subnational entities. While the
municipalities and departments already have a set of rules which constrain fiscal excesses 16,
this is not the case for decentralized agencies. The Government, on the other hand, preferred
a measure of the public sector deficit over which it has the largest degree of control.

35.      The Government opted for an overall balance target rather than focusing on a
primary balance target. The latter had been recommended in the Government technical
proposal. In theory, a primary balance target (which excludes interest payments on public
debt) is better controlled by the fiscal authorities given that interest payments can be subject
to exogenous exchange and interest rate fluctuations. In practice, the fact that 92 percent of
central government debt is on fixed interest terms and three-quarters in local currency reduces
this risk substantially.

36.     Most of the fiscal adjustment is programmed to take place in 2012. The Ministry
of Finance and Public Credit, in its Economic and Fiscal Strategy 2010-14, has outlined how
it intends to meet the 2014 target for the structural fiscal deficit. This strategy has been fully
incorporated into the macroeconomic projections presented in Table 1 (for details see
paragraph 23). The announcement of the proposed adjustment path is prudent as it reduces
speculation that the Government would postpone the fiscal adjustment until later in the
transition period, with the associated risk of ultimately not being able to meet the target.

37.     The fiscal rule facilitates counter-cyclical fiscal policy, in part through the use of
a stabilization fund. The draft law stipulates that the government can introduce a fiscal
stimulus when the projected real GDP growth rate falls below the long-term economic growth
rate by at least two percentage points and when an output gap is simultaneously projected.
The counter-cyclical spending cannot exceed 20 percent of the output gap and the additional
spending must be phased out after a period of two years. The mechanism is asymmetric in the
sense that above-potential growth would not trigger corresponding expenditure cuts.

38.     The Macroeconomic and Fiscal Savings and Stabilization Fund will be the main
instrument to smoothen out the fiscal impact of the economic and commodity cycles.
During times of high economic growth and favorable commodity prices, this fund will
accumulate windfall fiscal revenues. Resources will be accumulated when there is an overall
fiscal surplus of the Central Government or in case of voluntary contributions made by the

15
   If the Government declares a state of emergency or if the fiscal advisory committee (CONFIS) considers it
advisable in the case of a shock to macroeconomic stability.
16
   Law 358 of 1997 (the traffic lights law) introduced debt limits for subnational entities. Law 617 of 2000 (on
subnational fiscal responsibility) sets limits on the growth of recurrent spending. See Liu and Webb (2011).
                                                      22
Government (and the financial returns of these). These funds can then be spent when
economic growth is sluggish and/or commodity revenues low as an additional counter-
cyclical fiscal stimulus (up to 10 percent of the total balance in any given year).
Alternatively, the Government can use accumulated funds to reduce public debt, though the
rule does not specify a target for the level of public debt. The Fund will be administrated by
the Central Bank.

39.     A technical committee of independent experts, appointed by the Government,
will monitor the implementation of the fiscal rule. The committee consists of the Deans of
the Economics Faculties of different national universities, other technical experts and the
Presidents of the Economic Commission of Congress. The Government will define the
mechanism for selection of committee members as well as its functioning. The methodology,
estimation and definition of key variables will be made public. The committee can issue
statements related to Government compliance with the rule and a range of related topics
(definitions, methodologies, exceptional deviations from the rule etc.), although these
statements are non-binding. It can also issue comments on the detailed annual compliance
report that the Government must produce.

40.     In sum, the new fiscal rule represents an important step forward in terms of
supporting budget stability and predictability. The rule ensures fiscal discipline, facilitates
a counter-cyclical policy and improves the management of commodity revenues. It follows
international best practice by focusing on a structural deficit target, although the rule could
have been even stronger by applying a more comprehensive coverage of the public sector.

41.     Next steps: Implementing regulation currently being drafted by the Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit will clarify several aspects of the proposal. The law is written
in a relatively broad language leaving aside several key details for implementing regulation.
The unknowns include the exact definitions of: (a) the structural fiscal balance, (b) potential
output, and (c) long-term output.

42.     Pending challenges: Strengthening fiscal institutions beyond the fiscal rule is a
critical priority. The proposed fiscal rule framework is an important step in the right
direction, as it ensures medium-term fiscal sustainability and creates space for countercyclical
responses in bad times. Going forward, the authorities would also need to focus more on the
accompanying public financial management reforms that are needed to make the rule work in
practice. These include, in particular, the need to integrate the medium-term fiscal framework
in the budget process, enhance budget classification and reporting, and strengthen budget
preparation procedures. Dealing adequately with these topics in the implementing regulations
would be key to the performance of the fiscal framework.

Tax Reform

Prior action for DPL I: The Borrower has: (i) promulgated Law No. 1430, dated December
29, 2010 which, inter alia, reduced tax exemptions, closed tax loopholes and phased-out the
Borrower’s financial transaction tax; and (ii) issued Presidential Decree No. 4825, dated
December 29, 2010 which, inter alia, increased the rate and the base of the wealth tax.
Indicative trigger for DPL II: The Borrower’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has
issued the implementing regulation of Law 1430.

43.      The Government has introduced a tax reform which aims to raise the revenue-to-
GDP ratio and improves the efficiency of the tax system. Law 1430 and Decree 4825 are
expected to result in a permanent increase in the tax revenue of an average of 0.6 percent of
GDP per year in 2011-14 relative to the 2010 baseline (see Table 5), according to
Government estimates. The tax reform supports the objective of budget predictability and
stability by establishing a clear medium-term time path for individual tax rates.17 The major
elements of the tax reform include: (a) the elimination of the tax credit for investment in fixed
assets of firms, (b) closing of loopholes of the financial transactions tax, (c) a gradual phase-
out of the financial transaction tax, (d) a reduction of the energy surcharge levied on firms,
and (e) an increase in the base and rate of the wealth tax. 18

conservative estimate. *Others: See description in text. +Relative to the 2010 baseline.

44.     A tax credit linked to fixed capital investments by firms has been eliminated.
This measure, which enhances the tax base, is expected to raise the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio
by 0.5 percent per year starting in 2012 (effective from 2011 with a one year lagged impact).
Between 2004 and 2010, firms were allowed to deduct 30 percent of the value of their fixed
capital investments from their income tax (40 percent in 2008-09). The tax exemption for
capital investment had been introduced by the Uribe Administration to encourage investment
and was particularly benefitting capital-intensive sectors, such as mining. As previously

17
   For instance, the financial transaction tax will be gradually eliminated in 2014-18 and the surcharge on the
wealth tax is only effective in 2011-14.
18
   At the time of loan preparation, there was a legal dispute over the year in which Law 1430 would enter into
effect. The Law was submitted to the Gazette on December 29, 2010, but published on January 4, 2011. Table 5
assumes that the Law will be effective from January 1st, 2011. Given the conservative estimates of the tax
reform in the fiscal projections of Table 1 this issue does not affect the medium-term fiscal outlook.
                                                      24
mentioned, Colombia’s investment rate increased impressively in the 2000s. However, as
demonstrated in a rigorous econometric analysis by Galindo and Mendez (2010), the strong
growth in investment is unlikely to be linked to the capital investment tax incentive.19 The tax
incentive also featured prominently in labor market policy debates in Colombia, with some
observers arguing that it promoted a pattern of capital-intensive economic development and
introduced a bias against employment generation.20 These arguments, along with the
objective of broadening the tax base, played a role in the Government’s decision to eliminate
the tax credit.

45.     The tax collection efficiency of the financial transaction tax is expected to
improve through the closure of loopholes in existing legislation. This change is expected
to raise tax revenues an additional 0.1 percent of GDP in 2011-14. The financial transaction
tax is levied on all the bank transactions of firms and individuals. The tax was first
introduced in 1998. Since 2003, the tax rate has been 0.4 percent of the nominal transaction
amount. The effectiveness of tax collection decreased substantially in recent years, as
reflected by the revenue-to-GDP ratio which fell from 0.75 percent in 2004 to 0.63 percent in
2010. This is largely explained by a change in the behavior of economic agents, who
increasingly resorted to transaction methods which are not liable to taxation (including
payments outside the regular banking system and cash payments). Law 1430 effectively
eliminates these loopholes by also levying the tax on transactions such as: (a) third-party
payments through principal, settlor, or constituent; (b) transactions effectuated through the
financial markets, including guarantees, and; (c) credit disbursements.

46.     The financial transactions tax will be phased out gradually from 2014 to 2018.
The current rate of 0.4 percent will be reduced to 0.2 percent in 2014-15, 0.1 percent in 2016-
17 and zero in 2018 onwards. This clearly defined path supports the goal of budget
predictability. The rationale for eliminating this tax is related to its distortionary impact on
financial intermediation and credit expansion with an associated negative impact on economic
growth. Moreover, the tax tends to penalize small firms and low-income households who
have limited ways of avoidance (see Perry, 2010). The loss of revenue is substantial (0.6
percent of GDP) and the Government is working to identify alternative sources of revenues to
replace the tax. The Administration had originally planned to phase-out the tax starting in
2012. However, as a result of the La Niña disaster, it decided to postpone this decision until
2014. Moreover, it temporarily introduced ear-marking of 25 percent the recurrent revenues
from the wealth tax in 2012 and 2013 to finance recurrent spending related to disaster relief
(through the Calamity Fund).

47.    The energy surcharge for manufacturing has been eliminated. In a move to
reduce the production costs for the manufacturing sector, the Government has eliminated the
20 percent surcharge on electricity costs to industrial facilities. The measure is intended to
improve competitiveness of manufacturing firms in the context of the strong appreciation of




19
   The improved security situation is the most important explanatory factor behind higher investment (see
Fedesarollo and IDB, 2009)
20
   Botetro and Cavallo (2010), for instance, propose to change the relative price of capital and labor in favor of
the latter by eliminating the capital investment tax credit to finance a payroll tax credit.
                                                       25
the local currency.21 Colombia operates a system of cross-subsidies in the electricity sector
where the energy bill for low-income households is subsidized by high-income households,
manufacturing facilities and retail vendors.22 However, total subsidies exceed contributions,
and the difference is currently covered by the Central Government budget. Since more than
half of the contributions (54 percent) were made by the now exempt manufacturing industry,
an additional fiscal cost of the reform arises of 0.1 percent of GDP per year starting in 2013.

48.     A series of other adjustments in the tax code also have a positive short-term
revenue impact. This includes: (a) taxation on interest payments on private external debt to
harmonize with tax rules on private domestic debt, (b) elimination of tax exemption on
intermediary services in the oil and mining sector, (c) retention of one percent of oil and
mining revenues, (d) various measures promoting a more efficient Value Added Tax (VAT)
collection. These measures will raise tax revenues by 0.2 percent of GDP in 2011 and 0.1
percent in 2012-13.

49.     The base and rate of the wealth tax for individuals and firms have been
increased. Presidential Decree 4825 of December 29, 2010, introduces the wealth tax for
amounts lower than COP3,000 million and imposes a temporary 25 percent surcharge for
amounts higher than COP3,000 million for the 2011-14 period. Table 6 summarizes the
change in rates as a result. As discussed elsewhere, the revenue generated from this change
(0.1 percent of GDP, annually) will be used to finance recurrent spending in the wake of the
end-2010 heavy rains. The tax is only levied on wealthy individuals and firms, thus the
distributional implications are expected to be positive.

50.     Next steps: The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit is working to implement the
regulations of Law 1430. The Revenue Authority (DIAN) is also working closely with the
IMF and the World Bank on improving tax administration.

51.     Pending challenges: Further efforts are required to raise revenue collection. The
revenue-to-GDP ratio in Colombia remains low relative to peers, in part, because of a
relatively narrow and volatile tax base. The tax revenue foregone as a result of exemptions
increased from 0.7 to 1.4 percent of GDP between 2003 and 2008. Examples of tax
exemptions include a large number of differential value added tax rates (including zero rates
for many products) and tax exempt free trade zones. Moreover, only a small proportion of
individuals are subject to income taxation owing to a relatively high threshold for income


21
   Using firm level data, Mejia (2011) estimates that a 20 percent reduction in the price of electricity would
increase the growth rate of manufacturing productivity (which usually fluctuates between -2 and 2 percent) by
0.44 percent.
22
   The population is divided into six strata with 6 being the wealthiest and 1 the poorest. Strata 5 and 6 cross-
subsidize strata 1-3, while stratum 4 is neutral.

taxation in Colombia compared with other Latin American countries.23 The reforms being
implemented by the authorities represent important progress in expanding the tax base, but
further initiatives to remove tax exemptions and areas of under-taxation would be important.
The tax system is also complex to administer and prone to tax avoidance, so additional steps
of simplification are needed. A more selective approach to tax audits based on risk
assessments and enhanced taxpayers services are also important for Colombia as it
modernizes its revenue administration. The objective should be increase the non-oil tax ratio
over the medium-term based on efficiency gains on income and consumption taxes.

Efficient Debt and Cash Management

Indicative trigger for DPL II: The Borrower’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has
published a medium-term debt management strategy. Indicative trigger for DPL II: The
Borrower’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has taken steps to increase the coverage of
the Treasury Single Account, including: (i) issuance of the implementing regulations of
Article 225 of the National Development Plan Law; and (ii) design and implementation of the
associated information system.

52.     In addition to the actions described above to improve budget predictability and
stability, the Government is planning measures to make debt and cash management
more efficient. Specifically, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit is planning to
implement a Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy and a Treasury Single Account
(TSA). These reforms constitute indicative triggers for the second lending operation and are
briefly discussed below.

53.      Colombia generally exhibits good debt management practices, but the challenge
is to formalize and institutionalize these practices. The government has actively sought to
reduce the share of foreign currency denominated public debt, reduce exposure to interest rate
risk and extend the maturities of both external and domestic debt. There is considerable
coordination with fiscal policy. A debt management unit exists, debt recording systems are
adequate and data on public debt management is of high quality. Although there is regular
statistical reporting, there is a case for further strengthening the analytical work; this may be a
reflection of the high rotation of staff responsible for risk-cost modeling, strategic analysis
and design and monitoring of the debt management strategy. There is no formal public debt
management strategy, although some of the informal targets are made public. These targets,
however, are not based on a systematic underlying risk-cost trade-off analysis under different
assumptions.

54.    The National Development Plan Law of May 2011 (Article 220) authorizes the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit to design and implement a Medium Term Debt
Management Strategy. The objective of the Strategy is to define guidelines for the public
debt portfolio, identify appropriate budget financing, reduce the cost of servicing the debt in
the medium-term, and to contribute to the development of the capital market.

55.     It would be expected that the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy includes
the following elements: The government’s debt management objectives; an identification of

the scope of the strategy; a description of the existing debt management strategy and of the
existing debt portfolio; potential funding sources; current macroeconomic challenges and
structural features which affect or constrain strategy choice; an assessment of alternative debt
strategies in terms of the cost-risk trade-off under alternative scenarios, and finally; a
justification of the choice of strategy.

56.     Cash management: The Treasury Single Account (TSA) currently in place in
Colombia does not conform with international standards. The more than one hundred and
fifty public sector entities that form part of the National Budget System (PGN) currently
operate with about three thousand individual bank accounts, where one part of public
resources is managed by Treasury and the other part is managed by each entity. Cash
surpluses on individual accounts are used to purchase government treasury bills (TES) on a
daily basis. This system contributes unnecessarily to domestic debt creation and involves
interest payments from Treasury to the public sector entities. The Government is planning to
reform the existing system by integrating payroll payments, ensuring that payments are made
to the final beneficiary, implementing a system of bank reconciliation and gradually
eliminating physical bank accounts. The new system is expected to lead to cost savings,
increased transparency and improved public sector management.

57.     The Government has completed a first important step by creating the legal
framework for a Treasury Single Account. The National Development Plan Law of May
2011, in its Article 225, creates a Treasury Single Account within the Public Credit and
Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. The TSA will cover the
entire national budget system except for entities that provide social services. A series of
subsequent steps would be necessary to fully implement the TSA, including: (1) the
development of the implementing regulation, (2) the design of the conceptual model for the
system, (3) the development of the associated information systems, and (4) the introduction of
the new system. These steps are expected to be concluded by mid-2012.

58.     Pending challenges: In addition to the implementation of the Medium-Term Debt
Management Strategy, there would be benefits from institutionalizing the progress achieved
in strategic debt management. A case in point is the lack of a public debt management law
with clear objectives, requirements for yearly reviews of the Strategy and of reporting on
compliance, and a formal coordination mechanism on debt (for example, a Debt Management
Committee, which would draw on proposals of a Technical Committee). Another area that
could be strengthened refers to the existence of five front offices in the debt unit, each
dedicated to different sources of funding or recipients of debt, and with few coordination
mechanisms. With respect to the Treasury Single Account implementation, further inclusion
of public agencies within the national budget system would be needed, for instance for
agencies providing social services. Direct payments for public services to the service
providers currently only taking place for Bogota, can also be further expanded to other major
cities. Finally, comparison of databases between the National Treasury and the Revenue
Authority (DIAN) could reduce the leakage of budget resources.

59.      Expected medium term outcomes for component (A) improved budget
predictability and stability: Support of the fiscal rule, tax reform, and improved debt/cash
management are expected to lead to a more predictable, stable and efficient management of
fiscal resources.

B. Social Security Liability Management

60.   Obligations related to the provision of social security constitute the most
substantial long-term fiscal challenges in Colombia. The net present value of future
unfunded health care obligations has been estimated at 97 percent of GDP (2006-50), while
unfunded public pension liabilities reach at least 110 percent of GDP (2011-60).24 To
improve long-term fiscal sustainability, the Government has taken steps to improve the
management of health insurance liabilities, as discussed next.

Improving the legal and regulatory framework of the health insurance system

Prior action for DPL I: The Borrower has promulgated Law No. 1438 dated January 19,
2011 which inter alia strengthened primary health care and established the criteria for
updating the Mandatory Benefit Package.

Prior action for DPL I: The Borrower’s Ministry of Social Protection has issued: (i)
Resolution No. 4377 dated October 29, 2010, which, inter alia established a reimbursement
system that allows more predictability in the reimbursement rates for selected high-cost
medicines; and (ii) Resolution No. 1020, dated March 31, 2011, which, inter alia, established
a reimbursement rate ceiling for the reimbursement of forty seven pharmaceutical active
ingredients not covered by the Mandatory Benefit Package of the Contributory Regime.

Prior action for DPL I: The Borrower’s Ministry of Social Protection has issued Resolution
No. 1083, dated April 5, 2011, which established a committee to monitor and analyze the
trend of reimbursements paid by FOSYGA for health care goods (including pharmaceuticals)
and health services not covered by the Mandatory Benefit Package of the Contributory
Regime.

Indicative trigger for DPL II: The Borrower, through the Health Regulatory Commission
(CRES), has updated the Mandatory Benefit Package of both the contributive and subsidized
regimes.

61.    The key factors explaining the fiscal pressures arising in the health care system
include: (a) the lack of an adequate legal and regulatory framework to foster improved quality
with delivery of goods and services within the framework of evidenced-based medicine, (b) a
strong expansion in subsidized (as opposed to contributory) health insurance coverage, (c)
rapid growth of supply-induced health care demand outside the Mandatory Benefit Package,
and (d) the policy of harmonizing the Mandatory Benefit Package for all individuals covered
by health insurance by July 2014 (see Annex 1 for details).

62.    To address the current challenges of the health sector, including the need to
improve quality of care in a fiscally sustainable manner, the Santos Administration is
introducing changes to the legal and regulatory frameworks. This section highlights the
most important features of this new legal framework with special emphasis on provisions that
are expected to improve the fiscal situation of the health insurance system.

using a discount rate of 4 percent. This section focuses on health. See Annex 1 for a discussion of pension.
                                                     29
63.     The health services delivery model has been strengthened through a renewed
emphasis on primary health care.25 Law 1438 of January, 19, 2011, provides a clear policy
framework based on a primary health care approach emphasizing health promotion and
prevention, fostering inter-sectoral activities and strengthening of the first level of care
services. Law 1438 also established principles and guidelines for the organization and
strategic interventions of community health care teams to identify household and individual
risk factors and foster the demand for key services with a high positive impact on public
health. Improved medium and long term planning can be achieved when individuals with
factor risks and with early diagnosis of clinical conditions can be treated in a timely fashion.

64.     Law 1438 makes explicit the criteria for updating the Mandatory Benefit
Package and defines more clearly how to regulate the health insurance financing of
goods and services while ensuring public health soundness and sustainability.26 As
discussed in Annex 1, the surge in health care expenses arising outside the Mandatory Benefit
Package of the contributive regime is one of the key contributing factors to fiscal weaknesses
in the health insurance system. The rapid growth of this type of expenditure is, in part, the
result of lack of specific guidelines for periodic updates of the Mandatory Benefit Package.
Law 1438 addresses this weakness by providing specific criteria for biannual updates of the
Package. The criteria include sound policy principles such as the need for a match between
the benefits and the services needed to address the burden of disease of the population and the
changing trends of the epidemiological profile. At the same time the criteria establishes the
consideration of financial constraints but also the special needs of vulnerable groups of the
population. By providing a technically sound and systematic way to periodically improve
how the health insurance addresses the demands of the population for services that were
outside the scope of the Mandatory Benefit Package it is expected that the incentives for the
irrational use of costly medicines and its reimbursements are reduced. These provisions
complement the planned establishment of a center for national quality standards, clinical
protocols and guidelines to foster health insurance coverage policies based on principles of
evidence-based medicine and cost-effectiveness similar to what the National Institute of
Clinical Excellence (NICE) does in the United Kingdom as envisioned in the Statutory Law.

65.     The Ministry of Social Protection has also taken administrative measures to
contain health expenditures outside the Mandatory Benefit Package of the contributive
regime. As discussed in Annex 1, the expansion of reimbursements to the insurance
companies (EPS) for diagnostic and therapeutic goods and services not covered by the
Mandatory Benefit Package of the contributive regime is a major contributing factor to the
fiscal challenges of the health insurance system. Moreover, most of the costs (87 percent)
relate to high-cost pharmaceutical products. To contain costs, the Ministry of Social
Protection has issued two resolutions, as explained next.

66.    Resolution 4377-2010 seeks to enforce existing pharmaceutical policies and
regulations. This resolution also aims to contain costs by establishing a reimbursement

25
   The Colombian health insurance system consists of two regimes: (a) a Contributory Regime financed mainly
through payroll taxation of formal workers, and (b) a Subsidized Regime financed through national and
subnational budgets and through transfers from the Contributory Regime. See Annex 1 for details.
26
   Law 1438 of 2010 regulates the harmonization of the benefit packages setting the criteria for what will be a
unified Mandatory Benefit Package.
                                                      30
system that allows more predictability in the reimbursement rates for selected high-cost
medicines. This resolution established reimbursement price ceilings as a mechanism
introducing a degree of predictability for health care costs and minimizing perverse incentives
for irrational use of pharmaceuticals not covered by the Mandatory Benefit Package of the
contributive regime. It also seeks to strengthen the adherence to international and national
pharmaceutical policy safety and quality standards and strengthens the enforcement of
regulations and information systems set by the Ministry of Social Protection and the
Colombian National Food and Drug Institute (Instituto Nacional de Vigilancia de
Medicamentos y Alimentos – INVIMA).

67.     Resolution 1020-2011 provides the specific pharmaceutical reimbursement rate
ceilings for a selected group of pharmaceuticals. This resolution defines the specific
reimbursement price ceilings for each of the pharmaceutical active ingredients from a list of
forty-seven items not covered by the Mandatory Benefit Package. These ceilings are to be
used as maximum reimbursement rates to health plans and providers by the Solidarity and
Guarantee Fund within the Ministry of Social Protection (FOSYGA).

68.     Resolution 1083-2011 complements the above measures by creating a mechanism
to monitor and analyze reimbursements for goods and services not covered by the
Mandatory Benefit Package of Contributory Regime. The resolution established a
committee with the purpose of assessing trends in reimbursements and providing advice and
recommendations to the Minister on actions and interventions to improve guidelines,
enforcement and fine-tuning of regulations. The committee will take into account not only
the need for cost containment, but also the objectives of ensuring equitable access and
efficient use of resources. The committee meets on a monthly basis and is composed of the
following officials of the Ministry of Social Protection: Vice Minister of Health, Technical
Vice Minister, Finance Director, Director of Health Care Management and the Chief counsel.

69.     In effect, the measures adopted by the Government constitute a multi-pronged
approach to ensuring a sound reimbursement policy for pharmaceuticals. This includes
establishing sound financial and technical criteria for updating the Mandatory Benefit
Package, the resolutions related to reimbursements, the establishment of the monitoring
committee, as well as a planned review and update of the Mandatory Benefit Package. These
instruments seek to respond to the changing needs of the population while minimizing risks of
irrational and costly use of medicines through a dynamic approach that responds potential
changes in both unit price and volume.

70.    Next steps: The government is already enforcing resolutions 4377-2010 and 1020-
2011 for all the new reimbursement of pharmaceuticals not covered by the Mandatory Benefit
Package. The Ministry of Social Protection will set up a technical secretariat for the
Committee created by Resolution 1083-2011 and will develop its rules of operation.
Furthermore, the Mandatory Benefit Package will be reviewed and updated in order to
minimize loopholes and gray areas to better control quality and cost of the goods and services
covered by the health insurance system. The current positive list of goods and services does
not always provide a clear definition for what goods and services are covered. An in-depth
review and overhaul of the Mandatory Benefit Package is considered to be overdue to
improve quality but also to reduce the need to resort to the ad hoc technical-scientific


                                              31
committees for the analysis and decisions regarding which goods and services are included in
the Mandatory Benefit Package.

71.     Pending challenges: Priorities for the health sector that still needs to be addressed
include: (a) improving organizational arrangements to strengthen the stewardship of the
national health authority and enhance governance and accountability, (b) improving legal and
regulatory frameworks to define and update coverage of goods and services for the Mandatory
Benefit Package, (c) developing a comprehensive policy for improving information systems;
and, (d) develop a technical dialogue with the participation of independent researchers and
academia on how to operationalize in a sustainable, progressive and equitable manner the
constitutional right to health. The set of reforms that the government plans to implement in
the medium term includes the strengthening of institutional capacity to improve governance
and stewardship over the health sector within the framework of a new streamlined Ministry of
Social Protection, and, a new Statutory Law that complements the ordinary Law and other
regulatory measures already approved. These changes seek to improve oversight, enforcement
of regulations and to ensure that resources are allocated to effectively address the health care
needs of population. The new statutory Law and other complementary regulations seek to
rationalize delivery of health care according to best practices and international standards of
clinical excellence and cost-benefit analysis.

72.     Expected medium term outcomes for component (B) improved social security
liability management. Support of the ordinary health law and the resolutions that rationalize
health care costs are expected to improve the management of fiscal vulnerabilities of the
health system.


C. Disaster Risk Financing Management
73.     Colombia is experiencing rising economic and fiscal costs of natural hazards, as
illustrated by the recent La Niña emergency. This is the result of Colombia’s higher
exposure to natural disaster risks compared to other developing countries. Urbanization,
environmental degradation and, possibly, climate change are increasing this exposure.
Natural hazards therefore represent an important contingent liability, estimated at 11-18
percent of GDP for the 2011-50 period (see Box A1.1, Annex 1). The agricultural sector is
particularly vulnerable to natural hazards and, in the absence of effective risk transfer
mechanisms, the Government often bears part of the losses, giving rise to fiscal risks.

Indicative trigger for DPL II: The Borrower’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has
published a national financing strategy to reduce the fiscal vulnerability of the state against
the occurrence of natural disasters. Indicative trigger for DPL II. The Borrower has created
an Agricultural Risk Management Directorate in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development.

74.     The Government of Colombia is taking steps to improve the management of the
fiscal risks associated with natural hazards. In the short term, the Government is
implementing measures to manage post-disaster reconstruction efforts. In the medium-term,
it will develop a national disaster financing strategy and improve the management of
agricultural risks.

                                              32
75.     The Government has created an Adaptation Fund under the auspices of the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. The objective of the Fund is to finance
reconstruction activities in the geographical areas recently affected by heavy rains. The Fund
will be attached to the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, but will have budget and
financial autonomy. It will identify and execute a range of different infrastructure projects in
the areas of transport, telecommunications, agriculture, public services, housing, education,
health, aqueducts, sewerage, drainage, dams, dikes, and strategic zones that were affected by
flooding. The Fund will be financed through the sale of Government assets, principally
Ecopetrol.27 In effect, the Fund is aimed at expediting the reconstruction spending process
while maintaining close presidential oversight.

76.    The Government has included Disaster Risk Management as a cross-cutting
theme in its new National Development Plan. The National Development Plan was
approved as a law by Congress in May 2011. According to article 185 of the National
Development Plan Law, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit will be in charge of
designing a disaster financing strategy to reduce the fiscal vulnerability of the state against the
occurrence of natural disasters. Additionally, a set of policies and tools for managing disaster
risks will be formulated and adopted, such as a national policy on disaster risk management, a
frequent disasters management policy, and risk management criteria in the formulation of
national public investment projects.

77.     A disaster risk financing strategy aims at strengthening the capacity of the
government to respond after an adverse natural event while protecting its fiscal balance.
A number of instruments are available to build such a strategy, each with its own cost
structure and other characteristics. An effective financial strategy against natural disasters
relies on a combination of these instruments, taking into consideration the country’s fiscal risk
profile, the cost of available instruments and the likely disbursement profile after a disaster.28

78.     There is great value in having a prior risk financing strategy. It is essential for
faster recovery after a disaster event that a country is prepared for the challenge of financing
the recovery and reconstruction process. When this is not done, global experience shows that
the result is often expensive debt instruments, diversion of resources from ongoing
development programs, or slow and insufficient reconstruction financing.

79.     Next steps: In addition to preparing a disaster management strategy, the Government
is also planning to introduce institutional and fiscal mechanisms for the ex-ante management
of agricultural risks. This includes the preparation of legislation to establish: (a) a Directorate
of Agriculture Risk Management to be funded by the National Agriculture Risk Fund, (b)
benefits for borrowers and lenders that have purchased agriculture insurance, (c) an increase
in the level and modalities of the existing public funding for agriculture insurance premium

27
   Increased public investment through the Adaptation Fund, financed through the sale of public assets, gives rise
to an increase in capital expenditures and the deficit of the Central Government and the combined public sector.
The higher combined public sector deficit, however, does not result in additional borrowing, as the investments
are financed through asset sale and accounted for similar to privatization proceeds.
28
    Examples of ex-ante financing instruments include: budget contingencies, reserve funds, contingent debt
facilities, parametric insurance, CAT-Bonds, and traditional insurance. Post-disaster financing instruments
include: donor assistance (relief), budget reallocation, domestic credit, external credit, donor assistance
(reconstruction) and tax increases. For details see Ghesquiere and Mahul (2010).
                                                       33
subsidies29, and (d) the authorization for international insurance companies to offer
agriculture insurance directly in the Colombian market. Some of these measures have the
potential of reducing future unplanned fiscal outlays in response to natural disasters, as they
seek to promote the development of the private agriculture insurance market and promote
investments in risk mitigation and prevention.

80.     Pending challenges: Colombia is seen as a leader in managing disaster risk given its
existing sophisticated institutional arrangements. These institutions would be strengthened
further through the development and implementation of a financing strategy. While the
analysis and quantification of agriculture risks is a first step in the right direction of
developing a sector-wide strategy to manage agricultural shocks, further steps would need to
be taken in the future. This includes the development of risk mapping, risk quantification,
and training and capacity building for mainstreaming agriculture risk management into public
sector programs and private sector financial instruments.

81.     Expected medium term outcomes for component (C) improved disaster risk
financing management. Support in the area of disaster risk financing is expected to assist in
the identification of sources of natural disaster risks, the quantification of their potential fiscal
impact and the introduction of relevant financial instruments to mitigate risks.

                 IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

A. Link to the Country Partnership Strategy
82.     The Government has prepared a New National Development Plan Prosperidad
Para Todos (2010-14), which has been approved by Congress. The overarching goals of
this plan are to increase employment, reduce poverty and improve security. The Plan has
three pillars: (i) Sustainable Growth and Competitiveness, (ii) Equality of Opportunities for
Social Prosperity, and (iii) Consolidation of Peace. Moreover, it has four cross-cutting
themes: (a) International Relevance, (b) Environmental and Disaster Risk Management, (c)
Good Governance, and (d) Regional Development and Integration.

83.     The proposed operation supports the objectives of Colombia’s New National
Development Plan. The prior actions of this development policy loan support pillar (i) of the
Plan, as well as cross-cutting theme (b) of disaster risk management. The fiscal management
program enhances budget stability and predictability and facilitates fiscal consolidation,
which in turn, supports economic growth. The Plan makes explicit references to the
Government’s fiscal management program, supported in this operation, in the Chapter on
macroeconomic consistency. Moreover, a separate chapter is devoted exclusively to the
cross-cutting theme of environmental sustainability and risk prevention, which link with the
policy actions in the area of disaster risk financing.

84.   The new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12-16 is also aligned with
the key themes of the National Development Plan.30 The CPS has three themes: (1)

29
   Such subsidies have existed for several years, but they have mostly gone unspent because of the lack of
interest and incentives for private firms to offer agriculture insurance to farmers. This situation is expected to
improve with the planned Government measures.
30
   The CPS is scheduled to be presented to the Board on July 21, 2011.
                                                       34
Expanding Opportunities for Social Prosperity, (2) Sustainable Growth with Enhanced
Climate Resilience, and, (3) Inclusive Growth with Enhanced Productivity. Each theme
supports three long term outcomes. The DPL operation supports the long-term outcome of
improved fiscal, financial, and social risk management under the ‘Inclusive Growth with
Enhanced Productivity’ theme.

B. Consultations
85.      The Government’s fiscal reform program supported by this operation was an
integral part of President Santos’ election platform. Juan Manual Santos, who won the
second round of the Presidential Elections in August 2010, heads a national unity coalition
which controls about 80 percent of the seats Congress, and enjoys favorable approval rating of
above 70 percent. The major elements of the fiscal management program currently carried
forward by the Santos Administration were included in the President’s election manifesto
Buen Gobierno Para La Prosperidad Democrática. This includes proposals to introducing a
fiscal rule, reforming the royalties system as well as key components of the tax reform such as
eliminating the investment tax credit. Major elements of the ongoing health reforms to
improve fiscal sustainability of the system were also included in the election manifesto, such
as the importance of preventive health care, the proposal to introduce technical-scientific
committees.

86.    The National Development Plan, which includes the fiscal management program,
was completed and approved by Congress followed extensive nationwide consultations.
The exercise took place with 16 administrative departments with an ample range of
stakeholders from academia, NGOs, private sector, unions, indigenous people and the media.
As part of the CPS process, the Bank participated selectively in relevant Government
consultation events. Subsequently, some indigenous groups expressed concern about lack of
consultations during the preparations of the royalties reform.

87.      Key parts of the fiscal management program have also been discussed in public
fora. The Colombian think tank, Fedesarollo, organized a series of seminars on the fiscal rule
reform and the proposal to include fiscal sustainability in the Constitution. These seminars
were open to the public and were attended by Bank staff. The Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit has also presented its Economic and Fiscal Strategy in public forum where the Bank
participated. Participants in these seminars expressed support for the fiscal rule legislation
and the royalties reform while proposing ways in which institutional arrangements could be
strengthened. Views on the fiscal sustainability constitutional amendment were mixed as
participants either questioned the potential effectiveness of the measure or expressed concerns
that it would constrain constitutionally protected social entitlements. Finally, the Government
has had an active dialogue and consultations with private sector associations related to other
reform measures, such as the proposal to eliminate the capital investment tax credit and the
energy surcharge. The private sector supported both initiatives, despite their opposite impact.




                                              35
C. Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors

88.     The Bank’s country team has been collaborating very closely with the IMF.31
This cooperation includes the review of macroeconomic developments, including fiscal
projections and the preparation of debt sustainability analysis. The proposed DPL program is
consistent with IMF policy advice. In fact, the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department advised the
Government of Colombia in the process of preparing the fiscal rule. The two institutions have
also been collaborating closely in other areas, including revenue administration improvement
and public financial management (including debt management). The IMF is also advising the
Government on tax policy reform and customs administration.

89.     A review of activities by other development partners in Colombia suggests a
limited overlap with the proposed operation. A few linkages exist: The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (CEPAL) is preparing an economic damage estimate of the recent natural disaster.
Moreover, the IDB is supporting the technical design of the Adaptation Fund and is preparing
a programmatic DPL operation on disaster risk management and climate change mitigation.
In the area of pension reform, the IDB is preparing a diagnostic study. The IDB also works
on capacity building activities for local governments, which will be important once the
royalties reform has been implemented. The Bank is collaborating closely with these
partners.

D. Relationships to other Bank Operations

90.     The Bank is committed to a long-term engagement with the Government of
Colombia in the area of fiscal management. The proposed DPL is only one of several
different activities through which the Bank is supporting this reform program. As discussed
in Section I and as illustrated in Tables 4 and 7, the Bank is implementing a multi-sectoral and
programmatic package of convening, knowledge, and financial services in support of this
program.

91.     The authorities are considering requesting a new CAT-DDO DPL II. The
proposed CAT-DDO DPL II complements the proposed Fiscal Sustainability and Growth
Resilience (FSGR) DPL. To illustrate, the FSGR DPL supports the development of a
National Financing Strategy and the CAT-DDO is one of several financial instruments that
the Government may implement in the context of this Strategy. It is noted that the scope of
each operation differs in the sense that the CAT-DDO focuses on the general challenge of
disaster risk management, whereas the DPL focuses on the sub-set of disaster risk financing.

  Colombia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. Bank staff participated in the Article IV
consultations in June 2011.

E. Lessons Learned
92.    The design of the proposed operation takes into account the lessons learned from
the overall program with Colombia and in general from the Bank’s experience with
other middle income countries. In particular, the most important lessons are the following:

    Operations should be focused and avoid large and complex policy matrices. Rather
     than seeking to cover an extensive list of measures the design of this DPL has sought to
     concentrate on the key elements of the Governments fiscal management program. This
     has resulted in a policy matrix with 5-7 policy actions for each of the two DPL operations.

    The need to take into account the political economy of reform. In designing a policy-
     based operation, political factors and the legislative needs of the country needs to be
     understood and included in the dialogue with the client. The proposed operation supports
     only the most advanced parts of the Government’s fiscal reform agenda, while leaving out
     from the policy matrix other relevant measures which are still pending Congressional
     approval or reform proposals which face a low likelihood of entering into law. Moreover,
     Bank support to a reform program early in a Government Administration also increases
     the likelihood of successful implementation.

    The commitment of the Government is central in ensuring the success of the
     program. Previous policy-based and investment operations all pointed to the important
     role of strong government leadership in their success. The proposed operation effectively
     responds to the Government’s own priorities and commitment as reflected in the actions
     already taken. These priorities are reflected in the National Development Plan and in the
     Fiscal and Economic Strategy document of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
     (2010).

    Coordination with other international financial institutions, including the IMF, is
     critical to ensuring a consistent policy approach towards borrowers. The proposed
     operation builds on very close coordination with the IMF on the macroeconomic
     framework, particularly fiscal policy and projections, debt sustainability analysis and
     coherence in policy dialogue and messages.

F. Analytical Underpinnings
93.     The actions supported by the DPL have been assessed through analytical work of
the Bank and the IMF. This body of analytical work has provided the basis for a policy
dialogue with the government and has supported the design of the DPL. In some cases, such
as the discussion on managing commodities, the dialogue has been at the highest level with
the President, the Minister of Finance, the Director of National Planning, and the Minister of
Mining and Energy.32 In other cases, the policy dialogue has been at the more technical level,
such as the two-day workshop on Disaster Risk Financing with the Public Credit Office held
in Washington D.C. Table 8 shows the links between the prior actions included in the DPL
and the recommendations included in recent analytical work.

              V.     THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

Operational Design

94.     This operation is a programmatic series of two Development Policy Loans
designed to support the Government of Colombia’s fiscal management program. The
program covers three policy areas: budget predictability and stability, social liability
management, and disaster risk financing. Given the medium-term nature of the reform
efforts, Bank engagement naturally lends itself to a programmatic operation. The first loan is
designed to support the government measures to implement the relevant and necessary
legislative changes to strengthen the fiscal framework. Building on this, the second loan will
support the implementing regulation of these legislative reforms. The operational design is
summarized in the Policy Matrix (Table 9).

95.      The three policy areas of the fiscal management program are inter-linked and
mutually reinforcing. Improved management of social security liabilities has a positive
impact on budget predictability and stability as it reduces the need for unexpected tax
increases or expenditure cuts to meet social security obligations. Similarly, improved disaster
risk financing, i.e. the use of financial instruments such as insurance or event-based financial
products, supports the objective of budget predictability and stability since it reduces the
fiscal risks associated with natural hazards. Conversely, the inability to meet fiscal
obligations related to natural hazards through the budget automatically results in higher public
liabilities, including debt. Finally, the designation of contingency funds for natural hazards
through predictable and stable budgeting constitutes a disaster risk financing strategy.

Results Framework

96.     The fiscal management program is expected to enhance fiscal sustainability and
strengthen economic growth resilience. As the Debt Sustainability Analysis (Section II and
Annex 4) shows, the medium-term public debt trajectory is declining in the baseline scenario
and robust to most exogenous shocks. This scenario builds in the planned fiscal adjustment
arising from the implementation of the fiscal rule with its associated deficit target for 2014.
In addition, the improved management of commodities revenue through stabilization funds is
expected to reduce economywide growth volatility and increase fiscal savings thereby
providing a more solid foundation for higher investment and economic growth.

97.     Medium term outcomes have been identified for each of the three program
components. These medium-term outcomes are summarized in Table 10. To measure
progress towards the overall Program Development Objective and the objectives for each of
the three components, seven medium-term outcome indicators have been identified each with
a baseline value for 2010 and indicative targets for 2012 and 2013 (all end-year), as
summarized in Table 10. The linkages between the prior actions and indicative triggers and
the outcome indicators is explained as follows:




                                              40
(A) Improved Budget Predictability and Stability
    The fiscal rule mandates the Government to target a structural central government
      deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP by 2014. The achievement of this target requires a fiscal
      adjustment of about 1½ percent of GDP in the 2011-14 transition period. This
      adjustment will be evident in a gradually declining central government overall fiscal
      deficit.33
    The tax reform aims at improving the efficiency of revenue collection, as illustrated by
      an increase in the non-oil tax-revenue-to-GDP ratio. The latter is defined as total tax
      revenue less tax revenue related to Ecopetrol and other oil companies (excluding
      dividends from Ecopetrol).34
    A medium term debt management strategy and a Treasury Single Account (TSA) will
      contribute to improved debt and cash management. An annual report will detail the
      implementation of the debt strategy while the share of TSA payments in the National
      Budget System will reflect progress in implementing the TSA.

(B) Improved Social Security Liability Management
     The health reforms aim, inter alia, at reducing the expenditures (particularly on
      pharmaceuticals) incurred outside the Mandatory Benefit Package within the
      contributive regime. Following strong growth in reimbursements from FOSYGA (40
      percent in 2010), the target for reimbursements in the medium term is zero nominal
      growth.

(C) Improved Disaster Risk Financing Management
    A new national disaster risk financing strategy will identify financial instruments (e.g.
      insurance or event-based financial products) through which the state can protect itself
      from natural hazard risks. The degree to which these instruments are implemented
      reflects progress in implementing the Strategy.

98.     All prior actions for DPL I, summarized in Table 9, have been completed. The
Fiscal Rule Bill of Law was approved by Congress on June 14, 2011.

   The ideal results indicator, namely the Central Government structural fiscal balance using Government
definitions, was not available at the time of loan preparation.
34
   In 2010, non-oil tax revenue equaled 12.1 (12.3-0.2) percent of GDP. For 2013, non-oil tax revenue is
targeted to reach 12.5 (13.2-0.7) percent of GDP.

                          Box 4. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Ownership: The proposed operation supports the objectives of Colombia’s New National
Development Plan. The prior actions of this development policy loan support pillar (1) Sustainable Growth and
Competitiveness of the Plan, as well as the cross-cutting theme of Disaster Risk Management. The operation
supports the reforms outlined in the Fiscal and Economic Strategy 2010-14 of the Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit.

Principle 2: Coordinated Accountability Framework: The program document defines the actions agreed with
the government and summarizes expected outcomes in a program matrix. Contact with other multilaterals,
particularly the IMF, which also support policy actions in key program areas such as fiscal reforms has been
regular and close, including during the preparation of the operation.

Principle 3: Customization: The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has indicated that it intends to cover
part of its multilateral ‘budget support’ needs through the proposed programmatic DPL operation,
complementing the investment lending portfolio of other multilateral agencies and the Bank. The selected policy
areas covered by the DPL program are derived from the National Development Plan and the Fiscal and
Economic Strategy. Accordingly, the specific actions and intended outcomes also enjoy technical and political
support in their respective sectors. The relevance and soundness of said actions have been assessed through
Bank analytical work and follow-up activities.

Principle 4: Criticality Actions: The prior actions form part of an agreed accountability framework that focuses
on the Government’s critical actions for achieving the program objectives, as assessed through Bank analytical
work. The operation supports three complementary policy areas and the policy matrix has been limited to a
number of actions considered necessary to maintain coherence of the policy dialogue and benefit from
complementarities towards the intended outcomes. The reliance on legislative measures in the policy matrix is
related to the fact that legislative action is considered absolutely essential to the vitality of the reform program. 35

Principle 5: Transparency and Predictability: The approach and the timing of planned disbursement respond
to the Government’s stated financial needs. The program matrix clearly states expected outcomes and indicators
in a transparent manner. The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit and the National Planning Department will
exercise joint leadership in coordinating the monitoring and evaluation arrangements (see Section VI.C).

                              VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. Poverty and Social Aspects
99.     The Government actions, supported in this DPL, are expected to have a positive
poverty and social impact. Although this impact has not been assessed formally through
Bank analytical work, such as a Poverty and Social Impact analysis, an analysis of the reforms
supported indicate an expected positive impact (see Annex 1). The anticipated impact of each
of the supported reforms is discussed below.

100. The fiscal rule contributes to improved fiscal performance and macroeconomic
stability, which are important foundations for sustained economic growth and poverty
reduction. Moreover, the fiscal rule strengthens the capacity of the Government to pursue
counter-cyclical fiscal policy, including the implementation of social programs that can
protect the poor and vulnerable in times of growth decelerations. The proposed stabilization
fund is expected to smoothen the fiscal impact of the commodity cycle, which potentially
reduces the need for government to cut public spending (including social and poverty
programs) in times of low commodity revenues. There are no indications in the Economic
and Fiscal Strategy for 2010-14 that the Government will cut social programs to meet the
2014 fiscal deficit target.

     As per the Good Practice Note For Development Policy Lending (p. 13).
                                                          45
101. The tax reform is expected to have a small positive impact on low income
households. The reform tends to affect mainly high-income individuals and private sector
firms. The elimination of the capital investment tax credit of firms, the reduction of the
energy surcharge of firms and the closing of financial transaction loopholes are not expected
to have any direct impact the poor. The gradual elimination of the financial transaction tax
will have a positive impact on the low income households who use the banking system. The
increased base and higher rate of the wealth tax will not directly negatively affect the poor.
On the contrary, proceeds from this tax will be used to finance humanitarian efforts in the
wake of the heavy rains, which will mainly benefit the poor.

102. The poor are also expected to benefit from an increased focus on community and
primary health care, which is promoted in the ordinary health law. There is ample
evidence that an emphasis on primary health care, health promotion and prevention at the
community level are suitable to deal with the bulk of the burden of disease of the poor.
Shifting the emphasis of health system from specialized and medium-high complexity
diagnostic and therapeutic services towards a model better suited to address the actual needs
of the poor and other vulnerable populations improves equity in access to key social services
increasing human capital investment and ultimately reducing poverty. There is a vast
literature on how investments in health fostered within the framework of primary health care
approaches can have an impact on individual and households income and enhance other types
of public sector investments (i.e. education).36

103. Furthermore, actions to contain costs of the contributive regime will benefit the
poor within the subsidized regime by increasing the fiscal space within the health
insurance system. The poor form part either of the subsidized regime or do not have
coverage. The contributive regime, meanwhile, is mainly for formal sector workers, who pay
for their own health care and make solidarity contributions towards the subsidized regime.
Rising costs in the contributive regime endanger the ability of this regime to make solidarity
payments. Measures that contain costs (including of pharmaceuticals) in the contributive
regime therefore create more fiscal space within this regime to the benefit of those covered by
the subsidized regime, including the poor.

104. The poor are expected to benefit from the effective ex-ante risk management
efforts. Natural disasters have a disproportionate impact on the poor. Ninety-nine percent of
people affected by the close to 6,000 large scale natural disasters worldwide registered
between 1970 and 2002 were people in developing countries.37 Disaster risk management is
therefore essential for consolidating poverty reduction. The poor population is more likely to
be affected and less resilient to disasters occurrence. The poorer segments of the population
often live in the most vulnerable locations and live in inadequately constructed housing. In
addition, the poor have limited labor skills, fewer assets, and little or no savings. They have
little opportunity for risk diversification and restricted access to credit. Because of this, they
are less able to cushion the impact on consumption of disruptions to income.

B. Environmental Aspects
105. The proposed operation is not likely to have any significant effects on the
environment. Following OP 8.60, the operation was reviewed for any potential effects
relating to the environment, forest, and natural resources. As this operation focuses on
implementing a fiscal management program it is not expected to have any impact on the
environment.

106. The Government of Colombia is well prepared to address potential
environmental impacts. The new National Development Plan focuses on sustainable
growth, with environmental and disaster risk management as a cross-cutting theme, and calls
for the strengthening of the National Environment System. The Government has made
significant progress in strengthening the institutional capacity to plan and implement policies
to ensure environmentally sustainable development in priority economic sectors, and the
institutional capacity is expected to keep improving in the future given the current strong
emphasis of the National Development Plan on mainstreaming the environment in the key
productive sectors. The Bank has been accompanying the Government in this process through
a package of services, including the Environmental Development Policy Loan series, the
Sustainable Development Investment Loan, and the provision of targeted technical assistance
and analytical support in the area of environmental management.

C. Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation
107. The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) and the National Planning
Department (DNP) are responsible for coordinating actions among the concerned
agencies. The Department for Public Credit within the MHCP will collect the necessary data
to assess the implementation progress for which the MHCP is responsible and report it to the
Bank. Similarly, the Sub-directorate of Public Credit within the DNP will collect the
information necessary related to the implementation progress for which the Ministry of Social
Protection is responsible and report it to the Bank. (See Tables 9 and 10 for details).

D. Fiduciary Aspects

Public financial management

108. The public financial management systems are adequate to support development
policy lending. The country public financial management (PFM) systems, at the national
level, show advanced levels of performance which are close to good international practices,
according to the most recent Public Financial Management and Procurement Report (2009).
Moreover, Colombia has an effective track record of implementing PFM reforms, which has
been supported by the Bank through a package of financing instruments and knowledge
services. Salient features of the PFM systems are summarized below.

109. The budget is comprehensive, well documented, and implemented as planned
with actual expenditures deviating only slightly from planned levels. Budget planning is
based on a multi-year perspective and annual formulation reflects a functioning policy-based
system. Execution of budgeted expenditures suggests a largely credible budget, although
some arrears may exist.

                                              47
110. Revenue- and expenditure controls are comprehensive, although some concerns
arise with the quality of revenue reporting. Records and controls on cash flows, balances
and public debt support sound fiscal management and provide public institutions with the
tools for predicting funding to execute their budgets in an orderly manner.

111. The consolidated public accounts are prepared within six months of the end of
the fiscal year. They include full information on revenues, expenditures, and financial assets
and liabilities. Year-end accrual-based financial statements are issued by the Accountant
General and presented within six months by May 15 of the following year to the Controller
General for audit purposes. The Controller General’s auditing policies and procedures
provide for the application of financial, compliance and performance procedures consistent
with national government auditing standards. Audit reports are submitted before July 1st of
the following fiscal year to the Congress and the President of the Republic.

Procurement

112. An assessment of the public procurement system concludes that Colombia has
made progress over the past five years, although further work is needed. The study,
carried out in 2009, used the OECD-Development Assistance Committee (DAC)
methodology and was supported with technical and financial assistance from the World Bank.
There have been major leaps forward in modernizing the procurement system, but work
remains in terms of consolidating gains and ensuring sustainability. In 2004, the Government
created the inter-sectoral commission of public procurement (CINCO) to oversee and lead the
procurement reforms. In 2006 an electronic public procurement system was launched. In
2007-08, Colombia enacted a new law and associated regulatory decrees thereby bringing the
Colombian system close to internationally agreed standards. Important remaining challenges
include: (1) The development and implementation of an IT system to support e-procurement.
(2) The development of a permanent oversight and regulatory body with sufficient resources
and capacity to effectively replace CINCO as the champion for further modernization efforts.

E. Disbursement and Auditing
113. Disbursement. Upon effectiveness and compliance with any withdrawal tranche
release conditions, and following the Borrower’s request, the Bank would deposit the single
tranche disbursement to an account denominated in US dollars of the Central Bank (Banco de
la República) for subsequent credit into the Treasury Single Account of the Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit, thus becoming available to finance budgeted expenditures.

114. There is no evidence that the banking control environment into which the DPL
proceeds would flow is other than adequate. This assessment is based on a review of the
2009 audit report of the Banco de la República, the latest IMF Central Bank safeguards
assessment (2010), and the 2010 IMF Article IV Consultation. If requested by the Bank, the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit would provide the Bank with a written confirmation of
the described transaction after funds are disbursed by the Bank.

115. Audit. Based on the assessment of the borrower’s current public financial
management systems and the conclusion that the fiduciary arrangements for this financing are
adequate, the Bank will not require an audit of the designated account, and no additional
fiduciary arrangements are considered necessary at this time.
                                             48
F. Risks and Risk Mitigation
116. The DPL operation is subject to risks related to the external economic
environment and reform program implementation.                    Despite solid fundamentals,
Colombia’s near-term macroeconomic outlook could be adversely affected if commodity
prices fall, external financing conditions deteriorate or the global recovery falters. There are
also risks of policy slippages related to the implementation of the fiscal management program.
On the other hand, the political economy context is very favorable given the high popularity
ratings of President Santos whose national unity coalition control about 80 percent of the seats
in Congress. Moreover, reforms are being implemented within the first period of the
Administration’s four-year term, where the political will to make difficult decisions may be
relatively high. This increases the probability that the Government will be able to take the
reform agenda successfully forward. In light hereof, the risk classification is considered low.

117. Colombia is vulnerable to commodity price shocks and a deterioration of
external financing conditions. Commodity exports accounted for 63 percent of export
revenue in 2010 while 73 percent of FDI inflows are in commodity-related projects (mainly
oil). As a result, an adverse shock to oil and other primary exports (e.g. coffee) could result in
a significant increase in Colombia’s financing needs. A sudden deterioration of external
financing conditions would also affect Colombia. Tighter global financial conditions would
lower the inflows of private capital envisaged in the macroeconomic projections (Table 1),
and public external financing conditions also could be affected, even if the government were
to maintain access to international markets at favorable rates, possibly creating debt roll-over
difficulties. Mitigation: The two-year US$6.2 billion arrangement under the IMF Flexible
Credit Line, renewed in May 2011, will mitigate these risks continuing to provide space for
policy flexibility while bolstering Colombia’s access to international markets if tail risks were
to materialize.

118. Another external economic risk derives from a slower-than-expected global
recovery. Earlier fears of a double-dip recession have not materialized, but there are
important downside risks. Future developments in the United States, in particular, are of
importance to Colombia. Substantially higher oil prices or a further decline in domestic house
prices could dampen confidence and consumer spending in the US. This would reduce
demand for Colombian exports. Mitigation: Diversification of trading partners would be an
important mitigation factor, and Colombia is currently pursuing the negotiation of free trade
agreements beyond its traditional trading partners, for instance with South Korea and Turkey.
The Bank and the Fund are maintaining an on-going policy dialogue with the Government on
macroeconomic policy issues, which may help detect early potential threats to Colombia’s
growth.

119. Policy slippages in implementing fiscal reforms. Given the high level of ambition
of the fiscal reform agenda, there is also a risk of slower progress in politically contentious
areas. This has unfortunately been frequently the case in Colombia when dealing with
structural fiscal reforms in the past (e.g. pensions, health care). This would call for
frontloaded action in key policy reform areas that signal commitment to strengthening fiscal
institutions and reducing fiscal risks. Mitigation: Moving forward with the most contentious
issues first would signal strong commitment to reform and mitigate some of these risks. The
Government has, to some extent, followed this strategy, for instance, by frontloading the

                                               49
fiscal adjustment. The Bank, through its programmatic and comprehensive engagement in the
fiscal reform program, can support the Government in mitigating this risk.38

120. Sustainability of reform efforts in disaster risk financing management. In the
aftermath of the La Niña event, natural disaster risk management moved to the top on the
political agenda. The Government designed an effective post-disaster financing mechanism,
included the theme in the new National Development Plan, and issued several relevant
decrees to improve the country’s future crises preparedness. In some sense, this is a familiar
post-conflict reaction pattern of governments. The policy actions supported here are
important steps in the right direction, but further actions are needed to ensure the development
of a disaster risk financing strategy. International experience suggests a window of
opportunity for policy reform of about 6-9 months following a disaster event. While there are
important indications that Colombia is heading towards an improved institutional framework,
there is a risk that reform attention will be diverted as the memory of the recent disaster fades
and other priorities crop the political agenda. Mitigation: Encouragingly, the Government has
chosen the Bank as its strategic partner in moving the reforms forward. The Bank has been
requested to provide technical input on a number of ongoing activities and policy dialogue,
such as the Disaster Risk Management Analysis and other activities summarized in Table 7.
Therefore, the Bank can help mitigate this risk by reminding the Government of its
importance through the ongoing policy dialogue.




38
   As discussed in Annex 1, fiscal pressures may arise with the policy of harmonizing benefit packages in the
health insurance system. The policy of harmonization stems from the health sector reform Law 100 of 1993 and
Constitutional Court Ruling T-760 of 2008. The prior actions supported in this DPL (I-3 related to the ordinary
health Law, in particular) help to ensure an orderly transition to the unified regime which aim to control overall
fiscal pressures in the health insurance system.

                      ANNEX 1: COLOMBIA’S FISCAL CHALLENGES
A1.1. The purpose of this Annex is to discuss Colombia’s fiscal challenges in order to
contextualize the government fiscal program supported by the Bank. The text is
structured around the three main fiscal challenges Colombia is facing: improving budget
predictability and stability, improving the management of social security liabilities, and
improving disaster risk financing management.

A. Improving Budget Predictability and Stability

National Level

A1.2. Colombia is expected to expand oil and coal production substantially the coming
decade. Oil production rose by 25 percent in 2002-10, from 600 to 800 thousand barrels per
day, while coal production close to doubled from 40 to 70 million tons. By 2009, Colombia
was the fourth largest oil producer in Latin America, and among top 30 worldwide in terms of
production and proven reserves. Its coal production and reserves brought it among the global
top 10. By 2020, Colombia’s government is expecting that the country will produce 1,450
thousand barrels per day of oil and 160 million tons of coal – a projected increase of 80 and
75 percent, respectively (see Figure 1 panels c and d)39. This projection is, to some extent,
driven by the surge in foreign direct investment into these sectors over the past decade. These
investments increase the likelihood of major discoveries, which are yet to be made. The
projected expansion in production will require sizable investments in infrastructure and
transmission capacity and further improvements in the regulatory framework. Even if these
projections do not materialize as expected, Colombia’s current production is large enough to
generate commodity policy concerns.

A1.3. Fiscal dependence on commodities has increased in recent years in Colombia, but
falls below the regional average of commodity exporters. In 2010, about 13 percent of
total fiscal revenues in Colombia were derived from commodities (mainly oil, coal, and
metals) compared to 4.4 percent in 2002. This share is comparable to advanced resource-rich
economies (9 percent), but falls well below the regional average of commodity exporters (24
percent), according to World Bank (2010). Fiscal dependence on commodities is expected to
increase in Colombia as oil and coal production expands over the coming decade. The
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit estimates that the associated fiscal revenues could
increase from 1.0 to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2010-20.

A1.4. While increased commodity production has the potential to bring prosperity, it
also introduces a number of policy challenges. Economic policy management is critical for
whether natural resource abundance leads to higher growth and economic development, or
not. Natural resources may not necessarily be a curse, but there are plenty of commodity
concerns which create significant risks (World Bank, 2010).

   By government projections. Available international projections are more conservative. The IEA (2010), for
instance, projects a range of 700 to 800 thousand bpd of conventional liquid production (mainly oil) by 2020,
depending on the scenario. Colombia's success rate in oil exploration was 48 percent during 2010, well above
the world average of 20-30 percent. New finds by Ecopetrol increased its reserves by 11.4 percent in 2010.
                                                     53
A1.5. The macroeconomic challenges of commodity production are related to their
special characteristics, including high rents and price volatility. Several characteristics of
commodities (such as minerals, oil, and gas) distinguish them from other kinds of products or
economic activity. First, they produce high rents, i.e. above-normal returns on investments.
During a period of commodity export bonanza, this tends to cause the real exchange rate to
appreciate and to attract resources from other activities, discouraging diversification of non-
commodity exports: The Dutch Disease. A second characteristic is that international
commodity prices are highly volatile because of inelastic supply and demand. Price volatility
increases the uncertainty and risks in the entire economy, which may discourage investment.

A1.6. Fiscal rules, stabilization funds, and a flexible exchange rate can be effective
policy instruments to deal with these challenges. Commodity price shocks have strong
ripple effects on both general economic activity and fiscal revenues. This is exacerbated by
governments’ reliance on commodity-based revenue, a result of both Dutch disease effects
and neglect of other, less volatile forms of taxation. Rapidly increasing commodity revenues
during booms have fueled fiscal expansion, with spending in some cases rising more than
revenues. The best way to reduce volatility given a flexible exchange rate is to use a well-
designed commodity stabilization or long-term savings fund. Moreover, a flexible exchange
rate is the best mechanism to transfer the price shock to the real exchange rate, according to
World Bank (2010).

A1.7. Colombia’s experience with stabilization funds has been mixed. In 1995, an oil
stabilization fund was created and the fund accumulated important savings during booms in
oil prices. However, because it covered only a fraction of overall revenues, it was not an
effective instrument to stabilize overall expenditures, and Colombia actually saw a severe
deterioration in its public finances in the second half of the 1990s. Moreover, in 2008-09, a
part of the resources of the Fund were transferred to the national budget in a period of boom,
thereby contributing to pro-cyclical fiscal spending. On the other hand, Colombia had a
relatively successful experience with the Coffee Fund, when coffee was the main export of the
country.40

A1.8. The Fiscal Responsibility Law (2003) provides a good foundation for further
reforms to tackle commodity challenges. Colombia’s progress in fiscal consolidation over
the past decade owes, to some extent, to the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law (819
of 2003). The law obliges the executive to present each year to Congress a Medium Term
Fiscal Framework, which establishes a target for the consolidated primary balance of the
NFPS for the subsequent fiscal year as well as indicative targets for the next ten years thereby
facilitating a sustainable path for public debt. The underlying macroeconomic scenario is
determined jointly between the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, the Central Bank and
the National Department of Planning.

Subnational Level

A1.9. Subnational governments in Latin America, including those in Colombia, spend a
sizeable share of natural resources rents. While previously insignificant, the annual
amount of royalties has increased substantially over the past two decades in line with the rise

40
     Perry, Serven, and Suescun (2008).
                                              54
in commodity production in Colombia. In 2008, royalties payments peaked at more than
COP6,000 billion (US$3 billion, or 1.3 percent of GDP). During the 1990s, by comparison,
royalties did not exceed COP1,000 billion in 2009 prices, as illustrated in Figure 1 (panel e).
Royalties revenues may increase by about 20 percent in real terms between 2011 and 2020,
although as a share of nominal GDP such revenues would remain unchanged at around 1
percent.

A1.10. The distribution of royalties revenues is inequitable. The 1991 Constitution
maintained the exclusive right of producing subnational governments and serving ports to
participate in natural resource royalties (so-called direct royalties).           Non-producing
departments and municipalities have only limited access to royalties through the National
Royalties Fund (created by Law 141 of 1994), which accounts for only about ten percent of
total royalties. As a result, eighty percent of royalties benefit less than twenty percent of the
population (concentrated in eight departments), as illustrated in Figure 1 (panel f).

A1.11. The current royalties system is also ineffective in improving the well-being of the
population. There is practically no correlation between the amount of royalties received and
departmental performance in reducing poverty or providing public services, despite the fact
that some departments receive several times the national average. This is even more striking
given that direct royalties were specifically directed to investment projects in education,
health, water supply, and the environment.41

A1.12. Moreover, where subnational governments lack the institutional capacity to
spend their allocation of natural resources rents efficiently, funds may be wasted. There
is evidence that resource rents at the subnational level are often linked to poor quality
spending and a rise in rent seeking. To illustrate, between 2002 and 2010, more than 600
territorial entities had their access to royalties temporarily suspended. This suggests that
decentralization of resource rents is risky and must be accompanied by capacity building at
the subnational level.

A1.13. Royalties-dependent subnational entities are also subject to commodity price
volatility risks. Departments, such as Casanare, Meta, Arauca, and Huila are highly
dependent on royalties payments, while general government transfers have become a marginal
share of their total revenues. For this reason, commodity price volatility is directly translated
into local government budget fluctuations.

A1.14. Recognizing the design deficiencies of the existing royalties system, the
Government has proposed to reform it. As a first step, Congress approved a Constitutional
Amendment on June 9, 2011. A second step will be the approval of an accompanying
Royalties Law. A new royalties system will be fully functional from mid-2012 at the earliest.
The main elements of the Constitutional amendment are summarized below.

A1.15. The constitutional amendment defines the General Royalties System which differs
markedly from the existing system. The System does not form part of the national budget
nor of the regular fiscal transfer system to subnational entities (SGP), but works in parallel to
these. Fiscal resources within the proposed General Royalties System will be allocated to a

     See for instance Perry and Olivera (2009) or Ministry of Finance (2010b) for a detailed analsyis.
                                                          55
number of special purposes and Funds: (1) A Science, Technology and Innovation Fund, (2)
Subnational Pension Fund (FONPET) replenishment42, (3) A Subnational Savings and
Stabilization Fund, (4) Producing municipalities and departments will receive a smaller share
of the so-called direct royalties (adjusted over a transition period), (5) A Regional
Development Fund to finance regional investment projects, (7) A Regional Compensation
Fund to compensate poor areas during a transition period of 30 years, and (8) Supervision and
control of the exploration and exploitation of oil fields and mines and underground geological
research and mapping.

A1.16. The Subnational Stabilization Fund complements the National Stabilization Fund
created by the Fiscal Rule. Given that volatile revenues from natural resources extraction
are diverted both to the national level (through income tax payments and dividends) and the
subnational level (through the royalties system), it is useful that mechanisms to stabilize
revenue fluctuations exist at both levels. The Subnational Stabilization Fund will be
administrated by the Central Bank. In the first year of operation, twenty-five percent of total
royalties will be destined for the Fund. In subsequent years, the annual take of the
Stabilization Fund may not exceed 30 percent of the total. The Government has emphasized
that the resources of the Fund will be channeled back to the subnational entities and will not
be appropriated by the Central Government.


B. Social Security Liability Management

Health

A1.17. The key factors explaining the fiscal pressures arising in the health care system
include: (a) the lack of an adequate legal and regulatory framework to foster improved quality
with delivery of goods and services within the framework of evidenced-based medicine, (b) a
strong expansion in subsidized (as opposed to contributory) health insurance coverage, (c)
rapid growth of supply-induced health care demand outside the Mandatory Benefit Package,
and (d) the policy of harmonizing the Mandatory Benefit Package for all individuals covered
by health insurance by July 2014.

121. Colombia lacks an adequate legal and regulatory framework to foster preventive
approaches and to fully exploit the potential advantages of the existing financing model.
International experience suggests that long-term fiscal sustainability requires increased
efficiency and a renewed emphasis on the primary health care approach. For Colombia this
would represent a shift from the current emphasis on curative services to a more
comprehensive approach fostering better integration of delivery networks, health promotion
and prevention. However important challenges to ensure that the health insurance system can
progressively attain greater equality in access to quality services remain. Furthermore, the
current regulatory framework has resulted allocation important resources to reimburse health
plans for goods and services that do not address the priority needs of bulk of the population.




42
  Subnational pension liabilities totaled COP 95 billion (17 percent of GDP) in 2010 of which 28 percent were
covered by FONPET.
                                                     56
A1.18. Health care access has improved substantially over the decade, however the lack
of adequate regulation and shortcomings of the contributory regime coverage expansion
have eroded the foundations of the current financing model. The Colombian health
insurance system consists of two regimes: (a) a Contributory Regime financed mainly through
payroll taxation of formal workers, and (b) a Subsidized Regime financed through national
and subnational budgets and through transfers from the Contributory Regime. Between 2002
and 2009, health care coverage increased impressively from 60 to 94 percent of the population
as an additional 17.6 million persons were affiliated. While a very positive development,
around three quarters of new enrollees were covered by the Subsidized Regime such that, by
2010, only 39 percent of the population was associated with the Contributory Regime while
55 percent formed part of the Subsidized Regime. Among the underlying reasons for this
development were: a slower-than-anticipated growth in the size of the formal labor market
(the share of informal employment in Colombia is one of the highest in the region); and,
evasion, whereby individuals avoid forming part of the Contributory Regime and the formal
labor market, while accessing benefits through the Subsidized regime. Cross-comparisons of
databases reveal that more than three hundred thousand individuals are associated with the
subsidized regime when they ought to form part of the contributory one (Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit, 2010a). The resources lost to evasion (0.13 percent of GDP) would, in
theory, have been sufficient to pay for an additional 2.7 million persons in the Subsidized
Regime.

A1.19. Rapid growth in expenses outside the Mandatory Benefit Package also poses a
threat to health care finances. In the period prior to 2009, payroll contributions made by
members of the Contributory Regime were sufficient to cover the health care costs of this
regime even after deducting the solidarity payments to the Subsidized Regime. In 2009, for
the first time, this clearing fiscal account (FOSYGA, Fondo de Solidaridad y Garantía)
registered a deficit of 0.14 percent of GDP, thus rapidly exhausting the limited savings of the
Contributory Regime. The expansion of reimbursements to the insurance companies (EPS)
for diagnostic and therapeutic goods and services not covered by the Mandatory Benefit
Package was a major contributing factor with most of the costs (87 percent) relating to high-
cost pharmaceutical products. These reimbursements rose from 0.9 to 17.0 percent of total
health spending in 2003-09 (COP 2,400 billion).

A1.20. This development was largely the result of misaligned financial incentives,
information asymmetry and supply-induced demand. Financial incentives for health plans
to use loopholes in the definition of the Mandatory Benefit Package foster the use of legal
procedures by beneficiaries to finance health care goods and services delivered outside the
scope of the Mandatory Benefit Package. The analysis of the case of chronic kidney disease
by Chicaiza (2005) illustrates problems of asymmetry of information and supply-induced
demand, and suggests a lack of adequate regulatory institutions and enforceable mechanisms
aimed at correcting market imperfections and establishing guidelines for diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures. An important part of the problem resides in the absence of a systemic
approach and the lack specific criteria to update the Mandatory Benefit Package. These
factors have generated loopholes and gray areas in the definition of the Mandatory Benefit
Package which are considered to be an important contributing factor that fostered perverse
incentives for irrational use of costly medicines that have to be reimbursed by FOSYGA.



                                              57
A1.21. The policy of unifying the Mandatory Benefit Package provided in the two
regimes adds to the fiscal burden of the system. The Mandatory Benefit Package in the
subsidized regime is similar to that of the contributory regime in terms of coverage for low
and high complexity/high cost interventions, but the Mandatory Benefit Package in the
subsidized regime does not cover secondary and several tertiary level interventions.
Currently, the per capita unit cost (UPC) of the Contributory Regime is two-thirds higher than
the Subsidized Regime. Although the original vision of the reform was to progressively make
the two benefit packages similar, lower-than-expected formal employment growth rates and
fiscal constraints delayed the process. Dissatisfaction with the provision of services for the
subsidized regime have thus grown steadily over the years and patients have increasingly
resorted to seeking equal health care through a constitutionally mandated legal process known
as the Tutela. In 2008, the Constitutional Court (T-760) mandated the Government to provide
the same Mandatory Benefit Package to all patients irrespective of the regime the patient
belongs to. As it took office, the Santos administration agreed to have a Mandatory Benefit
Package for the subsidized regime similar to the contributory regime. In October 2010, the
Government started to provide health insurance coverage to minors. The same Mandatory
Benefit Package is to be provided to all minors irrespective of whether they are covered by
the subsidized or contributory regimes. The Constitutional Court ruling calls for the process
for all patients to take place no later than end-2015. The additional fiscal cost per year of
unification is estimated at about 0.5 percent of GDP.

A1.22. In 2009, the Government issued a series of emergency decrees to address the
health financing problems, though most of these were subsequently overruled by the
Constitutional Court. In light of the rapid deterioration of the financing situation, the Uribe
Administration declared a social emergency in December 2009 and decreed a package of
measures to increase revenues and manage spending. This included a higher VAT rate on
beer and gambling and adjusted consumption taxes on cigarettes and liquor. On the cost side,
the Government proposed to create a technical committee to approve spending outside the
Mandatory Benefit Package and the creation of a special fund to deal with this type of
spending, to be financed through earmarking of the tax measures. Most of these measures
were eventually declared invalid by the Constitutional Court in April 2010. Nonetheless, the
Court did recognize the critical financing situation of the health system, and on that basis, it
accepted the proposed revenue-enhancing measures. These measures, along with actions to
reduce evasion, became permanent through Law 1393 of July 2010. While the approved
measures (expected to yield 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent of GDP in 2010 and 2011,
respectively) may have been sufficient to deal with the short-term liquidity pressures, further
reforms are needed to address long-term sustainability of the system.

Pension43

A1.23. The Colombian Pension System is characterized by a lack of fiscal sustainability,
low coverage and inequity. These weaknesses have been present to varying degrees since
the system was created in 1946. Although the 1993 reform (and to a lesser extent those of
2003 and 2005) brought substantial progress, these three challenges remain substantial.

43
   The discussion of Pension liabilities presented here is limited, given the fact that this DPL does not support
any prior actions addressing these. Nonetheless, given that Pension liabilities constitute the most substantial
fiscal challenge for the Government, the basic problems of the system will be discussed. For a comprehensive
analysis see Santa Maria et al (2010).
                                                       58
A1.24. The System is characterized by a two-pillar design with two mutually exclusive
regimes. This includes the defined benefit regime (prima media) and the defined contribution
or individual savings regime (ahorro individual). In comparison, other Latin American
pension systems consist of two or three pillars which include a taxation-financed defined
benefit pillar for the poorest part of the population and a defined contribution pillar of
voluntary savings for high-income individuals. The Colombian design has exacerbated the
three fundamental challenges mentioned above.

A1.25. Fiscal viability of the defined benefit regime is undermined by over-generous
benefits compared to modest contributions. Contributions within the defined benefit
regime only cover between 28 and 58 percent of the benefit payments on an annual basis.
Given that this regime does not have any savings (the Pension Fund was exhausted in 2004),
the residual is covered through transfer from the central government budget, i.e. it is covered
by general taxation. Pension benefits cannot fall below one minimum wage – a principle
established in the Constitution since 2005 – and may reach 25 times the minimum wage.
(Colombia’s minimum wage is relatively high in a regional perspective.) The replacement rate
varies between 65 and 85 percent of the average salary of the worker over the past decade.
Workers can retire at the age of 60 (men) and 55 (women) and need to contribute for at least
1,200 weeks (about 23 years). The average monthly pension is equivalent to the average
formal sector wage. There are no mechanisms to ensure fiscal sustainability within the
defined benefits regime, and given existing parameters, it is fiscally unsustainable.44

A1.26. Transfers to the Pension System represent one of the largest expenditure items in
the national budget. In 2010, the Central Government spent COP 18,232 billion (US$9.6
billion or 3.4 percent of GDP) on such transfers. This represents one fifth of total Central
Government spending. These outlays exceeded other major expenditure groups such as
wages and salaries (2.1 percent of GDP), goods and services (1.2 percent of GDP) and interest
payments (2.7 percent of GDP). The amount only falls short of transfers to subnational
entities to cover education, health and sanitation (4.2 percent of GDP). Alternatively, it
corresponds to 90 percent of revenues raised from the value added tax. Pension transfers
have increased substantially since the early 1990s. In 1990-95, transfers averaged 1 percent
of GDP while gradually increasing to 2.5 percent in 2003 and above 4 percent in 2004.

A1.27. Future unfunded pension commitments constitute the Government’s largest long-
term liability. Estimates vary, but according to the National Planning Department,
Colombia’s pension liabilities total approximately 110 percent of GDP. Parametric reforms
implemented over the past decade (2003 and 2005) have had a positive impact on pension
liabilities, reducing them by about 60 percent of GDP. It is important to bear in mind,
however, that Colombia’s liabilities only cover about 25 percent of the population, whereas in
other developed countries liabilities cover 80-90 percent of the population.




44
  By comparison, the system of individual savings accounts is sustainable by design, as savers would need to
save enough capital (110 percent of the minimum pension) to receive a pension. Total savings reached 20
percent of GDP in 2010, thereby contributing to the aggregate savings and to capital markets development.
                                                    59
A1.28. Several factors contribute to increased pension liabilities, including:
 Demographic change. The current pensionable ages of 62 and 57 years for men and
   women, respectively, were established in 1966. Life expectancy at the pensionable aged
   has increased by about 7 years since the 1990s.
 Within-regime migration. There is a strong incentive for members of the defined
   contribution regime to migrate to the defined benefit regime, as members close to the
   retirement age stand to receive a substantially higher pension in the latter. Since 2007,
   more than half a million members have migrated.
 Labor market outcomes. The pension system is to a large degree a reflection of the
   labor market. The rate of informality in Colombia remains high and by implication,
   informal workers neither contribute to nor receive a pension.

A1.29. On the other hand, parametric reforms implemented in 2003 and 2005 will start
to have an impact from 2015 onwards. The deficit of the pension system, which is
currently covered by general budget transfers, is projected to fall gradually over the next 35
years from about 3.4 percent of GDP today to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2050.

A1.30. Pension system coverage is remarkably low. By 2010, only 26 percent of the
pension age population received a pension (about 1.4 million people). While this is a
moderate improvement from 1995, when only 16 percent received one, it is notable that three
out of four persons in the pension age in Colombia do not receive a pension. Meanwhile,
about 45 percent of the labor force contributes towards a pension. The latter group, however,
must contribute for sufficiently long to earn one. If they retire before doing so, then the
System will return their contributions without interest.

A1.31. Transfers to the public pension system are highly regressive. A benefit-incidence
analysis reveals that the majority of pension spending (86.3 percent) is received by the richest
quintile of the population.45 The second richest quintile receives 11.1 percent, while the three
poorest quintiles receive the residual (2.4 percent). Given the size of pension transfers, total
public monetary transfers (i.e. including conditional cash transfers) are actually regressive.
The pension spending alone increases the Gini coefficient by 1.63. By law, pensioners are
also exempt of income tax, even if they have a job, although they are required to form part of
the Contributive regime of the health care system.

A1.32. Despite the need for further parametric reforms, the National Congress has
shown a limited interest in supporting parametric reforms of the Pension System since
2005. This point can be illustrated by a recent proposal by the Santos Administration, through
the National Development Plan Law, to increase the retirement age from 62 to 65 years for
men and from 57 to 62 years for women. Even though this proposal would only become
effective from year 2040, it proved to be so controversial, that the Executive had to withdraw
it from the Law. The Government has, however, indicated that it intends to bring a new
proposal forward of increasing the retirement age by at least two years despite strong popular
opposition.46

  A Gallup Poll found that 78 percent of the population are against an increase in the pensionable age to ensure
that there are enough fiscal resources to finance pensions (February 25th, 2011).

Fiscal implications of legal processes

A1.33. The legal framework and judicial system also have an important influence on
fiscal policy and outcomes in Colombia. First, because of litigation against the State arising
from various legal disputes, such as government contracts, labor and land issues. According
to the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (2011), the net present value for 2011-21 which
the Colombian Government could potentially lose in law suits ranges between 12 and 71
percent of GDP (US$39-227 billion). Second, as a result of the interplay between the
Executive, Congress, and the Judiciary. The Constitutional Court judicial review process,
which plays an important role in Colombia’s democratic system of checks and balances,
occasionally has implications for government fiscal revenues and expenditures. Initiatives by
the Government and Congress to raise tax revenues (e.g. value added and other taxes) have
sometimes been declared unconstitutional by the Court. Similarly, on the expenditure side,
the Court has declared unconstitutional elements of past pension reforms approved by
Congress with implications for total pension liabilities. It has also ruled in favor of the rights
of health patients to ensure coverage of services not otherwise covered by the Mandatory
Benefit Package. While these rulings have some benefits for social development, it is also
important to be mindful of their implications for fiscal sustainability.

A1.34. To encourage judicial rulings to explicitly consider their fiscal implications,
Congress has approved a constitutional amendment to include ‘fiscal sustainability’ as a
criterion. The Fiscal Sustainability proposal was conceived by the outgoing Uribe
Administration and carried forward by the incoming Santos Administration. It was approved
by Congress on June 9, 2011. The amended Article 334 of the 1991 Constitution emphasizes
that while the State is responsible for the attainment of positive rights (Estado Social de
Derecho) of its citizens, it should proceed progressively towards the attainment of such rights
and use a framework of fiscal sustainability as an instrument. The amended Article 334 also
facilitates a ‘fiscal sustainability review’ of court rulings, which can be requested by the
Attorney General or a Minister. In this review, a hearing will be held regarding the fiscal
consequences of implementing a specific court ruling. The hearing may result in a
modification of the ruling. Similarly, the criterion of fiscal sustainability should guide all the
organs of the State in ‘harmonic collaboration’. Finally, the amendments to Articles 339 and
346, state that the National Development Plan and the national budget should be developed
within a framework of fiscal sustainability. The amended Constitution stresses the criterion
of fiscal sustainability cannot be invoked to affect fundamental rights or entitlements.

C. Disaster Risk Financing Management

A1.35. Colombia is more exposed to natural disaster risk than other developing
countries. A high rate of urbanization, compounded by the location of major cities in areas
of risk, have brought with them growing vulnerability to adverse natural events. Population
growth and the increasing concentration of settlements, assets and infrastructure mean that
vulnerability to natural hazard events is on the rise. Global climate changes, resulting in
increased climatic variability is also likely to exacerbate the country’s exposure.

A1.36. Colombia faces several different types of natural hazards, including landslides,
hydro-meteorological events, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Historical data
available since 1970) shows that hydro-meteorological events, such as the recent La Niña,
have imposed by far the largest burden in terms of personal and economic losses, as
summarized in Table A1.1 (illustrating a return period of four years averages rather than
totals). Over the last three decades close to 10,000 people have died and more than 14 million
people have been affected just from recurrent small scale disasters like flooding and
landslides. More than 1 million people were affected by various flood events in 2007, while
the 2010-11 La Niña phenomenon affected about 3 million people.

A1.37. Colombia is experiencing increasing economic losses as a result of natural
hazards. This trend is a phenomenon also observed in many other developing countries
owing to common drivers such as urbanization, environmental degradation and climate
change. As Figure A1.2 illustrates, economic losses in Colombia ranged from US$500
million to US$1 billion per four-year presidential period between 1970 and 1994. Since 1994,
losses have exceeded US$2 billion. The maximum historical loss occurred in the 1999
earthquake in the coffee-growing region of the country (Eje Cafetero) and had an economic
cost of about US$1.6 billion. This figure is likely to be exceeded by the 2010 La Nina,
though economic loss figures are not yet available. For reasons described above, economic
losses in Colombia tend to be larger than that of the average middle income country. In 2002-
06, for instance, losses were equivalent to 1.6 percent of GDP in Colombia and 1.0 percent of
GDP in the average middle income country.

A1.38. Natural hazards represent an important fiscal contingent liability. The challenges
related to the recent La Niña phenomenon were discussed in Box I, Section II. However,
aside from this disaster event, recurring natural hazards, more generally, represent a
substantial fiscal contingent liability that can be quantified, analyzed and potentially
mitigated. The liability is both explicit in the case that public property is damaged, but also
implicit in the sense that the public, especially the poor, may expect some compensation from
the Government.

A1.39. The contingent liability associated with natural hazards ranges between 11 and
18 percent of GDP. To facilitate comparisons with other public sector liabilities, the net
present value of the expected annual fiscal loss associated with natural hazards for the 2011-
50 period was computed (see Box A1.1 for details). The total value exposed is equivalent to
US$173.2 billion (64 percent of GDP), including publically owned assets and the private
assets of low-income groups. The fiscal value at risk is then computed by adjusting the value
exposed with the probability of a disaster event, which yields US$316 million per year (in
2010 prices).

A1.40. Natural hazards are one of the most important fiscal risks for the agricultural
sector. Preliminary estimates suggest that agricultural losses of the La Niña episode amount
to approximately US$300 million. More generally, losses in agriculture related to natural
disasters amounted to 12 percent of agricultural GDP in (1971-2002 average), according to
IDB (2006). The occurrence of losses in the sector exerts political pressure on the
Government to compensate affected farmers and rural households through farmer subsidies,
housing reconstruction and debt restructuring programs. In the absence of insurance
mechanisms, farmers frequently turn to the Government for compensation. This, in turn,
implies that the government bears a substantial part of the risks in the agricultural sector.

             Box A1.1: Estimating Contingent Liabilities of Natural Hazards
The purpose of this Box is to detail the estimation of the contingent liabilities associated
with natural hazards in Colombia. The point of departure is a study prepared by the
Economic Research Network (ERN, 2011) which contains probabilistic modeling of natural
hazards for Colombia and Mexico. The study uses recent advances in risk modeling which
improve the precision of loss estimates based on mathematical probability of future events
rather than on the historical frequency of such events.

The expected direct losses from adverse natural events in Colombia are estimated at
US$316 million per year. According to ERN (2011), the total value of assets exposed is
equivalent to US$173.2 billion (64 percent of GDP), including publically owned
infrastructure and the private housing of low-income groups. The fiscal value at risk is then
computed by adjusting the value exposed with the probability of a disaster event (Table
A1.2).

The net present value of expected losses in 2011-50 ranges between 11 and 18 percent of
GDP. To facilitate comparisons with other liabilities of the Colombian Government (such as
pensions or health care), the net present value of the contingent liabilities associated with
natural hazards for the 2011-50 period was computed. As a first step, it is necessary to
account for the rising nominal value of the annual loss estimate, i.e. the value of public and
private assets exposed. In the absence of historical data of nominal asset valuation in
Colombia this is proxied by using the annual growth in projected long-term nominal GDP (10
percent). Subsequently, the net present value for 2011-50 of the average annual loss is
computed. Depending on the discount rate used (4 to 6 percent), the NPV ranges between 11
and 18 percent of Colombia’s GDP for 2010 (Table A1.2). A discount rate in this range is
used when computing social security liabilities.

Subject: Letter of Development Policy – First Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability and Growth
Resilience DPL

Estimado Señor Zoellick,

The Government of Colombia is conscious of the importance of a responsible fiscal policy to support
macroeconomic stability. In this context, Colombia is pursuing economic policies that contribute to
sustainable medium-term economic growth and lower rates of unemployment without compromising
fiscal sustainability.

The strengthened macroeconomic stability observed in Colombia has been the result of coherent
economic management, including the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, supported by a solid
financial sector, and a flexible exchange rate. Economic policy is based on three pillars: First, a
responsible fiscal policy, which prioritizes social spending and public investment without
compromising public debt sustainability. Second, an inflation-targeting and counter-cyclical monetary
policy which supports growth stability. Under this arrangement, Colombia met the long-term inflation
target of 3.0 percent in 2010 – a result which particularly benefits the poor. The third and final pillar
consists of the macro prudential measures which serve to strengthen the financial system.

Sound and coherent macroeconomic management was an important explanatory factor both for the
economic resilience that Colombia exhibited during the global financial crisis as well as for the rapid
economic recovery. In fact, Colombia was one of the few countries that managed to successfully
escape the effects of the global crisis. Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s have returned Colombia to
investment grade status for its foreign-currency denominated government debt. This demonstrates the
confidence in the effectiveness of the reforms that Colombia is carrying forward and the sound
economic fundamentals. S&P justified the rating increase as follows: ‘the improved credit rating
reflects the growing resilience of Colombia’s economy to withstand external shocks such as the recent
global financial crisis, which demonstrated the capacity to use countercyclical fiscal and monetary
policies and the expectation that fiscal revenues would grow and the debt to GDP ratio would stabilize
in the medium term’.

Despite this progress, the Government recognizes that many challenges remain to ensure a sustainable
medium-term growth trajectory which through improved competitiveness would facilitate employment
generation, poverty reduction, and as a result, improve equality of opportunities. For that reason,
fiscal policy reforms for the next four years have been designed to contribute to fiscal and
macroeconomic stability, and employment generation to contribute to the promotion of economic
growth and productivity.

In this context, the Government of Colombia has requested the support of the World Bank through a
Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan. The loan
supports a fiscal management program in three key areas: (i) improved budget predictability and
stability, (ii) improved management of social security liabilities, and (iii) improved disaster risk
financing management. The program, which forms part of the National Development Plan, supports

                                                   71
the following reforms: a fiscal rule, a tax reform, the development of a medium-term debt management
strategy, improved Treasury Single Account coverage, a health law, measures to rationalize the
reimbursements outside the Mandatory Benefit Package of the contributive regime of the health
insurance system, financial protection strategy against natural disasters risk, and the creation of a risk
directorate in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

The Government presented to Congress the Fiscal Rule Bill of Law to improve fiscal long-term fiscal
sustainability and macroeconomic stability. The central government will target a 0 percent structural
deficit by 2022. In the transition period, the Government would target a structural central government
deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2014 and 1.9 percent in 2018. The Law also creates a
Macroeconomic and Fiscal Savings and Stabilization Fund to facilitate counter-cyclical fiscal policy.

In the last quarter of 2010, Congress approved important changes in the tax system. These reforms
increase the tax revenue, eliminate distortions, and stimulate an increase in productivity. The major
elements of the tax reform include: (a) the elimination of the tax credit for investment in fixed assets
of firms, (b) closing of loopholes of the financial transactions tax, (c) a gradual phase-out of the
financial transaction tax, (d) a reduction of the energy surcharge levied on firms, and (e) an increase
in the base and temporary rate hike of the wealth tax. Congress also recently approved a series of
reforms with two major objectives: (i) to stimulate employment generation and reduce labor
informality significantly, and (ii) to support the business sector through the adoption of measures that
reduce firm costs as a strategy to partly reduce the tendency of currency appreciation.

For more than a decade, the Government has recognized the importance of an appropriate management
of its debt portfolio and its positive impact on medium- and long-term economic and fiscal stability. It
has come a long way in terms of the development of policies and methodologies, and the culture of
managing debt portfolio risks has improved. These developments have not gone unnoticed within the
country and Colombia has also gained the reputation of being a pioneer on the international stage. The
Government, through the Public Credit and Treasury department, has reduced exchange rate, interest
rate and refinancing risks, thereby protecting the public finances from the volatility of the financial
markets.

Exchange rate risk: The exchange rate risk of the portfolio was reduced, thereby diminishing the
impact on public finances of a possible depreciation of the Colombian Peso which would increase the
local currency cost of servicing the debt and the nominal value of the debt stock. This had the effect
of: i) reducing the share of external debt from 71 percent in 1996 to 29 percent in 2010, which
demonstrates the importance of developing the domestic debt market, and ii) to reduce the share of
Euro and Yen within the external debt portfolio and simultaneously increase the share of denominated
in Colombian Pesos and USD – where there is a natural hedge with the portfolio of international
reserves denominated mainly in USD.

In terms of transactions, the Government managed to issue local currency denominated bonds in
international markets while achieving a longer maturity of this paper rising from 5 years to between 10
and 20 years. In some cases financing was obtaining at a cost lower than the local public debt market.
In 2010, external debt denominated in Colombian Pesos, represented 15 percent of external debt.

Interest rate risk: This risks was also managed prudently by increasing the share of external debt with
a fixed interest rate from 52 percent in 1996 to 80 percent in 2010. Moreover, the bulk of domestic
debt also has fixed interest rates. The combined effect of these actions was a reduced exposure of
public finances to an increase in the domestic or international interest rates.

Refinancing risk: The average maturity of external debt was increased by 4.3 years in 2006 to 11.6
years in 2011, while that of domestic debt (treasury bills) increased from 1.8 years in 2006 to 3.8 years

                                                   72
in 2011. This extension of maturities implies a reduced concentration of debt amortizations and a
reduced exposure to negative changes in market conditions.

In terms of specific transactions, the Government fixed the interest rate of the USD 3.696 billion debt
portfolio with the IDB and the USD 2.597 with the World Bank, thereby taking advantage of
historically low interest rates in international markets during 2009. During this year, therefore, the
Government fixed the interest rate of a total of USD 6.292 billion of its debt. Successful issuance of
new debt in international markets with a maturity of up to 20 years in local currency and in UVR
(Unidades de Valor Real, real unit value) up to 15 years. A number of debt management operations
also took place, for instance during 2009 debt management operations for an amount of COP 13,600
billion in which maturities were extended and the disbursement profile smoothened. During 2010,
similar operations were executed to the tune of COP 4,100 billion.

The Government of Colombia, through the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, is also working to
manage asset and liabilities risks. The National Development Plan identifies a number of tasks related
to the debt management, rules and procedures for optimizing the administration of government assets,
and for efficient cash management.

The development of a Medium-term Debt Management Strategy, as outlined in the National
Development Plan, will support efforts to consolidate debt management policy and support the
objective of debt sustainability. This Strategy will consist of a set of guidelines for debt management
with the objective of guaranteeing debt sustainability, according to article 364 of the Constitution
incorporating into its definition an integral evaluation of the revenues as well as the expenditures of
                                                       73
the budget, as well as an identification of the components and correlations between the principal
revenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities. Moreover, the Strategy would take into consideration
market restrictions, the coordination of macroeconomic policy to define the desired debt composition.
The Strategy would also define the instruments and tools which should be adopted to manage the
budget balance as well as defining the legal framework which would support this management.

Another focus area for the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit is the improved efficiency of the
Treasury Single Account. The National Development Plan Law allows the Ministry to integrate cash
management of different public entities and establishments into the Treasury Single Account in order
to improve efficiency and control of budget execution and to optimize cash resources. It is expected
that implementing regulation will be issued over the next 12 months according to the framework
established in the National Development Plan Law

Fiscal risks may also materialize and increase as a result of sectoral demands, in particular those
related to rising spending related to health service provision. Expenditures related to reimbursements
for services provides outside the Mandatory Benefit Package have increased from 330 billion pesos in
2006 to 2,400 billion pesos en 2010 and the bulk of this increase is explained by rising pharmaceutical
costs. To improve the rational use of pharmaceuticals and to improve the fiscal sustainability of the
health insurance system Law 1438 of 2011, and Ministerial Resolutions 4377-2010, 1020-2011 and
1083-2011 introduce measures that improve the regulation, control and reduction of these
expenditures. The National Development Plan, along with other short-term complementary measures,
include the update of the Mandatory Benefit Package, the establishment of a technical-scientific
institute to evaluate health technologies, and the development of an integral policy of pharmaceuticals.

The National Development Plan also emphasizes the strengthening of mechanisms for prevention and
mitigation of natural disaster risks in order to identify alternative ways through which to avoid the
devastating consequences that can occasionally arise from natural disasters, as illustrated by the
impact of the heavy and prolonged rainfall that hit the country in the end of 2010 and the beginning of
2011. In particular, the Plan focuses on adjustments in: (i) strengthening information systems and
monitoring for the management of environmental risks at the national and subnational levels, (ii)
programs for reconstruction, rehabilitation and prevention in infrastructure, housing and agriculture,
(iii) the strengthening of climate change components in the economic, social and institutional sectors,
and (iv) the strengthening of institutional and financial mechanisms to improve agricultural risk
management. It should be emphasized that the National Development Plan authorizes the Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit to design a national disaster financing strategy.

IMF Executive Board Approves New Two-Year US$6.22 Billion Flexible Credit
Line Arrangement for Colombia
Press Release No. 11/165
May 6, 2011
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund today approved a successor
two-year arrangement for Colombia under the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) in an amount
equivalent to SDR 3.87 billion (about US$6.22 billion). The Colombian authorities stated
that they intend to treat the arrangement as precautionary and do not intend to draw on
the line.
Colombia’s first FCL was approved on May 11, 2009 (see Press Release No. 09/161) and
a successor one-year arrangement was approved on May 7, 2010 (see Press Release No.
09/186).
Following the Executive Board discussion of Colombia, Mr. John Lipsky, First Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chairman of the Board, made the following statement:
“Colombia’s strong economic performance has been underpinned by a sound institutional
framework and skillful macroeconomic management. Countercyclical policy support has
paved the way for the recovery; a credible inflation targeting regime has anchored
inflation expectations; and exchange rate flexibility has cushioned the impact of external
shocks and large capital inflows. Strong supervisory and regulatory oversight has
underpinned the soundness of the domestic financial system. Furthermore, FCL
arrangements in 2009 and 2010 have contributed to preserving sentiment and market
access.
“In view of the favorable near-term outlook, the authorities intend to unwind fiscal
support and normalize monetary conditions as the recovery becomes self-sustaining and
slack is taken up. Fiscal reforms in train will also strengthen the medium-term budgetary
framework and economic prospects.
“In the authorities’ view, Colombia remains exposed to downside risks, including from
severe commodity price fluctuations and other adverse external developments. Under
these circumstances, the authorities have requested a new FCL arrangement, which
would provide appropriate insurance against shocks. The authorities intend to treat the
arrangement as precautionary.
“The Executive Board today approved Colombia’s request for a two-year arrangement
under the FCL. The augmented duration and size of this successor FCL—new features
made possible by the recent IMF facilities reform—will allow the FCL to play an even
stronger role in insuring Colombia against external risks while continuing to support the
authorities’ overall macroeconomic strategy.”
