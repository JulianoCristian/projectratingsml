Implementation Completion and Results Report for a Fiscal Sustainability and
Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan Series to the Republic of Colombia

      1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) describes the results of the
Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience Developing Policy Loan
(DPL) series to the Republic of Colombia. The programmatic series consisted of two
loans amounting to a total of US$500 million (US$ 300 million and US$200 million,
respectively). The World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved the first operation
on July 21, 2011 and the second operation on November 13, 2012. The operation was
closed on June 30, 2013. 1

2.      The overall aim of the program was to enhance fiscal sustainability and
strengthen resilience of economic growth. The program supported reforms that should
lead to a higher level of stability and predictability of expenses in the three interlinked
areas of fiscal revenues and expenses, social security liabilities, and disaster risk
spending.

1.1      Context at Appraisal

Appraisal of the first and second operation took place on June 8, 2011 and September 24,
2012, respectively.

3.     Prior to appraisal of the first operation, a new government assumed power
with high public support. President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón from the Social Party
of National Unity was elected by 69.13 percent of the popular vote in the second round
and inaugurated on August 7, 2010. He resumed the center-right coalition of his
predecessor Álvaro Uribe, maintaining an absolute majority in both chambers of the
parliament and high popularity, which favored the implementation of policy reforms. At
the time, the political landscape was also influenced by the long-lasting armed conflict
with guerilla groups (FARC, ELN).

4.      Growth was strong and inflation contained. Colombia experienced relatively
high GDP growth rates in the decade prior to appraisal (4.3 percent average annual
growth). Even during the global financial crisis, growth rates stayed positive and
rebounded strongly in the course of 2010 and 2011 (see Figure 1). Inflation stayed below
4 percent after mid-2009 and thus in line with the goal set under the Central Bank’s
flexible inflation-targeting regime. 2 Colombia runs a persistent current account deficit of
tolerable magnitude (mostly below 3 percent of GDP, see

  This would have required an ICR by December, 2013. However, as most outcome indicators of the
operation target values at the end of 2013, an extension of the ICR submission deadline to April 10, 2014
has been granted.
2
  Besides from maintaining low and stable inflation over a longer-term range, the Central Bank tries to
stabilize output around its natural level and monitors financial stability issues. The Banco de la Republica

5.      Table 1) that is mainly financed through FDI flows, especially in the extractive
sector, which have been a relatively stable source of international finance. Export
competitiveness also suffered from an appreciation of the real exchange rate of almost 35
percent in the decade prior to appraisal of the first operation.

6.      The recent economic developments should be viewed against the backdrop of
a decline in poverty rates and robust progress on shared prosperity. Colombian
official extreme poverty drop from 17.7 to 10.4 percent between the years 2002 and 2012.
Poverty reduction has been accompanied by progress in shared prosperity, with the
income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population reaching 7.9 percent over the
period 2008-2012 compared to 5.2 percent for the total population. Colombia also
improved with respect to multidimensional poverty. 3 Colombia’s Multidimensional
Poverty Index (MPI) declined from 49 percent in 2003 to 27 percent in 2012. Transfers
played an important role in the observed reduction in extreme poverty over the decade.
While the income from transfers accounted for 5.7 percent of income for the bottom
quintile in 2002, it represented 16.1 percent of income for the same group in 2012. The
observed increase in the relative size of income from transfers coincides with the
expansion of conditional cash transfer programs, such as Familias en Accion (which
expanded from 514,000 households in 2005 to about 2.79 million households in 2012).
These statistics suggest that the expansion of safety nets was both well targeted and
effective in reducing poverty, particularly extreme poverty. However, it is worth noticing
that overall Colombia’s fiscal policy is still very weak as a redistribution tool, and
inequality excluding taxes and transfer is almost the same as after including it.

7.       Commodities, especially oil, were becoming increasingly important. In 2011,
fuel exports accounted for 68 percent of total merchandise exports (up from 41 percent in
2002); the share of food exports was almost 11 percent (down from 23 percent in 2002;
see Table 1). Figure 1 also highlights that Colombia’s GDP growth broadly moves in line
with changes in the oil price. 4 Commodities also contribute to about 12 percent to total
fiscal revenues in 2011 (up from 5 percent in 2003).

  Measured by the government since 2011.

  This does not necessarily mean that all correlation between oil prices and growth has a causal nature, as
the latter also reflects developments in global economic activity, foreign demand and financial conditions.

Quarterly GDP changes calculated on a year-on-year
basis.

8.      Growth moderated around appraisal of the second operation. In early 2012,
economic activity showed some signs of potential slowdown that materialized around
appraisal of the second operation: as year-on-year quarterly growth fell below 4 percent
in the second half of 2012, but recovered since (see Figure 1).The slowdown happened
against the background of a tightening cycle of the Central Bank, 5 weakening commodity
prices, increasing guerilla attacks on oil pipelines, and major strikes in the oil, mining,
coal, railway, and agriculture sectors in the fall of 2012. The domestic construction sector,
retail and—especially—manufacturing sales also experienced a slowdown in activity. In
addition the COP continued to appreciate vis-à-vis trading partners between appraisal in
June, 2011 and end of 2012 (by approximately 3.5 percent in real terms), putting
pressures on export competitiveness.




5
 As annual real GDP growth surged to nearly 6 percent in 2011 and the output gap closed, Colombia’s
Banco de la Republica raised its policy rate from 3 to 5.25 percent between end-2010 and February 2012.

9.       Colombia has accumulated a strong record of fiscal reforms that contributed
to a decline in the central government debt since 2002. Colombia introduced Law 358
in 1997 to better control sub-national debt levels, approved a fiscal responsibility law in
June 2003 (Ley 819) that also underpinned the formulation of a medium-term fiscal
framework, adopted reforms to strengthen the management and distribution of oil and
mining royalties in 2011 (constitutional articles 360 and 361), 6 and added a fiscal
sustainability principle as a constitutional criterion in the same year (articles 334, 339 and
346). 7 Prudent fiscal management resulted in a decline in central government debt over
the past decade (Figure 2). Central government debt decreased considerably in the years
prior to 2008. Even after the challenges of the global financial crisis, central government
debt stood at 33 percent of GDP at the time of appraisal of the first operation (see Table
1). More than half of this debt is denominated in domestic currency which reduces
exchange rate risk. Debt Sustainability Analysis prepared at the time of appraisal
suggested that the public debt was sustainable in the medium term, although vulnerable to
a slowdown in economic activity. In fact, the growth moderation in mid-2012 affected
non-oil tax revenues from record high levels in 2011.


6
  At the concept stage of the operation, it was planned to support the royalties reform of the GOC with the
program as well. However, it was not kept in the policy matrix because of uncertainties and potential risks
related to the legal implications of the reform and its precise social impact. See also the discussions at the
Concept Note Review Meeting held on May 2, 2011 in the respective Decision Note.

  Savings of this fund can be used to a limited extent to finance counter-cyclical stimulus during years in
which the output gap is 2 percentage points below potential.

10.      At the time of appraisal of the first operation, certain structural factors
posed risks to longer-term fiscal sustainability and effectiveness of the fiscal policy.
Although well managed and balanced, Colombia’s fiscal accounts were exposed to
different sources of contingent liabilities. For example, existing social security
obligations, demographic change and rising health care costs constituted serious
challenges. 8 Colombia is also considerably exposed to natural disasters which can cause a
shock to fiscal spending and debt levels. 9 Furthermore, expenditure rigidities put a
restrictive limit on prioritizing expenditures or implementing fiscal adjustments. On the
income side, the outlined economic reliance on commodities is reflected in fiscal
revenues and raises concerns about budget volatility and predictability.

11.     The Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience DPL series supported the
government’s reform agenda aimed at addressing the above-mentioned fiscal risks.
Given the outlined longer-term pressures on fiscal expenses, the shorter-term risk of
budget volatility, and the need to invest in structural change and expanded social transfers
to sustain economic growth, the government of Colombia considered fiscal reform a
development priority. This is also reflected in Colombia’s Development Plan and
Country Partnership Strategy, which explicitly refers to the improvement of fiscal and
social risk management. 10 The DPL thus supported necessary but country-owned long-
term oriented reforms in the area of fiscal adjustment, where the political economy is
usually difficult. Furthermore, the DPL built upon a strong relationship between the GOC
and the Bank in the area of fiscal management 11 and could hence rely on relevant
analytical work to support the operation.

  One reason for pressures in health costs was growing health service provisioning outside the Mandatory
Benefit Package that was thus subsidized by the government. This development also be seen in the context
of a jurisprudence of the Colombian Constitutional Court that often favored citizens’ protection of
fundamental social rights—especially the constitutional right to health—via a relatively easy to access
system (‘tutelas’). See, e.g., Ely Yamin, A. and O. Parra-Vera (2009): “How Do Courts Set Health Policy?
The Case of the Colombian Constitutional Court.” PLoS Medicine 6(2)
9
  As an example, shortly before appraisal of the first operation, in April 2011, Colombia suffered a rain-
induced flooding and related landslides that killed more than 100 people and left approximately 69,000
homeless. Another wave of flooding happened in fall 2011.
10
   PD1 (p. 36) and PD2 (p. 16) link the DPL to the Development Plan’s themes “Sustainable Growth and
Competitiveness” and “Environmental and Disaster Risk Management.” However, it can also be seen as a
contribution to the “Good Governance” objective. Similarly, PD1 (p. 36/37) and PD2 (p. 17) relate the
operation to the CPS themes “Inclusive Growth with Enhanced Productivity” and the long-term outcome of
improved fiscal, financial, and social risk management but it should also be supportive to the outcome of
improved public sector management and the CPS theme “Sustainable Growth with Enhanced Climate
Change Resilience” (with the related long-term outcome enhanced disaster risk management).

1.2   Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved in DPL 1)

PDOs: Enhanced fiscal sustainability and strengthened resilience of economic growth.

Key Outcome Indicators (at the time of the first operation):

   •   The Central Government fiscal deficit is reduced to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2013.
   •   Central Government non-oil tax revenue is increased to 12.5 percent of GDP in
       2013.
   •   An annual evaluation report of the medium term debt management strategy has
       been published by 2013.
   •   90 percent of payments in the National Budget System are effectuated through the
       Treasury Single Account in 2013.
   •   Reimbursements to health insurance companies from FOSYGA for medical
       services (procedures and medicines) outside the Mandatory Benefit Package of
       the contributive regime do not exceed COP 2,400 billion by 2013 (recurrent
       expenditure).
   •   The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has implemented three financial
       instruments to mitigate natural disaster risks by 2013, consistent with the
       recommendations of the national Disaster Risk Financing Strategy.

1.3    Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

12.    PDOs remained unchanged but key outcome indicators were revised during the
preparation of the second operation in the series. Changes are summarized below:

Two key outcome indicators were revised:
      I.   Instead of targeting a fiscal deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP in 2013, the indicator
           was changed to a structural fiscal balance of -2.4 percent of GDP.
     II.   The targeted non-oil tax revenue in 2013 was increased from 12.5 to 13.2
           percent of GDP.
Two key outcome indicators were dropped because the associated indicative triggers
were not transformed into prior actions:
    III.   90 percent of payments in the National Budget System are effectuated through
           the Treasury Single Account in 2013.
   IV.     An annual evaluation report of the medium term debt management strategy has
           been published by 2013.
Instead, two new key outcome indicators were introduced:
     V.    The Consultative Committee concludes in its annual statement that fiscal rule
           implementation is satisfactory by 2013.
   VI.     The coverage of agricultural insurance is increased to 1.2 percent of area
           cultivated.




                                              6
Justification and Recent Developments:

13.     Targeting the structural fiscal balance (I), which is the more appropriate indicator
than the fiscal deficit per se, became possible only before the second operation. As part of
the implementation of the fiscal rule, the government agreed on a methodology to track
the structure balance. This indicator was not available before the first operation because
of unsettled discussions about measurement and methodology issues.

14.    The indicator concerning the non-oil tax revenue (II) was revised upward in view
of strong revenue performance in 2011 against the background of the exceptionally
strong cyclical growth performance in the forerun of the second operation, which did not
prove to be sustainable.

15.     Indicators III & IV above, which related to the TSA and the evaluation report of
the medium term debt strategy were dropped because the associated indicative triggers
were not transformed into prior actions in the context of the second operation. Despite
these reform areas being no longer part of the results framework of the operation, the
government made progress, confirming their high commitment to reform:

16.     Reforms of debt and cash management turned out to be technically more
demanding than expected. Accordingly, the indicative triggers for this area were not
turned into prior actions and it was no longer reasonable to keep payments in the TSA as
an indicator (indicator III above). The delay in implementation did not reflect
unwillingness of the GOC to reform. In fact and the Ministry of Finance has issued
Decree 2785 in November 2013, which sets the TSA implementation path. It requires the
entities that form part of the TSA to transfer their resources to the TSA by December 31,
2014 and aims for full implementation in July, 2015.

17.    Similarly, the ambition to develop a ‘state-of-the-art’ medium-term debt
management strategy has resulted in a slower-than-expected trajectory of completing this
task, making the annual evaluation report (indicator IV above) inadequate. Nevertheless,
the government approved the country’s medium-term debt management strategy in late
2012, shortly after the operation. Currently, the Government produces an annual
evaluation report that was classified confidential and circulated internally but it is
planned to be publicly released within the next months.

18.     The newly introduced indicator on the fiscal rule implementation (V above)
helped ensure that the government sticks to the implementation of the overall important
fiscal rule. As, conversely, progress in social security and disaster risk management was
quicker than expected, new prior actions have been introduced in these areas and were
also reflected in the newly introduced outcome indicator (VI above).

1.4    Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

19.    The operation supported reforms in the area of budget predictability and stability.
Besides from measures directly relating to fiscal management, this also included
management of social security liabilities and disaster risk financing.

2.2      Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

21.     Economic growth moderated during the implementation period amid
receding tailwinds. Commodity prices remained at overall elevated levels but did not
rise further. After starting a decline in 2011, oil prices remained essentially flat after mid-
2012, and Colombia’s agricultural, coal and coffee exports experienced similar or even
less favorable price developments over the same period. The extractive industry sector
also experienced a number of short-term supply shocks due to the strikes and attacks
mentioned above. Furthermore, the construction sector, in which public projects are an
important component, stagnated in fall 2012 after rapid expansion in the preceding year.
The combination of these factors, together with sluggish export developments due to the
strong peso, weighted on growth and revenue collection in 2012 and early 2013. This had
an adverse impact on fiscal revenues due to their exposure to commodity income but also
weighed on the non-oil/GDP revenues through earning declines in the formal sector and
slowing consumption.

22.     Despite the initial change in its composition the government continued to
implement important reforms that contributed to upgrades by rating agencies and
an invitation to start OECD accession process. A reshuffling in the cabinet in mid-
August 2012 took place but did not significantly alter reform progress as most reform
actions by then have already been implemented. Generally, reform implementation speed
was heterogeneous as reforms of debt and cash management took longer than expected
while progress in social security and disaster risk management was quicker and
compensated for the former. The overall commitment to fiscal reform nevertheless


                                                           9
remained high, which was also reflected in an upgrading of Colombia’s foreign-currency
bond credit rating to investment grade in 2011 by all three major rating agencies and
further upgrades by Moody and Fitch in the second half of 2013. The relevance of fiscal
reform to the government can also be inferred from the fact that progress has been
achieved concerning indicators that were initial indicative triggers but had to be dropped
in the curse of the second operation because progress was slower than initially expected
due to technical difficulties (see section 1.3). Finally, Colombia’s overall reform progress
is also reflected by its accession to the OECD, which resulted in a formal roadmap for
future membership in September, 2013 and by an IMF Article IV mission that praised
Colombia’s “strong fiscal framework” in March 2014.

23.     Implementation was positively affected by complementary World Bank
activities. Building on analytical work and prior consultations were supportive to
implementation. The operation was not detached from other World Bank engagements or
government reform plans but well-integrated into a wider fiscal management program.
This included a wide range of analytical work (tax expenditure study, pension studies,
open source risk assessment) and close consultations with the GOC on planned reforms.
This facilitated the design of the operation in a manner that was consistent with the
expected implementation progress.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

24.      Design: The results framework comprised 6 indicators that were partially
modified in course of the second operation. These indicators were generally well-selected
in that they are relatively easy to measure and reasonably linked to the prior actions. Most
of the indicators were economically relevant and precise. The only exception is the
indicator requiring the implementation of three financial instruments to mitigate natural
disaster risks by 2013, which was relevant but not so precise. It possesses a level of
flexibility needed in this sector at appraisal stage.

25.     Implementation: The operation’s arrangements defined the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit (MHCP) and the National Planning Department (DNP) as responsible
for coordinating actions among the concerned agencies. The Department for Public
Credit within the MHCP was responsible for collecting and reporting the necessary data
to assess the implementation progress in the areas of MHCP’s responsibility. Similarly,
the Sub-directorate of Public Credit within the DNP was responsible for collecting and
reporting the information necessary to evaluate the implementation progress in areas for
which the Ministry of Social Protection is responsible. Together, these institutions
collected most of the data necessary to assess and report on implementation progress and
achievement of the outcome indicators.

2.4    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

26.     The consultations between the Bank and the GOC during preparation and
implementation of the program supported an expansion of initiatives in Colombia’s
fiscal sector. In parallel, taking advantage of the policy discussion generated by the
preparation of the DPL, the Bank engaged in a series of analytical and convening


                                            10
activities that helped to inform a sequence of reforms (such as the comprehensive 2012
tax reform and the implementation of the Agriculture Financing and Risk Directorate).
These activities also supported other follow up lending operations. Reforms linking fiscal
policy and redistribution have been supported by the follow-up DPL “Enhancing Fiscal
Capacity to Promote Shared Prosperity” that targeted equity aspects in the fiscal sector,
while an agenda of structural reforms to further support growth resilience are being
discussed as part of a new “Growth and Competitiveness” DPL that potentially tackles
the pillars of innovation, external trade facilitation, human capital, and access to finance.

      3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

27.     Relevance of Objectives: Significant. The program development objectives were
to enhance fiscal sustainability and strengthen resilience of economic growth. As outlined
in section 1.1 and subsection 3.4(b), the operation addressed exigent problems of
Colombia’s development process: sustaining the growth momentum, achieving further
progress in poverty reduction, and avoiding a ‘middle-income trap’ will require public
goods provisioning and an adequate fiscal framework. Furthermore, the fiscal position
had to be shielded from volatility in commodity prices and long-term spending pressures
in the areas of social protection and natural risk. The operation supported the GOC in
tackling these challenges. It thereby built on long-lasting relations with the GOC in the
public management sector and on the governments’ reform priorities in the field of public
sector management, sustainable growth, and competitiveness, which are evident in the
National Development Plan and the CPS.

28.    At the time of the DPL preparation the World Bank goals of ending poverty
and promoting shared prosperity had not been defined yet, therefore the operation
does explicitly deals with these issues. Nevertheless the operation was prepared within a
broader engagement between the government and the Bank on the redistributing and
growth promoting roles of fiscal policy (these analytical and convening works supported
the preparation of the “Enhancing Fiscal Capacity to Promote Shared Prosperity” DPL in
2013). Furthermore, the GOC prioritized macro-fiscal stabilization as a first step and the
relevance of this objective for poverty reduction can be substantiated. 12 Against the
background of sustaining growth momentum and a pending OECD accession, the GOC
also put growth and competitiveness issues center stage and meeting this demand might
have helped implementing the follow-up operations with higher equity relevance.

29.     Relevance of Design: High. The policy measures supported by the program and
the targeted indicators were well in line with the outlined objectives and chosen with
rationale. The program supported areas where the Bank was well-positioned to contribute

finance, knowledge, and convening services. The design focused on a well-defined set of
reforms without overburdening the program with other ongoing reform efforts in the area
that were accompanied by other Bank instruments (e.g. the royalties reform). This led to
a framework of clear prior actions and outcome indicators. The programmatic design of
the operation emphasizes the GOC and the Bank commitment with the program’s
objectives. The design as a two-program operation allowed putting more emphasis on
legislation in the first and on implementation in the second operation. This approach can
generally help to avoid potential implementation slippages.

3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives

30.     The overall PDO of enhancing fiscal sustainability and strengthening
resilience of economic growth was achieved. The fiscal framework of Colombia has
certainly improved over the last years with the help of the implemented program, together
with supporting and follow-up operations and other government reforms. As mentioned,
these achievements have been recognized through sovereign debt rating upgrading by
three rating agencies.

31.     There are solid linkages between the PDO, prior actions, and outcomes in the
design of the operation. The focus on a limited number of actions and indicators has
potentially added to achieving this linkage and corresponds to a recent trend in
Development Policy Lending. 13 These indicators do not exhaust all the different
dimensions of the PDO, they represent a select sample of critical dimensions that were
complemented by a broader government strategy. This complementarity with other
activities and reforms beyond the results framework is discussed in more details in the
“Lessons Learned” section. The outcome indicators supported by the operation and their
development are summarized below:




13
  According to OPCS’ 2012 DPL Retrospective (p. xii/xiii), the average number of prior actions per
operation equals 10, whereas the average number of indicators has come down from 28 to 14.

Notes: *: These are recurrent expenditures. Actual expenditures were 2,649 bn COP, including 265 bn COP
that FOSYGA reimbursed for previous years in which the reimbursement request had not been presented
on time. This amount shoud hence be allocated to the previous years.
(a) Baseline values are taken from the Program Document of the second operation. They reflect the
estimates at the time of appraisal and not necessarily the actually realized numbers. Particularly:
(b) The realized non-oil tax revenues were 11.7 and 12.5 percent of GDP in 2010 and 2011, respectively.
(c) The actually realized coverage of agricultural insurance was 0.86 and 0.91 percent of cultivated area in
2010 and 2011, respectively.
(d) This number is an estimate. Data on area cultivated is not available before April/May 2014. The
estimate assumes an increase of area cultivated of 7 percent which would equal the highest increase in the
last decade and largely corresponds to the increase of activity in the agricultural sector in 2013. Only an
increase of more than 13.4 percent would imply that the indicator would not be met, a quite unrealistic
assumption.

(a)      Improved budget predictability and stability

32.     Outcome Indicator 1: The central government structural fiscal balance is
reduced to -2.4 percent of GDP in 2013. 14 – Achieved. The program supported the
legislation of the Fiscal Rule Bill of Law as the centerpiece of fiscal reform, as well as
the establishment of a committee monitoring its implementation (Decree No. 1790) with


14
   This indicator initially requested that “The Central Government fiscal deficit is reduced to 3.2 percent of
GDP in 2013.” As outlined in section 1.3 it was changed to the above-mentioned indicator due to progress
in fiscal management and associated data availability.


                                                      13
the aim of improving fiscal discipline and counter-cyclical fiscal policy. Since the fiscal
rule targets a central government structural deficit of 1.0 percent of GDP by 2022,
including an interim target of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2014, the indicator clearly relates to
the supported reforms. As part of its implementation, the government agreed on a
methodology to calculate and track the indicator. The central government structural
deficit goal of -2.4 percent of GDP was met both in 2012 and 2013 in line with the long-
run deficit trajectory and the outcome indicator. Implementation of the Law was
complicated by finding adequate methodologies for measuring the structural balance. As
the Report on the Fiscal Rule Implementation in 2012, which is summarized in Annex 3,
concludes, formally setting up the Consultative Committee and the technical expert
groups for calculating the structural balance in the first half of 2013 was an essential step
for the implementation of the Fiscal Rule Law.

33.     Outcome Indicator 2: Central Government non-oil tax revenue is increased
to 13.2 percent of GDP in 2013. 15 – Partially achieved. The program supported
promulgation of Law No. 1430 and issuance of Presidential Decree No. 4825, which
implement tax administration measures expected to increase tax revenue by 0.6 percent
of GDP per year in 2011-2014. These measures aimed at closing tax loopholes and
increasing the rate and base of the wealth tax to hence support the achievement of a
sustainable budget path (as targeted with outcome indicator 1). The supported actions
thus have a strong connection to the targeted outcome indicator and had a significant
positive impact on non-oil revenues in the context of the first operation. 16 In fact, the
indicator targeted in the context of the first operation (12.5 percent of GDP) was already
achieved in 2011. This gave rise to an upward revision of the indicator by the Bank in the
context of the second operation. However, the observed growth slowdown in 2012 led to
a drop of non-oil revenues to 12.3 percent of GDP in 2012. While non-oil revenues
recovered to 12.9 percent of GDP in 2013 and thus met the target set at appraisal of the
first operation, the revised target of 13.2 percent of GDP was not fully met. However, it
should be mentioned that the upward revision of this indicator in the context of the
second operation was probably over-ambitious. Furthermore, this indicator is clearly
subordinate to the more important outcome indicator 1 which it is supposed to support
and which was fully achieved.

34.    Outcome Indicator 3: The Consultative Committee concludes in its annual
statement that fiscal rule implementation is satisfactory by 2013. 17 – Achieved. The
program supported Decree No. 1790 which, inter alia, mandated the creation of a
consultative committee to monitor the implementation of the Fiscal Rule Law. Such
monitoring is relevant to avoid reform slippage in de facto policy implementation of de
jure legislation supported by the program. The consultative committee held its first


15
   This indicator was initially set to 12.5 percent of GDP in the first program but then revised upwards to
13.2 percent at the second program in view of progress achieved thus far.
16
   It is estimated that tax collection actually improved by 1.3 percentage points of GDP in 2011 and
estimates that about a quarter can be attributed to the reforms concerning the wealth and financial
transaction tax supported by first operation.
17
   This indicator was newly introduced with the second operation to make up for the dropped outcome
indicators.


                                                    14
meeting in May 2013. It produced its first annual evaluation statement in December
2013, in which it concludes that the report of first year of implementation of the fiscal
rule (2012) was satisfactory. The report evaluating the year 2013, in which the targeted
fiscal balance was met as well, is expected for June 2014.

(b) Improved social security liability management

35.    Outcome Indicator 4: Reimbursements to health insurance companies from
the Solidarity and Guarantee Fund (FOSYGA) for medical goods and services
outside the Mandatory Benefit Package of the contributory regime do not exceed
COP 2,400 billion by 2013 (recurrent expenditure). –Achieved. The program
supported an update of the Mandatory Benefit Package of the contributive and subsidized
regimes, the legal criteria therefore (Law No. 1438), as well as certain legal regulations
for FOSYGA reimbursements (e.g. Resolution No. 1020) and their monitoring
(Resolution No. 1083) with the aim of establishing a comprehensive approach to ensuring
a sound reimbursement policy for pharmaceuticals. There is hence a strong rationale why
the supported reform should contribute to stabilizing FOSYGA reimbursements outside
the Mandatory Benefit Package. Favorable developments were already achieved in 2011
and 2012 and recurrent reimbursements amounted to COP 2,384 billion in 2013. The
Ministry of Finance expects the payments to decline again from 2014 onwards following
the implementation of the statutory and ordinary Health Reforms approved in 2013.

(c) Improved disaster risk financing management

36.     Outcome Indicator 5: The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP)
has implemented three financial instruments to mitigate natural disaster risks by
2013, consistent with the recommendations of the national Disaster Risk Financing
Strategy. – Achieved. The program supported the development of a national financing
strategy for natural disaster risk management. This included the development of financial
instruments, i.e. ex ante budgetary or market-based tools that contribute to increased
financial protection of the state against disasters. Targeting the existence of three related
financial instruments is quantitatively measurable and the fact that they were not
explicitly classified allowed for flexibility to identify well-suited instruments. The
government successfully put in place three instruments by 2013: a catastrophic DPL with
a deferred drawdown option of 250 million USD was signed with the World Bank in
2012, a financial protection sub-account of the National Fund for Disaster Risk
Management was put in place with Law 1523 of 2012, and mandatory standard terms and
conditions for the insurance of road and infrastructure against disaster risk (such as
flooding and earthquakes) entered into force in the context of the fourth generation of
public private partnerships concessions. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit and the Colombian Procurement Agency are currently developing a framework
agreement for the collective insurance for central government buildings that should enter
in force in the next months and the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit is conducting a
cost-benefit analysis concerning a Catastrophe Swap.

37.    Outcome Indicator 6: The coverage of agricultural insurance is increased to
1.2 percent of area cultivated. – Achieved. The program supported implementation of


                                             15
Law No. 1450 which, inter alia, reinforces incentives for agriculture risk management
instruments, in particular agricultural insurance. This should help raise insurance
coverage, which initially was below 1.0 percent of cultivated area in 2010 and 2011. As
evaluated during the last implementation status and results mission, insurance coverage
rose to 2.06 percent of the cultivated area in 2012 already and is estimated to equal 2.16
percent by 2013.

3.3    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory.

38.     The program supported an important longer-term development challenge of
Colombia that was well-aligned with the country’s development plan and CPS. The
choice of a programmatic DPO was adequate to track and support a medium term fiscal
reform agenda. In addition, the operation was well-designed and aligned with the overall
country program of the Bank and could hence also rely on a strong analytical
underpinning to link Colombia’s development challenges to relevant prior actions and
outcome indicators. Furthermore, the program allowed embarking on a deeper and wider
cooperation between Bank and GOC (see section 6). The PDO was achieved even though
one outcome indicator (2) was not fully met, which was mostly due to factors beyond the
immediate influence of the operation and did not have an adverse impact on the more
important overall development objective of achieving a sustainable budget path (indicator
1). Despite the strength of the program, the somewhat slower-than-expected reform
progress on the TSA and on the implementation and evaluation of the medium-term debt
management strategy, and the partial achievement of one indicator lead us to consider
“satisfactory” as the overall outcome rating.

3.4     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

39.     Even though the DPL preparation did not include an in-depth PSIA of prior
actions, 18 it considered the potential distributional impacts of the different actions
and expected them be consistent with poverty reduction and social impacts. In the
long run, the supported fiscal reforms are expected to improve Colombia’s capacity to
pursue countercyclical fiscal policy with positive effects on poverty and income
distribution, which were adversely affected by pro-cyclical policies in the past. 19
Moreover, macroeconomic volatility and instability disproportionally affect the poor,
which have less instruments to protect against shocks. Therefore, the operation objective
is well aligned with poverty reduction and shared prosperity, even if these goals were not
explicitly mentioned during preparation. In the shorter run, there is a risk that fiscal
consolidation can be achieved by cutting pro-poor spending. In the case of Colombia,

  Concerning the update of the Mandatory Benefit Package, such an analysis has been made.

however, legal constraints largely prevent this from happening and there was no
indication that adjustment would take place through a reduction in pro-poor spending or
that that the Government would cut social programs over the time period 2010-2014. 20In
fact, social spending by the central government increased during the implementation
period of the operation. Nominal spending in the social sector between 2010 and 2013
increased by 28.8 percent, 21 while spending for education and health increased by 28.8
and 40.8 percent, respectively. Growth was well above accumulated inflation for the
period (11.5 percent). 22

40.    The operation and the analytical work surrounding it also helped embarking
on an ambitious agenda of equity-oriented fiscal reforms, supported by follow-up
development policy operation “Enhancing Fiscal Capacity to Promote Shared Prosperity”.
The operation supported, among other issues, the design and implementation of a
comprehensive tax reform which intended to make the tax system more progressive and
encourage formal job creation. However, stressing the linkages between the supported
program and other World Bank operations in the country could have been further stressed
during preparation.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

41.     Colombia’s public sector capacity is key in the country’s development
process. The DPL series supported many actions that strengthen its instructional
framework. For example, the implementation of a fiscal framework ensures government
responsibility and prioritization in spending. Actions supported by the operation also help
mitigate potential pressures on the expense side in the areas of social and disaster risk
management. Finally, tax administration measures helped to widen the tax base, to reduce
tax evasion, and to improve public financial management. All these developments should
have a positive longer-term impact on Colombia’s institutional capacity, and therefore on
its development process. Despite progress being made, further challenges remain and
there is potential scope for continued support.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

42.     No unintended negative effects have been identified by the team or the GOC.
Bank staff from various sectors emphasized that the operation led to a strengthened
policy dialogue with the GOC.

3.5  Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
—none—



20
   Constitutional arrangements and Law 715 from 2001 prevent social expenditures from declining as
earmarked spending—which mostly cover the social sector—may not be cut even in times of fiscal
constraints.
21
   This increase was well above accumulate inflation for the period (11.5 percent).
22
   The Report on the Fiscal Rule Implementation in 2012 also concludes that more recent consolidation
mainly took place through revenue increase, not expenditure cuts (see Annex 3).

   4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

43.     Colombia has the fiscal space and institutional framework to accommodate
most relevant risks. Political and macroeconomic risks seem mainly contained and
progress has been made with respect to management of disaster risks which nevertheless
pose a considerable challenge.

•       Political and Social Risks: The upcoming presidential elections (May, 2014) are
not expected to result in a major change in the overall policy stance, especially with
regard to fiscal issues. However, the country has been prone to protests and disruptions in
key economic sectors. Intensification of such tensions could put the fiscal consolidation
path under pressure because they can lead to a slowdown in economic activity while
possibly requiring increased spending to maintain the social balance. Furthermore, the
experience of social uprising in Brazil in the second half of 2013 demonstrates the
increasing demand for public service provisioning of an increasingly self-confident
middle class in Latin America. Similar developments in Colombia could also put pressure
on public expenditures but it is worth highlighting the GOC commitment to fiscal
consolidation. If such spending pressures were to materialize, the GOC would thus be
likely to search for additional revenue sources in line with the fiscal rule.

•       Macroeconomic Risks: Macroeconomic risks worth mentioning continue to stem
from high reliance on commodity prices and on external financing of the current account
deficit—although the latter is modest in size and mainly financed by FDI flows which are
considered relatively stable. These risks are unlikely to materialize at the same time: a
potential slowdown in world output that would lead to an oil price decline would most
likely be countered by monetary easing by industrialized countries. Nevertheless,
financial market volatility remains high and turmoil in large emerging economies could
have financial spill-overs to Colombia and also lead to a decline in international oil prices.
So far though, Colombia remains well positioned and very resilient to recent shocks
affecting emerging economies (balance of payment pressures in Turkey, India, Argentina;
social upraises in Thailand, Ukraine, and Venezuela). However, very large commodity
prices shocks could have implications not only to the external accounts, but to fiscal
outcomes. Despite the recent progress, Colombia’s non-oil revenues are still low
compared to similar countries in the region and the observed growth slowdown in 2012
highlighted that short-term indicators are prone to cyclical fluctuations although the
structural long-term budget balance is on a desirable path.

•      Natural Disaster Risk: Colombia’s relatively high exposure to natural disasters
continues to exercise some pressure on fiscal sustainability and growth resilience. While
the program helped to mitigate some of them, insurance is far from perfect and
occurrence of a major natural disaster would potentially affect private and public
investment patterns and future insurance costs.

   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance


                                             18
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory.

44.     The design of the DPL was appropriate, timely and responded to client’s
financing needs. The operation focused on prior actions based on critical reforms
supporting the client’s development goals and the Bank strategic priorities. In this context,
the selection of a limited number of crucial prior actions was appropriate to ensure a clear
focus of the reform program while still accommodating engagement in multiple sectors.
In addition, the operation’s results framework established a meaningful mapping from
PDO to prior actions to outcome indicators 23.

45.     The programmatic design was also appropriate for the operation in general
because it signaled medium-term commitment to the development objective.
Furthermore, by shifting emphasis from legislative to administrative measures during the
second operation, the operational design insured implementation of legal reforms and
helped avoiding potential policy slippages. It also proved flexible in responding to
heterogeneous progress in reform implementation by adapting the results framework
(indicators and prior actions).

46.     Bank analytical work and client consultation promoted quality at entry. This
is reflected in a large body of supporting knowledge products 24 and later follow-up
operations.

47.     Nevertheless, the decision of the Bank to raise upwards the indicator of non-
oil tax revenue between the two operations proved over-optimistic. While the
indicator was strongly linked to the prior actions and supported reforms, it still depended
on factors that are beyond the program’s influence or the government’s control. As
external downward risks to growth materialized, the target could no longer be met even
though the reform implementation was on track and consistent with government
objectives.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory.

48.     Prior to the ICR mission, the Bank conducted mid-term reviews and ISRs of
both operations (April, 2012 and July, 2013, respectively). Responsibility of data
collection and action coordination was clearly defined and the responsible parts came
through as agreed. The Bank team followed up on its responsibilities, and assured
periodic monitoring of implementation. Finally, the decision to postpone the ICR, taken
well before its expected delivery, was adequate as it allowed the team to gather the
necessary data and take into account a more complete picture of developments in 2013.


23
   Unfortunately, many DPOs lag behind in this aspect as OPCS’ 2012 DPL Retrospective (p. xiv) finds
that “while all DPO PDs include a discussion of the analytical underpinnings, many could be strengthened
by being more precise about the linkages between the Bank’s Analytical and Advisory Activities (…) and
the design of the program.”
24
   For examples, see the program documents of the first (table 8) and second (p. 2, Table 4, Box6) operation.


                                                    19
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

49.    Relevance of objectives and design were significant and high, respectively,
performance at entry, and supervision was satisfactory and no significant shortfalls were
reported during the operation period, resulting in an overall satisfactory rating.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

50.      The government showed strong commitment to reform and took full
ownership of the program. The government implemented an ambitious program of
fiscal reforms, going beyond the actions supported by the operation. Such commitment is
reflected in improved credit ratings by the most relevant rating agencies. However, in
some areas, reforms proceeded slower than initially expected and indicative triggers and
indicators had to be adjusted accordingly. It should nevertheless be mentioned that the
government continued to make progress also on areas where indicative triggers and
indicators were dropped. Given these small delays, we consider “satisfactory” as an
appropriate rating.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

51.     Implementation took place by different agencies coordinate by the Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit, which helped provide the technical expertise necessary for the
government to implement the program and reforms. The Ministry of Finance was the
agency responsible for implementing actions under the first and third pillars of the
operation and for coordinating the monitoring and evaluation activities. The Ministry of
Health was responsible for implementing actions under the second pillar, while the
Ministry of Agriculture implemented additional actions under the third pillar. Overall,
performance of implementing agencies was strong. The actions supported by the DPL
continue to be implemented as intend throughout the operations period and almost all
targets were met. On the monitoring and evaluation side, there few minor shortcomings.
While fiscal information was readily available, coordination with other agencies was not
always effective and Bank specialist had to contact their counterparts directly in order to
retrieve the information. Against this backdrop we consider “satisfactory” as an adequate
rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

52.    The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit worked in close collaboration with the
government to implement the supported reforms and, overall, served as a reliable
counterpart in the operation.



                                            20
   6. Lessons Learned

53.     The operation can be seen as a good example how DPLs can serve as a
trigger to engage in more fundamental policy dialogue with client countries with
medium income levels and where macroeconomic capacity is already high. Although
Colombia examplifies that most of these countries have recently enjoyed relatively good
access to global financial markets, the fact that consultations between the Bank and the
GOC during preparation and implementation of the program led to an expanded dialogue
highlights that these client countries can take benefit from packaging of Bank services.
During reform implementation, there may arise very specific technical questions that
might be beyond sight of the country and/or where the Bank is especially well-equipped
to provide or facilitated expertise. To provide input on these topics requires extensive
consultation and responding flexibly and timely to client needs and a DPO can be a
pivotal point for such consultation. The discussed operation proved to be very helpful for
accompanying and follow-up projects, both lending and non-lending (e.g. the tax
expenditure study, fiscal incidence analysis, ex-ante tax reform simulations, or the equity
DPL), brought equity considerations stronger into government focus, and opened
important doors for deepening the policy dialogue in areas such as fiscal policy, health,
and disaster risk management.

54.     From the perspective of middle-income client countries, the Bank’s value-
added in such operations might especially come from transaction costs reductions.
More precisely, the Bank can offer a full package of consulting, technical advice, and
finance that result in a continuous policy dialogue that effectively constitutes an option
privilege for follow-up operations and where the initiation costs for each operation are
accordingly low. While technical non-lending aspects were especially important in the
context of the current operation, insecurity about future global financial developments
also give a high value to the option to quickly engage in a follow up DPL operation. In
this context, it is worth highlighting the more general importance of timely response to
client needs and the evaluated operation highlights that DPOs can be an appropriate
instrument for this purpose, as the loan was prepared and disbursed in a timely manner.

55.     Given these considerations, it is difficult to assess the benefits of DPOs in
high-capacity middle-income countries exclusively against the indicators outlined in
the results framework. While a thoughtful design, monitoring, and evaluation of such
indicators is indispensable for a results-based development operation, this operation itself
might entail positive (but potentially also negative) consequences that are hard to
anticipate and quantify. Furthermore, the impact of such operations on the domestic
political landscape is limited or at least not intermediate. In the context of full
government ownership of a reform program, it is difficult to argue that the achievement
of short-term outcome indicators is the result of a DPO. On the other hand, longer-term
effects on Colombia’s fiscal system and its equity implications via follow-up operations
are beyond the classical results framework of DPOs.

56.   A more technical lesson learned is to remain conservative with revising
upwards targets that critically depend on the external economic environment in
view of short-term cyclical fluctuations. Achieving a decent target for the non-oil


                                            21
revenue indicator would probably have been a larger success than not achieving an over-
ambitious target due to factors beyond the design of the program.

57.     Finally, the operation shows that embarking on a sustainable fiscal path does
not necessarily entail cuts in social spending that would have adverse impacts on
poverty and shared prosperity. However, while the legal environment in Colombia nearly
prevents this from happening, this does not mean such adverse effects cannot occur in
other countries or contexts and it would be desirable to regularly study such potential
social impacts upfront.

Annex 3 Summary of Fiscal Rule Implementation

Legal Background

Law 1473 from 2011 requires the central government to comply with a Fiscal Rule from
2012 onwards. Article 5 of this law demands the government to meet a certain target for
the structural budget balance (that the government sets) and that the government enforces
an annually decreasing path for the structural deficit trajectory in the transition period.
Article 12 of the law requires the government to present a report on the fiscal rule
implementation to the Economic Commission of the Congress every June.

Technical and Institutional Setup

The structural balance corrects actual government income for effects of the economic
cycle (via elasticities of different tax revenues to the business cycle) and the commodity
cycle (calculated as deviations from expected long-run price and quantity developments)
and purges actual expenditure from countercyclical stimulus packages. A committee of
experts calculates potential output and the deviation of actual output to estimate the
effects of the economic cycle whereas another group of experts estimates long-run
commodity developments. A Consultative Committee affirms the methodology for
calculating these numbers to the Ministry of Finance. The rule targets a structural deficit
of 1.0 percent of GDP by 2022 and interim targets of 2.3 and 1.9 percent of GDP by 2014
and 2018, respectively.

Main Findings of the Report on the Fiscal Rule Implementation in 2012: 25

   •    The report concludes that the correct and complete implementation of the Fiscal
        Rule Law was initiated with setting up the Consultative Committee and the
        technical expert groups (for calculating the structural balance) in the first half of
        2013.
   •    The structural budget balance of the Central Government was equal to 2.4 percent
        of GDP in 2012, in line with the Fiscal Rule Law.
   •    A 13.6 percent increase of revenues in 2012 was the main factor explaining
        achievement of the envisaged structural fiscal balance. Besides from rising tax
        revenues, capital incomes of the central government contributed to this
        development.
   •    Expenses grew slightly (from 18 to 18.4 percent of GDP) in 2012, mainly
        resulting from pension transfer increases equal to 0.3 percentage points of GDP.
   •    Overall, the report does not identify important deviations from expected
        developments in 2012.

     This annex summarizes the above-mentioned report that has been circulated by Colombia’s Ministry
   of Finance in June, 2013.

•   GDP growth in 2012 was 4 percent, thus below the assumed potential growth rate
    of 4.6 percent. The resulting structural adjustment of the budget balance was
    relatively small (-0.1 percent).
•   Structural budget balance was 2.7 percent of GDP in 2011 which constitutes a
    major improvement over the initially foreseen structural balance of 3.7 percent
    and complies with the government target.
•   Although not obligatory for the 2011-12 period, the report notices achievement of
    a progressing fiscal adjustment path.
•   The improved investment rating lowers costs of public finance and allows for a
    better diversification of financing sources which further lowers costs and allows
    for more flexibility.
•   To support growth amid a period of economic slowdown in 2013, the government
    had to add adjustments to the initial budget.
•   Conservative estimates at the time of the report predict a structural balance of 2.4
    percent of GDP for 2013 under the assumption that major downside risks would
    not materialize. Among those risks, the report inter alia identifies a further
    slowdown in the European Union and additional costs potentially arising from
    reparation payments or pending legal cases concerning the health and pension
    sector.
