Some lessons learned included:  views and\n            inputs should be collected prior to subproject selection and\n            design, community-based organizations should be formed and\n            mobilized, intensive awareness campaigns should be carried\n            out on subproject selection criteria and post-implementation\n            requirements, in addition, subproject design should be\n            compatible with community management capacity to maintain\n            and operate the system. The Community Drinking Water Users\n            Union (CDWUU) had to rent equipment, which in many cases was\n            unaffordable, most communities are willing to procure\n            equipment on installments and asked the project to help\n            create a revolving fund so groups of closely located CDWUU\n            could buy equipment and repay the cost in installments. A\n            community-based approach works well when people understand\n            why they should come together to address common problems and\n            why they pay and what they for. It took some time for the\n            project to make people understand that they were not paying\n            for water but for the services to bring water, clean it and\n            make it safe. Likewise, in a community based approach, when\n            the people feel ownership of the system, they care more\n            about the investments they have made."}, "docdt": "2009-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
