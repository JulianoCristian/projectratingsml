There are five\n            main project components. The first component repairs and\n            builds village water supply systems. The second component\n            promotes rural hygiene and improves sanitation facilities,\n            builds the capacity of the National Center for Health\n            Promotion (NCHP), and implements an efficient and\n            cost-effective system of water quality protection. The third\n            component finances a management contractor to implement\n            component 1 and to provide technical assistance and\n            community development activities to strengthen the\n            community's capacity to plan, implement, operate, and\n            maintain water and sanitation facilties in an effective and\n            sustainable manner.
