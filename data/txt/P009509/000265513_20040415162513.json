The disruption of river\n            life as a result of bridge construction is noted and the\n            Response states that planning for the bridge has been under\n            careful consideration and examination and that since\n            building is only allowable during the dry season, a phased\n            approach was adopted to ensure that the erosion and flooding\n            were properly observed.  The resettlement areas, the\n            Requesters allege, are too small and do not allow enough\n            room for all of the people to be resettled. The Response\n            states that the idea for resettlement incentives is in\n            effect and that people will be allowed to resettle\n            themselves on nearby farmland.  The Management Response\n            allows for each allegation to be responded to by the\n            Management and the Government of Bangladesh."}, "docdt": "1996-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
