The Requesters, the Jamuna Char Integrated\n            Development Project (JCDP), give a history of the Jamuna\n            Bridge Project and express concern over the construction of\n            the bridge, which will require the resettlement of more\n            people than originally thought.  The people that live on the\n            char, or small islands in the Jamuna River, will need to be\n            resettled as a result of the bridge construction, but their\n            resettlement was not included in the original plan. The\n            Requesters state that the Bank's policy disallows\n            involuntary resettlement, but the potential threat of\n            displacement to the char people has not been taken into\n            account. Major concerns involve guide bunds that would cause\n            the river levels to rise and flood the char people's\n            land and homes. The Requesters note that most of the people\n            that would be affected only heard about the construction of\n            the Jamuna bridge through hear-say. While there have been\n            plans to resettle people, the land designated for the\n            resettlement  can only accommodate approximately 20 percent\n            of the people that will need land as a result of the\n            construction.  The JCDP states that agriculture, social\n            connections and livelihood would be destroyed by the\n            resettlement and destruction of the char lands."}, "docdt": "1996-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
