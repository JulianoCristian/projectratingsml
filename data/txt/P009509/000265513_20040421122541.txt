NOTICE OF REGISTRATION 
Dear  Sir: 
 
Re: Request for Inspection
 
- Bangladesh:  Jamuna Bridge Project (Credit 2569-BD)
 
 
 
The Inspection Panel (the “Panel”) received a Request for Inspection (the “Request”) dated 
August 18, 1996 on August  23, 1996 from an organization called the Jamuna Char Integrated 
Development Project (JCDP) representing Jamuna char dwellers (the “Requesters”) who claim that their 
rights/interests have been adversely affected by acts and omissions of the International Development 
Association (“IDA”).  The Request claims that char dwellers living in the project area have been, and may 
potentially be, directly and adversely affected by IDA’s omissions and failures in the preparation and 
implementation of the above-referenced project.  The Requesters claim to be harmed as a result of alleged 
violations of various provisions of IDA policies and procedures.  
 
 
In accordance with paragraph 17 of the Panel’s Operating Procedures (the “Operating 
Procedures”), I am notifying you that I have on August 26, 1996, which is also the date of the dispatch of 
this notice, registered the Request in the Inspection Panel Register. 
 
All communications with the Requesters in connection with the Request will be sent to Mr.  
Majibul Huq Dulu at the address listed below. 
 
In accordance with paragraph 18 of IDA Resolution No. 93-6 and paragraph 18(d) of the 
Operating Procedures, IDA Management is hereby notified that it must provide the Panel no later than 
September 25, 1996 with written evidence that it has complied, or intends to comply with the relevant 
policies and procedures in the implementation of the above-referenced project. The essential criteria for the 
response to the Request are set out in paragraph 33 of the Operating Procedures. 
 
The Request has been assigned  IPN Request Number RQ96/1. 
 
  
Sincerely 
yours, 
 
 
  
 
Richard E. Bissell 
  
Chairman
