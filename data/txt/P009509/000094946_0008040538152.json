Performances by\n            the Bank, and the Borrower were also highly satisfactory,\n            for the project was comprehensively well prepared, enabling\n            up-front resolution of complex issues, and, the\n            establishment of the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority\n            provided the necessary financial, managerial, and ownership\n            support. But, regardless of success, lessons drawn from the\n            project suggest that: 1) the milestone decision meetings\n            (MDM) proved to be extremely effective through its\n            systematic approach in resolving, and staying focused on\n            specific issues, and, it is thus suggested that MDM should\n            become integrated into project supervision, even if it means\n            higher supervision costs; 2) since projects involving large\n            civil works, require land acquisition, as well as\n            structural, and vegetative clearing, the practice of\n            requiring substantial site readiness before consent of civil\n            works, should become the norm. But greater coordination\n            between the physical preparation, and that of the social\n            components' will be required, so that resettlement, and\n            compensation support becomes effective prior to\n            displacement; 3) co-financing, in addition to counterpart\n            funds, proved effective in funding such a complex project,\n            and useful in reducing financial risks, but co-financing\n            partnerships should ensure that the agreed modus operandi is\n            clearly defined."}, "docdt": "2000-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
