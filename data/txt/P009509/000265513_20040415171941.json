The Jamuna\n            Bridge Project, meant to span the Jamuna River, will require\n            the resettlement of the char people, who live on small\n            mid-channel islands known as chars. The Request alleges that\n            the char people were not included in the planning and\n            implementation of resettlement and the environmental\n            measures that surround the bridge construction. The main\n            concerns of the Request outline involuntary resettlement of\n            the people and the lack of involvement of the char people.\n            The Management Response maintains that it adhered to the\n            correct policies and procedures and that a phased approach\n            to the construction was implemented to lessen the effects on\n            the surrounding area and people. After examining the details\n            of the Request, the Panel feels that the Request meets the\n            eligibility criteria and reflects legitimate concerns of\n            people that may be adversely affected by the project. The\n            Panel feels that the policies and procedures for\n            resettlement have not been properly followed. The Panel\n            feels that many changed should be made in order to insure\n            remedies for emerging problems. The Inspection Panel\n            concludes that an investigation of the matters alleged in\n            the Request is not warranted at this time."}, "docdt": "1996-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
