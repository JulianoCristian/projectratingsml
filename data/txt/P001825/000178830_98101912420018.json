Implementation of the\n            project would be carried out in two phases to ultimately\n            increase the present production capacity of 11.5 million\n            tons to about 14 million tons a year by 1984. Although the\n            Guelbs ore is of a different quality (lower iron content)\n            than the Kedia ore, with magnetic concentration the products\n            will actually be of higher grade and will have good\n            marketing characteristics. The main components are: (i)\n            construction of concentration/beneficiation facilities to\n            upgrade the low grade ore (30-40 percent Fe) to an\n            acceptable sinter feed (65 percent Fe); (ii) extension of\n            the railroad from F'Derik to El Rhein (45 km) and\n            increase of existing rail capacity and port facilities to\n            handle 14 million tons of ore per year; (iii) a new power\n            plant, additional water supply, housing and other auxiliary\n            facilities and services; and (iv) engineering, project\n            management and training."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
