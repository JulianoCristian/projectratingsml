consists of\n            the sequential development of two new iron ore open pits\n            with proven reserves of 386 million tons, both located in\n            proximity to the present mining town of Zouerate and\n            existing intrastructure, to gradually replace the Kedia pits\n            now being depleted. Implementation of the project would be\n            carried out in two phases to ultimately increase the present\n            production capacity of 11.5 million tons to about 14 million\n            tons a year by 1984. Although the Guelbs ore is of a\n            different quality (lower iron content) than the Kedia ore,\n            with magnetic concentration the products will actually be of\n            higher grade and will have good marketing characteristics.\n            The main components are: (i) construction of\n            concentration/beneficiation facilities to upgrade the low\n            grade ore (30-40 percent Fe) to an acceptable sinter feed\n            (65 percent Fe); (ii) extension of the railroad from\n            F'Derik to El Rhein (45 km) and increase of existing\n            rail capacity and port facilities to handle 14 million tons\n            of ore per year; (iii) a new power plant, additional water\n            supply, housing and other auxiliary facilities and services;\n            and (iv) engineering, project management and training."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
