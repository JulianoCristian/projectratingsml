principal urban institutions in the\n            Greater Banjul area (Banjul, the capital and environs). This\n            will be accomplished through training, technical assistance,\n            studies and the provision of essential equipment.\n            Furthermore, the project will: (b) demonstrate the\n            feasibility of improving and extending deficient physical\n            infrastructure in depressed areas and affordable serviced\n            plots and core shelter for low income beneficiaries. The\n            project will directly and indirectly improve the living\n            conditions of about 80,000 people through the provision of\n            improved water supply, sanitation, roads, drainage, street\n            and security lighting. In the spirit of the Bank's\n            Special Action Program (SAP), a Special Account (revolving\n            fund) will be established under the project to expedite disbursements."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
