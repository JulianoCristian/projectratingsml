principal urban institutions in the\n            Greater Banjul area (Banjul, the capital and environs).\n            This will be accomplished through training, technical\n            assistance, studies and the provision of essential\n            equipment.  Furthermore, the project will:  (b) demonstrate\n            the feasibility of improving and extending deficient\n            physical infrastructure in depressed areas and affordable\n            serviced plots and core shelter for low income\n            beneficiaries.  The project will directly and indirectly\n            improve the living conditions of about 80,000 people through\n            the provision of improved water supply, sanitation, roads,\n            drainage, street and security lighting.  In the spirit of\n            the Bank's Special Action Program (SAP), a Special\n            Account (revolving fund) will be established under the\n            project to expedite disbursements."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
