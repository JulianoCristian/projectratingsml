project is to\n            assist in meeting electricity demand in the northern region\n            of India through the addition of 1500 MW of hydro capacity.\n            The project will include the construction of the Nathpa\n            Jhakri power station, comprising : (i) a gravity dam; (ii) a\n            30 m long headrace tunnel and surge tank; (iii) penstocks, a\n            power house (including 6 x 250 MW units) and a 500 m long\n            tailrace tunnel; and (iv) reinforcement and expansion of the\n            transmission and distribution system in the state of\n            Himachal Pradesh. In addition the project will provide funds\n            for consultant and training services, computer hardware, and\n            software for the implementation of a program to modernize,\n            streamline, and strengthen operations of the Himachal\n            Pradesh State Electricity Board (HSEP), the Central\n            Electricity Authority (CEA), and the Central Water Authority (CWA)."}, "docdt": "1989-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
