PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
PORT DEVELOPMENT PREPARATION PROJECT (LOAN 1964-ME)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The industrial port development program was conceived in 1978 as a
means  for  alleviating  demographic  and  environmental  pressures  on the
central plateau of Mexico by attracting further industrial development to
outlying port areas and providing the industries with direct maritime
access (para 1.01). The program was to be financed from greatly increased
oil revenues.
Obhiectives
2.       This project was to assist the industrial port development program
through the provision of planning and management advisory services in
program formulation and design, and for sector and individual project
components in the ports program. The loan was to help finance the project
preparation work (para 2.01) and, if the projects and subprojects analyzed
in the feasibility studies proved to be technically and economically
viable, then the loan would also help finance the detailed engineering.
Implementation Experience
3.       Most of the planned US$2.5 billion construction work was suspended
by the Government when recession struck in mid-1982, and the project was
restructured to be consistent with a greatly reduced industrial ports
program (para 3.01). A total of US$4.5 million of the US$14 million loan
was disbursed for 33 consultancy contracts for various port studies,
training assignments and supervision of construction of the grain terminal
at Lazaro  Cardenas.    The  balance  of the  loan was  cancelled in four
decrements between July 1984 and November 1986 (para 3.12).
Results
4.       Four of the consultancy contracts  were  utilized as the basis for
the Lazaro Cardenas Industrial Port Project (Loan 2450-ME) and the Port
Rehabilitation and Equipment Project currently being appraised (para 3.02).
5.       A large cadre of Government  personnel were exposed to the details
of technical, economic and financial feasibility analyses required for Bank
financing of projects.  The studies  done  jointly by two groups of foreign
consultants working with counterpart staff in the offices of the CNCP led
to the follow-up third  and  fourth  port  projects  (paras 3.02 and 3.05).
These studies were financed under the subject project which emphasized that
port planning should be in line with the planning framework applying to the
rest of the economy.
6.       Though the  project  was  drastically  reduced  in  size  it still
remained a useful operation without any major issues.

PORT DEVELOPMENT PREPARATION PROJECT (LOAN 1964-NE)
I. INTRODUCTION
1 .01     An the price of petroleum inoreased and the Mexican offshore oil
fields oame into produotion in the late 1970. and early 1980a, the Mexican
economy started to boom. A National Urban Plan in 1978, and a National
Industrial Plan published in March 1979, were addressed at alleviating the
problems of eoonomio conoentration in the central plateau and the attendant
migration towards the urban centers. The National Industrial Plan provided
for the oonstruction of industrial parks and related infrastructure in
priority areas away from the central plateau, anG incentives for industrial
firms to locate in them. The Bank assisted this Plan through the Small and
Medium Industry loans. The area around the ports of Tampico/Altamira, Lazaro
Cardenas and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the south of the country were
identified as priority regions. Letters of intent were obtained from several
Mexican and jointly owned Mexican and foreign industries interested in
locating ln the industrial ports of Altamira and Lazaro Cardenas.
1.02      The office of Coordinacion de Proyectoo de Desarrollo (CPD), which
reported directly to the President of Mexico, was charged with the taak of
identifying and promoting projects which would be financed by the greatly
increesed oi. revenues.  The CPD took on the responsibility for coordinating
all studies and investments for the development of four industrial ports1/
in the priority regions in order to provide direct Recess by major industries
to i£ternational maritime transport.  The Port Development Preparation
Project, subject of this report, was to support the Government's efforts in
this investment program.
1.03      This Project Completior Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office and is based upon information from
the LAC information Center, President's Report NJo. P-2982-ME for the ?ort
Development Preparation Project (Loan 1964-ME), staff supervision reports and
working papers and the Project Completion Report prepared by Mexico's Banco
Nacional Pesquero y Portuario, S.A. (BASPESCA)s  Because of the nature of the
loan, this report does not include economic, operational and financial
analyses.
1/   Two were new ports on the Gulf Coast; Altamira, about 20 km north of
Tampico, and Laguna de Ostion about 5 km west of Coatzacoalcos. The
other two were existing ports on the Pacific Coast; Lazaro Cardenas and
Salina Cruz.



-2-
II. PROJECT PREPARATION
2.01      The Government's plans for port construction in the already
mentioned four industrial areas were approved in early 1979. It was
estimated that USS2.5 billion would be required for these investments over a
period of five years. Substantial budgetary allocations were made to
initiate construction, even though the detailed designs were still under
preparation and further studies were required. The Mexican Gevernment
requested the Bank, in late 1979, to revi w the CPD studies on industrial
ports. Bank staff concluded that, although the studies outlined an
acceptable strategy for economic decentralization, the absence of
preinvestment work for specific components of the program and a definite
policy fcamework made it difficult to define an appropriate role for the
Bank; material produced by CPD was not specific enough to permit appraisal of
a project.
2.02      During further discussions in August and November 1980, it was
concluded that, in view that CPD did not have sufficient staff with
experience in planning large ports, the Bank might best assist in the
planning and review of preinvestment activities required for the program
through a project preparation loan.  The Port Development Preparation Project
was designed to help finance the :ost of consulting services needed for
technical, economic, financial and institutional analysis of specific
components and general aspects of the industrial ports program, and provide
institutional strengthening inputs.   Negotiations were held in Washington in
January 1981 and a Loan Agreement was signed on May 7, 1981.
2.U3      The CDP (established in 1978) was the administering agency at the
time of negotiations. This was replaced by the Coordinacion General del
Programa de Puertos Industriales (CGPPI) at the end of 1981, which in turn
was replaced by the Comision Nacional Coordinadora de Puertos (CNCP) in
February 1983.
III. PROJECT IMPLEtENTATION AND COSTS
A. General
3.01      The initial project description limited disbursements to
preinvestment studies and activities related to industrial port development
ac Attamira, Lazaro Cardenas, Laguna de Ostion and SaLina Cruz. This was
modified in May 19t2 to incLude such other locations as would be incLudea in
the Government's industriaL port development program and agreed to by the
Bank. In mid-1982, the economy deteriorated rapidly, priorities had to be
revised, project objectives became less clear and project imptementation
suffered from lack of direction as the Bank and the Borrower searched for the
best use of available funds. Consequently, the project description was
further modified in February 1983 to incLude the reasonable cost of the
services of consultants and any equipment and materials related to port
development studies. This latter change was intended mainly to cover the
cost of equipment for Secretaria de Desarrollo Urbano y Ecolo-ia (SEUUh) for
monitoring air and water quality in Lazaro Cardenas.  SEIUE submitted a list
of equipment for procurement which wab greatly in excess of what the bank



-3-
considered essential for Lazaro Cardenas and, as a consequence, no such
equipment was procured under the project.
3.02      The project financed 29 studies in the ports sector, one
consultancy for supervision of construction and three training con.racts.
Two of the studies, (paras 3.04 and 3.05) prepared jointly by two different
foreign consrilting firms together with counterpart staff, led to the
development of the Lazaro Cardenas Industrial Port Project (Loan 2450-ME) in
1984 and the preparation of the the Ports IV Project in 1986-1987. A
Steering Committee, which had representatives from the Ministries and
agencies concerned with the Port Sector was created to ensure coordination of
all aspects of the project.
B. Work Performed Under the Project
3.03      Basically seven categories of work were carried out under the
project: the first group comprised technical assistance for planning,
engineering, financial and economic support services related to the
development of the ports of Lazaro Cardenas and Altamira; the other five
groups consisted of environmental studies at Lazaro Cardenas and Altamira,
operational and organizati3nal studies and training in port and equipment
operation and maintenance, site screening study and preliminary engineering
for a coal terminal at Lazaro Cardenas, miscellaneous studies at other ports
in Mexico, and supervision of construction of the grain terminal-at Lazaro
Cardenas. The following is a discussion of each of these.
(i) Planning and Engineering Services
3.04      This technical assistance was carried out by a foreign consulting
firm between October l982 and February 1985. Iuring the course of their
assignment, the consultant reviewed the navigational aspects of the Altamira
and Lazaro Cardenas ports, coestaL engineering, including the groins and
breakwaters to provide safe rsaritime access to the ports and protect the
shorelines against erosion, the planning of road and rail access to the
various areas of the ports, regulation of discharges from the power dam and
flood control in the Rio Balsas (adjacent to the Port of Lazaro Cardenas),
determination of equipment needs and operation systems for the 14ultiple-Use
Terminals (TUM) at Altaiira and Lazaro Cardenas, and technical assistance and
cost estimating for projects suitable for Bank financing.
(ii) Economic and Financial Support Services
3.05      A foreign consulting firm provided the economic and financial
support services for the studies of the industrial ports included in this
project between December 1982 and October 1985. The work included the
forecasting of traffic at the four inoustrial ports (prepared in considerable
detail for the Ports of Altamira, Tampico, and Lazaro Cardenas) and financial
projections for the existing operating companies at Tampico and Lazaro
Cardenas. The economic/financial consultants utilized technical and cost
data prepared by the planning and engineering consultant (para 3.04), in
evaluating the economic and financial feasibility of the various projects
being considered for Bank financing.



-4-
(iii) Environmental Studies
3.06      Environmental studies were performed for the Ports of Altamira,
Tampico and Lazaro Cardenas by Mexican consultants. These studies included
the collection, treatment and disposal of waste waters at Lazaro Cardenas;
installation of a network for monitoring the quality of water discharges at
Lazaro Cardenas; influence of w.ter runoff on the Port of Altamira; and an
ecological study of the greenbelt and adjacent areas around the Port of
Altamira.  The first of these Led to the construction af a colLector sewer
and treatment plant at Lazaro Cardenas financed under Loan 2450-ME during
1985-1986. The monitoring and evaluation of water discharges at Lazaro
Cardenas is ongoing. The other studies are being uti'lazed in the regional
and detailed planning at the Port of Altamira. The Ports IV Project
currently under preparation includes investments in Altamira.
(iv) Operational and Organizational Studies
3.07      Operational and organizational studies in the ports subsector were
performed at different stages of the project by two different foreign
consultants. In addition, three contracts for training in pert operations
were let, one with a UN specialized organization, and two with foreign
consultants. These met with varying degrees of success partly due co the
rapid deterioration of the Mexican economy. In the case of the training
program run by one of the consultants, the results were below original
expectations and the contract was cancelled.
(v) Coal Terminal Study
3.08      A site screening study followed by basic engineering for a coal
unloading terminal to supply a dual-fuel power plant being constructed to the
south of the Port of Lazaro Cardenas was performed jointly by the same
foreign consultant who provided the technical support services for the
industrial ports study, and a 'Nexican consultant.  This terminal is being
considered for inclusion under the proposed reformulation of the Lazaro
Cardenas Port Project (Loan 2450-ME).
(vi) Miscellaneous Port Studies
3.09      Various studies were performed covering the organization of the
Comision Nacional Coordinadora de Puertos (CNCP), corporate management of the
Empresas de Servicio Portuarios (ESPs), tariffs and port dues, storage aind
supply of fueLs at several ports, improvemenlt and expansion of passenger
terminals at tourist ports and establishment of an organization to jointLy
operate the ports of Tampico and Altamira. The study of tariffs and port
dues was well-prepared and the consultant's recommendations were
implemented. Additional tariff adjustments are envisioned as a part of the
action plan in the Ports IV Project currently under preparation. The studies
for the supply of fuel at several ports led to projects which are currently
being implemented with local funds.
(vii) Supervision of Construction
3.10      A European consultant was contracted to supervise the construccion
and commissioning of the grain terminal at Lazaro Cardenas.  This cerminal



was being constructed with Government funds for Compania Nacional de
Subsistencias Populares (CONASUPO), the national food Importing and marketing
company. The supervision of construction was successful but was suspended
following the earthquake of September 1985. It is expectei to resume work
with the same consultant during the reconstructilon process.
C. Disbursements and Costs
3.11      Initially the project was estimated to cost US$24 million with
US$10 million (42%) financed by the Government and US$14 million (58%) by the
Bank. The actual cost was US$6.4 million with US$1.9 million (28.7X)
financed by the Government and US$4.5 million (71.32) financed by the Bank.
3.12      The Loan Agreement provided for disbursing 582 of the cost of the
services of consultants employed on the Project. This was amended under the
Special Action Program in February 1983 to cover 1002 of the foreign
expenditures and 45% of the local expenditures for work done under the
project. The US$4.5 million which was finally disbursed amounted to about
71% of the total cost of the project. This high percc*tage was due to most
of the disbursements having been made for foreign consuitants' services. The
following table shows the appraised projected and actual disbursements of
loan funds.

3.13      Table I lists the original estimates of the costs of project
components and the actual costs. The overrun in the Lazaro Cardenas
component was largeLy due to the detailed analysis and development of the Rio
Balsas flood control component for the Lazaro Cardenas Industrial Port
Project. The Altamira component was fully expended in preparation of
components for the proposed Ports kehabllitation and Equipment Project.

Local and foreign inflation increased the costs of the studies and
supervision of construction more than had been anticipated during project
preparation.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      During its initial stages, project execution was hampered by the
difficult Mexican Institutional setting, characterized by the fragmentation
of responsibility for different parts of the planning process. The varying
degrees of support that different agencies gave to the consultants' work,
especially in terms of facilitating access to data, together with certain
resentment toward expatriates, made project execution difficult. Ilowever, as
the coordinating functions of the Steering Committee were developed, and the
role of the consultants became better understood, project implementation
experienced a substantial improvement.
4.02      The ultimate executing agency, the CNCP, worked directly with the
two consulting firms which provided assistance in technical, economic, and
financial analyses of potential port projects. The joint effort resulted in
a successful preparation of the Lazaro Cardenas Industrial Port Project (Loan
2450-HE) and doing the groundwork for the Ports IV project.
4.03      One of the training components of the project, aimed at training
ports management and operating personnel, was not successful. This was due
partly to a change in circumstances, and partLy to lack of understanding by
the executing agency of the end-product which was intended to be delivered by
the training agency. In the first place, the almost complete paralization of
construction of the industrial ports in 1982 forced a complete revision of
the manpower required for the ports and therefore in the training proposed
under the program. The contract for this training component was signed at
about the time that the CGPPI replaced the CPU as executing agency, in 1983.
CGPPI did not carry out a complete review of the syllabus of the training
program nor a detailed review of the printed material and audio-visual aids
which were intended to be used in the training exercise. As a result, the
syllabus and training materials were inadequate for the type of training
envisaged by CGPPI, and for the numbers and type of personnel that had to be
trained.
4.04      The most successful training exercise in port operation and cargo
handling was that carried out by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD). This program is still active in Mexico. The training
material was well prepared from the start, and the trainers are training
local trainers, to induce continuity in the training effort, based upon the
development of local resources.
4.05      The Directorate GeneraL for Maritime Works prepared comprehensive,
well thought out terms of reference for studies at many of the Mexican
ports. Financing of these studies under the loan was requested, but most of
the consultancies had been cQntracted prior to submission of the terms of
refer-ice to the bank.  Financing under the loan was therefore not possible.

V. CONCLUSIONS
5.01      Although the time allowed for project execution was extended by 602
and only 32% of the initial loan was disbursed it is considered to have been
successful in achieving its objectives for the following reason*:
(a) The project successfully accomplished its main objective of
systematizing the planning for the development of new industrial
ports thus aiding the national strategy aimed at decentralization
of economic activity and improvement of direct access by major
domestic industries to international maritime transport;
(b) The Lazaro Cardenas Industrial Port Project (Loan 2450-ME) was
prepared with resources financed under this loan, and the proposed
fourth port project (Port Rehabilitation and Equipment Project),
which includes the industrial port of Altamira and the three
principal general cargo ports of the country, was also largely
prepared under this loan;
(c) The studies leading up to the third and fourth port projects
emphasized that port planning should be in line with the
planning framework for the rest of the economy. This objective was
pursued in the preparation and conditionality of the two subsequent
port projects;
(d) The three training contracts identified the need for detailed terms
of reference and, if possible, a detailed review of the syLlabus
and course materials and interviews with the principal trainers
prior to contracting. The UiCTAD training exercise followed that
approach and was found to be very valuable. It is still in
operation in the country;
(e) Environmental studies at Lazaro Cardenas and Altamira were financed
under this loan. Environmental improvement components for the
Lazaro Cardenas Industrial Port Project (Loan 2450-ME) were
developeu under these studies; and
(f) Tariff studies were made under this loan. They form an important
part of the Bank's continuing dialogue with the Mexican Government
regarding the tariff structure of the Mlexican ports.
Lessons Learned
5.02      Although some of the preparatory work carried out by the various
agencies resulted in very good terms of reference for worthwhile studies,
they were presented to the Hank after the consultancy contracts had been
let. This resulted in the Bank refusing to finance the studies. The Bank,
however, accepted later for financing the two contracts for preliminary
engineering for the coal unloading terminal at Lazaro Cardenas, which had
been signed prior to the bank reviewing the terms of reference. The Bank
should show more consistency in apptication of its Guidelines.

5.03      Improvements were notlceablo In the organization of the planning
and administration of the ports sector during the course of the project.
Tariff studies were made and modiflcatlons In the tariff structure have been
introduced as a result. There has been a noticeable Increase in the
application of economic analysis to the deteruination of investment decisions
in the ports. There is still room for considerable improvements; however, it
will take considerable tlme and effort to overcome the inertia and political
and labor union influences which affect the ports sector, to fully apply
economic criteria to the review and decision process for new investmencs.
