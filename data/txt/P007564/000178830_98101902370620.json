of these ports would support the\n            Government's objectives of decentralizing economic\n            activity and growth to areas outside the central plateau and\n            providing domestic industries with direct access to\n            international maritime transport. The risks are that there\n            may be disagreement among the various agencies concerned\n            with the industrial port program on the timing and scope of\n            investments or the proposed developments at each port.
