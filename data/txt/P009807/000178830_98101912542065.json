proposed project is\n            to upgrade the maintenance and reliability of the fleet of\n            existing diesel and electric locomotives in the IR network;\n            to continue a program of modernization of IR's electric\n            locomotives; and to improve the technology, design and\n            operation of IR's bulk freight movements. The project\n            consists of: (a) the construction and equipping of a\n            maintenance facility for remanufacturing diesel electric\n            locomotives and locomotive components and assemblies, and\n            the import of wheels, axles, and components for expanding\n            the unit exchange system in the major maintenance workshops\n            and running repair facilities; (b) the import of prototype\n            AC electric locomotives for testing preparatory to choosing\n            the new generation of mainline locomotives and establishing\n            a manufacturing facility in collaboration with the selected\n            supplier; (c) the acquisition of components for the\n            construction of high-capacity wagons; and (d) the provision\n            of technical assistance and training for IR staff."}, "docdt": "1982-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
