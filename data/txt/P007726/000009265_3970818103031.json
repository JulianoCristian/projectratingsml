increasing the sector's productivity\n            within a framework of social consensus and environmental\n            soundness, thereby contributing to Mexico's economic\n            growth and poverty alleviation. While focusing on seven\n            states, the project benefits aquaculture producers, traders,\n            and processors throughout Mexico. It has two components: (1)\n            The first helps complete and implements the\n            government's regulatory framework, and provides key\n            public goods to stimulate productive sector (private and\n            social) investment. Its four subcomponents are: (i)\n            regulatory framework, (ii) environmental and coastal\n            resources management, (iii) public goods and services, and\n            (iv) institutional strengthening and project coordination.\n            (2) The second component, incorporating the Social Strategy\n            and Indigenous Peoples Development Plan, supports productive\n            investments and training for residents of\n            \"ejidos,\" cooperatives, communal land groups, and\n            other economically disadvantaged producers, and develops an\n            appropriate institutional framework that creates a more\n            level playing field for social sector participation in\n            aquaculture. This component includes two subcomponents: (i)\n            social aquaculture production, and (ii) institutional\n            development. The project will support investments in\n            aquaculture parks and hatcheries, create limited liability\n            corporations to manage them, and train management staff."}, "docdt": "1997-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
