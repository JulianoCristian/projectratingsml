This report is divided in\n            five sections.  The first section briefly describes the\n            Mexican aquaculture sector, while the relationship between\n            aquaculture and the environment in Mexico is reviewed in the\n            second section.  The existing policy framework in Mexico to\n            manage environmental issues associated with aquaculture is\n            assessed in the third section.  The fourth section briefly\n            outlines the description of the project and the environment\n            mitigation plan is presented in the fifth section."}, "docdt": "1994-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
