The\n            project was terminated at the government's request\n            after nearly two years of operation from the date of loan\n            effectiveness. Disbursements were to concentrate on studies\n            aimed at improving the sector regulatory framework. Project\n            implementation had encountered insurmountable difficulties,\n            deriving basically from: 1) the inability of the Ministry of\n            Environment, Natural Resources an Fisheries (SEMARNAP) to\n            deliver the planned output, due to the budgetary\n            restrictions discussed in the report; and 2) the fact that\n            the Ministry of Finance rejected the arrangments set down in\n            the Staff Appraisal Report for the Targeted Investment Fund\n            and for the AquaMexico fund--this last one on the grounds\n            that their execution would have resulted in authorizing the\n            new parastatals, which was against the Government of\n            Mexico's policy."}, "docdt": "2000-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
