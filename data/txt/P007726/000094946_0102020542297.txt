IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION NOTE
MEXICO
AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 4152-ME)
I. Introduction: Origin of the Request for World Bank's Assistance
by the Mexican Government
1.        This Project Completion Note refers to the Mexico Aquaculture Development Project
(Loan No. 4152-ME), for which a loan of US$40.0 million equivalent was approved by the World
Bank's Board on May 1, 1997 and signed on June 24 1997. The loan was declared effective on June
24 1998 and the Borrower requested its cancellation on May 23 2000. Out of the loan amount, only
about $1 million were disbursed. This ICN was prepared by Mario Pedini (Consultant, FAO) and
reviewed by Julio Cordoba (LCSER), Louise Cord (PRMVP), Ricardo Hernandez (LCSEN), Carl
Lundin (LCSEN), Raffaello Cervigni(LCSEN) and Adolfo Brizzi (LCCIC). The Government of
Mexico contributed with an "Informe Final" from SEMARNAP (June 2000) and a letter of remarks
on the draft version of the ICN from BANCOMEXT. A summary of the SEMARNAP document is
included in the ICN. The full document is available at request.
2.        At the time of project identification, GOM considered that the domestic aquaculture
sector - although still a small and relatively novel one - had tremendous potential for growth.
Aquaculture global production was then boosting at sustained yearly rates of about 10%, while
growth of capture fisheries was stagnating. GOM's expansion forecasts were based on the large
physical potential of Mexican watersheds and coastal areas, taking also into account that in recent
years efforts had been made to create a more enabling environment for aquaculture development. It
existed, at the same time, a clear perception of the pressing need that the expected sector growth be
given proper support and guidance in order to avoid, or at least keep under control, the problems that
had frequently emerged elsewhere under similar circumstances, such as an anarchic exploitation of
natural resources leading to conflicts of diverse nature.
3.        For an external observer, in the early nineties Mexican aquaculture industry consisted of
a consolidated oyster culture sector, a reduced number of private-owned freshwater fish farms and an
emergent shrimp culture sector driven by new entrants with very limited experience. The GOM also
considered in its statistics a sizeable production of tilapia derived from stocking large reservoirs,
although this production should have been counted mainly as inland fisheries derived from
introductions and not as aquaculture, due to the fact that too young fish fry were used for stocking.
The aquaculture sector contributed less than 15% of the fisheries total catch and less than 1% of the
agricultural GDP, according to official statistics. Real figures would have been probably smaller, if
tilapia production categorized as of farming origin had been attributed to inland fisheries capture.
4.        SEPESCA formulated in 1992 a national program for aquaculture modernization, with
targets that required a very rapid acceleration of the development pace. When GOM discussed how to
implement this new program it was evident that additional funding would be required and the
Ministry of Finance (SHCP) suggested approaching the World Bank as a possible partner to
implement at least part of the new program. By involving the World Bank, SEPESCA was also trying
I



to create a new fund for promotion and development of commercial aquaculture, better suited to the
specific sector needs than the existing FIRA fund. As initially conceived by SEPESCA, the project
would have concentrated its activities in ten states where SEPESCA had previously carried out
coastal area development activities. Following SHCP's recommendation, the World Bank was
contacted as a potential financial partner. As a result, the Bank's preparation work started in 1993
with a pre-identification mission. A detailed analysis of the overall project cycle is presented in
section IV of this report.
II. Project Objectives and Description According to the SAR, March 1997
5.        The Aquaculture Development Project preparation process was initiated by SEPESCA
and later on completed by SEMARNAP, with the World Bank's technical and financial assistance. A
US$ 700 000 grant of the Government of Japan through the Bank's trust fund system was used to
cover preparation costs.
6.        The main project objective, as stated in the SAR dated March 28 1997, was to promote
sustainable aquaculture development by increasing the productivity of the aquaculture sector within a
framework of social consensus and environmental soundness, thereby contributing to economic
growth and poverty alleviation in Mexico. The project was to focus on social sector aquaculture
producers in seven states (Baja California Sur, Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Sinaloa and
Nayarit), though some activities related to public sector intervention and normative aspects would
have a national coverage. Total project cost was estimated at US$58 million over 6 years, of which
US$40 million of World Bank loan, channeled through the Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior
(BANCOMEXT). Project design provided for two main components, each with several sub-
components, as described below.
7.        The first main component was the Regulatory Framework and Public Goods
Component (US$13.0 million, or 25% of total base cost), with the purpose of assisting GOM in the
completion and implementation of the aquaculture sector regulatory framework for the subsector, also
providing key public goods to stimulate investments by the private and social sectors. This
component was broken down into the following sub-components:
+ the Regulatory Framework Sub-eomponent (US$0.8 million), to assist SEMARNAP in
simplifying and improving procedures to grant aquaculture concessions and in completing and
maintaining the regulatory framework for aquatic health;
* the Environment and Coastal Resources Management Sub-component (US$5.1 million), to
increase institutional capacity to monitor and manage natural resources affected by aquaculture
production; this sub-component consisted of: (i) a pilot project for integrated participatory coastal
resource management, (ii) a coastal inventory and water quality monitoring program, and (iii) an
improved environmental planning and review process, including mandatory environmental
assessments for each of the investment subprojects funded under the project;
* the Public Goods and Services Sub-component (US$ 4.5 million), to provide key inputs for
technology generation and aquatic health through the setting up of an Aquaculture Research Fund
and a network of regional diagnostic laboratories;
2



* the Project Coordination and Institutional Strengthening Sub-component (US$2.6 million) to
strengthen the SEMARNAP's General Directorate for Aquaculture (DGA) in-house capacity to
implement the project.
8.        The other main component was the Social Development Component (US$ 38.4 million,
or 75% of total base cost), intended to test alternative mechanisms for promoting the involvement of
social sector producers through joint investments in aquaculture parks, hatcheries and small scale
aquaculture farms, and to set up a financial framework to facilitate the involvement of the social
sector in aquaculture. This component had two sub-components:
* the Social Sector Aquaculture Production Sub-component (US$32.8 million), which would
support: (i) the creation of seven aquaculture parks and commercial hatcheries (a shrimp park,
three tilapia parks, one hatchery for abalone and pen shell scallop and a special hatchery for
pathogen resistant shrimp), and (ii) the setting up of a Targeted Investment Fund (TIF) to test
different mechanisms to promote aquaculture development among social sector producers lacking
resources to invest, through the provision of matching grants, technical assistance and community
workshops;
+ the Institutional Strengthening Sub-component (US$5.6 million), which would: (i) support
training and technical assistance programs for managers and beneficiaries of the aquaculture parks
and hatcheries, and (ii) create the AcuaMexico fund to assist social sector producers to obtain
access to commercial aquaculture investments.
9.        Project implementation would be SEMARNAP's prime responsibility. A  Project
Committee in charge of the approval of annual work plans and budgets was to be established with the
participation of representatives of SEMARNAP and its decentralized agencies, and of concerned state
governments. Within SEMARNAP, the DGA would implement and supervise all the project
activities, with the exception of the AcuaMexico investment subprojects and the aquaculture parks
training and monitoring activities. These would be placed under the responsibility of a Mandate
Committee to be created for managing AcuaMexico, while a private consulting firm would be
contracted to provide the expertise and staff required for setting up and operation of investments
related to this fund. Civil society organizations, Universities, production sector actors and private
research institutions would be involved in the implementation of: (i) the TIF; (ii) the regional
diagnostic laboratories network; (iii) the aquaculture parks and hatcheries; and (iv) the Research
Fund.
III. Loan Signature and Effectiveness
10.       As explained in further detail in the following section, negotiations between the GOM
and the World Bank went on from end 1995 to June 1997. A first negotiation started on April 1996
was interrupted and then restarted in August 1996. The Loan Agreement was eventually signed on
June 24 1997 with the SHCP as the Guarantor for GOM and BANCOMEXT as the Borrower.
11.       Loan effectiveness was subject to the satisfactory fulfillment, by September 24 1997, of
the following four conditions:
* formalization of the contractual agreements between BANCOMEXT and SHCP regarding: (i) the
transfer of the proceeds of the loan to SHCP; (ii) the transfer from SHCP to BANCOMEXT of
funds required for effecting payments to the WB on account of the principal, interest and other
3



charges of the loan; and (iii) the transfer from SHCP to BANCOMEXT of funds required for the
establishment and operation of the AcuaMexico fund;
* establishment of the Project Committee according to provisions of the Guarantee Agreement;
*  setting up of an adequately staffed Project Coordination Unit (PCU), through the recruitment or
reassignment by DGA of additional personnel to perform specialized duties related to
administrative matters, social analysis, environmental assessment and project implementation and
monitoring;
* installation at the DGA of an ad hoc computerized information management system that would
permit timely and effective project implementation.
12.       Fulfillment of all four conditions required three consecutive postponements of the
original deadline before loan effectiveness could eventually be declared on June 24 1998. The first
condition was met on September 30 1997, the Project Committee was formally established on
October 7 1997 and the information system was ready and operational by end September 1997. In
contrast, as a result of public sector recruitment restrictions imposed by the GOM's austerity program,
PCU's staffing in compliance with the third condition was more problematic than anticipated and
required additional extensions of the deadline imposed by the World Bank. The recruitment of the
additional staff was completed on June 24 1998 and in that date the project was declared operational.
IV. Comments on the Project Cycle
13.       World Bank's involvement in the project cycle started in May 1993 with a short pre-
identification mission carried out by a team of two Bank staff members with the purpose of outlining
the project's key features. The mission agreed with GOM that the main focus would be on
aquaculture development and poverty alleviation in ten states selected by SEPESCA and that the
principal beneficiaries would be small farmers, ejidos and other producers groups. The participation
of CNA as a partner in the project, namely to deal with the integrated use of water in rural areas for
aquaculture development, was contemplated by the mission but was eventually discarded due to the
contrary advise of SHCP.
14.       Concerns were also raised in the pre-identification mission's report regarding the ability
of SEPESCA to draw on its own budgetary resources for handling the execution of a medium size
project (by World Bank standards) of US$150 million. As a matter of fact, stringent regulations
issued by SHCP for investment projects funding - condensed in the so called principle of non
additionality of resources - impose that the totality of projects expenditures be pre-financed from
the regular budget of the executing Public Sector agency. This, in the case of SEPESCAIDGA, was
obviously insufficient in 1993. It is noteworthy that the pre-identification mission had already
identified - albeit not addressed conveniently - this important issue, which will later have the most
severe consequences on project execution. In fact, although the Bank emphasized the need that SHCP
allocate to both SEPESCA and the participating states adequate financial resources for project
preparation and implementation, this was never made a precondition to continue project formulation
and appraisal and the moves made to seek the active involvement of SHCP's Egresos or Public Sector
Expenditure Directorate in the project preparation process never succeeded.
15.       The Bank's identification mission was fielded in June 1993, almost immediately after
the conclusion of the pre-identification mission. Moreover, and although the experts team was
4



unusually large (nine members) for an identification mission, the duration of the mission (two and a
half weeks) was probably too short considering that its agenda included visits to ten states and
discussions in Mexico City with no less than fourteen institutions. Arguably, the mission was not
given enough time to complete an independent rapid sector appraisal' that may have thrown a
different light on the actual potential for large scale investments - a topic of highly controversial
debate in Mexico, in particular concerning freshwater aquaculture - and had thus to rely almost
solely on already available information, mainly taken from the 1992 SEPESCA modernization
program.
16.       Moreover, it appears that insufficient emphasis was laid at identification stage on crucial
issues such as the lack of previous experience of the Mexican counterparts (both at SEPESCA/DGA
level and at state level) in the preparation and implementation of even simple aquaculture investment
projects, and the meager institutional funding available for aquaculture development, as previously
highlighted. Overlooking these constraints resulted in a preliminary project layout far too complex
with regard to the existing formulation and implementation capacities and an unrealistic work
schedule for the project preparation phase, whose responsibility was entirely taken on by the DGA
and the participating states. In fact, it was agreed that preparation work would be carried out initially
at state level with the identification and selection of suitable investment subprojects that would be
subsequently evaluated by SEPESCA, then incorporated and harmonized in the overall project design.
Not surprisingly, this approach produced a multiplication of proposals, often mismatched within the
local context and of very uneven quality. Participating states eventually submitted a list of subprojects
that would have required a total investment of US$320 million, thus inducing SHCP to urge drastic
portfolio downsizing and even the reduction of the number of participating states - a problematic
task for SEPESCA to carry out at that point in time.
17.       Project preparation started around August 1993 and lasted until April 1994, when a
pre-appraisal phase was launched by the World Bank although it could be said that modifications to
project design continued well into the appraisal phase. The Bank's involvement in the process was
substantial in terms of human resources, especially in the first preparation mission of October-
November 1993, carried out by a team of I 1 Bank staff and consultants. However, the purpose of this
mission was to review and fine-tune the project objectives and components, leaving preparation
follow up in the hands of SEPESCA and the state governments. The mission defined a number of
studies to be prepared by GOM, highlighted pending issues for the two main components retained at
that stage, i.e. Aquaculture Development and Coastal Zones Planning and Management, and lowered
the total estimated project cost to US$140 million. An issue of special concern of the mission, that
however was never satisfactorily addressed, was the lack of definition about participation of
SEDESOL, which should have been a crucial actor in a project whose main beneficiaries were
supposed to be the rural poor, considering moreover the very limited capacity of SEPESCA to deal
with social communication and community development.
18.       Various missions followed during the preparation and pre-appraisal stages, with the
latter starting around April 1994, but these were usually focusing at various sub-components rather
than at the total project package. Notwithstanding the Bank's constant backstopping and the
recruitment of an expert to assist the SEPESCA/DGA team, in particular with regard to economic
analysis aspects, project preparation proceeded at a slow pace and the quality of the proposals
submitted by the states remained uneven. SEPESCA eventually managed to assemble a portfolio of
Nor was such diagnostic study included amongst the studies requested by the pre-identification mission, although
sub-sector analysis were completed at later date.
5



26 subprojects, oriented both to the incorporation of a layer of producers of the social sector in
productive activities of commercial-oriented aquaculture and to the integration of the most precarious
producers in rural aquaculture activities, and to identify as the project's financial instrument the
AcuaMexico fund, for the former, and the Targeted Investment Fund, for the latter.
19.       Bank's appraisal was completed in 1996, when SEPESCA had already ceased to exist as
an independent ministry and responsibility for the fisheries sector had been transferred to an ad hoc
vice-ministry (Subsecretaria de Pesca) within the newly established SEMARNAP. During appraisal
and all the way to negotiation, the differences of opinion between the Bank and GOM regarding the
project concept, which had surfaced since identification stage, were never settled and even grew
deeper. The Bank increasingly steered the project's focus to poverty alleviation and environmental
conservation, whereas SEMARNAP's DGA basically wanted, in the same way as SEPESCA
formerly had, a development project aimed at supporting takeoff of the national aquaculture industry.
Besides, GOM's strong view was that unlike environmental conservation, poverty alleviation felt
within the mandate of SEDESOL and not of SEMARNAP.
20.       This substantial disagreement caused the failure of a first round of negotiation, which
took place towards the end of 1995 on the basis of a preliminary version of the SAR. Actually, it
appears that this document failed to a considerable extent to interpret properly the GOM's priorities.
These priorities had changed somehow, when the GOM decided to close down SEPESCA as a
ministry and transfer the fishery sector as a sub-ministry within SEMARNAP. The differences in the
former SEPESCA approach and the new SEMARNAP's one caused tensions over the entire life-span
of the project.
21.       SHCP notified in 1996 to the Bank GOM's readiness to resume negotiation, and the
following period up till June 1997, when the project was signed, was spent in an attempt to reach a
compromise acceptable to both parties and also to address other problems that had appeared
meanwhile in relation to the statutes and regulations of the AcuaMexico fund. However, the original
divergences were not entirely reconciled, as revealed by the hybrid project outline adopted in the final
SAR. A further downsize, justified by the financial crisis that had hit the country and the persisting
difficulties in finalization of components design, led to the cost figures reflected in the Loan
Agreement.
V. Reasons for Loan Cancellation
22.       The project was terminated at GOM's request after nearly two years of operation from
the date of loan effectiveness. In this period, a total of NMP9.27 million (approximately equivalent to
US$1 million) was disbursed by the project; this expenditure concentrating on studies (5 in 1998 and
6 in 1999) aimed at improving the sector regulatory framework. Project implementation had
encountered insurmountable difficulties, deriving basically from: (i) the inability of SEMARNAP's
DGA to deliver the planned output, due to the budgetary restrictions already discussed; and (ii) the
fact that SHCP rejected the arrangements set down in the SAR for the Targeted Investment Fund and
for the AcuaMexico fund -this last one on the grounds that their execution would have resulted in
authorizing new parastatals, which was against GOM's policy.
6



23.       Regarding this last point no solution could be found for replacement of a Mandato2 for
BANCOMEXT, that could be acceptable both to the World Bank and to GOM. SHCP eventually
suggested that the sub-components related to aquaculture parks financing be taken out from the
project and entrusted to FOCIR, which had specific experience in high-risk ventures. This proposal
would have further reduced the size of the project and was not a solution favored by BANCOMEXT.
During discussions with the Bank, other alternatives were also explored which would have led to
drastic project curtailing to about US$10-15 million, and its parallel refocusing on normative rather
than development activities, canceling in particular the AcuaMexico fund or redirecting the loan to
new components such as lagoon rehabilitation, which had not been contemplated in the SAR and
were therefore not acceptable to the World Bank. Since no effective solution could be found and with
the prospect of an additional reduction of the project size that would have eliminated the component
that interested the Subsecretaria de Pesca most, the DGA on April 28 2000 requested SHCP to
proceed with the cancellation of the loan. On May 16 2000, SHCP instructed BANCOMEXT, as the
Borrower, to request cancellation to the World Bank. The Borrower implemented this directive on
May 23 2000.
24.       Several other factors, already commented, may have had negative effects on project
implementation - for instance the underlying disagreement between the Bank and
SEPESCA/SEMARNAP on the project focus, and the complexity of its design, even after it had been
considerably scaled down, vs. the sector actors' very limited experience in investment projects.
However, while it should be acknowledged that these were partly the consequences of design flaws,
their relative importance fades when compared with the above two circumstances, which by
themselves would have sufficed to determine loan cancellation.
25.      It should be emphasized that these circumstances should not have arisen unexpectedly,
since they were the consequence of having overlooked, at project design stage, the importance of
SHCP's Egresos role and of having failed to ensure its responsible participation in the preparation
process. As a matter of fact, the Bank's counterpart inside SHCP had been almost exclusively Credito
(Directorate in charge of relations with International Financial Institutions). This, and the poor
institutional communication between Egresos and Cridito - a factor which was underestimated as
well - created a situation where the Bank was misleadingly given assurance by Credito or by
SEPESCA/SEMARNAP on the practicability of the proposed arrangements for project's financial
execution, while the main concerned authority, Egresos, had already ruled out the release of
additional funds. SEPESCA regular budget was clearly insufficient in 1993 and the situation
worsened after the program of austerity linked to the economic crisis that hit the country from 1994. It
is worth noting that the 1993 investment budget of DGA was of US$14 million, an amount already
insufficient with respect to the project size envisaged at that time. -Moreover, the lack of real
involvement of SHCP Egresos in project formulation understandably led to internal resistance to
endorse the changes required to break the deadlock of the AcuaMexico fund, possibly the project
component which interested the Subsecretaria de Pesca most. The inclusion of the fisheries sector
(formerly administered by SEPESCA) in SEMARNAP, where it had to compete with other sectors of
higher priority, made budget allocations even harder for DGA to obtain. Attempts in the last year of
project operation to finance project activities with SEMARNAP regular program funds were not
successful since aquaculture development was not considered a top priority.
2 In Mexico, the Mandato (Mandate) is a different legal instrument than the Fideicomiso (Trust Fund) and it is used
to distribute funds.

VI. Lessons Learned
26.       Several lessons can be learned from this project on different aspects. Some of them are
specific to the situation in Mexico, while others may apply to different country contexts as well.
27.       Country specific lessons, that of course apply to the broad category of external financed
development projects, can be recapitulated as follows:
*  As long as the principle of non-additionality of resources is rigorously enforced by GOM, it
appears crucial to seek the involvement of SHCP's Egresos since the earliest stages of project
preparation and to discuss with it the financial arrangements envisaged for execution. At the same
time, the preparation team should be prepared to work out alternative solutions to address the
issue of project's expenditures pre-financing. In fact, it has been noted that the technical
institutions in charge of emerging sectors, such as aquaculture, tend to take for granted that the
positive outcome of a negotiation with the World Bank is sufficient per se to remove any possible
objection from the part of the federal financial institutions and in particular to grant release of
extra funding for project implementation. Since this has proven a misleading assumption, it is
highly recommended to plan future investment programs on the basis of a phased development
approach tailored to the financial capability of the executing agency, seeking whenever feasible to
establish alliances between several entities which could be able to pool their resources.
*  A similar argument relates the need for an accurate feasibility analysis of the institution and
devices proposed. The non-allocation of resources by Egresos had grounds not only in budgetary
reasons, but also in its reluctance to support the creation of AquaMexico and the Targeted
Investment Fund for policy reasons regarding the creation of parastatals: these need
Congressional approval that the Executive was not willing to negotiate in the case of this project.
+  In general, it is advisable to avoid preparation and negotiation of Bank's loans in periods
immediately preceding the presidential elections, since the institutional changes brought about in
Mexico by a new presidency deeply affect the institutional set-ups, the government policies and
in most cases also the management of the federal agencies. The political orientation of the sector
institution may change, as it was the case with this project, weakening the sense of ownership and
therefore internal support for finalization of preparation and/or for funding of implementation.
*  The role of the Financial Agent (BANCOMEXT in this case) is relevant to bridge any gap of
understanding between the Bank staff and the executing agency, specially when this last one has
small experience in dealing with requirements of international agencies. Moreover, direct
negotiations between Bank and executing agency may cause confusions in the flow of
documentation and compromise the understanding of the general advance of the negotiations.
28.       Lessons that could serve as a guide for future Bank's operations in other developing
countries, particularly as far as new or emerging sectors are concerned, are summarized below:
* The persistent disagreement between the Bank and GOM on the project's concept and main focus
definitely led to considerable wasting of time and financial resources, and to a final design based
on a compromise, that was not entirely satisfactory. This suggests that it would be more sensible,
whenever the positions of the Bank and the client on essential matters substantially differ and
cannot be reconciled, as in this specific case, to discontinue project preparation by mutual
agreement.
8



* In the case of emerging sectors like aquaculture, and whenever specific technical expertise is not
already available - or not easy to mobilize -it would not seem appropriate to undertake large
scale complex development projects. The difficulties of dealing with early phases of development
of emerging sectors advocate keeping investment projects design as straightforward as possible,
in order to ensure easier management, shorter and more efficient project cycle and more rapid
attainment of the objectives.
29.       The country specific recommendation on phased approach also applies to countries other
than Mexico. In fact, a phased and guided approach, accompanied by the setting up of a proper
enabling environment, should represent the prime option for fostering gradual and sustainable
development of new sectors. This would also prevent uncontrolled growth phenomena that usually
result in huge social and environmental costs, while allowing sufficient time for education and
training of producers as well as Public Sector planners and technical officers. The use of APL or LIL

solution to work with emerging sectors with good potential for development.
VII Borrower comments3
30.       The resources invested in the project allowed to advance in the content of the component
"Regulatory Framework and provision of Public Goods and Services." This enhanced the knowledge
of the framework in which the aquaculture sector develops. The actions carried out during these first
two years of the project helped undeniably the General Direction of Acuacultura to improve the
regulatory framework of the activity and to strengthen it in terms of equipment and quality of its
human resources.
31.       The project could not be implemented according to what was programmed due to
multiple circumstances, like the delay in complying with the initial conditions of effectiveness of the
loan, the non-authorisation of the budgetary allocations required to operate, and the legal
impossibility to establish AcuaMexico and the Program to Support the Low Income Aquaculture
Producers (Spanish acronym: PAAER) in the terms that were agreed in the original design of the
project. Such contingencies pushed the project away from its original objective, of increasing the
productivity of the aquaculture sector.
32.       An in-depth restructuring of the project was tried so as to adjust it to a size that would
allow to perform only those actions that SEMARNAP considered as high-priority. Nevertheless,
even a reduction of the loan to US$ 10 millions which have required yearly budget assignments during
the biennium 2001-2002 superior to 50 million pesos, which would have implied internal budget
reallocations of about 40 million pesos annually. Given the unlikelyhood of obtaining an increase of
the budgetary ceiling and considering the difficult implementation of AcuaMexico and PAAER, it
was concluded that the most appropriate decision was to cancel the part of the project financed with
the loan 4153-ME.
33.       Considering the advances of the project before cancellation and the investment
perspectives foreseen for next years, some the original project goals will not be attained, namely: the
construction and operation of the parks; the construction of rural production units resulting from the
implementation of the Program to Support the Low Income Aquaculture Producers (the former
Targeted Investment Fund); and the implementation of the pilot plan for the administration of the

coastal resources of Veracruz. It would only be possible to elaborate two complete Mexican Official
Norms, (out of the commitment to elaborate seven norms for the Aquaculture sector) and advance the
technical content of other four. The program for monitoring of the quality of water discharged by
aquaculture activities is being discontinued, causing lack of information to validate the effectiveness
of water treatment programs.
34.       The cancellation of the loan does not put an end to the development of the project in
Mexico. It is the intention of the Borrower to continue implementation with its own resources, given
its importance as trigger of the processes needed by SEMARNAP to accomplish its mission of
promoting, fostering and regulating the culture of aquatic flora and fauna in the country and to
improve the quality of life of the inhabitants without deteriorating natural resources and the
environment.
