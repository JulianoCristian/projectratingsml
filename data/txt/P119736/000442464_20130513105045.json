           Productivity Project (EAPP) for Kenya were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Grantee performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in-country\n            systems input distribution, agricultural credit;\n            diversification support should adequately support emergency\n            operations. In the future, more attention should be focused\n            on appraising and supporting capacity building as an\n            important success factor. The fiduciary management capacity\n            of the implementing agency at the national and lower levels\n            needs to be enhanced. There is need to adequately provide\n            for capacity building of national and district level staff\n            and to encourage computerization and simplification of most\n            of the records. Inclusion of some critical post-harvest\n            interventions can improve project outcomes. Whenever\n            production-enhancing technologies are promoted, it is\n            advisable to also support other off-farm activities such as\n            storage and marketing. Cross-sectoral and international\n            experience, especially in the input voucher scheme, should\n            be incorporated. The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) should\n            emulate existing transfer mechanisms proven successful in\n            Kenya. Existing programs provide useful platforms on which\n            to build and gradually scale up service activities such as\n            the ones pursued under this project. Overall, the EAPP was\n            justified given the context of Kenya\u0092s import dependence and\n            rising food and fuel prices."}, "docdt": "2013-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
