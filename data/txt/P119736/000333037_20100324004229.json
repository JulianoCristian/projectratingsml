        Agricultural Productivity Project for Kenya is to assist the\n            recipient to increase access to agricultural inputs and\n            technologies among targeted smallholder farmers in selected\n            districts. There are four components to the project, the\n            first component being up-scaling the existing agricultural\n            credit program (Kilimo Biashara) at a cost of Euro 5.07\n            million.  The project will build on the partnerships already\n            established between the Government, International Fund for\n            Agricultural Development (IFAD), Alliance for Green\n            Revolution in Africa (AGRA), and Equity Bank to leverage\n            additional credit and scale up loans to farmers. The overall\n            strategy is to leverage Equity Bank's enormous\n            resources through a 10 percent guarantee fund on the basis\n            of which Equity Bank will provide credit facilities of up to\n            US$50 million to smallholder farmers, agro-input dealers and\n            other value chain players in the agricultural sector. The\n            second component is the up scaling the existing input\n            voucher scheme (Kilimo Plus) in selected districts through\n            the Government's National Accelerated Agricultural\n            Inputs Access Program (NAAIAP) at a cost of Euro 9.47\n            million. The third component is the up-scaling of the orphan\n            crop program at a cost of Euro 3.08 million. This component\n            will focus on supplying planting materials of orphan crops\n            to smallholder farmers in semi-arid areas.  This will\n            involve promoting farmer involvement in seed bulking and\n            multiplication of orphan and other crops, including sorghum,\n            cassava and millet.  These crops are drought tolerant and\n            more suitable for such areas and could be important\n            substitutes to maize both for human consumption and in\n            providing alternative ingredients to maize in animal feed\n            production.  Finally, the fourth component is the support to\n            project administration costs."}, "docdt": "2010-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
