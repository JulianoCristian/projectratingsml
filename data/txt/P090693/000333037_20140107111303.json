Environment and\n            Social (LENS) Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: The\n            Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) provided a proven\n            mechanism to support decentralization by delivering\n            financial resources to provincial and district\n            administrations. As a nascent institution, EPF capacity\n            development needs to be prioritized. The EPF lacked\n            visibility and regular communication with higher-level\n            Government of Lao (GoL) staff, potential foreign donors, and\n            the media, partly resulting in its inability to legally\n            secure a sustainable source of financing from GOL revenues.\n            Furthermore, EPF relied unsustainably on World Bank\n            technical support. For the EPF to mature as an institution,\n            it requires enhanced emphasis on technical capacity\n            development, strategic communication planning, and improved\n            fund-raising ability. The presence of voluntary private\n            sector responsibility in Lao PDR can provide substantial\n            financial support."}, "docdt": "2013-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
