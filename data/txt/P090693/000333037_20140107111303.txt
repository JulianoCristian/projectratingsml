1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

(a) Country and Sector Context
Socio-demographic context.1 Laos is a landlocked country with a 2005 population of
5.8 million, of which 73 percent were living in rural areas. Only 27 percent of the
population aged 15 and above had higher than primary education. The country was
one of the poorest in South-East Asia with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita
of US$450. The country is ethnically extremely diverse with 49 ethnic groups, some
very small and highly vulnerable. At the time, about 77 percent of the labor force was
engaged in agricultural activities, dominated by rice cultivation in lowland areas.

Economic context. Economic growth increased to seven percent in 2005. Lao’s
economy continued to be heavily dependent on capital-intensive natural resource
exports. Over 50 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was generated by the
agricultural and natural resources sector such as forestry, hydropower, and mining.
The economy benefited from increasing foreign direct investment in hydropower,
copper and gold mining, logging, and construction. Economic growth reduced poverty
rates to 34 percent in 2002/3.

Natural resources and environment sector. The country possesses significant natural
resource assets. It is extremely well endowed with water resources that have the
potential to generate 23,000 MW of hydropower, an important asset for engaging in
trade with the economically booming neighbors.2 Forested land covered more than 40
percent of the country, with 20 percent nominally under conservation status.3 Forest
cover had been decreasing due to threats stemming from logging, agricultural
expansion, hydro-electricity projects, and mining.

Environmental and social safeguards. Beginning 2000, the Government of Lao PDR
(GOL) started to strengthen its policy, legal and institutional framework for
environmental and social safeguards. It initiated decentralization of environmental
functions to provinces and established procedures for environmental assessment. A
turning point towards better practices was reached by the development of the Nam
Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project (NT2) 4 addressing previous shortcomings of
hydropower and mining projects by extensive, consultative work on impact
assessment and preparation of mitigation and compensation plans. At the same time,
uncoordinated, weak institutions, inadequate human resources (two percent of public
sector staff), and very low governmental budget (less than one percent of GOL
budget) constrained implementation and enforcement of ambitious Environment and
Social Impacts Assessment (ESIA) legislation and policies.

Key sector issues identified at appraisal included: (i) depletion of natural resources,
especially forest and biodiversity; (ii) rapid hydropower and mining development and

  Project financing: IDA grant US$20m; IDA Partial Risk Guarantee US$50m; MIGA Guarantee US$200m. See

                                                 1
associated environmental and social challenges, especially those related to relocation
of ethnic groups; (iii) national policy focusing on economic growth and poverty
reduction potentially leading to adverse environmental and social impacts; and (iv)
weak implementation of the legal and policy framework for social and environmental
management.

(b) Rationale for Bank Assistance
At appraisal, Lao PDR was well placed to achieve economic growth and reduce
poverty, provided that the GOL could increase the contribution of natural resources
(especially hydropower and mining) to development, and undertake reforms to
improve governance. The latter included improving the management of
environmental and social issues and addressing the legacy of past large hydropower
projects.

In 2005, the Environment Protection Fund (EPF) was established with support from
the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) as an administratively and
financially autonomous organization to strengthen environmental protection,
sustainable natural resource management, biodiversity conservation, and community
development in Laos. The EPF was expected to become the primary vehicle to fund
environmental investments in the country including revenues from NT2. This was
well reflected in the Laos Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 31758-LA, March 2005)
as all but two CAS objectives5 support the Project design and the recommendations of
the Sixth National Socioeconomic Development Plan (NSEDP, 2006-2010).6

(c) Higher level objectives
The higher-level objectives to which the Project contributed were long-term poverty
reduction and equitable economic growth and social development as a prerequisite to
achieve Lao’s long-term development goals through sustainable use of natural
resources.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

(a) Project Development Objective
The PDO, as stated in the original Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the
Development Credit Agreement, was to assist the Recipient to strengthen the
management of environmental and social issues associated with the sustainable use of
natural resources in Lao PDR for enhancing quality of growth and reducing poverty.

(b) Key Performance Indicators
The PAD proposed two key performance indicators (KPIs):
     Percentage of development projects complying with relevant safeguard
       policies (target 60 %); and
     Percentage prevalence of selected prohibited environmental activities in target
       provinces (target 50 %).


5
  (a) Strengthen management of key drivers for future growth by strengthening policies and resources for
environment conservation, improving rural livelihoods, and increasing sustainability of natural resource use; and
(b) support implementation of NT2 by extending the capacity building of GOL outside the NT2 Project area to
cope with any potential cumulative environment and social impacts.

                                                       2
It should be noted that despite a focus of the PDO on growth and poverty reduction,
no specific KPI was defined. Schedule 7 to the Development Grant Agreement for
the original financing listed a series of KPI, which did not match those in the PAD.

1.3 Revised PDO and KPIs, and Reasons/Justification

The PDO was revised in 2010 during a Board approved (level-one) restructuring
which included an extension of the closing date and approval of additional financing
(AF). The PDO became: to assist the recipient to strengthen the management of
environmental and social issues associated with sustainable use of natural resources
in Lao PDR. The last part of the PDO, “… for enhancing quality of growth and
reducing poverty” was removed, as it was meant only as an adjective to describe the
“higher objective” (see 1.1.c). In fact, the Project did not have growth or poverty
interventions and no KPI measured growth or poverty outcomes.

The two KPIs were revised in order to improve measurability, clarity, and attribution.
After restructuring the KPIs became:
    Percentage of environment compliance certificates (ECCs) issued by Water
        Resources and Environmental Administration (WREA) that are of adequate
        quality as judged by a third party annually (no target proposed); and
    Percentage of complaints resolved in Bolikhamxay and Khammouane
        Provinces (no target proposed).

The FA amended, restated and replaced the DGA for the original financing, and thus
covered both the original and the additional financing for the entire project from the
effective date of the FA.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

In the first phase of the project (commenced under the original financing) with an on-
demand subgrant mechanism, the target group was very broad. It included national,
provincial and district governmental agencies involved in environmental and social
management such as the WREA and other beneficiaries including community groups,
mass organizations or civil society organizations, educational and research
institutions. Beneficiaries in the three provinces of central Lao (Bolikhamxay,
Khammouane, and Savannakhet) were eligible to apply for subgrants.

In Phase 2 (commenced under the additional financing), the subgrant minimal amount
was increased and beneficiary selection became based on existing plans. Subgrants
were distributed to various national and provincial departments of the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), which had replaced WREA just
before the beginning of Phase 2 (i.e. after AF approval). Such beneficiaries included
MONRE’s Department of Planning and Cooperation (DPC), Department of
Environment Quality and Promotion (DEQP), Department of Environment and Social
Assessment (DESIA), Department of Forest Resources Management (DFRM) as well
as the Provincial Offices of Natural Resources and Environment (PONRE) in the
three above-mentioned provinces and the Nam Theun Nam-Kading River Basin.
Communities were indirect (subgrants implemented by these departments and
agencies) and direct (subgrants to Community Conservation Network) beneficiaries.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Policy Implementation and Capacity Enhancement (PICE; US$1.91
million). This component was intended to strengthen capacity for environmental and
social policy formulation and implementation through demand-driven capacity
building subgrants offered through the five PICE sub-windows: (A1) Environmental
and Social Monitoring and Policy Implementation Support (US$280,700); (A2)
Integrated River Basin Management (US$466,000); (A3) Hydropower Sector Policy
Support (US$479,800); (A4) Social Safeguards Management (US$390,600); and (A5)
Environmental Education and Awareness (US$292,900).

Component 2: Community and Biodiversity Investments (CBI; US$1.74 million). This
component used demand-driven subgrants to strengthen conservation practices and
livelihood improvements in and around protected areas and to improve localized
environmental conditions through partnership arrangements involving communities,
local governments, and civil society organizations in three central Lao provinces
through the two CBI sub-windows: (B1) Protected Area Management
(US$1,165,850); and (B2) Community Investment (US$575,000)

Component 3: Management and Monitoring Support (Window Management Unit or
WMU; US$1.15 million). This component included three sub-components: (C1)
Capacity Building of EPF windows (US$766,350) through the establishment of a
WMU responsible for implementing the PICE and CBI windows; (C2) Marketing and
Business Development of EPF’s subgrants (US$302,200); and (C3) Guidance,
Evaluation, and Monitoring (US$79,000). The component was meant to support the
Project’s compliance with agreed fiduciary and safeguard requirements and ensure
effective collaboration among governmental agencies, relevant projects, development
partners, and other stakeholders.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparations, Design, and Quality at Entry

(a) Soundness of the background analysis.
Key Project activities were initially intended to be part of NT2.7 However, during pre-
appraisal of NT2 in 2003, it was decided to develop a stand-alone project, to extend
environmental and social management policies and practices established for the NT2
beyond its limited geographic intervention area8 and to build institutional capacity to
implement those policies. This stand-alone project became LENS. Retrospectively,
this was the correct decision in view of the rapidly increasing hydropower and
industrial developments in the country and the weak governmental framework and
capacity to address related environmental and social issues.

The team was able to draw on the extensive preparatory work carried out for NT2, so
preparation lasted only six months. Project design was built on a key lesson of the
sector: Along with the development of policies and laws, significant attention should
be paid to the development of institutions, building of human resources, establishing
systems, involvement of communities and capacity at the local levels (provincial,
district and communities). In addition, component 3 was designed to strengthen the
EPF’s capacity to implement the Project. The subgrant approach allowed GOL to

 NT2 watershed (Nakai Nam Theun National Protected Area and two corridors), the Nakai plateau, and the
downstream areas along the Nam Theun and Xe Bang Fai rivers.

address specific beneficiary priorities and needs based on their existing capacity and
ownership. The provision for an open-menu of activity-focused subgrants afforded a
flexible project structure. The design and mandate of the EPF for channeling funds as
subgrants in a flexible and demand-driven manner through its thematic windows
fulfilled this purpose.

(b) Assessment of Project design
The purpose of the Project was to support the GOL in building and strengthening
capacity at all levels for sustainable management of its natural resources. The Project
design, targeting in parallel the development and implementation of new policy and
legal instruments, the strengthening of technical and institutional capacity of
stakeholder and the implementation of environmental priorities in three target
provinces, was appropriate. It involved actors at all levels, including civil society,
through a systemic approach combining capacity building, planning and
implementation, and addressed GOL and Bank priorities for sustainable growth. It
responded to lessons from environmental capacity-building projects to establish a
systematic approach resulting in a set of instruments and tools. However, this
arrangement was complex and difficult to manage by the EPF as a newly established
implementing agency because of: (i) coordination needs ensuring expected synergies
between the three pillars with multiple beneficiaries and actors; (ii) uncertainty related
to the nature, impact and results of demand-driven subgrants; and (iii) pilot
introduction of support for the devolution of environmental management functions to
provinces and districts ahead of the 2012 Sam Sang directive. 9 The choice of the
components and their funding allocation was adequate and linked tightly to the
objective, except that “ensuring quality of growth and reducing poverty” was only
indirectly supported by the design.

(c) Assessment of Project’s strategic choices.
Limited project intervention area on the ground. The Project’s intervention on the
ground targeted Bolikhamxay, Khammouane and Savannakhet, all in central Lao, to
avoid spreading limited resources too widely and to enhance the impact of NT2. The
rationale for selecting central Lao was the importance of its national and international
biodiversity and the need to strengthen GoL’s capacity to better manage
environmental and social issues in parallel with infrastructure development.
Assessment: The geographic focus helped to test the approach on a manageable scale
so lessons could inform future scale-up. It also responded to the limited budget and
suited the EPF’s expected learning curve.

Sector-wide demand-driven capacity building and investments. The Project design
specifically aimed at improving implementation capacity through support for
development of institutions, human resources, systems, tools and involvement of
community and capacity at national, provincial, district and community level.
Assessment: The approach addressed adequately ownership, commitment, and
sustainability of capacity building efforts. However, piloting demand-driven
approaches at all levels involved too wide a range of beneficiaries and produced a
scattered impact.


9
 In 2012, the governmental directive on delegation of responsibilities and benefits to local authorities (three-built:
provinces, districts, villages) was passed. It is known as Sam Sang.



                                                          6
Using a new financial mechanism. The Project used two out of five of EPF’s thematic
windows for smaller and larger subgrants (below/above US$10,000). The design was
built on EPF’s set-up, a flexible, demand-driven instrument with an open-menu of
options coupled with technical assistance to match the capacity of sub-grantees and
implementing agencies. Assessment: Implementation demonstrated the feasibility of
this novel approach for Lao PDR while pointing at potential efficiency risks and high
administrative costs for multiple, small-size grants.

(d) Institutional set-up for implementation arrangement
To compensate for the emerging nature of the EPF, the implementation arrangements
provided for the establishment of a Project funded WMU, essentially a Project
Management Unit, staffed with consultants. Assessment: This was a logical decision;
however, the Project’s funding allocation to EPF was insufficient to enable its
secretariat to acquire solid institutional and technical capacity, visibility at national
level and among development partners and arrangements for receiving sufficient
external financial resources.

(e) Risks assessment
The mains risks identified included: (i) delays in implementing the agreed policy and
regulatory reforms; (ii) inadequate availability of human and financial resources; (iii)
EPF’s capacity as a new organization; (iv) lack of capacity at central and local levels;
and (v) lack of recurrent budget at provincial level to ensure sustainability of
subgrants. The overall risk was rated “modest”. Assessment: The risk assessment
lacked a key risk related to the EPF’s ability to access NT2 revenues. More, NT2
revenues were presented as mitigation measures for some identified risks. This gap in
the risk analysis contributed to inefficiency in addressing lack of human and financial
resources which slowed implementation. Further, the risk assessment did not
adequately rate the risks related to the use of demand-driven finance instruments
through the EPF as a new institution with limited staff capacity, operational budget,
and implementation experience. The overall rating should have been significant. See
Annex 11 for a full discussion of risks at appraisal and their actual outcomes.

(f) Quality at Entry - Moderately Satisfactory.
Based on the analysis above, the Quality at Entry is rated as MS. The PDO and design
were well aligned with GOL policy and the CAS. Lessons from similar sector projects
were incorporated. The implementation arrangements and operational instruments
developed during preparation (PIP, OM for EPF, EPF recruitment plan, draft forms
for subgrants applications, PP, ToRs for three major subgrants, etc.) were of adequate
quality and reviewed extensively by GOL and the three participating provinces.
However, the short preparation time resulted in an underestimation of EPF’s capacity
to rapidly become operational10and financially and institutionally sustainable during
the project. The design included as a mitigation measure at EPF/WMU level the
recruitment of a two-year Chief Technical Management Advisor (CTA) tasked to
develop and implement an EPF training program, and to assist during the critical
learning stage. Retrospectively, this arrangement failed to meet expectations. Most
importantly, the design proposed a largely deficient monitoring and evaluation(M&E)


10
 The constitution of the EPF Board, the appointment of EPF Executive Director, and the recruitment of a CTMA
which were conditions of effectiveness, delayed implementation by about a year.



                                                     7
system with poorly defined indicators and insufficient support or incentive to carry
out monitoring and to report on outcomes (see section 2.3 also).

2.2 Implementation

Two key factors affected the Project during its entirety: limited capacity of the EPF
and challenging coordination among governmental agencies impacting delivery of
legal, institutional and policy subgrant outputs particularly during sector institutional
reforms. Other issues impacted either the original or the additional financing phase
(see Phase 1 and Phase 2 details below).

Limited capacity of EPF. EPF’s was a new autonomous institution operating with a
small budget from an endowment fund and with few staff. In Phase 1, the Project
supported the development of a detailed subgrant management system and provided
technical and financial assistance aiming to assist EPF with evolving into a strong,
competent institution. However, recruitment of EPF staff for the Project was suffered
from a lack of qualified human resources in Laos, particularly in environment and
social impacts, planning and monitoring, procurement and financial management.
One consequence, due also to the low competitiveness of the EPF salary scale, was a
high staff turnover especially of financial and procurement staff. More, the demand-
driven approach resulted in a high number of subgrants (154 in Phase 1 and 19 in
Phase 2) involving significant technical support and administrative costs. Finally,
EPF’s expected flow of funds from NT2 revenues could not be reached, impacting
further EPF’s limited operational budget. The disconnect between the limited EPF
capacity and the large volume of subgrants, aggravated by low capacity of sub-
grantees for identification, implementation and fiduciary management, resulted in
delayed implementation and weak monitoring.

In Phase 2, a decision was taken to redress the unbalanced situation by shifting the
subgrant approach from demand-driven to planned subgrants while reducing their
number (mostly CBI), increasing funding amounts per subgrant, and centralizing
fiduciary functions to the EPF. Assessment: This decision was correct as it entailed a
number of advantages: (a) reduction of EPF’s administrative costs while improving
fiduciary efficiency; (b) achievement of more tangible and measurable results and
improved monitoring; and (c) reallocation of resources for completing policy and
institutional reforms (PICE component) reconfirmed by GOL as sector priorities
during Phase 1 and for consolidating community conservation efforts under one
umbrella subgrant, the Community Conservation Network (CCN). The revised
approach in Phase 2 successfully reached the Project’s main targets. Nonetheless,
EPF’s financial, technical, and human capacity remained below expectations to fully
accomplish its mandate.

Challenging coordination among governmental agencies and delivery of outputs
particularly during sector institutional reforms. Effective coordination and
cooperation among multiple agencies were difficult and time-consuming due to
limited human resources at each agency and strong vertical administration and
decision-making practices. Priority subgrants under PICE11 aimed to address complex
legal and institutional issues that required active political support from high-level

                                                    8
decision makers (Project Steering Committee/EPF Board) to overcome
implementation challenges. Assessment: Despite favorable implementation
arrangements, these processes were time-consuming and reduced overall Project
efficiency particularly during institutional reforms primarily in Phase 1, 12 when
engagement of stakeholders needed to be renewed (change in counterparts, renewal of
training and awareness-raising, etc.). In addition, EPF’s performance to engage with
other development partners in the sector was less than satisfactory as demonstrated by
EPF’s lackluster reputation and lack of new partnerships.

Phase 1 (2006-2010) suffered from delayed effectiveness. WMU staff and Chief
Technical Management Advisor (CTMA) recruitment, a condition of effectiveness,
took about 10 months thereby delaying effectiveness by as many months. Significant
time was also required to secure approval of operational procedures and manuals as
well as to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the EPF, the Project Steering
Committee (PSC), and the Science, Technology, and Environment Agency (STEA).
Assessment: Delays were due to the lack of readiness for implementation, which was
foreseeable given the emerging nature of the EPF at that time and the high
qualifications needed for the CTMA position. Unfortunately, this slowed
implementation early on as it took another two years to complete all recruitment and
reach a steady state of implementation. The Project rating of moderately
unsatisfactory in 2007 corresponded to the implementation delays related to late start-
up, EPF’s low capacity, and inexperience with Bank procedures and high staff
turnover.

Phase 2 (2010-2013) restructuring and AF responded to the experiences and lessons
learned under Phase 1. The AF of US$ 3 million for three more years covered the
identified financing gaps to complete major PICE and CBI activities and to continue
capacity building priorities related to: (a) implementation of the CAR and ESIA
decrees at central and local level; and (b) planning and management of cumulative
impact using an integrated river basin management approach for NT-NKD, including
development of a conservation community network, both to enhance achievement of
the PDO. In retrospect, the AF amount and timeframe corresponded adequately to the
design changes (i.e. larger, lesser and pre-identified subgrants) and forthcoming
additional Bank support to the hydropower and mining sector (under a different
technical assistance project), which obviated the need for hydropower policy support
under Phase. Assessment: The restructuring and AF created conditions for faster and
better implementation. The two Phase 2 effectiveness conditions were appropriate and
did not cause delays. However, three shortfalls can be cited: (a) the restructuring
could have been introduced at MTR; (b) modifications in the M&E framework did not
fully respond to the gaps identified (see 2.3.); and (c) despite renewed attention on
EPF’s capacity, its budget for capacity building was reduced.

Other external factors and events impacted Phase 2. The creation of a new ministry in
charge of the Environment (MONRE) created new capacity building needs for the
PICE component (US$360,000 were reallocated to MONRE). Further, it required the
development of new cooperation and coordination arrangements between EPF and

12
  Before 2006 protected areas were under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest (MAF). In 2006, MEM was
created. In 2009 WREA was created. In 2011/2012 MONRE absorbed WREA and some staff responsible for PA
and land management from MAF.



                                                  9
MONRE. The governmental decentralization directive on devolution of
environmental management functions to provinces and districts in late 2012 (Sam
Sang) strengthened political support for the Project although without an adequate
increase of financial resources for provinces and districts. Access to NT2 revenues for
the environment and forestry sector was gained in 2011/2012, though MONRE, not
EPF, secured these revenues. Nonetheless, it is contributing to the sector’s needs
thereby increasing the sustainability of Project achievements. On the other hand,
despite being a key target of the Project, EPF was not able to access directly these
resources.

The increasing developments in the hydropower and mining sector accelerated during
Phase 2 and put an additional burden on the slowly growing environmental and social
management capacity supported by the Project. Particularly, DESIA, created in 2009,
and the provincial and district level offices struggled to keep pace to ensure
compliance with the social and environmental frameworks. Assessment: Project
implementation arrangements and design in Phase 2 were flexible enough to respond
to these factors and to deliver the intended results with minor implementation
problems except EPF’s inability to tap NT2 revenues. Future and continued capacity-
building efforts are still needed to consolidate and strengthen the new environmental
institutions such as MONRE (DESIA, PONRE), the District Office of Natural
Resources and Environment (DONRE) and the RBC.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

(a) Overall M&E rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
M&E design and quality: Unsatisfactory. The original results framework included a
few poorly defined indicators lacking baseline data, targets, and monitoring methods
and loose connections to the PDO. It did not measure EPF’s increased institutional
capacity or general capacity gains achieved with beneficiaries of subgrants (e.g.
number of beneficiaries trained, gender analysis, number of community
beneficiaries).13 Adding to the confusion, the Development Grant Agreement included
an annex with indicators, which were not fully synchronized with the PAD results
framework KPIs. Further, none of the EPF manuals included a specific M&E
framework, which could have been used to guide EPF with M&E and progress
reporting. The Project’s budget to establish and implement a WMU-based M&E
system was too limited.

M&E implementation: Moderately Unsatisfactory. Several factors influenced the
fluctuating quality of M&E (and ratings in ISRs):
     Indicators. The inappropriate quality of the original indicators, partially due to
        the demand-driven (open) nature of the interventions, resulted in multiple
        informal and inconsistent revisions from the Bank team as documented in the
        ISRs. During Phase 1, the two KPIs were not measured. After restructuring,
        the revised result framework was improved but still lacked baseline data and
        targets (see annex 10 for indicator revisions). The two revised KPIs were
        measured but did not fully assess the PDO achievements. One indicator
13
  The PAD proposed a capacity-building composite index for main beneficiaries (annex 4). But it was not being
implemented due to late project start and early resignation of CTMA. An institutional capacity building assessment
was not carried out during preparation.




                                                       10
     measured the strengthening of management of a specific social issue, in this
     case the grievance mechanism in two provinces. The other indicator measured
     the strengthening of management of a specific environmental issue, in this
     case the hydro-mining environmental standards (for a comprehensive analysis
     of the evolution of indicators during the Project, see Annex 10.)
    Tool. EPF developed a comprehensive subgrant database of use for all
     windows except that it did not include linkages to M&E indicators. Phase 1
     subgrants were captured in this database. In Phase 2, the database was not up-
     dated and thus was incomplete and therefore not in use at closure.
    Reporting. EPF produced its annual reports starting 2006 but it was not of a
     suitable standard. It was only in 2010 that the EPF produced the first M&E
     report based on M&E data when most of the Phase 1 subgrants were
     completed. The first comprehensive progress report to the Bank was submitted
     only after the restructuring in early 2011. The report focused on the subgrant
     implementation and not on its impact, risks, or sustainability. However,
     reporting improved and in June 2013, EPF produced a comprehensive Project
     Completion Report in June 2013.
    M&E function. M&E was meant to be the responsibility of the Project’s PICE
     coordinator. But this function was handed over to the provincial facilitators
     who supervised subgrants on the ground. EPF’s capacity to analyze the data
     collected in order to inform implementation decisions and stakeholders
     (Board, PSC, Bank) was limited due to lack of training and deficiencies in
     M&E design.

M&E Utilization: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The M&E data was used to inform
EPF’s annual report presented at annual stakeholder meetings and for dissemination
on its webpage (in English and Lao). The subgrant database model was extended to
cover all EPF windows. In the future, EPF plans to consolidate these currently
separate databases and to link them to its financial management system. However,
the information generated was not used as feedback to improve the EPF subgrant
mechanisms (application forms, monitoring report forms).

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

(a) Safeguard Compliance – Rating: Satisfactory
Environmental and Social Safeguards. The Project was correctly designated as a
Category B project and triggered four Bank safeguard policies on Environment
Assessment OP/BP 4.01; Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04, Involuntary Resettlement
(OP/BP 4.12), Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10). An Environmental and Social
Safeguard Framework (ESSF) was prepared and disclosed on June 6, 2005 covering
all four safeguard policies. No additional safeguards were triggered for Phase 2.

Compliance and process. The Bank approved a subgrant template that included
safeguard screening. As part of the subgrant approval process, EPF, initially with
assistance from the CTMA, screened subgrants for safeguard compliance by using the
ESSF. On a few subprojects, especially related to the CBI component on protected
area management, the EPF consulted the Bank’s safeguard specialists on the




                                       11
application of social safeguard policy related to potential restriction of resources
access. 14 The Project complied with all safeguard policies.

(b) Financial Management Compliance. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Financial management (FM) performance. The performance is evaluated according to
three criteria.
     Staffing. The Project depended largely on external FM consultants. It funded
        one WMU financial officer and one accountant who worked full time on
        financial management under supervision of the EPF financial manager. The
        financial team experienced a high workload particularly during Phase 1
        processing more than 150 small subgrants. FM capacity and performance were
        impacted by high staff turnover throughout implementation. In 2012 the FM
        position was vacant.
     System. EPF developed a computerized FM system to monitor financial flows
        and assist in overall budget management. The system became operational in
        mid-2010 and is currently in use. Issues included late advance clearing for
        subgrants and weak recording of vehicle usage.
     Compliance. Submission of the IFRs (Interim Financial Reports) became
        regular and timely only in Phase 2. The IFRS did not include a narrative on
        the Project progress and variance analysis until the last year of Phase 2. The
        monthly reconciliation was not done regularly and fixed assets register not up-
        dated. Audits were conducted and submitted on schedule and received
        unqualified results.

(c) Procurement Compliance. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Procurement performance. The appraisal assessment correctly rated EPF’s
procurement capacity as “high risk”. This was based on the lack of procurement
proficient staff in the country and the complex nature of demand-driven, small-size
subgrants, which involved a wide range of beneficiaries including local communities.
This risk was confirmed as the EPF struggled especially during Phase 1. The
moderately satisfactory performance rating is based on an assessment of:
     Staffing. The Project experienced high staff turnover involving three different
        procurement specialists requiring multiple repeater training sessions;
     Modalities. During Phase 1, the procurement specialist experienced a
        significant workload, processing more than 150 subgrants. During Phase 2,
        procurement functions were re-delegated to EPF to compensate for low
        capacity at sub-grantee level, to reduce procurement risks and to accelerate
        completion, which was an effective mitigation measure;
     Tools. The use of the subgrant manual could not be assessed but appeared to
        be limited. The manual and forms were not reviewed or updated; and
     Compliance. The Bank rated procurement performance moderately
        satisfactory based on a post audit of subgrants especially early in
        implementation. There was no evidence of deviation from Bank procurement
        policy.

14
   The client’s completion report (annex D, p. 71) indicates that the Houy Ngoua District Protected Area was
upgraded to Provincial Protected Area (PPA) in 2011. Then, 45 households residing illegally in the PPA were
relocated by the GOL into a village adjacent to the PPA. This resettlement was completed before the submission of
a CBI B1 subgrant for this PPA by PONRE BLKY. The subgrant supported additional consultations between the
displaced and host communities to help them define their respective roles in the management of the PPA and the
use of its resources.



                                                      12
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The maintenance and use of institutional and capacity-building achievements under
the PICE and CBI windows are jeopardized by inadequate staffing, budget provisions,
and inappropriate technical staff capacity at all levels of government. Ultimately, the
post-completion results will depend heavily on the prioritization of the environment
by national and sub-national governments. With pressure to achieve MDG
(Millennium Development Goal) targets by 2015 and to become a Middle-Income
Country by 2020, there is a high risk that post-operations will not receive appropriate
budgets, staffing and training investments without strong donor or private sector
support. However, there are two major results of Phase 2 subgrants on the ground that
demonstrated considerable progress in reaching sustainability and scaling up:

(a) Community Conservation Network (CCN), funded under CBI 2. Harmonized with
Government policy and with high quality provincial and district support in
Bolikhamxay Province, the CCN is sustainably managed without external support. Its
finances have been managed effectively at the District level and some positive
environmental impacts have been achieved. Village, District, and Provincial
authorities are highly motivated to manage and expand the revolving village
development funds (see annex 2).

(b) Nam Theun - Nam Kading River Basin Committee (NT-NKD RBC), funded under
PICE A2. Although uncertainty exists concerning future Lao policy with integrated
water resource management, the NT-NKD RBC is harmonized with GoL’s ambition
and currently receives MONRE financing for basic recurrent budget. With the recent
approval of the NT-NKD RBC Strategic Plan 2015-2020, much work remains in
attracting donor funds for implementation. However, positive dialogues have
reportedly already taken place with potential donors and the private sector, allowing
for optimism for sustainable post-operations (see annex 2).

EPF established as permanent operating body. The revised Environmental Protection
Law (December 2012) clearly defines the need for EPF operation, sources of EPF
funding, and scope of the EPF. An EPF Board meeting in March 2013 concluded that
EPF would remain an autonomous entity, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister. EPF
structure, staffing, and procedures/ and guidelines are being modified to improve its
effectiveness and efficiency. At closure, most of the remaining WMU staff had been
incorporated into EPF secretariat. EPF continues to utilize its ADB endowment to
finance most staff costs and its revenues from hydro and mining investors. EPF
continues to provide subgrants to beneficiaries.

Next phase/Follow-up project. To sustain the benefits of the Project’s investments, a
follow-up World Bank financed operation, LENS 2, is under preparation (appraisal
expected in 2014). The follow-up operation will provide the opportunity to continue
the dialogue with a wide variety of environmental and social stakeholders, scale up
operations to include new stakeholders within both the three original provinces and
potentially seven additional provinces (depending on quality of implementation) by
using three out of the five EPF windows (adding EPF’s window for water resource
management). The proposed follow-up project would build on the experiences of
LENS and include the lessons learned outlined in this ICR promoting planned


                                          13
subgrants and further strengthen EPF’s capacity administering increased volume of
subgrants and ensuring its sustainability.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Overall Rating Relevance: High
The PDO to assist the Government of Lao PDR (GOL) to strengthen the management
of environmental and social issues associated with the sustainable use of natural
resources in Lao PDR remains highly relevant today and is also in line with the
current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) in Lao PDR (2012-2016) which deepens
Bank involvement in natural resources management (NRM), especially for
hydropower and mining. A Bank study conducted on natural resources and
environmental management 15 confirmed the increasing trend for hydropower and
mining development mainly in areas where poverty as well as biodiversity values are
high.16 More, there are concerns on the limited knowledge, institutional capacity in
the country to address the environment and social safeguard issues including the need
to facilitate appropriate benefit-sharing and budget allocation among agencies. This
conclusion suggested that the Project objectives reflect proper diagnosis and
consistent with the country’s current development priorities given a large number of
hydropower development, limited human and financial resources in the country.

Relevance of design and implementation. Supporting the EPF (which essentially is a
sustainable funding mechanism) is considered highly relevant. This choice is relevant
in view of the limited GOL budget in comparison with the importance of the sector
and the need to secure funding to address the threat for biodiversity conservation,
environmental management, and capacity building for the sector. Further, this high
relevance is demonstrated by additional activities funded by the Bank in the sector.17
EPF managed to complete subgrants satisfactorily particularly at provincial level
which is considered a major achievement. In a low capacity environment where the
needs are so many, a subgrant mechanism, even if not demand-driven, spreads the
risks and matches better the capacity of EPF and sub-grantees.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The Project is evaluated against its original and revised PDO by measuring Project
achievements at the time of restructuring (Phase 1 to January 2010) and Project
closing (Phase 2 to June 2013) respectively (see annex 2 for outputs produced). Then
theses ratings are weighted to account for the proportion of financing leading to each
(see data sheet section H) as follows:

         Original PDO achievement: Moderately Unsatisfactory (US$3.19m disbursed or 41%)
         Revised PDO achievement: Satisfactory (US$4.67m disbursed or 59% of total)

   By 2020, about 43 large (> 50MW) hydropower projects will be in operation. At present, 8 are under operation;
7 (all IPP) are under construction; 28 (all IPP) are designed. A number of small, medium mining project (mostly
potash and gravel) and large mines (mostly gold and copper) are planned. Potential impacts include resettlement,
land acquisition, loss of watershed and biodiversity, and effects on water quantity and quality.

       Overall Rating:          Moderately Satisfactory (US$7.86m)


The Project is not evaluated against the indicators in the Financial Agreement as they
are not fully synchronized with those from the PAD and were not monitored.

PDO, Phase 1: to assist the Recipient to strengthen the management of environment
and social issues associated with the sustainable use of natural resources in Lao PDR
for enhancing quality of growth and reducing poverty.

It was designed in the early 2000’s when PDOs tended to be descriptive . The PDO
portion “…for enhancing quality of growth and reducing poverty” was meant as an
adjective clause to describe the rationale for strengthening management capacity. In
fact the Project had no specific growth or poverty interventions (and no KPI to
measure poverty or growth outcomes). In Phase 2, this part of the PDO was rightly
removed.

Nonetheless, in both phases, a set of intermediary outcome indicators (IOI)
reasonably well selected to measure the PDO, was available and monitored. From a
direct analysis of the indicators, Phase 1 appears Moderately Unsatisfactory (of two
KPIs neither were measured; of eight IOIs, six were achieved, one partially achieved
and one was not measured) and Phase 2 appears Satisfactory (of the two KPIs, both
were achieved; of 13 IOIs, 11 were achieved and two partially achieved.) Additional
factors validate these ratings as demonstrated by the positive end results of each
component. For a more comprehensive treatment of the Project outputs see Annex 2.

This first analysis of the rating is weighed by a review of outcomes, not measured by
indicators, but reported and aligned with the PDO.

Component 1: Policy and Institution Capacity Enhancement. This component
strengthened central, provincial, and district governmental agencies’ capacity at
differing degrees for assessment, monitoring, and compliance for environmental and
social sustainability especially in Phase 2.

At central level:
     Environmental Protection Law and Decree no. 122/PM on EIA (effective in
       March 2010) and several technical guidelines for mitigating the potential
       negative impacts of development projects including hydropower, mining, and
       agriculture on local environment and local people were promulgated. A
       national guideline for Ethnic Groups’ consultation was completed in
       December 2012 and relevant agencies’ staff were trained on how to conduct
       such consultation and to understand and use these new technical and legal
       instruments. As a result, the Project contributed to increase environmental and
       social compliance in new hydropower and mining projects. In addition, the
       revised Electricity Law (approved in early 2012) improved clarity on
       sustainable development of investment projects and included a provision for
       the project developers to share project benefits with local authority and
       communities as well as to make contribution to EPF.
     The support for the implementation of the national policy on environmental
       and social sustainability of the hydropower (NPSH) has been critical given the
       rapid development of large hydropower projects (more than 50 MW) by the

                                          15
       private sector. The Project resulted in an improved public knowledge on the
       policy and commitment of the MEM’s agencies to take the lead in facilitation
       effective implementation of the NPSH.
      A compliance-monitoring unit was established in DESIA. DESIA conducted
       consultation meetings and training with sector agencies and provinces
       including engagement through study visits of high-level decisions makers
       (National Assembly). A Standard Environmental and Social Obligations
       (SESO) is now annexed to the concession agreement of large development
       projects. Such SESOs, while constantly improving, are considered acceptable
       compared to international standards 18 . While, SESO is an improvement,
       monitoring of Environment Compliance Certificates (ECC) remains a
       challenge given DESIA’s limited number of experienced staff and funding
       constraints.19
      The Project assisted NUOL to develop needed training capacity and a
       curriculum on social impact assessment and helped establishing a partnership
       with a research center on social impact assessment in China. These results are
       considered highly relevant for facilitating the implementation of the Decree
       no. 192/2005 on Compensation and Resettlement of Development Projects.

At provincial level:
    Environmental provincial and district institutional and staff capacity in
       planning, management and monitoring were strengthened through training and
       operational support.
    A Social Impact Management Unit (SIMU) was established under the
       Provincial Office of Natural Resources and Environment (PONRE) in
       Bolikhamxay and Khammouane provinces. A database to monitor
       environmental and social compliance of development projects was established,
       as was a grievance compliance mechanism in Bolikhamxay and Khammouane
       provinces with 98% of cases resolved.
    NT-NKD RBC and its secretariat were established by Decree no. 293 in June
       2010 and are functioning in Bolikhamxay province. MONRE provides limited
       funds to the RBC Secretariat including staffing.
    PONRE’s capacity to develop, up-date, and implement PESAP in the three
       targeted provinces was strengthened.

Component 2-: Biodiversity and Livelihoods Enhancement: Selected protected areas
and local communities benefited from improved environmental management and
enhanced livelihood options. This intermediary outcome was achieved by increased
efficiency in protected area management; lower environmental violation, increased
empowerment of local communities in NRM and improved livelihoods of local
communities and reduced poverty:


18
   Assessment of the ECC quality at the time of the AF design, suggested that given current weaknesses of the
ECC system and rapid development of hydropower projects in the country measuring the quality of the ECC based
on inclusion of SESO into the CA appeared to be the most effective way to improve implementation of the ECC
system.
19
   A NUOL 2012 assessment on performance of the EIA process in Lao PDR identified major gaps between the
EIA policy/regulations requirements and practices. Coordination and cooperation among agencies, provinces,
project developers, and consultants are weak causing poor quality of the measures, delay in approval, and
ineffective compliance. Lack of clear procedures has further weakened the system.



                                                    16
      169,000 hectares of area brought under enhanced biodiversity conservation
       (six Provincial Protected Area (PPA)); six management plans for the PPAs
       and 20% of priority activities implemented including demarcation of
       boundaries and basic community-based law enforcement initiated.
      12 communities established a new model in Lao PDR - the CCN in the Nam
       Theun-Nam Kading basin combining measures for improved livelihoods and
       community-engagement in the conservation of natural resources. The model
       has delivered satisfactory results related to strong community engagement and
       ownership, enhanced capacity of provincial staff and local communities and
       conservation efforts and is therefore being replicated and scaled-up in similar
       community-based natural resource management interventions in the country.
      115 subgrants were completed (US$2.2 million) benefitting more than 200
       communities in the areas of natural resource management, biodiversity
       conservation, and livelihoods development.

Component 3: Management and Monitoring Support: After implementation of this
Project, EPF emerged as a more competent institution:
    Institutional and technical capacity: Modest improvement such as (a) the five
        windows are functional, (b) a computerized accounting system is operational,
        (c) EPF is capable in channeling funds to the provincial level, (d) EPF staff
        have been trained in procurement and financial management, (e) some
        management tools were developed and improved (e.g. Subgrant Manual,
        Subgrant Database, annual reports; etc.).
    Financial capacity: (a) NT2 revenues accrue to MONRE, but not to EPF20, (b)
        no contribution from GOL or other donor accrue to EPF, (c) an endowment
        generates about $350,000 per year, (d) since 2008, EPF receives about
        $100,000-$300,000 per year from small mining developers, (e) at present
        (2013), and for the next 25 years, EPF receives $200,000 per year from the
        Theun Hinboun extension hydropower project

The review of qualitative outcomes for each component, showing a long list of
achievements although many of these achievements are considered “in-progress” and
may not yet be sustainable. This confirms the indicator-based initial rating which is
that Phase 1 is rated Moderately Satisfactory and Phase 2 is rated Satisfactory. The
weighted average is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

Overall Rating Efficiency: Moderately Satisfactory
Project costs in comparison to outputs appear reasonable. At appraisal, an economic
and financial analysis was not undertaken due to difficulties in quantifying up-front
efficiency of demand-driven projects that focus on capacity and institution building,
so an end-of-Project economic/financial analysis was not feasible. However, the key
elements impacting the Project’s efficiency included:

Implementation delays including delayed effectiveness of 10 months occurred mainly
in Phase 1 and resulted in efficiency losses.

20
  While the GLIP referred to EPF as beneficiary for NT2 revenues, the final revenue sharing agreement did not
include EPF. MONRE negotiated access to NT2 revenues but EPF failed.



                                                    17
High staff turnover at EPF/WMU but also within beneficiaries decreased efficiency as
new staff needed to be recruited and trained requiring often a steep learning curve.
This was mitigated by the revised implementation arrangements under Phase 2.

Operating costs. Initially the input costs 21 (including administrative costs and
technical assistance) for subgrant development, monitoring, and supervision were
higher than anticipated. This is not unusual as such type of subgrants, particularly for
community development operations, often have high administrative costs in the first
years as the portfolio is building up. The annual input costs per volume of transaction
decreased over time due, particularly after the revisions introduced for Phase 2 (less
transactions with larger volume, centralized procurement, more Bank TA support).

Benchmarking. In order to broaden the efficiency analysis a few of the subgrants
cost/outcome ratio were compared with similar projects elsewhere. This analysis must
be taken with caution, as the accuracy of this analysis is not more than an order of
magnitude.
 Efficiency of NUOL Subgrant. Under the PICE A Window, the National
    University of Laos (NUOL) Faculty of Social Sciences received an $80,000
    subgrant for developing curriculum and training materials on social issues related
    to large infrastructure projects.22 When contrasted to comparable projects within
    Lao PDR and the region, this subgrant appears to demonstrate a high-degree of
    cost-effectiveness. For example, under the WB –AusAID Hydro-Mining
    Technical Assistant Project, the NUOL Faculty of Mining Engineering is
    scheduled to receive $98,000 for one technical study, one field trip, one
    international workshop, and staff training. Under the same project, the NUOL
    Faculty of Hydropower Engineering is budgeted to receive $40,000 for the
    development of six new course curriculums. Outside of Lao PDR, in 2009, the
    Thailand International Cooperation Agency provided Phnom Penh University
    $64,633 to develop a curriculum for teaching and learning the Thai language. The
    Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC) in 2006 contributed $114,025 to Timor-
    Leste for the “technical and pedagogical capacity building for teachers of
    Technical Agriculture School, providing an update in their curriculum.”
 Community Conservation Network Subgrant. Covering 12 villages, the $525,000
    CCN subgrant supported the establishment of revolving funds and the
    organization of communities for protected area surveillance. The cost per village
    was about $43,000, which appears to be within the range of similar practices. In a
    Burkina and Cote d’Ivoire community-based wildlife management project, the
    amount per village was $43,000. In Namibia a project supported 25
    conservancies, or about 125 communities, with an average of $57,000 per
    community. The GEF project Biodiversity Conservation in Bolikhamxay province
    (closed in 2007) achieved similar results with about $31,000 per village.


21
   Input costs are described in the client completion report as “operating costs” but these include also technical
assistance, which is an investment. The EPF endowment covers its operational costs. At closure, EPF had not
calculated a “unit cost” for subgrant processing and lacked standardized monitoring of cofinancing.
22
   Outputs include: (a) Social Safeguard Syllabus used by the Bachelor and Masters programs already utilized by
some380 students; (b) 15 technical manuals developed with TA from Mahidol University and disseminated, (c) six
technical training sessions for 131 participants from Government, private sector and academia; (d) an MOU with
Hohai University in China and professional exchanges from Thai and American universities.



                                                       18
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The overall outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory which is substantiated by a
“high” rating for relevance; a moderately satisfactory rating for achievement of the
PDO, with moderately satisfactory efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty. The rural poor in Lao PDR depend primarily on the availability of natural
resources for their livelihood so degradation of the environment has an immediate
adverse impact on these communities. The community-based interventions focusing
on the conservation of natural resources including forests, biodiversity, and water
resources may help secure their livelihoods. The successful Community Conservation
Network (CCN) subgrant demonstrates increased community knowledge and
participation in natural resources protection.

There is data to substantiate this from only one subgrant. Still, the Project CBI
window appears to have contributed to poverty reduction. CBI subgrants covered a
wide range of community issues including education, health, tourism, agriculture,
conservation of natural resources, and fish farming. For one of the larger CBI
subgrants, the CCN, livelihoods improved significantly: 263 households (41.74%)
were better off in 2012 than 2009 based on an assessment that used national standards
related to housing standards, rice sufficiency, and income level.

Gender. The Project design did not explicitly focus on gender, so the impact of
subgrants on women in terms of their participation and benefits, across all 173
subgrants could not be assessed. However, the subgrant application forms did include
gender analysis, e.g., percentage of female staff, focus on women’s participation in
training activities, use of a gender sensitive approach to consultation, etc.

Ethnic minorities. The Project supported the participatory development and
implementation of consultative guidelines of ethnic groups23 through the Lao National
Front for Construction (LNFC) 24 . This is considered an important achievement
particularly as these guidelines were integrated into the General Guideline on Public

Involvement as part of the EIA requirements. This set of social safeguard policies
provides key principles and a process through which project affected people could be
consulted and encouraged to participate in the Project. The subgrant established a
social safeguard committee in each of the 18 target villages (about 6,600 people) to
implement the guidelines in partnership with other government agencies and provided
training to the target groups.

Social development. The Project significantly strengthened social safeguard
compliance in Lao PDR. The results included effective implementation of the CAR

23
   Laos has 49 ethnic groups categorized into 4 main families: Lao Tai, Mone-Khmer, Hmong-Mien, and Chinese-
Tibetan. The latter three are considered vulnerable since their livelihood is mainly based on subsistence. These
ethnic minorities are often the victims of investments projects, which in many cases, led to land acquisition,
involuntary resettlement, and limited access to the natural resources.
24
   LNFC received an IDF grant to train its staff on ethnic group facilitation, participatory consultation, and conflict
resolution.



                                                         19
decree; development of an EIA decree (2010), establishment of DESIA, a national
department in charge of environmental and social compliance; development of a
curriculum at NUOL on social safeguards and training of more than 500
governmental officials, private investors and students; establishment of standards for
social and environmental obligation (SESO) for investment projects; development of
pilot grievance mechanism in two provinces (Bolikhamxay, Khammouane); and
development of ethnic consultation guidelines including training. The Project further
supported study tours to Thailand, China, and Vietnam to strengthen knowledge and
raise awareness at a high political level on resettlement issues. As a result, a MOU
between NUOL and the Chinese Institute for Technical Cooperation is expected to
enhance inter-regional cooperation and knowledge transfer.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The Project achieved institutional results as summarized below:
 EPF’s operational skills and capacity to manage subgrants, including from
    provinces, and coordinate with sector agencies improved, although less than
    expected. Its institutional performance and proactivity in terms of lobbying,
    fundraising, and internal development remained modest.
 In the three targeted provinces, the general capacity of PONRE and DONRE staff
    was strengthened as documented by its improved planning process.
    Environmental personnel increased in quantity and quality compared to the
    baseline. Yet, lack of adequate staffing, qualifications, and budget hampers
    effective implementation. A provincial SIMU was established in the targeted
    provinces for social safeguard compliance.
 The first RBC (NT-NKD) and its secretariat were established.

Institutional change as a long-term effort needs to be planned with adequate funding
and an adaptive strategy. Thus, beneficiary institutions supported under the Project
need continued support to grow stronger and faster in the future.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A Project steering committee and EPF annual stakeholder workshop was conducted
on June 14, 2013 (114 participants including central and provincial/district level)
reviewing and endorsing the results of the draft PCR (see annex 6).


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Overall risk: Significant. This is based on the assessment of two important sets of
risks: (a) environment and social sector risks; and (b) institutional risks.

Sectoral risk rating: Significant
Some risks relate to the fast increase of hydropower and mining projects. On one
hand, thanks to the project, environment legislation, regulations, and guidelines are
progressively more efficient as demonstrated by SESO now that they are attached to
most Concession Agreements. Also, the successful testing of grievance mechanisms,
ethic group consultation guidelines and the introduction of an involuntary
resettlement curriculum at the University of Laos all show that social issues can

                                         20
increasingly be addressed in investment projects. However, the pace of capacity
development of the national and provincial institutions that ensure compliance
monitoring is insufficient to keep up with the pace of transport, plantations,
hydropower, and mining development. Furthermore, Laos lacks a strategic planning
framework to assess cumulative impacts on the environment and people, or to offset
immitigable residual social or environmental impacts.

Institutional risk rating: Significant.
     EPF is financially sustainable with about $500,000 in secured annual revenues
         but it has not yet reached a critical mass of staff, capacity and financing to
         scale up and become relevant at the national level25 –Moderate.
     DESIA has insufficient human and financial resources and capacity for critical
         enforcement and monitoring26 – Significant.
     PONREs and DONREs have critically insufficient human and financial
         resources and technical capacity to deliver on their mandate27 – High.
     NT-NDK RBC lacks a sufficient budget to implement its strategic plan, and
         much work remains to be done to attract donor funding – Significant.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Quality at entry is already discussed at length in Section 2.1. The Bank’s strengths in
ensuring quality at entry were the following: (a) the project design was consistent
with Lao PDR’s national development strategies and with the Bank’s CAS in vogue at
the time; (b) the project was identified in March 2004, appraised in late May 2005 and
was approved on June 30, 2005, for a total preparation time of only 15 months and for
a budget of about US$114,000, and preparation met the standards of 2005; (c) the
project design was innovative and was based on solid sectoral knowledge gained over
10 years of working on the NT2 Project; (d) the Bank’s team was led by a senior
social scientist and comprised a team including three other social scientists, an
environmental economist, an environmental specialist, a biodiversity specialist, an
institutional specialist and fiduciary experts. The team enjoyed excellent working
relationships with GOL representatives at central and provincial level to ensure
smooth preparation. The team ensured that the EPF’s operational instruments were of
good quality prior to effectiveness.

However, these strengths are balanced by weaknesses. First, the Bank’s assessment
of institutional capacity of the EPF and other stakeholders (potential sub-grantees)
was overly optimistic. As a consequence the project had limited mitigation measures
and provided limited institutional development support to the EPS, both in terms of
quality and modality of TA support, and offered little operational budget support.
Second, the risk assessment of “moderate” was overly optimistic and overlooked a
25
   EPF revenues: annually an endowment provides $350,000 and hydropower/mining contribute about $300,000.

number of risks that arose during implementation, as already reported in Section 2.1
above. Finally, as reported in Section 2.3, the project had a PDO that stretched too
broadly into poverty reduction, but had no indicators linked to poverty monitoring.
The KPIs lacked clear definition and the Results Framework in general had no
baseline, intermediate or end-of-project target outcomes by which to measure
progress. The indicators in the Financial Agreement did not match those in the PAD.
This poor M&E foundation was problematic throughout the project’s life and made
assessment of final outcome somewhat challenging.
(b)    Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Strengths of implementation support.
     During Phase 1, the TTL, who was an internationally recruited staff based in
       Bangkok shared project leadership responsibilities with a national level staff
       based in Vientiane. In Phase 2, the Vientiane-based TTL and his team
       maintained a continual dialog with the EPF and provided just-on-time
       technical inputs. This arrangement also increased the efficiency of budget
       utilization. The average number of staff weeks decreased from 27 to 22 and
       the average budget utilization decreased from $58,000 per year to $36,000 per
       year, which are extremely low supervision coefficients.
     In both phases, supervision teams were relatively stable, with a key national
       staff on the team for the entire duration of implementation. The team also
       included fiduciary experts and social and environmental safeguard specialists.
       A total of 11 formal review missions, an average of 1.2 per year, were
       organized as well as a number of informal field visits;
     In Phase 2, after realizing that the EPF needed further strengthening to carry
       out its mandate, the Bank provided solid advisory services to the EPF to
       compensate for its lack of technical capacity. The quality of this support was
       recognized by stakeholders as one of the key factors contributing to the
       achievements of Phase 2.
     In both Phases, the mission aide-memoires correctly highlighted concerns and
       priorities although the M&E was never sufficiently a concern to be fully
       addressed by either the team or management.
     Issues for management attention in the ISRs were usually addressed during
       supervision missions although not always adequately documented in
       subsequent ISRs.
     The ISR ratings were done with candor.

Weaker aspects
   Despite an opportunity at MTR, the team waited until the end of Phase 1 to
      review the project design and restructure it. One argument was that it would
      be more efficient to address needed changes at the additional financing stage.
   Even though the Project was meant to complement NT2 project and help
      anchor hydro-power in a positive environment framework, there was no effort
      to maintain that complementarity as part of supervision. A consequence may
      be that NT2 revenues are not accruing to EPF; another consequence may be
      that the Project approach for community support in the Nakai Nam Theun
      NPA border zone villages was different than the NT2-supported approach in
      the same NPA.


                                         22
      The team missed two opportunities (at the original MTR and restructuring) to
       (i) address the Project’s M&E deficiencies indicated as a matter of concern at
       several occasions by Bank management; and (ii) address EPF’s strategic
       capacity building instead of limiting support to strengthening capacity for
       implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance Rating:
Both quality at entry and the quality of supervision are rated moderately satisfactory.
Therefore, the overall Bank performance rating is Moderately Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance - Rating: Satisfactory
This rating is based on:
     Counterpart funding: Although GOL counterpart funding was not required, an
        in-kind contribution, particularly to the PICE window, was made representing
        about 20% of the subgrant amount. It included staff time for technical and
        management inputs, office space and utilities, as well as the active
        involvement of high level decision-makers at ministerial, departmental, and
        provincial levels.
     Legal and institutional reforms: The GOL supported and delivered effectively
        a number of key environmental and social compliance regulations and
        institutional reforms during implementation (see Annex 2 component 2).
     Commitment and involvement: GOL provided strong support from high level
        decision-makers at the ministerial and department levels especially during the
        original LENS implementation period, and during the design of the additional
        financing when key policy decisions regarding the responsible agencies and
        priority for capacity building had to be made. The participation of members of
        the National Assembly in a study tour to China helped to increase political
        support for environmental and social safeguard compliance.
     Legal covenants: GOL ensured compliance with the legal agreements (legal
        covenants, 9 out of the 10 tracked in the ISRs were met28, although delayed)
        and addressed concerns in a timely manner when issues were raised.
     Increased staffing for sector: GOL absorbed 56% of the Project-funded junior
        consultants based in MONRE (41 out of 74) in October 2012 thereby ensuring
        sustainability of reforms introduced and capacity gained.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance - Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
EPF/WMU implemented Phase 1 without prior experience on subgrant management
and Bank procedures. Consequently, significant time (2007 to 2009) and efforts were
required to address the issues related to the roles and responsibility of STEA and EPF,
recruitment of WMU staffing, and approval of procedures and the operational manual.
During implementation, EPF’s performance improved more slowly than expected due
to the following issues:
     Delivery design: WMU set-up appeared to be inadequate to fulfill TA and
        fiduciary roles for implementation which were underestimated at design state29
28
   Covenant: “Action plans to bring each hydropower facility constructed since 1990 into full compliance are
prepared and disclosed by each owning company” was partially met.
29
   EPF facilitated approval of subgrants and monitored their implementation including training on procurement and
financial management. At the provincial and local level, EPF provided technical, financial, and procurement
supports to sub-grantees.



                                                      23
        Staffing: EPF experienced significant recruitment difficulties and delays
         following a high staff turn-over reducing efficacy and efficiency
        M&E: Project design did not focus on establishing an EPF based M&E system
         and despite improvements made (subgrant database, annual reports) a
         dedicated system was still not in place at closing.
        FM/procurement: Moderate financial and procurement performance due to
         lack of experience with Bank procedures and staff capacity.

Despite these challenges, EPF:
    Exceeded the target of satisfactory completion of subgrants (154 subgrants in
       Phase 1 and 19 subgrants in Phase 2)30;
    Kept operating costs under control and reduced administrative costs in Phase
       2;
    Fully disbursed the two LENS grants;
    Managed successfully its endowment and mobilized annual contributions in
       hydro and mining exceeding US$300,000.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
The overall Borrower performance including borrower and implementing agency
performance assessment considering the particularly strong ownership and
commitment to the PDO, satisfactory enabling environment, regular stakeholder
consultations, and solid relationship with the Bank is Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

The most significant lessons learned of the Project are as follows.

Lessons from similar experiences confirm that a subgrant mechanism is a suitable
business model. EPF and LENS confirmed that subproject mechanisms are a valid
business model, not just for social or community-driven development operations, but
also to support public administrations, remote project sites and a variety of sectors.
Such mechanism has the flexibility to respond to client needs in a low capacity
environment as it evolves. It can be adapted to local realities during implementation
(a) as lessons are learned (in this case changing the selection process and subgrant
size), or (b) as policy, legal or institutional circumstances change (in this case creation
of MONRE, adoption of the Sam Sang Directive).

The EPF provided a proven mechanism to support decentralization by delivering
financial resources to provincial and district administrations. EPF demonstrated it
could channel much needed financing and technical resources in a cost-effective
manner to lower levels of government. Currently donor financing and technical
support are concentrated at the central level, whereas the national government is
currently devolving administrative responsibilities to provincial and district
governments under the Sam Sang Directive. EPF provides future potential to assist in
realizing the Government’s ambitions.

An effective balance between subgrant size and GOL policy harmonization is
necessary. The EPF was successful in identifying the optimal model for financing the

30
     EPF received a total of 251 subgrant applications (167 for CBI and 83 for PICE) of which some were ineligible.



                                                         24
Lao environment and social sectors in a low capacity environment. During Phase 1,
the EPF tested small grants that were demand-driven. Even though more than 100
were administered, their high transaction costs and scattered impacts made them
suboptimal. A reduced number of medium size subgrants - ranging from $100,000 to
$500,000 - introduced in Phase 2 was better adapted to the capacity of beneficiaries
and EPF, and concentrated impacts by focusing financing around GoL policy
priorities.

Future lending should focus on EPF capacity development. As a nascent institution,
EPF capacity development needs to be prioritized. The EPF lacked visibility and
regular communication with higher-level GoL staff, potential foreign donors, and the
media, partly resulting in its inability to legally secure a sustainable source of
financing from GOL revenues. Furthermore, EPF relied unsustainably on World Bank
technical support. For the EPF to mature as an institution, it requires enhanced
emphasis on technical capacity development, strategic communication planning, and
improved fund-raising ability.

Important targets need to be linked to a clear legal framework. A critical project
target -- that EPF should receive a portion of NT2 revenues -- was not set out in
unequivocal terms, but was just an intermediary outcome without a targeted amount
which carried no weight or leverage31. The country’s commitment was captured in the
Government Letter of Implementation Policy but was not included as a legal covenant
in the Financial Agreement. In addition, there was no project activity or incentive for
the EPF secretariat to actively pursue this target. The consequence was that, at Project
closing, NT2 revenues were not accruing to EPF and past NT2, or LENS,
supervisions have not been able to reverse the situation.

The presence of voluntary private sector responsibility in Lao PDR can provide
substantial financial support. EPF showed that private hydroelectric and mining
investors were willing to voluntarily contribute financing for public environmental
management. In FY12, despite limited EPF outreach and communication, 36 mining
operations ($267,000 total) and the Theun-Hinboun Hydroelectric Power Company
($200,000 annually) contributed to the EPF. With natural capital extraction increasing
exponentially, there is future potential for EPF to engage the private sector for
substantially more support.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
A summary of the detailed and well-prepared borrower’s completion report led by
EPF appears in Annex 7.

EPF and the main stakeholders have reviewed and endorsed the final draft of this ICR
without any further inputs. The borrower’s letter received from the Minister of
Natural Resources and Environment (November 22, 2013), states that (i) the Ministry
(MONRE) is satisfied with the outcome of the Project; (ii) throughout Project
implementation it had been seen outstandingly a lot of achievements that MONRE
31
  The Letter of Sectors Policy of the NT2 project mentions the LENS project and the fact that NT2 revenues
should contribute to EPF but does not state percentages nor targets.



                                                   25
acquired and that were part of its targets and work plans; (iii) the ICR is deemed well
prepared and reflected the facts of the Project; and (iv) that MONRE highly
appreciates the assistance from the World Bank, especially on the LENS Project
which has just completed successfully and that MONRE looks forward to further
assistance and cooperation in the future.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The Project design, based on three interlinked components (PICE, CBI, MMS),
supported EPF’s mandate and GOL priorities. The outputs achieved contributed
clearly to the Project’s intermediate outcomes and to achieving the PDO of improving
the management of environmental and social issues associated with the sustainable
use of natural resources in Lao PDR. Further, key outputs were linked to the Project’s
legal covenants that were essentially achieved. (See Annex 12 for a discussion of
compliance with legal covenants).

2.1. Key consolidated results
As presented in section 3.2, the Project achieved most of its intermediary outcomes as
presented below:
Operationalizing EPF as the environmental financial mechanism responsible for
implementing the national environmental policy of Lao PDR. The Project was
instrumental in building EPF’s human, financial technical and institutional capacity
(IO 3).

Piloting EPF’s subgrant mechanism. The Project launched EPF’s subgrant
mechanism through two of the five funding windows (PICE and CBI). It responded
adequately to funding needs for sustainable use of natural resources from central,
provincial and district governmental institutions, and civil society organizations
including local communities (IO 3).

Improving environmental and social compliance for development projects. The
Project contributed significantly to improve the policy, legal and institutional
framework for environmental and social compliance particularly for hydropower and
mining investments (IO 1).

Strengthening capacity for environmental and social management. The Project
produced considerable capacity for environmental and social management issues at
central, provincial, and local level (see 2.2 for more details) (IO 2).

Specifically, the Project supported EPF in managing 173 subgrants using its three
components. These subgrants achieved mostly satisfactory results and contributed
directly to:
     Improve institutional, legal and policy framework for environmental and
        social management and compliance monitoring;
     Strengthen governmental staff capacity (numbers, quality) at central,
        provincial and district level;
     Strengthen education services and environmental awareness-raising;
     Enhance participation from non-governmental stakeholders in local
        environmental management including enforcement;
     Establish environmental and social grievance mechanisms to solve local
        environmental and social conflicts;
     Address natural resource degradation through enhanced protection and
        improved management in some protected areas and local communities;
     Increase revenues in some communities due to establishment of sustainable
        use and livelihood models; and
     Increase funding from private sector to EPF.

                                         28
Figure 1 below shows that the majority of the consolidated subgrants (63% of 173)
aimed at supporting sustainable management of natural resources followed by
community development measures and awareness raising:

Note: Intervention area is defined here as a cluster of related subgrant activities. Most subgrants
included multiple intervention areas.
NRM includes: PPA and Forest Management (31%); Biodiversity conservation (20%); Water
Management (11%) and RBC (1%).
Community development includes: Community development (23%); Community fund (12%);
Ecotourism (12%).
Policy and legal framework includes: Data base (9%); Policy (6%); Environment Strategy (6%);
Compliance (5%)

2.2 Capacity Building – a Key Element of Project Interventions

The Project supported capacity building at both the individual and institutional levels
across all three components. Beneficiaries included governmental staff, non-
governmental organizations, and local community members. However, the Project’s
M&E system and EPF’s subgrant forms did not include dedicated indicators to track
capacity building results. The EPF completion report collected some data related to
training topics and number of people (see table 2 below) but the actual number of
people trained is likely much higher than the 4,316 reported.

Importantly, the Project’s initial subgrants helped to compile information related to
training needs for environmental and social management at national and provincial
level. Subsequently, this information was used to identify priority capacity building
subgrants under the additional financing. At closure, stakeholders in the sector
acknowledge the Project’s key role in assessing current sector training needs and
defining a more strategic and programmatic approach for future environmental and
social safeguard capacity-building implementation.

    Beneficiaries: Central GOL (1); Bolikhamxay (5); Khammouane (8);
       Savannakhet (4); Others (3).

Outputs:
The outputs increased effectiveness of safeguard policy implementation, monitoring
and evaluation:
    Enhanced provincial capacity. In three provinces, PONRE and DONRE staff
       capacity was built on improved environmental and social planning and
       management. As a result, provincial staff and budget in target provinces
       increased significantly if compared with the situation prior to the Project. The
       Project supported the provinces with computers and office equipment.
    Provincial effectiveness.
        All three provinces developed and up-dated a provincial environmental
           strategy and action plan (PESAP) including legal measures.
        Further, a database for tracking development projects and their
           environmental and social compliance in the three provinces was developed
           and is operational (pilot for Lao PDR).
        A SIMU was established in Bolikhamxay and Khammouane providing
           technical assistance and capacity building to the committees at districts
           level. Activities included study visits to Vietnam, China, and Thailand on
           resettlement and grievance mechanisms, and training/workshops at local
           level (pilot for Lao PDR).
        A grievance mechanism was established and operationalized in
           Bolikhamxay and Khammouane provinces (pilot for Lao PDR). Positive
           results achieved (98% of complaints resolved).

Related indicators:
    IOI 4 - Number of environmental plans being effectively implemented by
       provincial governments – Partially met
    AF IOI 1 - Percentage of complaints resolved in Bolikhamxay and
       Khammouane - Achieved.

       which ECCs are issues in selected provinces established - Achieved
    AF IOI 3 - Provinces where units responsible for monitoring social impacts
       and a functional complaint handling mechanism are established. – Achieved


(A2) Integrated River Basin Management

                                          33
Objective: to support the Water Resource Committee of the STEA and MIH to
develop an integrated approach to the management of cumulative impacts in NT-
NKD River Basin.

A2 Portfolio overview:
    3 subgrants (2/Phase 1; 1/Phase 2); total budget spent US$ 736,000; average
      size/subgrant: US$ 245,300; largest subgrant: US$ 340,000; smallest subgrant:
      US$ 110,000.
    Rating EPF per number of subgrants: 1 HS; 2 S
    Beneficiaries: Central and provincial GOL combined

Outputs:
The outputs supported the establishment of the IWRM framework Nam Kading River
Basin favoring community participation and transparency of river basin management:
    An institutional framework for IWRM in NT-NKD river basin leading to
       establishment of the first Lao River Basin Committee for the NT-NKD basin
       (PM decree #293 issued in 2010) was developed.
    A NT-NKD RBC secretariat and office in Bolikhamxay province including
       working groups were established and operationalized. Project support included
       staff, equipment, a vehicle, and operational budget. Meetings of RBC started
       in October 2012. A draft 5-year RBC Strategic Plan has been prepared and
       shared with stakeholders. As part of EPF’s completion report, a special paper
       on the NT-NKD implementation model was prepared to contribute to the
       national discussion on RBC models (PCR, annex E). These achievements are
       considered critical to address potential cumulative/transboundary impacts and
       other crosscutting issues related to Natural Resources and Environment
       Management (NREM.)

Related indicators:
    IOI 2 - Framework for addressing cumulative impacts in NT-NKD - Achieved.
    AF IOI 4 - Status of RBC for NT-NKD – Achieved
    AF IOI 5 - Status of implementation model for a river basin organization in
       Lao PDR – Partially achieved

(A3) Hydropower Sector Policy Support

Objective: Support to implementation of National Policy on Environmental and Social
Sustainability of the Hydropower sector.

A3 Portfolio overview:
    2 subgrants (2/Phase 1); total budget spent US$ 386,000; average
       size/subgrant: US$ 193,000; largest subgrant: US$ 289,000; smallest subgrant:
       US$ 97,000.
    Rating EPF per number of subgrants: 1 HS, 1 non-evaluated
    Beneficiaries: Central GOL

Outputs:


                                        34
      Improved public knowledge on the policy and commitment of the Ministry of
       Energy and Mines (MEM) agencies to take the lead in facilitating effective
       implementation of the policy through:
      NPSH implementation strategy developed
      Sector action plan to facilitate effective coordination amongst agencies
      Training for DOE/MEM and PDEM staff on monitoring of hydropower
       projects
      Operational support to DOE/MEM and DESIA/WREA for carrying out
       monitoring of hydropower projects (including 1 vehicle, computer office
       equipment)
      Two national high-level workshops on NPSH (2009, 2011)
      Study tour in Thailand (energy related agencies)
      Two NPSH status reports
      Input (article 41) in revised Electricity Law (approved in 2012) to improve
       coverage on environmental and social safeguard including enhanced
       governance in the Independent Power Producer process (applied to all private
       investors in hydropower projects). The law stipulates the need for ensuring
       adequate mitigation for potential negative impacts of hydropower projects
       including obligation for project owners to share benefits with local
       communities and local authorities in the Project area and to make contribution
       to EPF as suggested in the NPSH.

Related indicators:
    IOI 1 - Number of existing hydropower projects responsive to national policy
       by preparing action plans and implementing agreed mitigation measures
       contained therein - Partially achieved.
    AF IOI 2 - Percentage of ECCs issued by WREA that are of adequate quality
       as judged by third party (as measured by percentage of SESO attached to
       CAs35) – Achieved


(A4) Social Safeguards Management

Objective: to strengthen GOL’s capacity to implement the National Policy on
Resettlement and Compensation including refinement of policies that improve
livelihood opportunities for ethnic groups and awareness raising.

A4 Portfolio overview:
    12 subgrants (9/Phase 1; 3/Phase 2); total budget spent US$ 1,405,000;
       average size/subgrant: US$ 117,100; largest subgrant: US$ 630,000; smallest
       subgrant: US$ 5,100.
    Rating EPF per number of subgrants: 2 HS, 8 S, 1 M, 1 non-evaluated
    Beneficiaries: Central GOL (11); Others (1)

Outputs:

35
  SESO integration in the CA proved to be a more rigorous approach than measuring ECC compliance by third
party, as it entails the obligation that the developers would need to adhere to and it supports the Government's own
system and capacity in tracking this.


                                                        35
The related outputs led to an increased knowledge and awareness of resettlement
management and increased involvement of local communities:
    Implementation of Compensation and Resettlement decree (CAR). Project
       supported awareness and capacity-building on social assessment and review,
       consultation and information disclosure.
    Promulgation of the EIA Decree. The Project supported the development and
       dissemination of the EIA decree (Decree #112, approved in 02/2010).
    Elevated Institutional Role for Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
       at Central Government (DESIA). Upgrading of the division of environmental
       impact assessment of the Department of Environment (DOE) of STEA to the
       Department of Environment and Social Impacts Assessment (DESIA) under
       the WREA in 2008 and then part of the Ministry of Natural Resources and
       Environment (MONRE) in 2011;
    Operationalizing DESIA.
        Facilitating initial operation of DESIA (2009-2013) including staffing,
          training, and operational support.
        Capacity building efforts included study visits to China to resettlement sites
          (2008, 2012). The 2012 visit was joined by high-level decision-makers,
          members of the National Assembly, to learn from Chinese experience
          regarding resettlement and social impacts aspect.
        At closure, DESIA has reasonable staff and offices including a library that
          is being used for disclosure of information related to EIA/SIA as required
          in the EIA decree36.

      Ensuring DESIA effectiveness.
        DESIA conducted consultation meetings and/or training with sector
          agencies and the provinces.
        The Project further supported DESIA efforts to forge effective
          implementation of EIA/CAR decrees including incorporation of SESO as
          an annex to the CA of development projects.37 Translation of draft SESO
          into Lao language and consultations carried out with line agencies and the
          provinces to ensure adoption of final SESO by the end of 2013.
        DESIA developed technical guidelines for implementation of CAR decree
          and the public involvement. The guidelines were up-dated in 2011 and
          2012. Training and dissemination were carried out with line agencies and
          provinces.

Although not planned initially, the sub-component supported activities of beyond the
original focus:


36
   Since the launching of EIA Decree in Feb 2010, DESIA until now has reviewed 191 EIAs for 191 development
projects. Out of these, it has completed and approved 162 projects including IEEs for 97 projects and full EIAs for
65 projects. In addition, DESIA has reviewed and approved SESO annexes to CAs for 13 development projects.
The trend seems to be stable with notable increase in the number of SESOs reviewed, which are largely for
hydropower projects possibly due to a) the recent Government's moratoriums issued for land, mining and
agribusiness (plantations) concessions until 2015, b) the recent economic/financial crisis in the region resulting in
some investments suspended or withdrawn, and c) monopoly in investments and special arrangements with China
and Vietnam, which do not always follow the EIA policy and procedures and which are out of DESIA's control.
37
   Incorporating SESO into CA is considered the most effective way to ensure that private investors will
implement the proposed mitigation measures for the environmental and social impact.

    Climate Strategy. Upon request from DOE/WREA, the Project supported the
     development and up-date of the National Climate Change Strategy and Action
     Plan.
    Accessing NT2 Revenues. WREA was supported to establish a mechanism to
     tap into NT2 revenues starting 2011/12
    Environmental Action Plan. WREA was assisted in up-dating the National
     Environmental Action Plan (2011 – 2015).
    Pollution Control Decree. Project facilitated drafting and related consultations
     of the Pollution Control Decree.
    Land Policy. Project supported drafting of land policy.

CBI 1 Protected Area Management

Objective: to support protected area management authorities to do operational work in
eligible protected areas

CBI 1 Portfolio overview:
    59 subgrants (52/Phase 1; 7/Phase 2); total budget spent US$ 1,2031,000;
       average size/subgrant: US$ 20,900; largest subgrant: US$ 160,000; smallest
       subgrant: US$ 2,100.
    Rating EPF per number of subgrants: 12 HS, 34 S, 8 MS, 5 U
    Beneficiaries: Central (2), Provinces (27), Districts (24), Community (3), Non-
       governmental (3)

Outputs:
    Protected Area Management.
       Capacity. Provincial and district governmental staff capacity related to
         protected area management in target provinces was strengthened (training
         of at least 50 officials, of which 18 protected areas staff received
         comprehensive training on protected areas planning, equipment including
         motorbike, GPS, camera). The three provinces have increased their number




                                                39
          of staff working on forest resource management or protected area from
          2006 to 2012 by 50%. 39
        Governance. District and village committees for the PPAs have been
          established.
        Site management. 10 provincial protected areas have now clear boundaries
          with demarcation posts (more than 150,000 ha) and signboards installed
          e.g. 140 signboards for 60 km in Khounxe Nongma PPA.
        For the six priority PPAs (Phou Chomvoy and Houy Ngoua in BLX,
          Khounxe Nongma and Pha Thambing in Khammouane, and Laving-Lavern
          and Dong Natad in Savannakhet), the PPA management plans were
          completed and approved by the provinces. Implementation of priority
          activities initiated (mapping, boundary demarcation, patrolling).
        Awareness. Conservation awareness rising was conducted for officials and
          villagers in the protected areas.
        Tourism. Tourism facilities and checkpoints are now available in Dong
          Natad PPA and partly in Houy Ngoua PPA and Phou Chomvoy.
        Law enforcement. Village patrol teams, village foresters, and village
          network have been formed as the key player for the protected area
          management. The local villagers of the 6 PPAs received conservation
          awareness training including relevant laws on forestry and wildlife.
        Regulations. Developed regulations for protected areas management of the
          6 PPAs, including completing most of land and forest allocation in the
          PPAs. Land use planning was completed in most those six PPAs except
          Khounxe Nongma and Laving Lavern due to their large size.
        Research and data collection. All 6 priority PPAs completed socio-
          economic surveys, flora and fauna survey including Saola survey in
          Khounxe Nongma PPA with participation of village foresters. Databases
          were established for Laving Lavern, Phou Chomvoy, and partly Houy
          Ngoua PPAs.
        Up-grading of PAs. As a result of the Project’s interventions, Laving
          Lavern PPA was promoted to be NPA in 2011 and Houy Ngoua District
          Protected Area was promoted to be PPA in 2008. Since the success of this
          new provincial protected area management by Muang Mai Forestry
          Technical School, the Bolikhan’s District Governor allocated some 960 ha
          of degraded forest for Muang Mai Forest Technical School to be
          responsible by rehabilitating it and use it for academic research. Some
          protected areas receive some funding support such as Khounxe Nongma
          PPA and Laving Lavern NPA from Sepone gold mining company, and
          Phou Chomvoy from Hinboun hydropower through WCS.
      New decree on protected area. Project facilitated consultation of the new
       national decree on protected area.

CBI 2 Community Environmental Development

Objective: to support development of reduced impact livelihood options in and around
national and provincial protected areas, and other small environmental and natural
resource projects in local communities
CBI 2 Portfolio Overview:
     56 subgrants (55/Phase 1; 1/Phase 2); total budget spent US$ 973,000; average
       size/subgrant: US$ 17,400; largest subgrant: US$ 525,000; smallest subgrant:
       US$ 2,000.
     Rating EPF per number of subgrants: 23 HS, 18 S, 11 MS, 4 U
     Beneficiaries: Central (2), Provinces (15), Districts (25), Community (10),
       Non-governmental (4)

Outputs:
    Phase 1 Local Community Engagement in Conservation and Livelihood
       Alternatives in Three Provinces. Local communities and district staff received
       training and outreach activities to plan and implement community-based
       conservation activities. A number of forest, wetlands, and water bodies (ca.
       50,000 ha) were put under legal protection and are managed by communities
       including village patrolling. Most of these areas were marked with clear
       boundaries, signboards. Examples are Sokbok and Nongchao in Nongbok,
       Nam Piad watershed, 3 forest zones of Xebangfai, several wetlands and
       bamboo forest of Songkhone of Savannakhet Province) and 15 fish
       conservation zones in Bolikhan District and in Pak Kading River. Sustainable
       use / livelihood development activities were supported by establishing about
       17 village funds (e.g. banana plantation, cow raising, gardening, bamboo
       management, women’s group). Other related outputs included development of
       small-scale irrigation schemes; small-scale eco-tourism sites.
    Conservation Awareness. Conservation awareness tools for local communities
       and officials including posters and brochures and programs for radio and
       television were developed and disseminated.
    Phase 2 with Community Conservation Network in NT-NDK basin. The
       Project developed a novel approach to promote conservation activities and
       livelihood options for local communities by building ownership, commitment,
       and capacity of provincial staff and local communities. This model is called
       Community Conservation Network (CCN). CCN included the following
       elements: establishment of clear land uses, including identification of fish
       conservation zones, village protected area, watershed protection and
       reforestation areas; outreach activities; village capacity building and
       committees, establishment of community rules; and importantly a
       conservation contract as part of the fund borrowing contract; and regular
       patrolling with NPA staff. CCN was established in 12 villages (115 members)
       around the Nam Kading (six) and Nakai Nam Theun (six) national protected
       areas. Completed training for 14 staff on livelihood development, 16 staff on
       mapping and 64 staff on outreach activities, complete the establishment of a
       total 7 fish conservation zones. For livelihood development through

                                         41
       establishing a village revolving fund in all 12 pilot villages (55 million kip per
       village). A village fund committee was established for managing the fund. The
       Project funded a CCN study tour for officials and villagers to Thailand to learn
       from similar approaches. The CCN fund included support for the rehabilitation
       of the office and procurement of equipment and vehicles (2 cars). Further, the
       Project supported production of outreach materials for use in 12 villages and
       conducted radio program for 1 year at provincial radio broadcast. Of the 2,580
       people participated in the village outreach, 1,552 were women.
       EPF’s provincial facilitator: Each province was supported from EPF through
       a provincial facilitator and one account (later only one facilitator for 3
       provinces due to reduced number of subgrants).
      Related indicators:
      IOI 6 – Number of communities benefitting from sustainable livelihood
       models or environmental management – Achieved.
      AF IOI 11 – Number of conservation communities established in NT-NKD
       basin - Achieved

Component 3 MMS: (US$ 1.4 million; 20 % of total project costs)
Overall rating: MS


Objective: To support the day-to-day operation of the EPF, specifically PICE and
CBI windows; marketing and business developments of the windows to assist
beneficiaries to prepare subgrants; developing and implementing a monitoring and
evaluation and dissemination process to assess performance of the two windows and
training of the EPF staff to perform adequately.
Beneficiaries: EPF staff, particularly the WMU staff

Project funds:
Phase 1: 1.05 million
Phase 2: 0.35

Outputs under this component were the following:

MMS 1 Capacity Building of EPF Windows
(planned as 67 % of component cost)

    EPF operationalization:
      WMU staffing and training. The WMU staffing for Phase 1 included one
       WMU manager, two technical officers each in charge of one LENS window
       (PICE; CBI); support staff and three provincial facilitators. An international
       consultant was recruited for two years to provide technical assistance as the
       Chief Technical Management Advisor but resigned after one year (2007-
       2008). The position was split in two part-time assignments (portfolio
       management and biodiversity conservation). A M&E officer was recruited
       in 2010. In Phase 2 WMU staffing was reduced (only one provincial
       facilitators, no technical assistance) and merged with EPF staffing to reduce
       management layers and increase efficiency. The current EPF secretariat
       staffing includes one WMU manager, one finance officer, one accountant,
       one procurement officer, and one facilitator.
                                          42
          EPF equipment. Project supported EPF with equipment, one vehicle,
           operational budget, and consultants.
          Operationalizing PICE and CBI windows. A Window Management Unit
           (WMU) managed the two Project supported EPF windows. Technical
           assistance provided to beneficiaries at all levels particularly during Phase 1
           including multiple workshops and consultations. Training provided to
           beneficiaries on subgrant development, monitoring, procurement, and
           financial management. A functional computerized accounting system
           (APIS) has been established to monitor the fund flows.
          Subgrant administration. Subgrant tools (manuals, screening forms)
           improved. Subgrant database developed and operationalized.40
          Delivery of PICE and CBI subgrants. EPF managed 154 subgrants in Phase
           1 and 19 subgrants in Phase 2.
          Compliance with World Bank fiduciary requirements. EPF complied with
           legal covenants and fiduciary and safeguard requirements.

MMS 2 Marketing and Business Development amongst relevant agencies and
within targeted provinces
(planned as 26% of component cost)

      Stakeholder consultation. Annual stakeholder meetings were carried out. SC
       meetings took place although with decreasing frequency over time.
      Outreach. EPF developed and up-dated its webpage with documents in
       English and in Lao. A few outreach tools were developed (brochures, annual
       reports).
      Additional funding. Although EPF did not succeed in tapping into NT2
       revenues, it received funding from small mining companies (2008 – present)
       around US$200,000/year and from hydropower investor Theun Hinboun US$
       200,000/year. This contribution is to be used partly for administration and
       partly for new environmental activities.


MMS 3 Guidance, Evaluation, and Monitoring
(planned as 7% of component cost)

      M&E and Reporting. EPF issued seven annual reports 2006 – 2012.
       EPF/WMU issued three M&E reports. A final PCR was completed in 2013.

Related indicators:
    IOI 7 – Percentage annual operating costs per volume of transaction –

                                    44
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

At appraisal, a detailed economic and financial analysis was not carried out mainly
due the Project's demand-driven design and menu for subgrants and lack of data on
the environmental budget for governmental central and regional/local institutions.
Consequently, the ICR could not carry out a classical economic and financial
analysis. Nonetheless a crude analysis shows that during the project period, there was
improvement in terms of financial mobilization for the sector.

In 2005, only 0.6 % of the government budget was spent on environment related
agencies. Only US$ 15,000 was available on an annual basis for environment related
agencies within STEA. Sector financing from national budget has not significantly
improved. In 2011/12, the sector received approval for tapping into NT2 revenues
(3% for the environment sector to be shared 50%/50% between MONRE and the
forestry sector) which is equivalent to US$ 400,000 and if continued will increase the
sector budget significantly. Also, at Project completion, while EPF has not received
revenues from NT2 or from the government, it receives annual voluntary contribution
from small mining companies and one hydropower investor. Together with the
interest rate from the endowment fund, EPF receives an estimated US$ 500,000/year
to cover its recurrent budget, which is twice what it received in 2005.

Economic efficiency was sought in the design of subgrants. Because of the lack of
information and because of its framework approach, the Project integrated economic
and financial sustainability criteria into the eligibility and review process to the
selection of subgrants based not only on the technical and practical soundness, but
also on economic and cost-effectiveness considerations. In terms of capacity building,
the intended outcomes were realized. However, the weak monitoring and evaluation
framework did not allow for an ex-post cost-benefit analysis. The Project also
contributed to better environmental management and therefore reduced economic
costs of environmental degradation. The environmental and social costs of extractive
resources development projects have not been measured and therefore could not be
used to quantify avoided costs generated by the Project.

Nonetheless, the Project monitored EPF/WMU's annual operating costs per volume of
transactions to ensure that expenditures for sub-grant management remained
reasonable. The target of reducing annual operating costs was reached and actually
exceeded by the end of the Project (see data sheet original IOI 7 and additional
financing IOI 12 indicators).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

 As reported in EPF’s Project Completion Report in 2013 41, the completion report
 assignment included a beneficiary survey with key agencies including opinions of
 representatives from the Project target provinces (Bolikhamxay, Khammouane, and
 Savannakhet) on WMU/EPF performance. The results suggested that EPF operation
 through the subgrant mechanism is considered acceptable however improvement on
 procedures and services (especially on technical aspects) would be necessary.

 The provinces identified three strengths of WMU/EPF:
     Providing funds and technical assistance to support the planning and
        implementation of PESAP;
     Promoting active participation of local staff and local communities through
        the subgrants; and
     Having management mechanism that could be responsive to the local needs.

 The three weaknesses include:
     Limited funds and technical supports (no funding support from government
        and/or other donors beside Bank);
     Limited technical capacity and experience of WMU/EPF staff in the field and
        frequently change of staff; and
     Complex requirement on procurement and financial management.

 Recommendations for improvement include:
     Tapping additional fund from government, developers, and other sources;
     Improving communication, coordination,
     Timely advice between EPF and the subgrants; and
     Incorporating some incentive for government staff to play an active role.

The annual EPF stakeholder workshop for year 2013 was carried out on 17 May 2013
and used to present findings from the Project Completion Report (PCR). The
workshop was chaired by the Minister of MONRE. More than 114 participants
including central, representatives from the 17 provincial governmental agencies,
stakeholders and other development partners participated. Comments provided to EPF
were included in the final report before the PCR was adopted.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICRs

The Borrower prepared and validated its Project Completion Report (PCR)42 during a
national stakeholder workshop in May 2013. An extract of its executive summary is
presented below:

(a) Overall Conclusions

The overall Project performance is considered “Satisfactory” based on the rating of
9 key aspects related to relevance of the Project objective and design, Project
effectiveness/efficiency, GOL and Bank performance, achievement of the Project
outcome indicators, and potential impacts. There were 173 subgrants (valued about
$5.6 million equivalent) implemented under the Project of which 154 subgrants were
implemented during 2006-2010 under the Phase 1 and 19 subgrants were
implemented during 2011-2013 under Phase 2. Although there are some delays and
difficulties encountered during implementation and the lack of NT2 revenue flowing
into EPF as planned, many of the key outputs/outcomes have made significant
contribution to the success of the legal and institutional reforms for the natural
resources and environmental management (NREM) sector. There are also a number of
lessons learnt EPF to move forward and becoming a permanent financial entity for
NREM in Lao PDR, especially on water, forest, and environmental management. All
the subgrants were completed at the end of 2012 and all the remaining three subgrants
will be completed by the closing date. All the Project outputs/outcome indicators,
including legal covenants, are “met” or “partially met” in difficult cases and the legal
covenants are compliance with.

Given that capacity building is a long term process additional technical assistance and
financial supports from the Bank and other development partners to key agencies,
provinces, and EPF to facilitate effective implementation of NREM activities will be
necessary in Lao PDR when human and financial resources remain limited while
development activities are rapid especially for large hydropower, mining, and
plantation. LENS’s implementation experience suggested that the subgrant
mechanism is flexible, appropriate, and effective for channeling technical assistance
and funding supports to the agencies, especially at provincial and district levels, as
well as to the local communities and other key stakeholders and that EPF staff and
some GOL agencies and local communities have gained experience about the Bank
operation and management and ready to move forward the implementation of
additional projects. Although NT2 revenue has not been made available for EPF
activities as planned during LENS design, EPF Executive Office has demonstrated its
potential to tap and manage additional fund from developers and more efforts will be
made on this aspect. Supporting EPF operation (at least during the next five years)
will therefore be critical for forging achievement of sustainable use of natural
resources in Lao PDR. Sections (b) through (g) below highlight the key findings on
the Project assessment while Section (h) summarizes the key lesson learnt and
recommendations from LENS Project.

(b) Overall Performance, Relevance, and Effectiveness

The overall Project performance is rated “Satisfactory”. This is rated from 9 key
aspects related to relevance of the Project objective and design, effectiveness and/or
efficiency (E/E) of Project implementation and management, GOL and Bank
performance, achievement of the Project outcome indicators, and potential impacts
(Table 8). Sections (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) briefly summarized the discussions while
more details are provided in the main report and annexes.

(c) Relevance of Project Objective and Design

The overall Project objective, design, and implementation is rated “Satisfactory”.
Reasons are briefly discussed as follows:

          Relevance of Project objective is rated “Highly Satisfactory”. Review of a
           Bank recent study (2010) on natural resources and environmental management
           sector in Lao PDR 43 , the Bank country assistance strategy 44 , and other
           projects 45 confirmed that rapid development in hydropower projects and
           limited human and financial resources in the country to ensure effective
           implementation and monitoring of environment and social safeguard issues
           remain high priority in Lao PDR. Recent institutional and legal reforms in the
           country reflect GOL policy and priority for capacity building of key agencies,
           including EPF, and for active participation of people. This confirms that
           LENS objective is highly relevant to the current country condition. Relevance
           of the key subgrants and outputs is also rated “Satisfactory” given that many
           of them could facilitate the development/promulgation of key regulations
           and/or building operation capacity of key agencies considered priority for
           forging achievement of NREM in Lao PDR.

     Relevance of the Project design is rated “Moderately Satisfactory”. The
      Project is complex covering many sensitive issues and involves many
      beneficiaries while the EPF operation and the subgrant mechanism are new in
      Lao PDR and the budget available for the Project management and technical
      assistance are limited. However, despite some delays and difficulties, the
      subgrant mechanism is proven to be flexible and appropriate for EPF
      operation and could provide timely support to GOL actions on legal and
      institutional reforms, which are considered critical for ensuring effective
      management of natural resource and environmental in Lao PDR. Main
      shortcomings affecting achievement of the outcome are the complexity and
      sensitivity of NREM issues, the involvement of many agencies/beneficiaries at
      national and local level, and the premature application of an open-menu and
      the demand-driven concept with inadequate funding support. Risk
      identification is also considered moderately satisfactory.

(d) Project Implementation and Management

Effectiveness/Efficiency (E/E) of the Project implementation is rated
“Satisfactory”. The Project grant was provided from the Bank in SDR (Special
Drawing Right) while the US$ and Lao Kip is used during the management of the
subgrants and activities. Of the total grant of $7 million, $5.6 million (80%) was
allocated to subgrants and 1.4 million (20%) was allocated to WMU/EPF. Of the $5.6
million subgrant budget, $3.4 million (61%) was provided to PICE subgrants and $2.2
million (39%) to CBI. Under LENS, there were 154 subgrants ($3.1 million)
comprising of 47 PICE subgrants ($1.6 million) and 107 CBI subgrants ($1.5
million). Most of these subgrants were completed by the end of 2010 as planned.
Under Phase 2 there were 19 subgrants ($2.5 million) comprising 11 PICE subgrants
($1.8 million) and 8 CBI subgrants ($0.68 million) and most of them are completed at
the end of 2012.

Key activities included consultants, trainings/workshops, awareness/education
programs, study visits, and incremental operating costs. Key outputs and outcomes
are considered relevant to PDO and important for achieving sustainable development
of natural resources and environmental management (NREM) in Lao PDR.
Performance (E/E) of each component and key outputs/outcomes considered priority
to GOL is highlighted in Table 9 and more details are provided in Chapter 2.

                 between      EPF       and     potential
                 beneficiaries and key stakeholders on
                 NREM in Lao PDR including
                 improved subgrant management and
                 monitoring capacity of EPF staff.

(e) GOL and Bank Commitment

GOL commitment is considered “Satisfactory”. Based on the subgrant proposals,
GOL in kind contribution was about 20% of the subgrant budget. Recognizing the
needs for the country to address the environmental and social issues, a number of
regulations and institutional reforms were carried out during the past 7 years.
Although these efforts caused delay in implementation of some subgrants the
potential long-term impacts on sustainable use of natural resources are considered
critical for GOL to move forward achieving sustainable development in Lao PDR.
Involvement of and policy support from the high level-decision makers at the
ministerial and department levels were very high especially during the
implementation of the original LENS and the design of additional financing when key
policy decisions regarding the responsible agencies and priority for capacity building
had to be determined in light of the GOL priority and the legal and institutional
reforms. Most the agencies and beneficiaries are committed to the implementation of
the subgrants and appreciated the availability of technical assistance and funding
support provided from the Bank through EPF. EPF commitment also rated
“Satisfactory” given limited human technical and management capacity in the
country. However, there are rooms for improvement, especially on communication,
transparency, technical, and management capacity of EPF Executive Office.

Bank performance is considered “Satisfactory”. Although there are some
shortcomings in the design and during implementation, the Bank team took proactive
actions to address them. At the beginning of the Project, the Bank intervention helped
facilitating clarity on roles and responsibility of key agency and EPF and the
responsible agency for key subgrants, especially those related to the implementation
of the Nam Theun Nam Kading (NT-NKD) integrated river basin management and
the national policy on environment and social sustainability of hydropower sector

                                                 53
(NPSH) which has been adopted in mid-2005. During the original LENS
implementation, the Bank management and technical team actively involved in the
discussion with the high-level decision makers on ways to implement the NPSH, to
enhance effectiveness of the EIA/SIA process, and to address potential cumulative
impacts in NT-NKD river basin. Throughout the Project, the Bank technical team
plays a key role in providing technical guidance to the sub-grantee and key agencies
related to policy and institutional capacity building of the national agencies and the
Project provinces related to environment and social safeguards.

(f) Potential Impacts and Institutional Challenges

Potential Project impacts on the PDO is rated “Satisfactory” for all the three
components. Although there are some delays and difficulties encountered during
implementation and the lack of NT2 revenue flowing into EPF as planned, many of
the key LENS outputs/outcomes have made significant contribution to the success of
the legal and institutional reforms carried out by GOL to forge sustainable use of
natural resources and improve effectiveness of environmental management. There are
a number of lessons learnt for EPF to move forward and becoming a permanent
financial entity for natural resources and environmental management (NREM) in Lao
PDR, especially on water, forest, and environmental management. Most of the
subgrants were completed at the end of 2012 and all the remaining three subgrants
will be completed by the closing date. All the Project outputs/outcome indicators,
including legal covenants, are “met” or “partially met” in difficult cases and the legal
covenants are compliance with.

Potential impacts of LENS on strengthening institutions and instruments for
assessment, monitoring and compliance for environmental and social sustainability,
and broaden the constituency for environmental change is rated “Satisfactory”.
LENS supported a number of subgrants under PICE component/window and many of
the key subgrants resulted in an improved policies and instruments at national level
that are critical for forging sustainable use of natural resources in Lao PDR and
through a number of training, workshops, and study visits, these legal and technical
instruments are understood by stakeholders, institutionalized within government
agencies and system, and implemented by technically competent staff. During 2006-
2012, institutional capacity of Bolikhamxay, Khammouane, and Savannakhet in the
planning and management of environment and social aspects, including setting up
grievance mechanism in Bolikhamxay and Khammouane, have significantly
increased through the implementation of PICE A1 subgrants and the key technical
and management instruments such as the provincial environmental strategy and action
plan (PESAP), environmental database, and implementation of the grievance
mechanism in Bolikhamxay and Khammouane have been institutionalized and
implemented by trained staff.

Supporting an integrated river basin management (IRBM) through PICE A2 focusing
in Nam Theun Nam Kading (NT-NKD) resulted in promulgation of the river basin
committee (RBC) decree in 2010 (Decree 293) and operation of the NT-NKD RBC.
Of the 3 subgrants (valued $0.74 million) under PICE A2, one subgrant ($0.34
million) was provided to initiate the operation of NT-NKD RBC and its secretariat
office in BLX during 2011-2012 and this is considered only the beginning for GOL
effort to move forward the implementation of an IRBM in Lao PDR. Additional GOL

                                          54
efforts and technical assistance will be necessary for facilitating effective
implementation of the RBC operation especially in forging effective cooperation and
engagement among the provinces, the sector agencies, and local communities on the
ground. Given the establishment of NT-NKD RBC and its secretariat office in
Bolikhamxay, an improved understanding and commitment of the decision makers in
Bolikhamxay and Khammouane, and capacity of key stakeholders at local levels,
effective implementation of the NT-NKD RBC activities could be moved forward
when technical assistance and funding support could be provided. Detailed
information on the NT-NKD implementation model (building local capacity and
leadership of the provinces) is provided in Annex E.

Supporting the implementation of the national policy on environmental and social
sustainability of the hydropower (NPSH) during 2007-2010 (through PICE A3) is
critical for Lao PDR given rapid development of large hydropower projects (more
than 50 MW) by the private sector (about 40-50 projects) expected to be in operation
by the end of 2025. There were two subgrants ($0.37 million) provided to the
Department of Electricity of the Ministry of Energy and Mines (DOE/MEM) under
PICE A3 and they resulted in an improved public knowledge on the policy and
commitment of MEM’s agencies to take the lead in facilitating effective
implementation of the policy. At present, the NPSH is being implemented under a
separate technical assistance project (HMTA) designed to facilitate sustainable
development in hydropower and mining sectors under the Bank and AusAID
supports. More importantly, the subgrants resulted in an improved integration of an
environment and social aspects into the revised Electricity law during 2011-2012,
including a clear provision (article 41) for the Project developers to share the Project
benefits with local authority and communities in the Project area as well as to make
contribution to EPF.

Supporting key agencies responsible for forging effective management of
environment and social impacts assessment (EIA/SIA) process and environmental
management (through PICE A4) resulted in the promulgation of the new EIA decree
(Decree 112), operation of DESIA, and development of a mechanism for tapping NT2
revenue for the NREM agencies. DESIA is the new agency and at present it has
reasonable staff and office including a library that is being used for disclosure of
information related to EIA/SIA as required in the EIA decree. DESIA conducted
consultation meetings and/or training with sector agencies and the provinces
including facilitating capacity building and engagement (through study visits) of high-
level decision makers (the national assembly) and finalization of technical guidelines.
A Standard Environmental and Social Obligations (SESO) is being applied as an
annex in the concession agreement (CA) of large development projects, and this
process is being formalized. The draft SESO was developed with assistance from
international experts under Sweden and Finland technical assistance programs (SEM
II) and Environment Management and Support Project (EMSP) and it is in line with
NT2 project practice, which was considered acceptable at international level.

Supporting public education on environment (PICE A5) in 2007-2010 could increase
awareness and knowledge on environmental issues as well as on EPF operation and a
number of small subgrants were provided to wider constituencies/beneficiaries
including university, research institutes, mass organizations, and local NGOs. The
National University of Lao (NUOL) subgrant ($80,000) has developed training

                                          55
capacity and curriculum on social impact assessment and with support from DESIA
and EPF a partnership with a research center on social assessment in China has been
established and this effort will be continued. The Lao Front for National Construction
(LFNC) subgrant ($80,000) has developed a national guideline for consultation with
ethnic groups in Lao PDR and provided training to key staff. These outputs/outcomes
are considered important for facilitating effective implementation of Decree 192.

The potential impacts of the CBI subgrants on promoting on-the-ground investment in
environmental improvement activities, with emphasis on sustainable biodiversity
management, community environmental management and livelihoods enhancements,
is rated “Satisfactory”. There were 115 subgrants (about $2.2 million) provided under
CBI window and many of them are sustainable and appreciated by local beneficiaries.
During 2007-2012, there were 59 subgrants (about $1.2 million) provided to the units
responsible for PAs management in Bolikhamxay, Khammouane, Savannakhet and
six selected provincial protected areas (PPAs) and nearby local communities gained
experience in the planning and implementation of the protected areas management
activities, including completion of the PPA management plan and demarcation of
PPA boundary. Under CBI B2, there were 20 small subgrants ($0.44 million)
provided directly to local communities in Bolikhamxay, Khammouane, and
Savannakhet and many of them could demonstrate ways to increase ownership and
sustainability of local communities to implement conservation activities. Under the
additional financing, one large subgrant ($0.52 million) was provided to Bolikhamxay
in the context of NT-NKD management with an aim to establish a community
conservation network (CCN) that could demonstrate ways to promote conservation
activities as well as building ownership, commitment, and capacity of provincial staff
and local communities. Implementation of the CCN subgrant could also demonstrate
ways to promote livelihood options for local communities while the province begins
to strengthen its capacity on monitoring and enforcement. At present the CCN has
been established comprising 12 villages around the Nam Kading national protected
area (NKD-NPA). The CCN subgrant mechanism appears to follow GOL normal
operation procedures and is in line with GOL policy to enhance effectiveness of PA
management, increase livelihood development of local people, and increase
institutional capacity at provincial and local levels. These two models (providing
direct subgrant to local communities and CCN) will be scaled up and/or replicated as
much as possible.

Achieving the outcome indicator related to NT2 revenue and EPF (EPF emerges as a
competent institution eligible to receive NT2 revenues) is rated “Satisfactory” despite
the fact that EPF has not yet received NT2 revenue. Most of other outcome indicators
for WMU/EPF are met and EPF operation is on going. LENS’s implementation
provides an opportunity to many EPF staff and manager to gain operational
experience on a subgrant mechanism and management as well as to build EPF’s
capacity to connect/engage key agencies and wider constituency/ beneficiaries
necessary for facilitating sustainable financing mechanism. At present EPF opens five
specialized window including PICE and CBI windows and a functional computerized
accounting system (APIS) has been established and could timely monitor the fund
flows. EPF has demonstrated its potential and connections in providing technical and
financial supports for (a) building provincial capacity on environmental protection
and management including conservation and management of protected area and
biodiversity conservation and pollution control; (b) facilitating effective cooperation

                                          56
among agencies at national and provincial levels to address potential negative impacts
(direct and indirect) in the context of an integrated river basin management and other
cross-sector/trans-boundary issues, including capacity building; and (c) facilitating
public engagement and widening constituencies for conservation of natural resources
and environmental management, including enhancing transparency of regulatory
monitoring process. Reviewed of EPF financial status demonstrates high potential for
EPF to tap additional funds from private sector and development partners to be used
for supporting NREM activities in Lao PDR, however this will require strong support
from the sector agencies, especially those under the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the
Ministry of Planning Investment (MPI), the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM),
and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE). With support
from MPI and MEM agencies, starting 2008, EPF received budget contribution from
developers (mostly small mining) about $100,000-$300,000 per year. At present
(2013), EPF also received a budget of $200,000 per year from Theun Hinboun
extension hydropower development project and this will be continued during the next
25 years.

Institutional challenges: Sustainability of the key PICE subgrants (A1, A2, A3, and
A4), CBI subgrants, and EPF are likely to be high given the operation of MONRE;
the revision of the Electricity Law (2012), the Minerals Law (2011), and the
Environmental Protection Law (2013); and the EPF Board decision in March 2013 to
maintain autonomous status of EPF operation. However, reviewed of the NREM
sector and LENS implementation experience suggested that rapid hydropower
development, depleting natural resources, and limited human and financial resources
remain the key challenges in Lao PDR. Balancing socioeconomic development,
poverty reduction, and conservation of natural resources and environment, including
reducing potential negative impacts on local community and environment in Lao PDR
will require strong leadership and commitment of policy and decision makers,
effective implementation of GOL regulations, and capacity and commitment of staff
of key agencies. LENS has demonstrated various types of subgrant operations that
could be managed through EPF however additional technical assistance and financial
supports will be necessary to facilitate achievement of sustainable use of natural
resources in Lao PDR. Priority for the additional supports should include but not
limited to: (a) capacity building of MONRE agencies related to NREM focusing on
conservation forest, protected area management, integrated water resource
management, and pollution control; (b) capacity building of line agencies and the
provinces to ensure effective management and monitoring of development projects
and their potential negative impacts given due focus on social impact issues and
integrated river basin management; and (c) capacity building on financial aspect of
NREM especially in enhancing effectiveness, sustainability, and transparency of EPF
operation.

(g) Key Lessons Learnt and Recommendations

Key factors affecting the implementation and development outcome of LENS include
(a) complexity and sensitivity of the environmental and social safeguard issues,
especially those related to development of large hydropower projects; (b) moderate
shortfalls in the design, (c) lack of Bank experience and limited capacity of EPF and
agencies/sub-grantees, and (d) delayed implementation during the institutional


                                         57
reforms. Although some legal revisions on NREM are on-going a major organization
change is not expected at least for the next five years.

In Lao PDR, NREM issues are complex and sensitive and addressing them requires
active involvement of policy/high level decision makers; adequate capacity and
effective coordination and/or cooperation among agencies; and timely technical
assistance and financial supports from GOL, EPF, the Bank, and other development
partners. LENS implementation experience however suggested that ensuring effective
cooperation among agencies, especially between ministries appeared difficult and
time consuming due to limited human resources at each agency and strong vertical
administration and decision-making practices. LENS has also demonstrated that EPF
operation could play a key role in promoting sustainable use of natural resources and
conservation of biodiversity and environmental quality in Lao PDR. The subgrant
mechanism is flexible, appropriate, and effective for channeling technical assistance
and funding supports to the agencies, especially at provincial and district levels, as
well as to the local communities and other key stakeholders.

On capacity of EPF, LENS provided opportunity for EPF manager and staff to gain
knowledge and experience on the subgrant management and operation and the Bank
operation and requirements as well as to establish connection and partnership with
key agencies, local community, and other key stakeholders considered critical for
ensuring effective and transparent management of natural resources and
environmental management (NREM). Given the differences in GOL requirements and
Bank practices however the EPF executive office will have to adjust its operation
procedures that are effective and acceptable to GOL as well as in line with donor
requirements. EPF autonomous status offers an opportunity for GOL to tap additional
technical assistance and funding resources form developers and development partners
if EPF operation could be seen as effective, transparent, and sustainable.

To move forward the EPF operation, strong policy and technical supports and
additional financial assistance both from GOL and the Bank will be necessary at least
during the next 5 years. To make sure that EPF will have adequate operational budget
to improve the quality of the services and timely delivery of expected outputs, it is
estimated that increasing endowment up to at least $10 million will be necessary to
help enhancing effectiveness as well as sustainability of EPF operation. EPF should
develop a long-term strategy for capacity building for EPF operation during the next
10 years including a five-year action plan (2015-2020) as soon as possible. Given that
capacity building is a long term process and that the incremental capacity building
approach appeared appropriate for Lao PDR, EPF capacity building should be
developed in line with the following three phases: Phase 1-Learning Phase (2006-
2015), Phase 2- Testing phase (2016-2020), and Phase 3-Operation phase (2020-
2025). TOR for the strategy development should be prepared as soon as possible.
Key recommendations therefore are as follows:

    Bank to provide technical assistance and funding supports to enhance
     achievement of LENS’s PDO: Given that capacity development is a long-term
     process and requires additional technical assistance and financial supports,
     especially in light of rapid development and limited human resources in the
     country. To address these challenges it is necessary for the Bank to continue

                                         58
   building capacity of key agencies and EPF. Priority for technical and financial
   supports should include: (a) Environment and social safeguard capacity and
   monitoring of potential negative impacts focusing on forging effective
   implementation, monitoring, and reporting of the EIA system; (b) Stakeholder
   engagement and implementation of the integrated river basin management
   (IRBM) focusing on supporting constructive coordination and cooperation
   among key agencies, local agencies, local communities, private sector, and
   other stakeholders on conservation of natural resources and environmental
   management, including livelihood development options; and (c) Enhancing
   effectiveness of financial aspect for NREM focusing on financial aspect
   regarding funding sources and fund flows.

 Bank to provide technical assistance and funding supports to enhance
  capacity of EPF: Building on EPF unique position as an autonomous entity, it
  is necessary for EPF to work closely with key agencies (especially those under
  MOF, MPI, MEM, and MONRE) at the central and provincial levels to
  improve transparency and effectiveness of EPF operation both from the fund-
  raising and fund-utilization sides.

 In a short term, EPF should also take actions to improve EPF structure and
  organization that could be carried out during the second part of 2013. This will
  demonstrate EPF willingness to be more effective, proactive, and transparent.
  This study should be carried out as soon as possible.
