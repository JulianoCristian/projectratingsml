2.      Project disbursement as of November 2012 is SDR 1,800,658.01 (95% of the IDA
Credit). The PDO remains highly relevant. The project has allocated additional budget for
the Environmental Protection Fund to continue working with its Board of Directors and
related ministries to strengthen its sustainability.

3.      The proposed reallocation would allow use of funds from the ‘unallocated’
category and the estimated remaining balance under the goods and incremental operating
cost categories to finance additional activities under Sub-grants parts A and B, consultant
services and training. The proposed reallocation will not change the existing
disbursement categories and will not affect the Project Development Objective or project
design.
