The assistance rendered by\n            the World Bank since 1996 gave an appreciable impetus to the\n            sector development. One of these financial aids concerned\n            implementation of key economic reforms in the agrarian\n            sector. To provide such aid, a project was developed\n            entitled agriculture sector adjustment loan. Its resources\n            were used to carry out land reform, to restructure\n            agricultural enterprises, to privatize, and de-monopolize\n            agro-industrial enterprises, as well as to liberalize\n            internal and external trade, and to finance the critical\n            import needs. The seeds development project helped improve\n            the situation in the area of seed production and develop its\n            competitiveness. The rural finance project objective was to\n            facilitate the development of effectively operating and\n            competitive rural regions, and to improve the living\n            standards of the rural population. In June 2003, the World\n            Bank approved the decision to extend a loan in the amount of\n            United States (U.S.) 195 million dollars for implementing\n            the rural land titling and cadastre development project for\n            Ukraine. The World Bank supported land reform as a priority\n            component of economic transformations that are taking place\n            in the Ukrainian agrarian sector. The activities envisaged\n            by the project are aimed at a fair distribution of land\n            plots among farmers, consolidating of their ownership rights\n            to land by issuing respective state land titles on a\n            free-of-charge basis, as well as the development of a land\n            lease market, which is to contribute to improving the living\n            standards of the rural population. The project will focus\n            much attention to informing the population on the work\n            carried out and the significance of land reform on the\n            whole. Furthermore, additional funds will be allocated to\n            purchase required equipment for agrarian universities in the\n            cities of Odesa, Lviv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv."}, "docdt": "2004-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
