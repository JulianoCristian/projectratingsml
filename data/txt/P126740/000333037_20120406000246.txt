                              GRANT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

                                      SOLOMON ISLANDS

                              DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION 1


Borrower:                      Solomon Islands Government
Implementing Agency:           Ministry of Finance and Treasury
Financing Data:                Terms: Standard IDA grant terms
                               Amount : SDR 1.3 million ( US$ 2million equivalent)
Operation Type:                Programmatic, first in a series of two development policy operations,
                               single tranche, to be disbursed upon effectiveness.
Main Policy Areas:             Public financial management, state owned enterprises, and extractive
                               revenue transparency.
Key Results Indicators:        The number of civil society organizations consulted during budget
                               preparation; active use of a new chart of accounts; the number of
                               ministries that do not deviate more than 10 percent from the allocations
                               approved at the start of the fiscal year, pro-rated by the ratio of total
                               actual spending to total allocated spending; the percentage deviation
                               between appropriated and actual payroll expenditures; publication of
                               successful tenders awards including method of procurement; service
                               standards and staffing requirements for a new procurement unit; total
                               debts of the water authority; an EITI work plan.
Program Development            The proposed grant is the first in a series of two development policy
Objectives and Contribution    operations in support of Solomon Islands‘ transition from post-conflict
to Interim Strategy Note:      recovery to sustainable development in the context of its National
                               Development Strategy (NDS). The proposed operation would support
                               the following three development objectives: i) improve the quality of
                               public financial management; ii) improve the financial management of
                               key State Owned Enterprises; and iii) improve extractive revenue
                               transparency. The proposed operation is fully aligned with the
                               objectives set out in the most recent World Bank Interim Strategy Note
                               (ISN) to: (I.a.) address fiscal and balance of payments pressures through
                               the provision of financing and through the attendant participation in the
                               policy dialogue; (II.c.) update the mining sector regulatory and
                               institutional framework and seek participation in the Extractive
                               Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI); and (III.c.) improve the
                               effectiveness, efficiency, and planning in public spending. The
                               overarching themes throughout are public sector effectiveness and
                               accountability.
Risks and Risk Mitigation:     Program ownership is potentially subject to some political risk given
                               frequent changes in governments in Solomon Islands. The risk is
                               reduced in several ways. Many of the key political leaders and senior
                               bureaucratic officials remain in government even if their portfolios are
                               altered with successive changes in government. Within this group, there

                                                   i
                       is a high level recognition of the need for reform and the degree of
                       commitment has deepened significantly across a range of political
                       actors. The establishment of the government-led multi-donor Core
                       Economic Working Group (CEWG) mechanism has led to a coherent,
                       coordinated, and consistent approach by donors that can also be a force
                       for policy stability.

                       The macroeconomic and fiscal framework is subject to considerable
                       risks from volatile commodity prices, weather, and seismic events.
                       These risks are reduced by successful government action to build up
                       external and internal buffer stocks as part of the ongoing dialogue with
                       the IMF and donors on macroeconomic policies and the reform program.
                       The Bank will continue to monitor the impact of global economic shocks
                       and assess the need for further support. Both the World Bank supported
                       Rapid Employment Project and the Rural Development Program could
                       be ramped up if need be as part of a response to an economic shock.

                       There is some risk of a resurgence of social unrest. This is being
                       addressed by the government on many fronts ranging from security to
                       state building to public service provision, with assistance from RAMSI
                       and other key donors. The World Bank Justice for the Poor program is
                       aimed squarely at better understanding this risk. It focuses on improved
                       public sector management at the local level where traditional and outside
                       legal systems intersect. The proposed grant with its emphasis on public
                       sector effectiveness and accountability will augment these efforts by
                       helping to improve service delivery outcomes, in turn contributing to
                       political stabilization.

                       Weak institutional capacity could hamper the implementation of the
                       reforms supported by the proposed operation and the broader NDS.
                       These risks are mitigated by the choice and design of the supported
                       measures which are calibrated to existing capacity, the provision of
                       extensive technical assistance by RAMSI, the Pacific Financial
                       Technical Assistance Centre, the World Bank, and other donors through
                       ongoing or planned projects supporting the key ministries responsible
                       for policing, justice, prisons, public finance, health, education, and
                       infrastructure.

                       RAMSI is being progressively scaled back with expectation that its
                       advisory presence in 2013 will be roughly one third of its size in 2009.
                       At the same time, it is expected that more traditional development
                       assistance from AusAID, NZAP and other donors will gradually be
                       increased. Overall aid levels are not expected to go down. This change
                       in modality creates some short-term coordination risks but it also creates
                       an opportunity for the government to collaborate with the international
                       community through the CEWG process on how a long-term aid program
                       could best serve the population – including elements of assistance aimed
                       at reducing fragility, encouraging growth and job creation, and building
                       government capacity.

                                         I.    INTRODUCTION
1.      Solomon Islands is a fragile, post-conflict small island state and the poorest in the Pacific
when measured in terms of GDP per capita.1 Most of the population continues to be dispersed
across rural areas of the archipelago, where they largely depend on subsistence agriculture. This
caps food poverty rates, but exposes the population to environmental shocks. Poverty rates are
higher in urban areas, where traditional safety nets are weaker and unemployment rates are high.
A former British protectorate, the country became independent in 1978 and enjoyed twenty years
of moderate but sustained economic growth and improvement in social indicators.

2.      A low-level conflict between 1998 and 2003, known as ―The Tensions,‖ brought the
formal economy and many state functions to a halt.2 Real GDP per-capita, which had been
slowly eroding between 1996 and 1999 fell sharply between 2000 and 2002. An Australian-led
and financed regional peacekeeping mission, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon
Islands (RAMSI), stopped the violence, and rapidly restored order and basic state functions,
particularly in finance. The country has subsequently enjoyed a fairly good security situation,
interrupted only by short-lived but destructive riots in the capital Honiara in 2006. The RAMSI
presently retains a police and military presence, as well as a large corps of civilians in advisory
or in line functions, concentrated in the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). An
international security presence is likely for the foreseeable future although a transition for
RAMSI by 2013 is envisioned: many of the current RAMSI civilian-led development functions
are likely to be incorporated into more conventional aid programs.

3.      Two successive parliamentary elections have taken place since then, in April 2006 and
again in August 2010. The country has a Westminster parliamentary democracy but suffers from
structural political instability. Lack of established political parties leads to regular floor-
crossings, votes of no confidence, and chronic uncertainty among weak ruling coalitions. This
form of political instability was in evidence well before the Tensions and is likely to persist until
the underlying structural issues are addressed. These structural issues are distinct from the
causes of the Tensions which include over-centralization of decision-making in Honiara, poor
service delivery, a narrow economic base, conflicts over land tenure in the context of inter-island

  According to the Foreign Relations Committee of Parliament. The Solomon Islands Truth and Reconciliation
Commission is expected to issue a final report on the Tensions in 2012.

migration, and poor links between indigenous and imported political systems. The structural
political instability does, however, add another layer of difficulty to the long-run challenges
involved in addressing the causes of the Tensions.

4.      Until very recently, fiscal discipline was weak and pro-cyclical spending prevailed while
public service delivery from government and its state owned enterprises (SOEs) was inadequate
and inequitably distributed. The RAMSI intervention, together with the Honiara Club
Agreement of 2005, helped stabilize the fiscal situation until the Global Economic Crisis (GEC)
of 2008/09. The legacy of poor fiscal management made it difficult for the government to
manage the GEC, with the result that strong internal and external imbalances emerged in 2009.
That year saw the imposition of drastic spending reservations, the accumulation of significant
arrears, uncertainty as to whether government could meet basic payroll obligations, and a
reduction in import cover to less than one month.

5.      In response, the government and donors formed the Core Economic Working Group
(CEWG) in March 2009 in order to better meet the economic and fiscal challenges facing the
country during the Global Economic Crisis. The CEWG represents a very close collaboration
between officials from the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI), the Ministry of
Development, Planning, and Aid Coordination (MDPAC), MOFT, the Prime Minister‘s Office,
RAMSI, Australia, New Zealand, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the European
Commission (EC), and the World Bank. The formation of the CEWG led to a successful request
for an IMF Standby Credit Facility (SCF) and start of general budget support from the ADB and
EC, with the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and the New Zealand
Aid Programme (NZAP) providing sectoral budget support. The situation has significantly
improved since then, following three years of a deepening reform dialogue, well managed
positive economic shocks, and the introduction of a common reform matrix for economic and
financial reforms, the Economic and Financial Reform Program (EFRP).

6.       Thus, the government entered 2011 with cash reserves equivalent to two months of
expenditure (excluding externally financed projects), 5 months of import cover, and a credible
reform program. A number of reforms were introduced. For the first time in recent history, the
budget was fully funded and backed by analytical work and consultations with civil society
organizations. To strengthen tax administration and collections, the Customs Valuation Act was
amended and a ministerial circular was issued to authorize notification of the Public Accounts
Committee of the nature and cost of all tax and customs exemptions. The determined (taxable)
price of logs was adjusted upwards, closer to market prices. This may be followed by the
adoption of a formula based pricing mechanism with automatic quarterly adjustments. In order
to better control expenditures, a new payroll system has been installed which captures the full
central government labor force and flags expenditures that are not backed by spending warrants.
These and other ongoing reforms are expected to contribute substantially to macroeconomic
stability and the quality of governance.

7.      The CEWG and budget support have contributed to the reform process. The government
and its partners have followed good practice precepts from the start. Examples include the
introduction of a unified policy matrix for economic and financial reforms, and consensual
agreement on policy actions. The process has been flexible, non-legalistic, combining elements
of the formal and informal, and fundamentally based on dialogue and trust. Most importantly,


                                               2
the process was developed by the government and its aid partners specifically to work in the
context of the Solomon Islands.

8.      Budget support and CEWG have an established track record of not only successfully
supporting a credible multi-year reform effort, but also effectively mitigated risks associated
with political fragility. The strong dialogue and incentives created by the IMF and budget
support program meant that reform efforts remained strong and continuous during periods of
political instability over last quarter of 2010 and the first and fourth quarters of 2011.

9.     The policy dialogue has been productive. Over the last several years, the government has
agreed to stronger spending control through the Honiara Club agreement; introduced
improvements in budget formation; improved the Financial Instructions; improved forecasting
and cash management; agreed to procedures for determining the taxable price of logs for export;
made improvements in the governance arrangements for SOEs, restructured the Soltai cannery
and commercialized the KPFL plantation.

10.      Structural political instability has not impeded progress towards policy reforms. There
have been no major setbacks or slowing of the reform program in the last three years despite the
fact that there have been several changes in the Minister of Finance, changes in government, and
elections. The establishment of the CEWG mechanism, as noted above, contributed to this
outcome but there are other factors at work as well. Many of the key political leaders and senior
bureaucratic officials remain in government even if some of their portfolios are altered with each
successive change in government. Within this group, there is a high level recognition of the need
for reform. Each Minister of Finance has been supportive of the reform agenda and, as the
reforms have begun to yield results, the degree of commitment has deepened significantly across
a range of political actors. Another key to SIG‘s successful reform agenda has been the support
from large and enduring cadre of advisors. Part of RAMSI‘s whole-of-government strengthening
program, these have largely been recruited from central Australian Government agencies. After
assisting in the stabilization of SIG‘s core functions, this corps has developed and implemented
topical reform programs to strengthen SIG‘s public financial management and budget processes
and systems. As noted above, RAMSI is now being progressively scaled back with expectation
that its advisory presence in 2013 will be roughly one third of its size in 2009 while maintaining
its security presence. At the same time, it is expected that more traditional development
assistance from AusAID, NZAP and other donors will gradually be increased.

11.     Against this background, national priorities include increased social and economic
opportunities, sustainable population growth, stability, and peace -- as referenced in the Solomon
Islands National Development Strategy (NDS) 2011-2020. The strategy places emphasis on
efficient public service delivery, transparency, and accountability. In essence, Solomon Islands
intends to make the transition from a post-conflict stance to the business of long-term
development.

12.    In support of that effort, this program document proposes a First Development Policy
Grant (DPG-1) for SDR 1.3 million (US$2 million equivalent) to the Solomon Islands
Government (SIG). The proposed grant is the first in a series of two development policy
operations in support of Solomon Islands‘ transition from post-conflict recovery to sustainable
development in the context of its NDS. The proposed operation would support the following


                                                3
World Bank Interim Strategy Note (ISN) objectives: (I.a.) address fiscal and balance of
payments pressures through the provision of financing and through the attendant participation in
the policy dialogue; (II.c.) update the mining sector regulatory and institutional framework and
seek participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI); and (III.c.) improve
the effectiveness, efficiency, and planning of public spending. The operation complements
similar support, cited above, provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European
Commission (EC).

                               II.    COUNTRY CONTEXT
                          A.      RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

13.     In early-2012, the Solomon Islands enjoyed a markedly more secure macroeconomic
footing relative to recent years. A surge in logging, support from the government‘s development
partners, improved external conditions, and gains in macroeconomic management lifted growth
rates, built foreign exchange and government cash reserves, and kept retail prices in check (Table
1).

14.     Solomon Islands‘ GDP growth recovered in 2010 from the impacts of the 2009 global
economic crisis (Figure 1). The economy is estimated to have expanded by about 6.8 percent in
2010 and is estimated to have grown by around 9.0 percent in 2011, following a 4¾ percent
contraction in 2009. By Q3 2010, overall production had surpassed the level it had been in 2008
(according to CBSI data). The earlier-than-expected first gold pours at the Gold Ridge mine
contributed to the pick-up in growth in 2011. Yet, even with the recovery in the Solomon
Islands economy, incomes have barely kept pace with population growth. The latter averages
almost 2¼ percent a year, according to the 2009 census, meaning that by the end of 2011 per
capita GDP was barely higher than 3 years earlier.

15.     Logging activity drove much of the economy‘s resurgence, especially late in 2010 and
through the first quarter of 2011. Logging is expected to have contributed around one-third of the
economy‘s expansion in 2011. Log exports remained at near record highs through 2011, with
1.9 million m3 exported over the whole year. Anecdotal reports attribute this strength to new
species being logged, a re-entry into areas logged a decade or more ago to harvest trees now
large enough, and extension to areas now made viable by the higher international timber prices.
The impact of more activity was amplified by higher international prices: average export prices
increased by over one-quarter in the year to January 2011, to near US$100 per m3.

16.    Imports grew faster than exports in the first stages of the rebound, before slowing as the
recovery matured. One-off capital equipment imports for specific investment projects explain
much of the surge and subsequent decline in imports, such as the 83 percent increase in
‗machinery and transport equipment‘ in Q4 2010, most of which was destined for the rebuilding
of the Gold Ridge mine. Rising fuel (from late 2010) and food prices (less dramatically but
through the full year) also contributed to the increase in import values.

17.    The rebound initially expanded the goods and services deficit, but this turned into an
improving position through 2011. The record trade deficit of 2010 shifted to surplus as the surge
of imports started to contribute to export production (most notably through production at Gold


                                                 4
Ridge) and as higher global prices for cash crops elicited greater production. Solomon Islands
recorded trade surpluses totaling nearly SBD 150 million spread across Q2 and Q3 of 2011, and
preliminary data suggest an improved trade account over the full year. The current account
deficit is estimated to have fallen from near 30 percent of GDP in 2010 to just below 12 percent
of GDP in 2011.

18.    Foreign investments and increased official development assistance funded much of the
increase in imports in late 2010 and the start of 2011, allowing foreign exchange reserves to
accumulate over this period. Reserves exceeded 5 months‘ cover of goods and non-factor service
imports by the end of 2010, and approached 7 months‘ cover by the end of 2011. Foreign
exchange reserves rose to above US$410 million by December 2011 (Figure 2). Capital account
inflows, to both public and private sector investments, recovered from the compression of 2008.
Capital investment credits totaled US$15.0 million in the four quarters to Q4 2008, the lowest
amount in recent years. In contrast almost US$60 million of capital investment credits were
recorded in the four quarters to Q1 2011, itself the second strongest quarter on record.

19.  The Solomon Islands have been somewhat insulated from the resurgence in global
commodity prices around the turn of 2010. Urban consumer prices were flat through 2010,



                                                                                              6
before some inflationary pressures largely associated with the direct and second-round effects of
the increase in fuel prices emerged in the second quarter of 2011, lifting peak CPI inflation to
10.1 percent in 2011 (Figure 3). This was followed by disinflation in the second half of 2011
leading to a period average rate of 6.6 percent.

20.     The government budget ended 2010 in a considerable surplus (Figure 4), which it
maintained through the first 10 months of 2011 – again contrasting with the severe cash
shortages at the start of 2009. The surplus was equivalent to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2010 and 5.0
percent of GDP in 2011 (following the government‘s budget presentation). Below-budget
spending and spending reservations at the start of the year also contributed to the 2010 surplus.
Revenues were above-budget, mostly linked to the strength in logging (7 percent more than
projected, due to higher tax receipts). Customs and excise collection was almost one-third higher
than 2009 due to both improved collection and the higher value of log exports. These same
factors again lifted revenues above budget-time expectations in 2011. The estimated surplus in
2011 was also induced by poor spending, especially of the development budget. Officials
attributed this to the late budget (passed in April) and to limited project implementation capacity.

21.    Government debt continued to decline (Figure 4), resulting in an improvement of the
country‘s risk rating to ‗yellow light‘ status from ‗red light‘ status under the Honiara Club
Agreement. Government debt fell to SBD 1.3 billion (around 21 percent of GDP) at the end of
2011, reflecting growth in nominal GDP and ongoing repayments of domestic debt. The
government settled all valid accounts and arrears in 2010, an improvement on previous years.
SIG has also eliminated its external arrears following a payment of US$1.9 million to the
European Investment Bank and the decision to write-off the balance in arrears of US$0.75
million.

22.     On balance, monetary conditions eased through 2011. The average interest rate on
commercial loans declined from over 15 percent in June 2010 to between 13½ and 14½ percent
in the year to mid-2011, while net interest margins fell as time deposit rates recorded a small
increase over this period. Yet private credit growth remained very weak – the stock of
commercial loans declined constantly from mid-2009 to Q2 2011. After rising through much of
2010, excess liquidity in the banking system appears to have stabilized, with the growth in
foreign exchange reserves becoming the main driver of growth in the money supply. The central
bank has worked to reduce this liquidity by issuing more short-term paper, and by increasing
banks‘ reserve requirements. With the improvement in macroeconomic conditions, the central
bank resumed auctioning short-term paper, the 28 day ‗Bokolo Bill‘. CBSI hopes that these
issues will lay the path for establishing a policy interest rate, and to complement the 56 day and
longer Treasury bills which the government largely uses for cash management purposes.

23.     A modest revaluation of the SBD against the US dollar in June 2011 did not offset the
currency‘s depreciation against other currencies. In practice CBSI has operated a crawling peg
against a basket of exchange rates with a heavy weight on the US dollar. The SBD was close to
7.8 SBD/US$ in early June 2011 before the revaluation lowered it to 7.4 SBD/US$ (Figure 2).
This move unwound only a little of the US dollar‘s depreciation, which the SBD has tracked.

                      B.      MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 2011-2014

24.    The macroeconomic framework implemented by the authorities has been adequate to
provide an acceptable level of price stability, maintain acceptable internal and external balances,
reduce the stock of debt, and build reserves to cushion shocks. This broad framework is
expected to be maintained in the coming years and is therefore adequate to support the proposed
program.

25.     The growth in economic activity achieved over 2010 and 2011 is expected to be sustained
into 2012, although growth rates are likely to moderate to around 6 percent in 2012 and 4 percent
over 2013-14 as logging output declines. Slower output from logging is expected to be partially
offset by scaled-up production from the Gold Ridge mine and from cash crop and fish producers.
If this does not happen, or if logging activity declines faster than expected, then real growth
could slow further to around 3 percent per annum over 2013-14.

26.     The surprisingly high rate of logging experienced in the first part of 2011 is unlikely to be
sustained, even as new areas are entered, and this decline in logging will subtract from the
economy‘s growth. Uncertainty about the potential for logging will rise substantially from mid-
decade. Beyond output at Gold Ridge rising to potential, mining may strengthen in the second
half of the decade, if nickel production takes hold. Long lags are expected in the approval of
nickel mining lease applications lodged in September 2011. There is potential for further gains in
cash crop production and receipts from fisheries, as efforts to improve extension services, market
access and contract negotiation continue. Meanwhile the declining RAMSI contingent of security
personnel and advisors will slow growth in private consumption demand. The high import
content in all these activities diminishes their impact on GDP growth, although not on
government revenues.

27.     Monetary policy is expected to be consistent with inflation slowing to under 5 percent,
subject to price developments in trading partners. Lower external prices and the exchange rate‘s
appreciation against the US dollar are likely to feed into slower inflation into 2012. Solomon
Islands however remains highly exposed to external price shocks, but the central bank‘s
accumulation of foreign exchange reserves suggests greater scope to manage future shocks

28.     Gains in the health of public finances are likely to be retained. The funding required for
fiscal operations is fully identified. The 2012 budget maintains an overall surplus of 1.3 percent
of GDP (IMF GFS definition), and includes provisions for unexpected expenditure. Thus the
proposed budget would further build the government‘s cash reserves, above the thresholds
established under the IMF program closing at the end of 2011. Improvements in revenue
collection, particularly in the IRD, are broadening the revenue base. Revenues as a share of
GDP are therefore expected to increase to 38 percent of GDP by 2014 from an estimated 32.5
percent of GDP in 2011. These gains are expected to allow an expansion in development
expenditures to 12 percent of GDP by 2014 compared to an estimated 5.9 percent in 2011. The
ongoing surplus, plus robust growth in nominal GDP will also allow further progress in reducing
the public debt to GDP ratio to 16 percent of GDP by 2014 from 21.3 percent in 2011. Revenues
will, however, remain susceptible to the volatility in the logging and mining sectors for the
foreseeable future.



                                                 8
29.      The external position in the outer years is set to deteriorate temporarily during the
transition from logging exports to more cash crops and marine products in addition to mining.
Export growth, denominated in US dollars will slow to almost zero in 2013 before picking up
slightly in 2014 and increasing thereafter. Import growth will slow as well but less than
proportionately because increased exports of services and income receipts are expected to
partially compensate for lost logging exports. The net result is that the current account deficit is
projected to worsen from just under 12 percent of GDP in 2011 to almost 16 percent of GDP in
2013 before improving slightly to 14 percent of GDP in 2014. In consequence, the pace of
reserve accumulation will also slow so that import cover will gradually erode from a peak of 6.5
months in 2011 to 5.7 months in 2014. This puts a premium on continued access to IMF
facilities while also avoiding any unnecessary reserve drawings, particularly in light of continued
risks from external shocks and natural disasters.

30.     The medium-term outlook is subject to considerable risks inherent in a small, isolated and
geographically dispersed economy such as Solomon Islands. Frequent changes in the holders of
ministerial positions are likely to persist, although these changes tend to have limited impact on
reform programs, as described elsewhere in this document. Elections are next scheduled in 2014.
External developments provide the main source of macroeconomic risk. The islands are
particularly susceptible to natural disasters, which can disrupt fragile transport and production
infrastructure. Declines in global commodity prices could have a dampening influence on real
activity, and slow the development of participation in the market economy. Conversely,
strengthening the institutional capacity to access opportunities offered by Australia‘s seasonal
labor program could bring cash to remote communities and build skills.

                                  C.     DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

31.     The November 2011 joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) concluded
that the Solomon Islands is at moderate risk of debt distress. Containing the risk of debt distress
will require continued efforts on rebuilding fiscal buffers and enhancing the resilience to external
shocks. In the baseline scenario of the DSA, key indicators of sustainability—the present value
of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt, the ratio of PPG debt service to exports
and the ratio of PPG debt service to revenue—all remain well below the indicative thresholds
based on the quality of Solomon Islands‘ institutions (Table 2). The baseline scenario allows for
the possibility for renewed access to external financing after completion of the review of the
Honiara Club Agreement, compensating for the decline in foreign aid. As a result, the ratio of
PPG debt-GDP rises in the long-term. In the sensitivity analysis, shocks relating to non-debt
creating flows (largely official grants) resulted in a substantial increase in the debt burden and
caused some indicators to rise significantly above their thresholds over an extended time period.
Based on past debt problems and the country‘s uncertain growth prospects, a cautious approach
to new borrowing was advised.

32.     The DSA suggests that the Solomon Islands‘ overall public sector debt dynamics are
sustainable in light of the current size and the evolution of the domestic debt stock. At the end of
2010, central government public and publicly guaranteed debt had fallen to near 28 percent of
GDP (US$135 million) and is estimated to have fallen to around 22 percent of GDP in 2011 (this
includes disbursements under the IMF program). Over two-thirds of public debt was external.
Public debt is expected to continue to fall in the medium-term, as budgets remain in surplus, and
no new borrowing has been contracted. Reflective of this improvement, the ratio of debt
servicing to non-grant revenues is estimated to have fallen from around 4.5 percent in 2010 to
3.5 percent in 2011 and further declines are anticipated.

                          III.     THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM
                                 A. THE INCIDENCE AND NATURE OF POVERTY

33.     Poverty in the Solomon Islands is largely material rather than food-related, and the rates
tend to be higher in urban than in rural areas. According to a 2008 United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) report3 analyzing data collected in around the turn of 2006, the incidence of
poverty, relative to local, basic needs4 is moderate with a headcount rate of 22.7.5 Roughly 84
percent of the population lived in rural locations. The rural households were found to provide
substantially more of their own food than those in the urban areas. Thus, even though urban
access to public services was markedly higher, the rural poverty headcount (18.8 percent) was
lower than the headcount of 32.2 percent in the national capital city of Honiara. On the other
hand, according to the report, rural Solomon Islands households provided substantially more of
their own food (58.6 percent) than those in both provincial urban areas (16.7 percent) and
Honiara (8.5 percent) with the greatest difference between households found among households
in the lowest expenditure quintile. These figures reflect both the greater subsistence production
and the levels of food security of rural households, as well as the general lack of organized
markets in these areas; it also signifies the greater need for cash for food purchases in Honiara
and the provincial-urban centers. Female headed households tended to represent a greater share
of households in the poorest expenditure deciles, especially in the rural areas. The Poverty Gap
Index, measuring the depth of poverty in Solomon Islands has been estimated at 7.5, which is
similar to Tonga and Samoa and less than that estimated for Fiji or the Federated States of
Micronesia. The Squared Poverty Gap Index, which is a measure of the severity of poverty being
experienced, is at 3.5 nationally, similar to Fiji, FSM and Tonga.

3
  Plans for a new household survey, perhaps as early as 2012 or 2103, are under discussion.
4
  No estimates have been made for the incidence of poverty below the international poverty line of US$1.25 per day
due to a lack of purchasing power parity exchange rates for Pacific Island countries.

34.     In Honiara, 78.8 percent of all household heads were in some form of full or part-time
employment. In contrast, in the rural areas only 16.6 percent of household heads were formally
employed. Instead, the rural population relies on a combination of subsistence farming, logging,
fishing, and the sale of cash crops. The lack of formal employment opportunities in the rural
areas is reflected in the one-third of all household heads engaged in production for home
consumption compared to 2.3 percent in total.

35.     The United Nations Human Development Index provides another measure of poverty
based on human capacity. The Solomon Islands was ranked 123 out of 169 countries in 2010
with a Human Development Index of 0.494 that has remained essentially unchanged since 2006
when it improved to 0.493 from 0.483 in 2005. Life expectancy at birth is reported at 67 years.
According to UNICEF sources, infant mortality in 2009 was estimated at 30 per 1,000 live
births, and under-5 mortality at 36 per 1,000.6 According to the same sources, 12 percent of
children less than 5 years old were moderately underweight between 2003 and 2009, and 33
percent suffered from moderate to severe stunting in the same time period. Although health care
is meant to be free7, there is some evidence that it may not be equitable: much of the health
expenditures are for activities in Honiara. Moreover, much of the health care in Honiara is
skewed towards tertiary and curative rather than preventive care. According to the 2008 UNDP
report, the poor in Honiara are only one-third as likely to have post primary education as the
better-off while, in the rural areas, the poorest household are only half as likely to have gone
beyond primary level compared with the average for all household. The average schooling
attained by citizens 25 years or older was 4.5 years.8

                               B. THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

36.     A Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) for the period 2008-2010 was adopted
by the government in 2008 with technical assistance from NZAP. The CEWG Policy Matrix for
2010-2011 requires that a widely consulted new MTDS be formulated and adopted by 2011. The
new MTDS, entitled the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2011-2020, was developed with
technical assistance from ADB and financial contribution from Australia and European Union.
The NDS has been under formulation since early 2010. Following submission of the first draft
NDS in December 2010, intensive work on stakeholder consultation was concluded in May
2011. It was approved by Cabinet in Q3 2011. It builds on the experiences of past development
strategies, and upon available analytical work done in recent years by government, donors and
other agencies. It was extensively consulted with government officials, donors, the Solomon
Islands private sector and civil society.

37.    The new NDS has three over-arching goals. The first is to increase social and economic
opportunities. This goal will be supported by efforts to alleviate poverty, providing help for the
vulnerable, and by providing an equitable distribution of public resources and economic benefits.
The second goal is to secure sustainable growth. Supporting activities include facilitating private

  The 2009 Demographic and Health Survey provided an infant mortality estimate of 24 deaths per 1,000 live births.
7
  ―Out of pocket‖ contributions from households were estimated to finance only 6 percent of total health costs in
2008 according to the MHMS Finance Report for Year Ending 31 December 2008. Much of the financing comes
from Australia which in 2009 provided over one-third of total public expenditure in the health sector, supporting
pharmaceuticals, technical advisors, and provincial grant funds.

sector development, diversifying the economy (notably through new mining operations), and
improving the management of environmental issues and climate change in particular. The third
goal is to maintain stability and peace. This goal will be supported by maintaining security, law
and order; and by securing regional and international partnerships. These three goals are
complemented throughout by a general emphasis on improving the quality of governance.
Special emphasis is placed on increasing the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of
public service delivery (notably for policing, health, education and infrastructure) and on
ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. The NDS is expected to guide future sectoral
strategies and ministry corporate plans from 2012 onward.

    IV.    WORLD BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM
                           A. LINKS TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

38.     Solomon Islands has been a member of the World Bank Group since independence in
1978. The Solomon Islands Government has received a number of loans and grants from the
World Bank, totaling US$63.4 million, prior to the current ISN period. These projects have
assisted governments with work in numerous fields including education, rural development,
health, and energy. In November 2008, the World Bank Group established a permanent office in
Honiara together with the Asian Development Bank.

39.     The proposed operation is fully consistent with the ISN for FY10-11.9 The ISN is
explicitly rooted in a results-based framework, which links overall goals that are consistent with
the government‘s MTDS to specific strategic objectives and outcomes which are monitored,
where appropriate and possible, by quantitative intermediate progress indicators that are directly
affected by Bank interventions. A new Country Partnership Strategy will be drafted in FY13 that
will be consistent with the government‘s new NDS.

40.     The ISN specifically envisions the initiation of development policy operations, stating
that ―The WBG will move toward a modest Development Policy Operation in FY2011 in order
to support select PFM reforms, encourage coordination, selectivity, and sequencing among the
overall donor budget support program, and help to move the country away from narrow project
aid modalities. A gradual shift to budget support could also over the medium-term become a
more cost effective use of aid funds, given the high transaction costs of project implementation
in Solomon Islands.‖ In fact, there are currently 180 different donor projects in Solomon Islands
– this is not only unmanageable but also contributes to the fragmentation of government and
donor efforts.

41.     The proposed operation will bridge the FY10-11 ISN and FY13-15 Country Partnership
Strategy. Although the operation will not produce results until after the current ISN is replaced
by a successor, it will support a number of key outcomes that are consistent with current ISN
objectives. These include policy actions that will help address fiscal and balance of payments
pressures through the provision of financing and through the attendant participation of the Bank
and other donor partners in the policy dialogue; update the mining sector regulatory and

institutional framework and seek participation in the EITI; and improve the effectiveness,
efficiency, and planning of public spending.

         B. RESULTS ACHIEVED UNDER PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATIONS

42.    The proposed operation is intended to be the first of two programmatic Development
Policy Operations from the World Bank. Results indicators are included in the Program Matrix
in Annex 3 for measurement at the conclusion of the expected second operation.

                     C. COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANK ACTIVITIES

43.     Several operations are direct complements to the proposed DPO series and provide
financial and technical assistance in these areas. The intended improvements in public
expenditure management will benefit from and build upon similar work initiated under the
Health Sector Support Program Technical Assistance (HSSP-TA) Project (Report No. 40993-
SB). Active since March 2008, the HSSP-TA complements the larger AusAID HSSP sector-
wide approach with targeted technical assistance to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services.
The technical assistance focuses on public expenditure management and planning for the
medium-term and at the provincial level, sector performance monitoring and training, and
capacity building.

44.      The DPO focus on SOEs is complementary to the Solomon Islands Sustainable Energy
Project (Report No. 43120-SB). With a World Bank grant of US$4 million for four years to
2013, this project aims to support and improve the efficiency and reliability of electricity
supplied by the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA). This is being done through the
recruitment of management expertise, the improvement of SIEA‘s financial position, and the
improvement of SIEA‘s technical operations. Efforts have led to improved collections,
installation of more cash power meters, and significant reductions in outages. The project is
currently undergoing a re-structuring which will add another almost US$2 million to the project.
The World Bank has been engaged in and the leading donor on energy issues since 2004,
including for the Tina River hydroelectric project, with a large body of analytical work. The
Bank has also played a leading role in dialogue and coordination in this sector, encouraging
improved governance and adherence to the revised 2007 SOE Act. The current Government is
the first to adhere to this Act.

45.      The DPO focus on updating the regulatory and institutional fiscal framework for mining,
particularly with regard to efficiency and transparency, is fully consistent with the Bank‘s
Mining Sector Technical Assistance (SPF Grant No. TF097135). The World Bank, through the
State and Peacebuilding Fund, is providing technical assistance to the Solomon Islands
Government to review policy, legislation and institutional arrangements relating to the mining
industry. This will set the stage for a planned second phase of the project which will include a
major capacity building effort. The project also includes activities aimed at mainstreaming
women‘s voice on mining related issues. The project is complemented by separate efforts to
support the government‘s stated goal of signing up to the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI), including the placement of an EITI specialist in the World Bank office in
Honiara to work with the government on reaching EITI compliance.

             D. COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNER PROGRAMS

46.    The proposed DPO series will complement and leverage the support of other
development partners. The specific areas for IDA support have been identified in close
coordination with other development partners, aiming for synergy with their respective
interventions, and building on IDA‘s comparative advantage in these areas. The Bank will
continue to collaborate closely with these donors during implementation of the government
program supported by the proposed operation, especially through the mechanism of the CEWG
described below.

                Box 1: The Second Joint Assessment Mission of the EFRP Matrix
 The 2011 Joint Review Mission (JRM), reviewing SIG‘s achievements in implementing the policy reform actions captured
 in the Economic and Financial Reform Program (EFRP) 2011-2013, found progress in many important areas:

          The EFRP has contributed to the achievement of fiscal stability and a stronger external position. The IMF
           benchmarks were met;
          The SIG has adopted the National Development Strategy, which provides the framework for Solomon Islands‘
           longer-term development;
          SIG‘s revenue base has been strengthened through more effective Inland Revenue Division (IRD) administration,
           a new focus on integrity in collecting import and export duties at Customs, the design of a new natural resource
           tax framework, and progressing candidature under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI);
          Improving the budget preparation process by deeper engagement with line ministries and consultations with
           Solomon Islands‘ civil society organizations
          Ongoing improvements in budget transparency through greater use of press releases and MOFT‘s website to share
           information on the government‘s finances;
          Greater control over government expenditure through improved cash management, and ongoing development of
           Public Financial Management systems including payroll, financial tracking (through the Chart of Accounts and
           Financial Management Information System) and internal audit;
          Improved management and oversight of SOEs, improvements in their financial reporting, and development of a
           Community Service Obligation policy.

 The JRM recommended the following be priorities for the CEWG-supported reform program. These combine areas of
 progress already being addressed as well as areas which the JRM believes would benefit from increased emphasis.

     1.    Continued engagement of the IMF under a Fund-monitored program
     2.    Strengthening procurement practices and processes
     3.    Public service reform
     4.    PFM reform roadmap
     5.    Developing an economic reform program
     6.    Audit and monitoring
     7.    Budget documentation and planning processes, linking to the NDS via sector strategies
     8.    Ongoing improvements in the performance of state-owned enterprises
     9.    Comprehensive revenue study
     10.   The provision to SIG of comprehensive estimates of expected development expenditures by development partners.


47.     The creation of a multi-donor CEWG together with SIG was a transformational event. It
allowed, for the first time ever, regular dialogue on economic policy between donors and the
government at the ministerial level. The CEWG was established in March 2009 by the Minister
of Finance, with the government represented by officials from MOFT, MDPAC, OPMC ( office
of the Prime Minister‘s Cabinet), and the CBSI and with donor participation from the ADB,
AusAID, EC, NZAP, RAMSI, and the World Bank. MOFT is in the process of inviting the
Ministry of Public Service (MPS) to join. The original intention was to improve coordination and
dialogue between SIG and development partners to meet the economic and fiscal challenges
facing the country during the Global Economic Crisis.


                                                            14
48.     The first Economic and Financial Reform Program (EFRP)10 was created under the
CEWG in 2009 and was followed by a Joint Assessment Mission led by the Ministry of Finance
and ADB under the auspices of the CEWG, in August 2010. This was the first time such a joint
mission had taken place. A summary of the mission‘s findings is provided in Box 1. The
mission provided the basis for the disbursement decisions of donors – as it had been agreed that
the one exercise would aim as much as possible to cover the needs of all five donors providing
direct and sector budget support. The review of the EFRP has now been established as annual
exercise. In order to avoid overwhelming a small Ministry of Finance, there is an agreement that
donor representation in the review will be limited to a rotating subset of the full membership
from year to year. The 2011 mission was led by the World Bank and MOFT, with participation
from AusAID and EC.

49.     The creation of the CEWG and a common EFRP matrix facilitated the introduction of
general budget support to Solomon Islands by the ADB and the EC in 2010 and 2011, to be
followed by the World Bank in 2012. ADB support under the Economic Support and Recovery
Program11 focuses on fiscal management, public financial management, SOE accountability,
telecommunications deregulation, and transportation policy. The ADB has disbursed US$5
million into the 2010 budget, under its Economic Support and Recovery Program sub-program 1.
It disbursed an additional US$5 million into the 2011 budget. While no formal agreement has
been concluded, a similar amount is likely for 2013. EC budget support under its Vulnerability
Flexibility (V-Flex) Funds was focused primarily on mitigating the impact of the Global
Economic Crisis. In 2010, the EC disbursed €15.2 million into the 2010 budget. In 2011, it
expects to disburse up to €2.8 million for general budget support under its new Climate
Assistance Programme. In addition, the governments of Australia and New Zealand are
providing sector budget support to health and education respectively, with each aligned to the
common EFRP matrix. Australia also paid out AU$3 million in 2010 and another AU$3 million
in 2011 in recognition of progress against 2009 and 2010 EFRP policy actions. A multi-year
funding arrangement is being explored for future support to the EFRP. New Zealand disbursed
US$7 million in 2010 for its education program. The Bank has collaborated closely with each of
these donors to ensure close alignment and complementarities in the areas supported by the
DPG-1 under the auspices of the CEWG.

50.    The Bank is also taking care to align its efforts with ongoing donor programs of technical
support for public financial management, notably the comprehensive program of support from
the RAMSI Financial and Economic Management Strengthening Program (FEMSP), from
ADB‘s Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) on SOE reforms and NDS
implementation, and from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre. The work on SOE
reforms is conducted in collaboration with the ADB which takes the lead in this sector.

51.      IMF and IDA staffs have coordinated closely on the identification of the respective
institutions‘ areas of focus. The IMF Board concluded the third review of the Solomon Island‘s
arrangement under the Standby Credit Facility in November 2011. The authorities and the IMF
agreed that the government‘s reform program will be supported by a new Standby Credit Facility
10
   It should be noted that the EFRP does not, and is not intended to, address unresolved issues underlying ―the
tensions.‖ That work is ongoing and is led primarily by RAMSI. Additional work is led by the UNDP as well as
the World Bank under the Justice for the Poor program.

following the expiry of the first arrangement in December 2011. IMF and IDA staffs have
coordinated their advice closely on economic issues and solutions for the government. IDA
relies on the IMF for advice and assistance on issues related to macroeconomic management
while the IMF relies on IDA for advice and assistance on issues such as private sector
development and sector strategies. Both staffs collaborate on issues related to fiscal management
and are also coordinating closely to provide advice to the government in its efforts to strengthen
public financial management.

                                       E. LESSONS LEARNED

52.     Although the proposed operation will be the first World Bank DPO for the Solomon
Islands since 1999, its design has benefited from lessons drawn from similar operations in other
fragile countries. These are summarized below:

      Budget aid to fragile states should not be viewed as simply a transfer of financial
       resources to a country‘s budget; rather, it should be considered as a key element of an aid
       package that also includes evidence-based policy dialogue, analytic work, technical
       assistance, and capacity-building activities. This advice is well heeded: the proposed
       operation is embedded in the CEWG policy dialogue, it builds on prior analytical work,
       and it complements ongoing TA programs provided by RAMSI, the World Bank, and
       other donors.

      In these environments, it is important to consider more systematically the choice and
       complementary nature of instruments to support recurrent expenditures—for example,
       policy-based budget support lending, grants, and multi-donor trust funds. Donors could
       fine tune the mix of instruments and sources of financing at their disposal to avoid
       negative consequences for countries if disbursements through one mechanism are delayed
       or withdrawn. The proposed choice of a programmatic series is reflective of this
       guidance.

      Programmatic operations focusing on a modest reform agenda may be feasible for
       gradual reformers such as the Solomon Islands Government, if there is strong ownership
       for uncomplicated and politically feasible reforms that can build momentum for future
       change. This lesson is embodied in the annual CEWG process which starts with the
       formation of a government-owned reform program that is vetted by the Cabinet for
       desirability and feasibility before it is proposed to the donor community.

      Effective coordination among donors is important in small states with limited capacity.
       Capacity to implement structural reforms is extremely thin in small states and can easily
       be overwhelmed by the relatively large number of donors. It is therefore critical that
       donors coordinate their activities closely and minimize duplication of efforts that over
       stretches government capacity. In recognition of this lesson, this DPO was prepared
       through the CEWG mechanism in a manner fully aligned with the EFRP matrix in close
       collaboration with key donors and multilateral development agencies active in the
       Solomon Islands.




                                               16
        Close working relations between the Bank and government counterparts improve the
         quality of Bank assistance. The creation of a World Bank country office in 2008 has
         helped ensure such a relationship which ultimately led to the creation of the CEWG
         mechanism.

                                     F. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

53.     The design of the proposed operation is based on the conclusions and recommendations
presented in a number of analytical documents. They include core diagnostic assessments by the
World Bank in collaboration with the government and other donors. The design aspects related
to public financial management are informed primarily by the 2010/11 Public Expenditure
Review (PER), which focused on issues related to budget formation and budget execution, at the
request of MOFT, as a means of improving public service delivery. The PER provides guidance
on a number of reform options aimed at budget formation and budget execution, some of which
have been taken up in the latest EFRP Matrix.12 It is expected that the PER process will be
ongoing in the form of smaller, follow-on public expenditure reviews aimed at specific ministries
or spending programs. Additional guidance in public expenditure management is found in the
Solomon Islands Public Financial Management Performance Report (EC, 2008), Solomon
Islands Operational Procurement Review (IDA, 2008), the Financial and Economic Management
Strengthening Program (RAMSI, 2010), Solomon Islands Education Sector Public Expenditure
Review (IDA, 2009) and the Health Financing Options report (IDA, 2010). An assessment of
civil society and the demand for good governance can be found in an unpublished 2008 report
commissioned for the World Bank entitled Pacific Region Civil Society Scoping Mission
Country Notes.

54.   The content related to SOEs was informed by two documents. One is entitled ‗Designing
a Program of Support for Strengthening the Solomon Islands‘ State Owned Enterprises‘
(RAMSI, 2010). The other was produced by the ADB in 2011 and is titled ‗Finding Balance:
Benchmarking the Performance of State-Owned Enterprises in Fiji, Marshall Islands, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, and Tonga.‘ Among other things, these reports included suggestions for
improving the governance, financial accountability and sustainability of key SOEs.

55.     The content related to mining is informed by the documentation prepared for the
Solomon Islands Mining Sector Technical Assistance Project, the background paper completed
for the Solomon Islands Growth Prospects Discussion Note, and a background note on the
history of the Gold Ridge Mine. These documents established the need for more attention to the
quality of the regulatory framework particularly with regard to exploration, taxation and revenue
sharing.




12
 The PER team also provided informal technical assistance to their counterparts in the MOFT Public Expenditure
Analysis Section.


                                                     17
                         V.     THE PROPOSED OPERATION
                                 A. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

56.     The proposed grant of SDR 1.3 million (US$2 million equivalent) is the first in a
programmatic series of two development policy operations in support of Solomon Islands‘
transition from post-conflict recovery to sustainable development in the context of its NDS.
Budget support as a form of assistance in Solomon Islands serves several over-arching strategic
purposes. It has proven more effective than project aid or TA alone in supporting and
consolidating structural reform, mitigates vulnerability to unanticipated shocks, promotes
dialogue and coordination across donors and partners, and reduces aid fragmentation. The
proposed operation would support the following three development objectives: i) improve
public financial management; ii) improve the financial management of key State Owned
Enterprises; and iii) improve extractive revenue transparency. The proposed operation is also
fully aligned with the objectives set out in the most recent World Bank Interim Strategy Note
(ISN) to: (I.a.) address fiscal and balance of payments pressures through the provision of
financing and through the attendant participation in the policy dialogue; (II.c.) update the mining
sector regulatory and institutional framework and seek participation in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI); and (III.c.) improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and planning in
public spending. The overarching themes throughout are public sector effectiveness and
accountability.

57.     Improved public financial management is the first development objective. Successive
governments have been re-building basic systems in partnership with the donor community but
there is now an appetite to undertake measures in new areas. One of these is the quality of
budget formation and execution. The government intends to more transparently link its future
budgets to the National Development Plan and to introduce a more consultative budget formation
process while, at the same time, tightening up on the quality of budget execution. If these
objectives are met, the quality of public service delivery should gradually improve and boost
overall confidence in stability of, and future prospects for, the economy.

58.     Improved financial management, the second development objective, is also needed for
the SOEs. The SOEs responsible for electricity and water not only provide key public services,
but also have an important role to play in job creation and investment promotion. Through
ADB‘s PSDI technical assistance, a new SOE Act, passed in 2007, and its accompanying
regulations issued in 2010, should facilitate their ability and motivation to play this role. The
aspects related to governance and monitoring of the SOEs are particularly important to success.
The government intends that these provisions shall be implemented. The earlier policy reforms
undertaken under the CEWG Policy Matrix 2010-2011 required (i) publicly releasing an annual
SOE monitoring report, (ii) endorsing debt restructuring for the Solomon Islands Electricity
Authority (SIEA) and new appointments to senior positions, (iii) completing the tender process
for sale of Sasape Marina and initiating a restructuring of Solomon Airlines, (iv) implementing
SOE regulations on community service obligations and (v) appointing directors with a view to
further enhancing performance. It also required further actions to resolve the debt that the
Solomon Islands Water Authority (SIWA) owes to the SIEA (more than SI$33 million). The
intended resolution is the focus of this operation.



                                                18
59.    The selection of the third policy objective, improved extractive revenue transparency, is
motivated by three post-conflict needs: (i) to mitigate the proven potential for conflict through
transparent and consultative administration of benefits; (ii) to address the well-founded public
concern that mining will go the way of logging, providing only short term benefits to only a few
people, and (iii) strengthening the ability of the government to administer a technically
challenging sector with large international investors.

                                         B. POLICY AREAS

60.     Policy actions supported by the proposed operation are aligned with the government
EFRP as reflected in the Letter of Development Policy (LDP) (Annex 2). Table 4 provides
details of the operation‘s prior actions. The rationale for their selection is discussed below,
particularly in terms of their importance to the government program, expressed government
commitment and feasibility in the context of ongoing capacity constraints. Specifically, each of
the three policy areas in this sub-section includes a description of the situation and challenges
facing the government, a review of recent government actions, and reforms planned to be
undertaken under the program. Each policy area concludes with a sub-section that outlines the
policy actions supported by the proposed operation. The operation foresees outcomes in line
with the results targeted in the ISN which, in turn, is consistent with the results sought by the
NDS.

Improving Public Financial Management

61.   Current situation and challenges. While the quality of aggregate fiscal management has
improved since the arrival of RAMSI and government commitment to the Honiara Club
Agreement, more attention is now needed for the quality of budget formation and execution.

62.     While the formation of the NDS benefitted from widespread consultations, the budget
process had been lacking opportunities for direct consultations with representatives from non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). Until recently, this could be attributed to near absence of
NGOs in the Solomon Islands. More recently, several NGOs have established operations,
primarily in Honiara, but several have a presence in the provinces as well. Some of the areas of
focus include corruption (including a new chapter of Transparency International), logging and
other extractive industries, environmental protection, indigenous rights, small-holders, youth
support, and the welfare of mothers and children. A survey conducted in 2008 found that most
NGOs suffer from low capacity and some were initially viewed with distrust by government
officials. Thus, while these organizations are still new and growing, they represent the beginning
of what could become a more engaged civil society. The government has recognized this and
seeks to encourage their growth. As noted below, MOFT has initiated a consultative process with
members of civil society as part of the annual budget cycle.

63.     There is also a general lack of connection between sector ministry requirements and the
budget. This is partly due to the fact that the planning documents of government and of each
ministry are organized by loosely defined goals which are not accompanied by cost estimates
while the budget is a long list of inputs organized by ministries. The lack of connection is also
partly due to the budget process which does not include any opportunity for sector ministries to
argue for changes in the allocations proposed for them (beyond a small amount set aside for new


                                               19
activities) nor any opportunity for MOFT to explore opportunities for cost reductions.
Moreover, control over budget formation is fragmented with the Ministry of Public Service
managing the compensation and placement of employees; MOFT managing other recurrent
spending, and MDPAC managing the development budget – and with only minimal coordination
between them. Thus, it is not unusual to see one part of a ministry‘s budget go up while another
part is reduced even though policy changes do not require such an outcome. In addition,
hearings conducted by members of the ruling coalition in Parliament (the Caucus) have been
used in years past to modify the MOFT proposal before it reaches Parliament for ultimate
approval. The budget process has also been open ended to the extent that changes can be made
after the budget is approved by Parliament using a variety of methods including directives in the
form of cabinet letters, contingency warrants, and supplemental budgets that are not fully funded.
As a result, the budget allocation for any particular ministry will tend to vary over time without
regard to what is required to achieve government goals.

64.     The quality of budget execution is also weak. Actual spending by most ministries tends to
deviate from original allocations by as much as ±20 percent and sometimes more. In 2009 for
example, only 7 of 30 budget heads were spent within plus or minus 10 percent of their original
approved recurrent allocations (Annex 6).13 Four heads were over-spent by an average of 32
percent of their original allocations and 20 heads were under-spent by an average of 29 percent
of their original allocations. The year 2009 was a difficult year in which SIG controlled
resources fell short of budgeted targets by almost 14 percent.14 Yet it is interesting to contrast
this outcome with the outcome from 2008 when 16 of 30 budget heads (53 percent) were spent
within ±10 percent of budgeted amounts despite a 12 percent shortfall in total SIG controlled
resources. Moreover, the 2008 outcome represented a slight improvement over the 2007
outcome when only 14 of 29 budget heads (48 percent) were spent at levels close to allocated
amounts. The problem is worse in the development budget, with project financing only slightly
better than direct contributions from the government.

65.     Part of the problem in under-spending, particularly in the development budget, can be
traced to weak administrative and technical capacity. Over-spending can be assigned in part to
weak expenditure commitment controls and generous access to contingency warrants. For some
ministries, substantial resources have also been diverted internally (vired) from public service
delivery to less productive uses such as employee allowances, office expenses and travel.

66.    Recent government actions. In 2010, as part of a jointly conducted Public Expenditure
Review, MOFT held a series of workshops with senior officials drawn from the sector ministries
and key donor agencies that led to an open discussion of the issues described above. This led to
a commitment on the part of MOFT to embark on a program of budgetary reforms. Some
examples are listed below:




13
   Changes to approved allocations via supplemental budgets are not included here. Thus, the deviations represent
the sum of sanctioned and unsanctioned within-year adjustments.
14
   SIG controlled resources include all revenues and all direct budget support but excludes project support and sector
support.


                                                         20
          The Government has established a website managed by MOFT that provides budget
           details from 2010 onward.15

          MOFT created a Public Expenditure Analysis Section within the Budget Division in 2010
           to conduct the PER together with the World Bank. This unit has developed an
           operational analytical capacity to review ministry spending patterns through the use of a
           new multi-year database created for the PER. This led, in turn, to the very first budget
           hearings in which ministers were presented with an analysis of the actual level and
           composition of expenditures within their ministries.

          The 2011 budget will be the first to set funding aside, as part of a planned surplus, for
           contingency warrants. In previous years, contingency spending was financed through ad
           hoc expenditure reductions applied to various ministries.

          Expenditure controls for employee compensation have been strengthened. Beginning in
           2011, the government will issue individual ministries with accounting warrants for
           payroll, while new payroll software has been installed that will help reduce spending in
           excess of the warrants.

          Expenditure controls for other recurrent spending have also been tightened so that, from
           2011 onward, ministries may not spend beyond the amounts allocated to them.

          Preparations are being made to link spending more tightly to government objectives. To
           this end, the Budget Unit and the Treasury are collaborating on a design for the
           organizational codes that will allow spending to be tracked not only by ministry and
           inputs but also by programs within ministries.

          Beginning in June 2011, MOFT began soliciting advice from civil society and provincial
           leaders for the formation of the 2012 budget.

67.    By February 2011, and with efforts to tighten expenditure controls already underway,
MOFT had secured preliminary approval from the Cabinet to begin designing a comprehensive
program of budgetary reforms. The design work is ongoing. This work will build on existing
donor programs of support and is informed by the findings from the PER as well as prior
expenditure review work completed for the education and health sectors.16

68.    Outcomes and actions. The government expects to achieve several key outcomes
following the completion of the policy actions supported by the proposed programmatic series of
development policy operations. These are discussed below.

69.     A new role in budget formation and monitoring is to be created for civil society
organizations and provincial officials. To achieve this, MOFT invited a cross-section of civil
society organizations and provincial leaders to submit ideas as part of the annual budget process
for what the government could do to improve public service delivery. It is expected that this
would then set the stage for further and more informed consultations each year. This process

16
     See Section IV.F above.


                                                      21
will also build community awareness of the budget as the country‘s preeminent resource-
allocation and planning device, towards building incentives for better execution. This would be a
commendable change: there were no such consultations in prior years.

70.     A new chart of accounts is to be introduced in a staged manner to support budget
improvements. The account codes will be rationalized and simplified to reduce duplication and
inconsistencies in the 2012 budget, and account codes will be used for the first time in assigning
allocations and recording project expenditure against the development budget. Further advances
will be made in relation to the 2013 budget with the budget and expenditure information being
organized by program/activity for ministries. The new system will also allow reporting to be
consistent with IMF Government Financial Statistics standards. The work will be supported by
upgrades to the financial management information system, modifications to existing business
processes and the development and delivery of training for financial and other key ministries.
This work is supported by the RAMSI FEMSP.

71.     The annual budget process will be revised to allow an opportunity to better align ministry
allocations with needs. To achieve this, MOFT will deepen the new budget consultation process
with line ministries introduced as part of the 2011 budget process. In particular, the annual
review of the budget proposals by each ministry will not need to be restricted to the small
fraction of the budget set aside for proposed new activities, as has been the practice thus far.
Instead, ministries will have the opportunity to present their business case for their baseline and
proposals while MDPAC, MOFT and MPS may question any portion, prior to making final
recommendations to Cabinet before the final budget is presented to Parliament.

72.     In contrast to pre-2011 practices, budgets will be fully funded. In addition to an
administrative decision taken in 2011 to limit contingency warrants to a pre-defined share of
planned budgetary surpluses (to build needed cash reserves), MOFT intends to revise the Public
Finance and Audit Act to formally require that that the annual budget and all supplemental
budgets shall be fully financed.17 Additional revisions will focus on financial management
accountabilities. These will include alignment between budget actions and the medium term
fiscal strategy as well as making more explicit the responsibilities of permanent secretaries and
other public servants in relation to the control and management of public expenditures. The
revised Public Finance and Audit Act will provide a stronger base for transparency, credibility,
and accountability of the budget and financial management. This work will proceed in stages,
starting with discussion papers and stakeholder consultations and then proceeding to Cabinet
endorsement around September 2012, legislative drafting, and approval by Parliament by
December 2013.

73.     The ability to execute the budget in accordance with parliamentary appropriations will be
strengthened. In addition to improvements in the financial management information system, and
notably for the payroll, this objective will be promoted by amending the Financial Instructions to


17
   One option to achieve this would be to amend Section 4 of the Act to specify that the sum of all expenditure
allocations plus the maximum allowable spending for contingency warrants shall not exceed the sum of revenues,
grants, and borrowing approved in the budget. Similarly, Section 15(3)(b) could be amended to require that all
supplemental budget allocations shall be fully financed from new revenues, grants or approved borrowing or from
expenditure reductions in specific budget heads or sub-heads selected by the Minister.


                                                      22
reduce opportunities to deviate from the approved budget.18 This work is also expected to be
completed by December 2013. For 2012, however, the government will pursue the very first
fully funded Supplemental Budget through administrative measures. This will reduce the need
for disruptive spending cuts that have been needed in the past in order to accommodate
unfinanced supplemental appropriations.

74.    The combined effect of better budget formation and improved budget execution should
gradually reduce the gap between budgeted and actual expenditures over the next 5 to 10 years.
The preliminary impact will be measured by monitoring the number of budget heads that deviate
from approved allocations by more than 10 percent and the depth of those deviations relative to
available resources and past performance.

75.     The degree of transparency surrounding the procurement process will be increased. This
will be achieved by publishing successful procurement tenders controlled by the Central Tenders
Board on the MOFT website. In addition, as a result of MOFT having found discrepancies in the
procurement practices of several Ministries when procuring information technology and
stationery items; MOFT has increased compliance activities on all IT and stationery
procurement; collected information from reputable dealers of the real cost ‗value for money‘
prices of IT equipment and stationery; suspended trading with some of the questionable suppliers
until a review of their operations has been undertaken by Internal Audit; and referred all suspect
or unusual purchases to Internal Audit. Internal Audit has referred some of this information to
the police force for further investigation. As a next step, MOFT is considering the formation of
a new central procurement policy unit that would develop procurement policies, build line
ministry‘s capacity through training, monitor procurement decisions, manage whole-of-
government purchases, and act as a secretariat for the central tender board.

76.     Focus of Proposed Operation. The proposed DPG-1 supports three policy actions that
are critical to the objective of improved public financial management. The first action is to
introduce the use of ministerial expenditure analysis briefs into the annual budget process for the
very first time. This was achieved as part of the 2011 budget formation and strengthened in the
2012 budget formation. The second action is to tighten up expenditure controls for employee
compensation by issuing separate warrant authorities for payroll to ministries. Third, successful
tenders awarded by the central tender board are published on the MOFT website.

Improving the Management of Key State Owned Enterprises

77.    Current situation and challenges.19 The SOE sector will need continued attention if it is
to contribute to economic growth and government resources. The government undertook an
aggressive restructuring and divestiture program for its state owned enterprises in the late 1990s,

18
   One way to do this would be to amend the Financial Instructions to: (i) lay out tighter procedures for ensuring that
no spending shall take place except through the appropriations approved by parliament per section 101 of the
Constitution; (ii) provide a clear definition of what constitutes ―an urgent and unforeseen need‖ for the use of
contingency warrants; (iii) provide guidance on an upper limit for the maximum amount of contingency warrants to
be proposed to Parliament in the draft Appropriations Act; and (iv) provide rules for when requests for virement
may and may not be accepted, e.g., only after the relevant line item has been exhausted and only in support of public
service delivery.

preparing several for sale and completing two privatization transactions before the tensions
began in 1998/99. Following a change in the government in 2000, the privatization program was
halted, and efforts to restructure SOEs were effectively abandoned. SOE performance
deteriorated and the balance of the portfolio generated net losses in every year except 2004.

78.    Attempts to improve the performance of the SOEs over the past decade have delivered
mixed results. A new SOE Act, prepared with ADB technical assistance and passed in 2007,
together with its accompanying regulations issued in 2010, provide a robust framework for the
governance and monitoring of the SOEs, but important provisions have yet to be fully
implemented. Most SOEs struggle to prepare and publish timely annual reports and statements
of corporate objectives; and some directors continue to be appointed outside the requirements of
the law on the basis of political rather than skills-based considerations.

79.    Lacking better governance, the SOEs have failed to develop the commercial focus
required for effective management. The net result is that the Solomon Islands SOE portfolio has
been one of the poorest performers in the Pacific both on economic and financial terms.

        According to the ADB, the consistently lower productivity of the SOE sector caused a
         significant drag on economic growth.

        The SOE portfolio generated an average return on equity of -13.9 percent for FY2002–
         FY2008 and accumulated losses of SBD184 million (US$24 million) during the same
         period. A financial restructuring of the SOE portfolio in FY2008 cost the Ministry of
         Finance an estimated SBD220 million, bringing the total government contribution to at
         least SBD398 million (US$52 million) for FY2002–FY2008. This restructuring, which
         was intended to reduce the debt levels and financing costs, is likely to have only a
         temporary impact on improving the profitability of the portfolio because high levels of
         receivables, poor recovery practices, and high operating costs lock many SOEs into loss-
         making cycles. In FY2008, the most recent year for which financial statements are
         available, 6 of 12 SOEs were insolvent.

        The Solomon Islands also had the highest or second highest costs of service delivery in
         the region, as shown in Table 3.

80.     Beyond the fiscal strain created by the SOE portfolio‘s poor financial performance, many
of the SOEs are also failing to provide adequate levels of service or meet minimum service
delivery standards in such key infrastructure sectors as power, water, and shipping. Access to
electricity is estimated to be no more than 16 percent overall and 10 percent in the rural areas. In
2007, the electricity authority was insolvent with liabilities exceeding assets and becoming more
so due to continued financial losses. Access to piped water has been limited to a small number


                                                           24
of urban centers and supplies are unreliable. Getting the SOEs back on track so that they provide
efficient, reliable and affordable services will require some capital expenditure. That
expenditure will have to be paid for via a combination of improved efficiency, capital injections,
SOE tariff and pricing reforms, and perhaps donor financing.

81.     Recent government actions. With support from the ADB and RAMSI, a number of
notable reforms have been implemented since 2009. Home Finance, Sasape Marina and Soltai
SOEs were privatized, new SOE regulations were adopted to support the 2007 SOE Act, and the
boards of SIEA and SIWA were restructured. In October 2011, the Cabinet endorsed a 33
percent increase in the water tariff for SIWA. In 2011, a new MOFT SOE Monitoring Unit
began work to implement the SOE regulations governing non-commercial services in exchange
for limited access to subsidies in order to avoid the need for internal cross-subsidization within
key SOEs. The resulting contractual relationship is referred by SIG as ―Community Service
Obligations‖ (CSOs). The Monitoring Unit has prepared a template contract for the Community
Service Obligations, and with continued support from ADB, is upgrading the accounting and
financial reporting systems of the SOEs in order to effectively implement the CSO regulations.
Building up from previous reform actions included in the CEWG 20010-2011, government has
also moved to make solvent the operations of the two most important SOEs, the Solomon Islands
Electricity Operations (SIEA) and Solomon Islands Water Authority (SIWA). This has included
mobilizing and coordinating assistance from the World Bank for management reform in SIEA
(SISEP) and from AusAID and JICA in SIWA. A joint donor program—the Pacific Regional
Infrastructure Facility—is funding advisory assistance to SIWA. An output from this assistance
includes completing the recovery action plan, which includes a menu of proposed measures to
settle SIWA‘s approximately SBD $35 million debt to the SIEA and the mobilization of
technical assistance to undertake a detailed tariff study for SIWA to inform future adjustments.

82.     Outcomes and Actions.20 One of the most immediate objectives of the government under
the EFRP has been to move key SOEs towards financial solvency. As a first step, the need for
internal cross-subsidization would be reduced under the new Community Service Obligation
policy. While the utilities‘ service delivery is concentrated in Solomon Islands‘ few urban areas,
the cost of service delivery is higher in some of the hard to reach areas where more of the poor
households are found. This has been one source of losses, especially for SIEA. Under the CSO
policy, SIG appropriates an amount of funds to finance service-delivery contracts with the SOEs
in these higher-cost areas in order to ensure service delivery to poor households. SBD 10 million
was allocated in the 2011 budget, and the first CSO contract was signed between MOFT and
SIEA in September 2011, covering the cost of providing electricity in some remoter areas.

83.     Additional work is being pursued, starting with the reduction of SIWA debts to SIEA in
2012 followed by the installation of more meters, improved meter reading and auditing practices,
a tariff review, and a potential CSO contract for SIWA. With technical assistance from the
ADB, another important reform is the improvement of the regulatory environment and its
coverage. A third outcome sought by the government through the EFRP is that the SOEs should
operate in an increasingly transparent and commercial manner. The objective of greater
transparency is to be achieved through a number of actions. All SOEs are to submit annual
statements of corporate objectives and report on how well the objectives from the previous year

20
     The full range of SOE reforms is summarized in the EFRP Matrix in Annex 4.


                                                        25
were met. All SOEs are to submit financial statements within 3 months of the closing of each
financial year and audited statements within 6 months of the next financial year. Audited
financial accounts are to be made available to the public in line with SOE Act and made
available on the MOFT website. In addition, new appointments to SOE Boards are to be made in
accordance with the regulations under the SOE Act. These actions will help provide the
government and its SOEs with the information and motivation needed to begin improving the
quality and coverage of public services over the medium-term on a commercial basis.

84.     Focus of Proposed Operation. The proposed DPG-1 supports one policy action that is
critical to the service delivery objective. Specifically, the government will have adopted a
Community Service Obligation policy for State Owned Enterprises in order to reduce the need
for internal cross-subsidization of low income clients and will back this policy with an adequate
budgetary allocation. In fact, the policy was adopted by the Cabinet in September 2011,
budgetary allocations were included in the 2011 and 2012 budgets, and the first CSO contract
was signed (with SIEA) in October 2011.

Improving Extractive Revenue Transparency

85.     Current situation and challenges. The mining sector is likely to play a key role in the
future of the Solomon Island economy. In particular, mining is expected to replace forestry as
Solomon Islands main source of export earnings as early as 2013. Yet, local economic benefits
may be limited unless SIG can effectively develop and enforce tax and benefit-sharing regimes.
Perceptions among the local communities directly affected by mining operations have been, and
will remain, especially important in this regard. Success will be more likely if institutional and
policy settings are strengthened in the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Rural Electrification and in
the Inland Revenue Department of MOFT.

86.    Prior to the civil unrest, Solomon Islands hosted the Gold Ridge mine on the island of
Guadalcanal. This was a medium scale privately-owned gold mine producing approximately
100,000 ounces of gold per year. The mine operated only a short while before it was forced to
cease operations during the conflict. It remained closed until it was reopened under new
ownership in 2009 and had first production in 2011. The new operation is expected to export
125,000 ounces, worth around US$120 million, annually.

87.     The Government holds high expectations that the Gold Ridge Mine will be a major
contributor to the economy. However, significant tax revenues from the mine are unlikely in the
first 5 years of production as depreciation allowances are taken against capital investments. In
the short term, mining is nonetheless likely to play an important role in the economy, particularly
in terms of balance of payments support through gold exports as logging exports decline.
Eventually the mine will become a significant tax payer after a capital recovery period of
approximately five years.

88.     In addition to gold mining there are significant other possible future mineral development
opportunities. Recent mineral exploration has identified a number of new and interesting mineral
targets for possible future development including nickel on Choisel and Santa Isabel islands and
copper and gold on Guadalcanal, Vella Lavella and New Georgia islands. In addition, the seabed




                                                26
surrounding the Solomon Islands contains mineral deposits which are high in copper, gold and
zinc.

89.     There is significant potential for development of a nickel mine in Santa Isabel which
could export as much as 30,000 tons of nickel, currently valued at US$460 million, per year, and
applications were lodged in September 2011. Development of nickel will be highly capital
intensive and require significant infrastructure development in terms of roads and port facilities.
This project can only go forward after some ambiguities regarding licensing and community
concerns are resolved.

90.     The potential of the mineral industry to contribute to broad based economic growth will
only be realized if the sector is properly managed and integrated into the local economy. The
mining industry typically operates as a capital intensive enclave and does not directly create
many jobs. At the same time, if the benefits of the sector are to be maximized, it will be
necessary for private sector SMEs to be supported to develop the capacity to provide goods and
services to the mining sector in order to spread the benefits of the sector more broadly through
the economy. The principal benefits of the sector are its capacity to contribute substantially to
exports and Government revenue. However this will only contribute beneficially to achieving
government objectives if mineral revenue agreements are fair and managed transparently and
utilized effectively.

91.     The principal risk of the mining sector in such a small economy is that, if it is not
properly regulated and managed, then it can result in social, cultural and environmental harm to
affected communities and can become a vector for corruption that could become a flashpoint for
future conflict. Mitigating this risk and minimizing the capture of rents is a key challenge.

92.      The experience with logging provides significant lessons for management of mining
sector benefit streams. There is a widely held perception within the Government and citizenry
that the logging industry has not contributed any significant positive development legacy with
little lasting benefit accruing to either local communities or the State. Management of
community benefit streams from logging has in general been very poor, often corrupt, and a
source of tensions. The experience from the Gold Ridge mine immediately prior to the tensions
was similar, with strong feelings on the part of the local community that most of the benefits
were accruing to people other than themselves.

93.     Given both the potential benefits and significant risks associated with mining sector
presence, there has been strong demand from government, RAMSI, and AusAID, as key
partners, for World Bank to assist both the government and mining impacted communities to
avoid the traps experienced in the logging sector and increase transparency and accountability in
the mining sector. The Government, with support from both RAMSI and the World Bank, is
currently pursuing the adoption of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
principles and seeks to become a candidate EITI country to ensure that the revenues from mining
are managed and distributed in a transparent manner. The British High Commission provided
support for EITI outreach and knowledge work. The World Bank is also supporting civil society
capacity building to increase understanding of benefits sharing mechanisms and their role in
EITI. Civil society will participate in EITI through a Multi-Stakeholder Group (MSG), along
with representatives from government and mining companies. The MSG will prepare a work


                                                27
plan for implementing EITI; this is one of the last steps required for the country to become an
EITI candidate. The work plan will be the basis for the government to receive grant support for
the implementation of the EITI. The implementation grant will be provided under the EITI multi-
donor trust fund, managed by the World Bank.

94.     In addition to adopting the EITI, the framework for mining sector management needs to
be strengthened.21 There is no sector strategy document guiding mining sector development or
defined benefit sharing arrangements with landowners and local communities. A Mining Act
was passed in 1990 and can be described as a piece of framework legislation which anticipated
the development of regulations to give effect to due process under the law. These regulations
have never been drafted, and as a result, much is left to discretion in terms of licensing and
regulatory actions in the sector. This has contributed to confusion and conflict between the
Government and the private sector and has acted as a disincentive to mineral exploration
investment. The World Bank is providing, as a first phase of its assistance to the government in
the sector, support in identifying and addressing the policy gaps related to the legal and
regulatory regime of the mining sector. Focus policy areas will include licensing, environmental,
social, fiscal and institutional aspects. In a second phase, support for implementation of the
strategies identified in the first phase will be provided.

95.     Outcomes and actions. The government seeks two main outcomes related to extractive
revenue transparency under the EFRP. The first is to strengthen the regulatory framework
controlling the mining sector, with special emphasis on the fiscal regime. This will be achieved
by submitting revised mining fiscal legislation to Parliament. This effort will be informed by
recent technical assistance provided by the IMF and planned assistance from the World Bank.
The second objective will be to work with the government, mining companies and the affected
local communities to devise mechanisms for more transparent reporting of mining revenues.
This will be especially important to the benefits sharing arrangements for the local communities.
This objective will be facilitated by the institutional strengthening and technical assistance to
improve the legal and regulatory framework of the mining sector that the World Bank is
supporting and by the country‘s participation in EITI. To this end, the government will form a
multi-stakeholder group to implement the various steps required by the EITI process for the
country to become an EITI compliant country.

96.      Focus of Proposed Operation. The proposed DPG-1 supports one policy action that is
critical to the objective of extractive revenue transparency; namely, that an EITI policy paper
would be approved by the Cabinet and publicly announced. This policy action was realized in
July 2011 in the form of a Cabinet decision to endorse the implementation of EITI principles and
a commitment to work meaningfully towards revenue transparency, in collaboration with civil
society organizations and mining companies. The action was completed in August 2011
following an unequivocal public statement made by SIG. It is an important prerequisite for the
work ahead.




21
   The development of a world class regulatory framework is inadequate to ensure compliance. An appropriate and
well coordinated institutional framework and personnel with capacity to implement the regulatory framework across
a range of Ministries and agencies of Government must also be developed and in place.


                                                       28
                            Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Ownership: Reinforce country ownership. All of the prior actions for DPG-1 are consistent with the government‘s own NDS.
Ownership is routinely validated during the pre-appraisal and appraisal phases.
Harmonization: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability framework.
This is achieved through the CEWG EFRP matrix, jointly negotiated and agreed on an annual cycle (See Section IV.D above).
Customization: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances. This is
achieved in the broad sense through consistency with the NDS. The framework is also reviewed and revised annually, in
response to evolving circumstances.
Criticality: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement. The number of donor benchmarks
was 17 in 2009 and 19 for 2010/11, of which 5 were selected for the DPG-1. Further efforts to consolidate the EFRP matrix on
the basis of criticality will be pursued.

Transparency and predictability: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support. The EFRP matrix provides a pre-established and harmonized framework for the evaluation of performance
through specific baselines and outcomes.


                                 C. PRIOR ACTIONS FOR THE PROPOSED DPG-1

97.    The proposed DPG-1 will support selected reforms in the government‘s program
described in Section V.B above and that are deemed essential to its successful implementation.
The rationale for their selection has been discussed in the previous section, namely their
importance to the program and expressed government commitment and feasibility. This list is
aligned with the government‘s overall NDS program and the EFRP matrix of the CEWG (Annex
4). Compliance with these prior actions as defined in the Financial Agreement forms the basis
for IDA to proceed with the proposed operation. Table 4 presents a summary of the prior actions
and their status of implementation as formulated in collaboration with the government.

98.     The introduction of consultations with line ministries, backed by the introduction of
expenditure briefs for the first time, will help better align budget allocations with program needs.
The quality of budget execution will be improved by tightening payroll expenditure controls and
by introducing more transparency into procurement outcomes. The degree of transparency and
accountability for procurement outcomes will increase through the publication of procurement
tenders. The adoption of a Community Service Obligation policy for SOEs will prepare the
ground for improvements in financial viability and thus also improve the prospects for better
service delivery. The degree of extractive revenue transparency will be put on the path to
improvement as the government takes the first steps towards meeting EITI criteria, beginning
with the adoption of a policy paper announcing government intentions in this regard.

                                       Table 4: Prior Actions for DPG-1
Development Objective One: Improve Public Financial Management
(1) Introduced the use of ministerial expenditure analysis briefs into the annual budget process from 2012, providing
    information on the level and composition of budgeted and actual expenditures.
(2) Issued separate accounting warrants on April 19, 2011 for each ministry in order to strengthen payroll expenditure control.
(3) Published successful tenders awarded by the Central Tender Board, including the name of bidder and amount of bid.

Development Objective Two: Improve the Management of Key State Owned Enterprises
(4) Adopted a Community Service Obligation policy for State Owned Enterprises on June 9, 2011, with a budgetary allocation
    in 2011.

Development Objective Three: Improve Extractive Revenue Transparency
(5) Endorsed an EITI policy paper on July 6, 2011 proposing the implementation of EITI principles and commitment to work
    with civil society organizations and extractive industry companies in the Solomon Islands, with an accompanying public
    statement dated August 26, 2011.


            D. INDICATIVE TRIGGERS FOR THE NEXT DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION

99.    It is expected that a second programmatic development policy operation will follow the
proposed grant. The broad policy areas set out under the first operation will be maintained in the
second, subject to emerging issues and risks. The specific policy action triggers are described
below.

100. The quality of budget formation will be improved in 2011/12 through three key policy
actions supported by the proposed second development policy grant: i) the government will give
visibility to the new consultative role in budget formation for civil society organizations and
provincial leaders by publishing an annual report of their consultations; ii) the design of a new
chart of accounts will be adopted so that expenditures can be planned and tracked by programs
and activities; and iii) a more consultative budget process will be adopted in order to better align
budgetary allocations with what line ministries need to achieve their objectives. The government
will lay the groundwork for improvements in the quality of budget execution by endorsing policy
changes that will guide the ensuing revision of the legal and regulatory framework governing
public expenditures. An additional trigger aims to improve capacity in procurement
administration, regulation and monitoring through the creation of a new procurement branch
within the Treasury. Deeper SOE reforms are also planned, starting with the reduction of SIWA
debts to SIEA in 2012. Further progress towards entry into the EITI through completion of an
application for candidate status, will be another step towards strengthening extractive revenue
transparency.




                                                              30
                Table 5: Indicative Triggers for Next Development Policy Operation
                            Development Objective One: Improve Public Financial Management

(1) Publish a summary of the consultations with civil society organizations that occurred in preparing the 2012 budget and solicit
    similar consultations in the formation of the 2013 budget.

(2) Adopt a new chart of accounts to plan and track expenditures by programs and activities.

(3) To assess the full content of individual ministry spending proposals for the recurrent and development budgets, adopt formal
    consultation mechanisms between central agencies and line ministries as part of the budget formation process.

(4) Cabinet endorses policy positions consistent with sound Public Financial Management principles, to be incorporated in a new
    Act, including the requirement that all budgets and budgetary variations are fully funded.

(5) Create and begin staffing a dedicated procurement branch within the Treasury including dedicated units for policy and
    training, tender support, and operational procurement.

                 Development Objective Two: Improve the Management of Key State Owned Enterprises

(6) SIEA and SIWA, in collaboration with MOFT, agree on a mechanism for the reduction of SIWA‘s debts to SIEA.

                         Development Objective Three: Improve Extractive Revenue Transparency

(7) An application for candidate status to EITI international secretariat is completed.


101. The Bank‘s decision to proceed with the second grant in the proposed series will be
informed by the degree of progress towards, or completion of, the indicative triggers listed in
Table 5. The choice of triggers for the second operation is informed by preliminary CEWG
discussions regarding the 2011/12 EFRP matrix, lessons learned from previous operations, the
selection of other binding benchmarks by the ADB and EC, and recent analytical work (notably
the FY10 Sources of Growth analysis and the FY11 PER).

                             VI.        OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
                                                A. PARTICIPATION PROCESS

102. The design of the proposed programmatic series draws from the EFRP which, in turn,
draws from elements of the NDS. The NDS benefited from stakeholder consultations conducted
by MDPAC on behalf of the government as part of the preparation process. The consultations
included cabinet ministers, parliamentarians, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), members
of civil society, the private sector, cooperative associations, local authorities, religious leaders,
development partners and beneficiary groups.

                                            B. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

103. The measures supported by the proposed programmatic series of development policy
grants are expected to have significant positive direct and indirect impacts on poverty reduction.
No adverse social or poverty impacts are expected from the actions supported by the proposed
series of grants.




                                                                 31
104. Improving the coverage and quality of public services is often a key to reducing poverty
and vulnerability to conflict. The proposed programmatic series will pursue this strategy through
two channels: the direct provision of public services by government ministries and the provision
of key utility services through SOEs.

105. Strengthening the budget formation process is expected to lead to a better alignment
between the NDS, budgetary requirements, and budgetary allocations. Improving the quality of
budget execution should help ensure that the newly aligned budget is well implemented and
leakages to unproductive uses are reduced. These changes should gradually facilitate the
coverage and quality of public service delivery throughout the Solomon Islands. The new
consultative role created for citizens groups and provincial leaders, combined with the new
provisions for greater transparency are expected to be especially helpful in motivating better
results.

106. With regard to the utility services, economic growth and poverty reduction should be
promoted through better financial management promoted in part through the adoption of CSO
agreements and improved financial viability as outlined in Section V.B.

107. The actions proposed for the mining sector will facilitate poverty reduction indirectly
through the promotion of a fiscal regime that clarifies revenue sharing obligations and creates
more transparency in the receipt and distribution of mining sector revenues. These outcomes, in
turn, are expected to increase the resources available to the government, and to local mining
affected communities, for poverty reducing programs and activities. In addition, improved
transparency reduces the vulnerability to conflict associated with mining.

                                  C. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

108. The specific actions supported by the proposed programmatic series of development
policy operations are not likely to have significant positive or negative effects on the Solomon
Islands environment, forests or other natural resources. Specifically, the measures supported by
the proposed operation to improve the quality of budget formation and execution, improve the
transparency and accountability of SOEs, and improve mining sector governance are not
expected to have a negative effect on the country‘s environment and natural resources.

                     D. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

109. The administration of this operation will be the responsibility of MOFT while monitoring
and evaluation is done jointly with the donors under the CEWG. The MOFT Financial and
Economic Development Unit (FEDU) is the main office responsible for monitoring the program
and all outcome indicators (detailed in Annex 3). FEDU will provide quarterly reports to the
World Bank and other CEWG budget support partners on implementation progress measured
against established timetables and agreed performance indicators. This will be done as part of
the reporting process established earlier for the CEWG. The overall reform effort will be
reviewed by the government in close coordination with the World Bank‘s in-country office and
regular Bank missions to ensure continued implementation of the program within an adequate
macroeconomic policy framework.



                                               32
110. The elements of the EFRP matrix are shown in Annex 4. It captures all the benchmarks
from the budget support programs of each budget support partner as they were set out in early
2012 as well as a number of intermediate non-binding actions. Future versions of the EFRP
matrix will also contain a number of output or outcome indicators. These indicators will help the
authorities and the donor partners evaluate the impact of the government program.

                                      E. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

111. Fiduciary risks have decreased markedly over the last several years as the result of a wide
ranging program of reforms from 2003 onward, backed by RAMSI and other key donors. This
reform effort is expected to continue and deepen over the next several years. Even so, fiduciary
risks remain substantial. Key documents for issues related to the fiduciary aspects of public
resource management include the Solomon Islands Public Financial Management Performance
Report (EC, 2008), the Solomon Islands Operational Procurement Review (IDA, 2008), the
Financial and Economic Management Strengthening Program (RAMSI, 2010), and the Public
Expenditure Review (IDA, 2011).

112. To address the issues raised in these reports, the government embarked on a wide ranging
series of reforms beginning with the Financial Management Strengthening Program (FMSP) and
separate assistance provided to the Solomon Islands Customs and Excise Division (SICED),
Inland Revenue Division (IRD) and Ministry of Planning and Aid Coordination (MDPAC).
Assistance to these agencies was converted into a cohesive and coordinated program of
assistance under the FEMSP beginning in late 2010. These efforts have been and will be
supported by the technical assistance and advisors from RAMSI through 2013. Additional
assistance for fiscal responsibility legislation will be provided by the Department of Finance and
Deregulation in Canberra and by the IMF. The World Bank will provide assistance to improve
the quality of mining sector governance and strengthening the analysis of line ministries‘
expenditure. ADB has supported SOE reforms including the preparation and audit of financial
statements, secured transactions work, and the preparation of legislation. Assistance in revising
National Provident Fund legislation is expected from the IMF.

113. An IMF Safeguards Assessment was completed in October 2010. As a signal of its
commitment to implementing safeguard measures, two new program benchmarks were added: (i)
fully constituting the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) Board by end-December 2010 to
improve oversight of central bank operations; and (ii) publishing the opinion rendered by an
international audit firm on the CBSI audit results and the International Financial Reporting
Standards-based financial statements, beginning with the 2010 accounts by end-June 2011 to
increase overall transparency. The CBSI has also incorporated the recommended changes in
computing reserve money, in order to standardize the reporting of NDA of the CBSI under the
IMF-supported program. Good progress has been made in implementing the recommendations
of the Assessment. The CBSI Board has been fully constituted, thereby strengthening its
oversight of central bank operation. The authorities are preparing to publish the opinion rendered
by an international audit firm on the CBSI audit results and the IFRS-based financial statements
in order to increase overall transparency.

114. Overall, the Bank has judged the government‘s commitment to the PFM improvements
and its performance in implementing the PFM reform program as showing adequate


                                               33
improvement. In this light, additional fiduciary arrangements beyond those already included in
the EFRP and FEMSP are not considered necessary for this operation.

                                F. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

115. The operation would consist of a single tranche of SDR 1.3 million (US$2 million
equivalent) to be available upon effectiveness. The proposed operation will follow IDA's
disbursement procedures for development policy grants. Once the operation becomes effective,
and at the request of the Borrower, the proceeds will be deposited by IDA into a dedicated
government account at the CBSI which forms part of the country‘s foreign exchange reserves.
As a due diligence measure, within 30 days of receipt the Borrower will provide a written
confirmation to IDA when the amount has been transferred to a local currency account available
to finance budgeted expenditures. Disbursement would not be linked to specific purchases. The
proceeds of the operation would not be used to finance expenditures excluded under the
Agreement. If, after being deposited in a government account, the proceeds of the operation are
used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the
Borrower to either: (a) apply the corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refund the
amount directly to IDA. No designated account is required for this operation.

116. The Bank will request an audit of the receipt of the disbursement through the deposit
account and into the budget management system of the Borrower. The financial audit report
should be furnished to the Bank within 6 months from the last disbursement. In that event the
Borrower would i) report the exact sum received into the deposit account and its supporting
details; ii) indicate to the Bank details of the consolidated fund bank account to which the
equivalent of the disbursement proceeds would have been transferred; and iii) submit a report on
receipts and disbursements for both the deposit account and the consolidated fund account to
enable IDA to review consistency of the withdrawal with the development financing agreement
and achievement of the objectives of the operation.

                                G. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

117. One of the key strengths of the proposed DPG-1 is that is explicitly grounded in a
government driven process that sets out a reform agenda for support from the donor partners
through the Core Economic Working Group (CEWG), a proven coordination mechanism
involving key government and donor interlocutors. As there was no forum for Government-
donor dialogue or even regular contact between ministers and donors prior to the establishment
of the CEWG, the forum is credited with having created communication, discussion, and
dialogue between Government and donors where none previously existed. The resulting reform
program is laid out in the Economic and Financial Reform Program (EFRP) matrix, which is
developed by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) based on its ongoing reform
program and Government policy, in consultation with donor partners through CEWG. This
process is led by Solomon Islands Government (SIG) and culminates with in the formal adoption
of the EFRP matrix by the Cabinet.




                                              34
Program Ownership

118. Program ownership is potentially subject to some political risk given frequent changes in
governments in Solomon Islands. There are no truly institutionalized political parties, which
leads to weak coalitions of individuals forming government. The average lifespan of such
governments, thus far, has been roughly 2.5 years (with a maximum of 4 years) and the average
time in office for a Minister of Finance has been 1.5 years although several have lasted as long as
3 to 4 years.

119. The experience of the last three years has, however, demonstrated that a well-articulated
program of policy and technical reforms can be sustained through periods of political uncertainty
and changes in ministerial leadership. There have been no major setbacks or slowing of the
reform program in these three years despite the fact that there have been several changes in the
Minister of Finance, changes in government, and elections. This is due to several factors. First,
many of the key political leaders and senior bureaucratic officials remain in government even if
their portfolios are altered with successive changes in government. Second, within this group,
there is a high level recognition of the need for reform. Each Minister of Finance has been
supportive of the reform agenda and, as the reforms have begun to yield results, the degree of
commitment has deepened significantly across a range of political actors. Third, the
establishment of the CEWG mechanism has led to a coherent, coordinated, and consistent
approach by donors. The CEWG as a coordination group, and the EFRP matrix as a tool for
articulating reform, are now in their third year.

Macroeconomic Shocks

120. The macroeconomic and fiscal framework is subject to considerable risks inherent in a
small, isolated and geographically dispersed and largely subsistence economy with a small and
semi-literate population. Exogenous shocks include volatile commodity prices (for logging, gold,
smallholder cash crop exports and energy imports), as well as weather and seismic events. The
very high rates of logging in 2010 and 2011 add to the risk of exhaustion of the Solomon Islands‘
main export crop and a key revenue source for government. High among induced shocks is the
risk that under-analyzed policy decisions made amidst political fragility or weak budgetary
institutions will have significant ongoing fiscal costs.

121. The risks created by such shocks to macroeconomic stability and NDS implementation
are mitigated by successful government action to build up external and internal buffer stocks as
part of dialogue with the IMF, the World Bank and the multi-donor budget support donors on
macroeconomic policies and the reform program over the last three years. The Bank will
continue to monitor the impact of global economic shocks and assess the need for further
support. Both the World Bank supported Rapid Employment Project and Rural Development
Program are community based programs, in urban and rural areas respectively, which could be
ramped up if need be as part of a response to economic shock.




                                                35
Social Instability

122. There is some risk of a resurgence of popular unrest in one form or the other. Continuing
inter-island migration, the breakdown of the tradition 'kastom' systems, including the traditional
social safety nets and continued poor service delivery all pose a risk to stability. Further,
demographic change and change in the use of resources will heighten the risk. The risk may be
especially high in Honiara where food poverty is high and urban services are inadequate.

123. This risk is being addressed by the government on many fronts ranging from security to
state building to public service provision, with assistance from RAMSI, the United Nations
Development Program, and a number of key donors including the ADB, AusAID, the EC, and
NZAID. The World Bank Justice for the Poor program is aimed squarely at better understanding
this risk. It focuses on improved public sector management at the local level where traditional
and outside legal systems intersect. The proposed DPG with its emphasis on public sector
effectiveness and accountability will augment these efforts by helping to improve service
delivery outcomes, in turn contributing to political stabilization.

Institutional Capacity

124. Weak institutional capacity could hamper the implementation of the reforms supported
by the proposed operation and the broader National Development Strategy. Capacity constraints
abound as a natural consequence of a small, widely dispersed population and short institutional
history. Four specific weaknesses noted in recent analytical work include inadequate
participation in the budget process, weak articulation of measurable goals and capacity to
monitor progress, poor budget execution, the quality and timeliness of financial reports, and a
low capacity for producing and following up on external audits.

125. These risks are mitigated by the choice and design of the supported measures which are
calibrated to existing capacity, the provision of extensive technical assistance by the Regional
Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the World Bank and other donors through
ongoing or planned projects supporting the key ministries responsible for policing, justice,
prisons, public finance, health, education, and infrastructure.

Strategic Partnerships

126. RAMSI is being progressively scaled back with expectation that its advisory presence in
2013 will be roughly one third of its size in 2009 while maintaining its security presence. At the
same time, it is expected that more traditional development assistance from AusAID, NZAP and
other donors will gradually be increased. Overall aid levels are not expected to go down. This
change in modality creates some short-term coordination risks but it also creates an opportunity
for the government to collaborate with the international community through the CEWG process
on how a long-term aid program could best serve the population – including elements of
assistance aimed at reducing fragility, encouraging growth and job creation, and building
government capacity.
