Some lessons learned included:\n            successful project take-off and implementation require\n            strong initial support to the management in the form of\n            project facilitation training (PFT) and supervision missions\n            early in the life of the project. The absence of these\n            support activities for the NSQP led to considerable delays\n            in recruitment of technical assistance staff and\n            commencement of procurement delays in appointments of\n            consultants and procurements of goods and services\n            substantially reduce the potential contribution of these\n            facilities to project implementation and impact - many of\n            the civil works projects were uncompleted, equipment were\n            either not yet installed or required to be connected to\n            utilities to become functional, and some of the training\n            that should have been provided by the consultants on various\n            equipment was lost.
