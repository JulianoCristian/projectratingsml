The main\n            objective is to support the national goal of increasing\n            agricultural production and farm income by ensuring\n            production and distribution of good quality seed of selected\n            varieties.  In particular, the project will assist in the\n            formulation of a national strategy for the following : a)\n            institutional reform leading to changes in the roles and\n            responsibilities of the public sector; b) accelerating the\n            development of seed programs; c) pricing of seed; d)\n            improving effectiveness of seed certification; and e)\n            improving quality control operations.  The National Seed and\n            Quarantine Project will be comprised of the following 7\n            components : 1) institutional reform of public sector\n            agencies operating in the seed subsector; 2) strengthening\n            variety testing, registration and release programs; 3)\n            support for production, processing, and storage of breeder,\n            foundation and certified seed; 4) expansion and\n            strengthening of seed certification and quality control\n            operations; 5) human resource development through training\n            in key activities related to the seed industry; 6) provision\n            of working capital to finance breeder and foundation seed\n            operations, and funds to maintain strategic reserves of\n            these seed categories; and 7) strengthening of the PQS\n            through reorganization and improved management supported by\n            technical assistance, facilities improvements, and human\n            resource development."}, "docdt": "1989-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
