REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON THE PROPOSED
TARBELA DEVELOPMENT FUND (SUPPLEMENTAL) AGREEMENT 1975
AND ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE
TARBELA DAM PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on the proposed
Tarbela Development Fund (Supplemental) Agreement 1975, and on a proposed
credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent of US$8,000,000
on standard IDA terms to help finance the cost of repairs and additional
remedial works necessitated by the damage incurred during the first filling
of the Tarbela reservoir.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Current Economic Situation and
Issues in Pakistan" (658-PAK, dated March 28, 1975) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on April 11, 1975. Country data sheets are attached
as Annex I.
3.        The economy of Pakistan (then West Pakistan) expanded at an
average annual rate of more than- 6%0 during the decade of the 1960 's. In
the Second Plan period (1960-65) this growth was spearheaded by industrial
growth of 13%o per annum. During the Third Plan (1965-70) agricultural out-
put grew at 5.6°% annually with the aid of new high-yielding wheat and rice
varieties, compared with less than 4%0 in the first half of the decade, but
the industrial growth rate fell to 7.6%0. During the 1970's, however, the
growth rate has been considerably lower.   During fiscal years 1970/71 and
1971/72, there was virtually no change in total output as political uncer-
tainties and the conflicts culminating in the separation and independence
of East Pakistan resulted in a decline in industrial activity, while
drought virtually halted agricultural growth. Since the return of civil-
ian rule in late December 1971, growth has been fairly modest. After
two years without growth, the GNP grew by 7%O in 1972/73, but the in-
crease declined to 5%0 in 1973/74 and in 1974/75 it was probably less
than 3.5%'. The industrial expansion was the result primarily of fuller
utilization of capacity.
4.        In FY1975, Pakistan has suffered a series of setbacks.   These
have included much larger than anticipated wheat import requirements, a
deterioration of about 15%O in the terms of trade and damage during the
first filling of the Tarbela reservoir that will delay the availability
of its water for irrigation by one year (until about December 1975), and
for power generation by 7 or 8 months (to October/November 1976). However,



- 2 -
there have also been important positive developments, including an accel-
eration of public sector i.nvestment, some upturn in large-scale private
investment, growing economic ties with, and capital flows from, the
Middle East oil-producing countries, the reopening of transport, postal
and limited trade ties with India, and prospects for a slowdown in world
and domestic inflation.
5.        In 1974/75 the output of the major agricultural crops may have
declined by 3%o or more owing to lack of water. River flows during the
1974 summer crop season were the lowest in the past 90 years and fall
and early winter canal supplies were only 40%O to 50%O of normal.  Agri-
cultural prospects for 1975/76 depend heavily upon ample Canal water in
the spring and summer and adequate rains this fall.   To encourage agri-
cultural production in the longer run, farm prices must be adjusted so
that farmers receive higher (closer to world market) prices for their
cotton, wheat, rice and other products. The government in late 1974
lowered agricultural export duties and in early 1975 announced higher
procurement prices and higher prices to consumers, but further changes
in this direction are needed to rationalize the price structure. Other
government programs which should encourage agricultural growth are those
to improve seeds and cultural practices, to provide more power for tube-
well water supplies and to reduce water-logging and salinity.   With
the increasing desire of small and medium-scale farmers to participate
in the "green revolution", agricultural growth in the next five years
could equal the 5.6%O annual rate of the 1965/70 Third Plan period if
appropriate government pricing and other policies and programs are
followed. When water from the Tarbela reservoir becomes available
in the closing months of 1975, this will substantially increase the
acreage irrigated in the winter seaison.
6.        Domestic savings rates have declined steadily since 1969/70.
In 1973/74, public saving was slightly negative and private savings
were less than 8% of GDP. This compared with 1%O' and 12%o', respectively,
in 1969/70. In 1974/75 the budgetary deficit on current account deteri-
orated further. Public saving will have to be substantially increased
if a satisfactory rate of growth in the future is to be maintained and
excessive reliance on external borrowing avoided. In recent months, the
government has taken sorne significant steps to reduce subsidies, restrain
other non-development expenditures, and to increase revenues from Govern-
ment enterprises. These have included substantially higher prices for
wheat, vegetable ghee and sugar, a doubling of the price of natural gas,
and higher electric power and petroleum product prices.
7.        After more than a decade during which prices rarely rose more
than 2-3%a annually, Pakistan has been experiencing price increases of
20%0' to 30%O annually since early 1972. Since mid-1973 the growth of the



- 3 -
money supply has been limited to about 14°o annually by monetary and
fiscal restraint. At the same time (late 1973) that these restraints
began to curb domestic inflation, however, international prices began
to increase sharply.   The dollar prices of imports rose by 37% in
1973/74 and by a further 22°o in 1974/75.   Dollar export prices rose
47°o in 1973/74, but only 4°o in 1974/75.  With the presently lower
rates of international inflation, however, the rate of price increase
in Pakistan will probably decline in the coming months.
8.        The deterioration in Pakistan's balance of payments resulting
from increased imports, particularly of wheat, and the adverse changes
in the terms of trade, are reflected in an increase in the current
account deficit plus debt repayment from US$191 million in 1972/73 to
US$608 million in 1973/74 and an estimated US$1,027 million in 1974/75.
The deficit in 1974/75 has been financed principally by inflows from
the Pakistan Consortium and from OPEC countries. The resource flows
from these sources enabled Pakistan to finance its balance of payments
deficit in 1974/75 with only about US$90 million of short-term borrow-
ing and some draw-down of net reserves. Pakistan's external aid re-
quirement is expected to be somewhat higher in 1975/76, Indications
of aid at the May 1975 meeting of the Pakistan Consortium were signi-
ficantly higher than in the previous year and, combined with expecta-
tions of assistance from OPEC countries and other sources, suggest
that long-term capital receipts may be sufficient to limit resort to
new short-term credits in FY76. In subsequent years, rising agricul-
tural, fertilizer and other domestic production should moderate the
increase in trade deficits, but the balance of payments situation
will be aggravated by rising debt amortization payments, particu-
larly after the end of the debt-relief period in June 1978.
9.        Pakistan's external public debt at the end of June 1975
amounted to about US$5.3 billion equivalent, of which US$1.2 billion
were undisbursed. At present Pakistan's debt service problem has
been eased by the arrangement concluded in June 1974 whereby coun-
tries participating in the Pakistan Consortium agreed to provide
US$650 million equivalent in debt relief over four years. However,
the sharply increased borrowing that has been undertaken during
the past two years is a cause for concern. If Pakistan continues
to finance its investment through foreign sources to a very sub-
stantial degree and exports grow at the modest pace of the past
two years, by the end of the decade debt service could absorb a
large proportion of foreign exchange earnings. In FY75 the debt
service ratio was 16%; this could rise to 21%o by 1980. It is,
therefore, imperative that the government accelerate its efforts
to raise domestic savings and exports. Including undisbursed
balances, Pakistan's debt to the Bank and IDA now represents



- 4 -
about 16%o of its external public indebtedness; by 1980 this ratio would
fall to about 113%. The share of the Bank Group in total debt service
(after taking account of the debt relief which Pakistan will receive
from other creditors) is now about 235o, but is expected to decrease
to about 9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
10.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclu-
sive of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the
former East Pakistan) now amcunts to approximately US$1.2 billion.     During
its long association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in
almost all sectors of the economy.    Through FY75, 42%U of total commitments
were for public services, 25°% for agriculture, 22%O for industry, 10%o for
industrial imports and l1% foi education. Lending for public services has
amounted to nearly US$500 million and has included loans and credits for
railways, electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, telecom-
munications and water supplies. A large part of past lending for agricul-
ture was for Indus Basin projects. The lending for industry has been mainly
through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC).
For most projects for which loans and credits are being disbursed, construc-
tion is now going ahead satisfactorily. The principal problems being en-
countered are that the rates charged by some of the public services have
not kept pace with inflation and, hence, some utilities are not earning
the return which they need. Furthermore, some institutions have financial
problems arising from the loss of assets in the former East Pakistan. These
problems are the subject of current discussions between the Bank and the Gov-
ernment.  Annex II contains El summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
as of May 31, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
11.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.     One
of these is to support the directly-productive sectors of the economy, to
increase production of import-substitutes such as foodgrains, edible oils,
fertilizer and engineering and capital goods and to sustain export growth
in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial
and agricultural products. The main part of Bank Group assistance for
industry will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as
PICIC, the Industrial'Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and the National
Developrient Finance Corporation (NDFC) which provides finance primarily
for industries in the public sector. The most important part of future
lending for agriculture is expected to be for the Government's new program
to increase productivity in l:he Indus Basin by controlling salinity and



- 5 -
improving the utilization of surface irrigation and groundwater. The
Government has requested the Bank to be the Executing Agency for a UNDP
technical assistance grant for improving agriculture and water planning
in the Indus Basin.
12.       Another objective is to continue to improve the institutions
which are responsible for the principal public services which have ben-
efitted from Bank Group lending in the past, namely, Telegraph and
Telephone Department, Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA),
Pakistan Railways, and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company. In most
of these, institutional improvements are being made with technical
assistance financed by the Bank Group.
13.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other
fields, particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to
bring economic development to the poorest strata of the population.
This proposed shift, which implies increased lending for agriculture
and rural development, will be accompanied by significant lending for
projects complementary to the massive Indus/Tarbela works. This may
involve both large drainage projects and smaller-scale, more staff-
intensive projects throughout the sector and the country. Although
not yet reflected in the record of loans and credits approved, this
shift has, in fact, already occurred in terms of staff time devoted
to the preparation of projects in rural development, livestock and
forestry. The Government is giving increasing attention to rural
development and the Bank has sent a number of missions to discuss
the rural development program and to assist both the Federal and
Provincial Governments to formulate specific proposals and to pre-
pare a project for Bank Group financing. However, the implementa-
tion of the rural development program is still in the early stage,
and is largely dependent upon the initiative of the Provinces.
14.       At the Government's request, Bank missions have been working
with municipal authorities on the plans for the urban development of
Karachi, whose population now exceeds 4 million. A Karachi master
plan was recently completed with the assistance of consultants financed
by UNDP, and urban projects are being developed within the framework of
this plan. In view of the preparatory work which has already been done
on urbanization problems of Karachi, there are good prospects for worth-
while participation by the Bank Group in this area, beginning with a
project in the Lyari section of the city within a year. The Govern-
ment has also asked the Bank to study urbanization problems in Lahore,
Pakistan's second largest city. Planning in Lahore is at a much earlier
stage than in Karachi and the immediate need is for technical assistance.
A mission to examine problems of urbanization and regional development of



- 6 -
smaller cities and on a country-wide basis visited Pakistan in March 1975
and a follow-up mission to identify specific projects is scheduled for
this fall.
15.       During this fiscal year, in addition to the credit now proposed,
I expect to present for your consideration credits for a seed project, an
irrigation and drainage project, a third education project and a second
water supply, drainage and sewerage project for Lahore, as well as a
loan for a power transmission project. All of these projects have been
appraised. Preparatory work is also well advanced on a loan for a fer-
tilizer project, in which IFC may also participate, and this, too, should
be ready for your consideration by the end of FY76.
16.       IFC has made nine investments in Pakistan for a total of US$28
million, of which US$20.7 million was by way of loans and US$7.3 rnillion
by equity participations. (These are shown in Annex II.) About US$11
million reimains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include
three in the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one
each in steel, cement ancl fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of
PICIC.
PART III - THE INDUS EIASIN AND TARBELA DEVELOPMENT FUND AGREEMENTS
The Indus Basin Developmefnt Fund Agreements
17.       The partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 resulted in
the border between India and Pakistan being drawn across the Indus river
system. Pakistan became the downstream riparian on all the tributaries,
and the division of the waters became a major international dispute.
18.       In the hopes of achieving a mutually acceptable solution, the
Bank offered its good offices to India and Pakistan in 1951. This offer
was accepted by both countries in 1952.
19.       In 1954 the Bank put forward a proposal for a settlement with
three basic features:
a.   The waters of the three Western rivers, the Indus, the
Jhelum and the Chenab, were to be allocated to Pakistan,
and the waters of the three Eastern rivers, the Ravi, the
Beas and the Sutlej, to India. The areas in Pakistan,
hitherto fed by the Eastern rivers, would in future be
fed by water to be transferred from the Western rivers
by means of a system of replacement works.
b.   India would make a contribution to the cost of the replace-
ment works.



- 7 -
c.   During construction of these works India would limit her
withdrawal from the Eastern rivers in step with Pakistan's
capacity to replace the waters used by India.
20.       In September 1960, after several years of negotiations in which
the Bank played a considerable role, India and Pakistan signed the Indus
Waters Treaty. Under the Treaty, after a Transition Period (which expired
on March 31, 1970) to allow for the construction of "replacement" works
(dams, barrages and link canals), it was agreed that India would have the
sole use of the waters of the Eastern Rivers and would make a contribution
to the cost of the replacement works, while Pakistan would have the use of
the waters of the Western Rivers.
21.       This solution of the dispute became feasible as the result of
the willingness of a number of countries and the Bank to provide substan-
tial financial assistance to supplement India's payment due under the terms
of the Indus Waters Treaty. Accordingly, the Indus Basin Development Fund
Agreement, 1960, was executed simultaneously with the signing of the Indus
Waters Treaty. This Agreement established an Indus Basin Development Fund
(the Indus Fund), with commitments from Australia, Canada, Germany, New
Zealand, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Bank to
contribute in grants and loans (including £ 62,060,000 to be provided by
India under the Indus Waters Treaty) the equivalent at that time of US$895
million. The Bank's contribution was a loan of US$90 million (US$80 mil-
lion as a contribution to the Indus Fund and US$10 million to meet inter-
est charges during construction) and it agreed to act as Administrator.
22.       The system of works originally consisted of the construction of
two large dams, one on the River Jhelum (Mangla) and another on the River
Indus (Tarbela), about 400 miles of new link canals, three major and two
minor barrages, the remodelling of three existing link canals, and a pro-
gram of tubewells and drainage. At that time the total cost of the system
was estimated at US$848 million equivalent.
23.       However, when some civil works contracts had been awarded, it
became apparent the funds committed would be insufficient to complete
the full program of works. After discussions among the Bank, the con-
tributing governments and Pakistan, a compromise was reached on a new
financing plan for a reduced system of works in which Mangla Dam, the
barrages and the link canals would be given priority and the tubewells
and drainage works would be omitted; any funds remaining in the Indus
Fund would be made available to Pakistan to finance the Tarbela Dam on
the Indus or another water development project, to be agreed by the
Bank and Pakistan after a study of the water and power sector in the
then West Pakistan.



- 8 -
24.       The new financing plan contemplated increased foreign exchange
contributions by the Contributors totalling US$315 million equivalent
(including US$58.5 million from IDA) on the understanding that Pakistan
would accept them as a final release of any obligations, moral or legal,
of the Contributors to finance the entire system of works provided for
in the 1960 Agreement. For its part, Pakistan agreed to provide all
future rupee requirements of the Indus Fund. The financing plan pro-
vided that any foreign exchange balance would be available for the
Tarbela Dam project, or some other water development project. These
arrangements were embodied in the Indus Basin Development Fund (Supple-
mental) Agreement, 1964.
25.       The study provided for in the Supplemental Agreement 1964 was
carried out by several firms of consulting engineers and a group of Bank
staff directed by Dr. Peter lieftinck, who was at that time an Executive
Director of the Bank. The study endorsed the high priority given to the
Tarbela Dam Project by Pakistan and confirmed that the project was not
only technically feasible but also economically justified either singly
or as part of a comprehensive development program.
The Tarbela Development Fund Agreement
26.       Discussions subsequently took place on various occasions within
the framework of the Pakistan Consortium to consider how the balance of
the funds for Tarbela might be provided to supplement the sum likely to
be available for transfer from the Indus Fund, then estimated at US$324
million. In March 1968, agreemeot was reached in principle on the terms
of the Tarbela Development Fund Agreement. In April 1968 the Executive
Directors approved a resolution authorizing the signature on behalf of
the Bank of the Tarbela Developmeht Fund Agreement whereby, inter alia,
the Bank would become Administrator of the Fund and would make a loan of
US$25 million. In May 1968, this agreement had been signed by all the
Parties and had come into force. In July 1968 the Executive Directors
approved the loan of US$25 million (Ln. 548-PAK). The other parties
agreed to make the following contributions:

*    Later increased to FF 167,000,000.
Pakistan agreed to provide to the Fund all rupees required to meet local
currency costs. The contributions of the Bank and the United States
were intended only as residual financing, which would be cancelled or
refunded to the extent that they were not needed. The United States
contribution has been fully disbursed and the Bank contribution is now
being disbursed and should be fully disbursed in September 1975.
PART IV - THE TARBELA PROJECT
27.       Negotiations of the proposed arrangements for supplementary
financing of the Tarbela project with Pakistan and the countries con-
cerned took place at meetings at the Bank's offices in Paris on April 10
and May 8, 1975. Negotiations with Pakistan on the terms of the proposed
credit agreement took place in May.
The Project
28.       The Tarbela Dam consists of an earth and rockfill dam across the
River Indus, about 40 miles northwest of Islamabad. Prior to the decision
to proceed with construction, very extensive feasibility and design studies
had been carried out. The dam, 485 feet high and about 9,000 feet long at
its crest, is flanked by two auxiliary dams on the left bank. The dams
are designed to impound 11.1 million acre feet (MAF) of water which would
provide initially 9.3 MAF of live storage. Two spillways are provided at
the left abutment, with a capacity sufficient to handle over twice the
largest flood on record.
29.       Four tunnels, each 45 feet in diameter at the upstream end, were
cut in the right abutment to divert the flow of the river during construc-
tion. Three of these tunnels will subsequently serve as power intakes, and



- 10 -
each will serve four generating units.    The fourth tunnel will serve as a
permanent irrigation outlet. In addition, Pakistan is constructing at its
own cost two tunnels as additional irrigation outlets, one in the right
bank and one in the left bank. These tunnels were not included in the
original design of the project. The Tarbela power plant, when completed,
will have 12 generating units of 175 Megawatts (MW) each, a total of
2,100 MW. The present project includes a powerhouse structure to accom-
modate the first four generating units. These units and related equipment
are financed separately by Pakistan, with assistance from Japan. 500 KV
and 220 KV transmission lines required to transmit the power generated at
Tarbela to the main load centers are being financed with assistance by
Canada and China respectively. At Annex III is a description of the
stages of construction of l;he project and maps shcwing its location.
30.        At the time of the establishment of the Tarbela Development
Fund the project was estimated to cost US$827.5 million equivalent,
including US$492 million in foreign exchange.    The main civil works
contract was awarded in May 1968 to the Tarbela Joint Venture (TJV),
a consortium of Italian and French firms, later joined by a number of
German and Swiss firms.
Present Status of the Project
31.       After some initial difficulties, the major civil engineering
works were constructed on schedule and by the middle of August 1974 the
main embankment dam had been completed. Progress on the construction of
the powerhouse and installation of generating plant, to be commissioned
from about the end of 1975, was also generally on schedule. The impound-
ing of the reservoir began in July 1974. Owing to the complex geological
nature of the foundations, it had been decided to test fill the reservoir
slowly and, in order to facilitate the emergency "dumping" of the reservoir,
should this prove necessary, the inlet gates to Tunnels 1 and 2, originally
intended to operate only as closure gates, were modified so that they could
be both opened and closed under hydraulic head. Shortly after the filling
began, it was discovered that the centre gate of Tunnel 2 could not be
fully closed. Then some of the steel liner plates were stripped off one
of the outlet passages of Tunnel 3, whereupon, as a precautionary measure,
all the outlet gates to Tunnels 3 and 4 were closed, and the reservoir
began to fill at an increasing rate. The next incident was a loud noise
in the inlet area of Tunnel 2 following which water flowed at full bore
through the tunnel accompanied by debris. The decision was then taken
to dump the reservoir by opening all the gates of the other tunnels. As
the water level was drawn down it was revealed that the main damage con-
sisted of the collapse of a section of Tunnel 2 in the inlet area and the



- 11 -
cave-in of the abutment above the area of collapse. There was consider-
able cavitation damage in Tunnels 1 and 2 and, as mentioned above, the
liner plates in Tunnel 3 outlet were stripped. A number of sink holes
were found in the upstream blanket. Seepage through the relief wells
at the toe of the dam and through the right abutment was more than had
been expected. Damage of a less serious nature was caused by the tur-
bulent flows of water in the outlet area downstream of the dam.
32.       When the accident occurred the Government of Pakistan gave
instructions that first priority should be given to restoring the works
in time for the next filling of the reservoir and appointed a Cabinet
Sub-Committee to monitor progress and resolve difficulties. The Bank
arranged for Mr. Bernard Chadenet, Vice President, to lead the work of
the Bank, in its capacity as Administrator of the Indus Basin and Tarbela
Development Funds, in the measures necessary to restore the situation fol-
lowing the mishaps during the first filling of the reservoir. He visited
Pakistan in October and December 1974 and in February 1975 to discuss
the required program of remedial measures and to review action required
on potential problems. After each of these missions, Special Reports
by the Administrator were sent to the Parties to the Indus Basin and
Tarbela Development Fund Agreements and oral reports were made to the
Executive Directors. As soon as the nature and extent of the damage
were known, a program of repair works was started and the Project
Engineers also prepared a program of additional works designed to
increase the safety of the project during the next filling. Good
progress has been made with implementing these programs, and all the
work which had to be carried out before the reservoir again began to
fill in June this year was finished in time. Some additional remedial
works remain to be completed. It has been possible to meet the costs
of repair and remedial works from resources remaining in the Tarbela
Development Fund pending the completion of final project works; these
resources will have to be replaced to permit final completion of the
project.
33.       The cost of these repairs and additional remedial works is
estimated to be US$59 million, 1/ of which US$42 million is required
1/   The US$59 million estimate, made by the Project Engineers in February,
was the basis for the financing arrangements underlying this proposal
(see para 35 below). A revised estimate prepared by the Project
Engineers in late May 1975 estimated the cost of repairs and addi-
tional works at US$62.2 million. This estimate differs from the
earlier one mainly in the inclusion of a contingency allowance to
cover the cost of additional works that may be required after the
second filling of the reservoir but whose extent and cost cannot now
be foreseen with any precision.

in foreign exchange. Of this total, the repairs account for US$32 million
(US$23 million in foreign exchange) and the additional works account for
US$27 million (US$19 million in foreign exchange). Annex IV summarizes
the main components of these costs and the purpose of the proposed Credit.
The Need for Additional Foreign Exchange
34.        The most recent estimate of the total cost of the project in-
cluding the cost of the repairs and additional works as stated above, is
US$1,020 million, of which US,$568 million is required in foreign exchange.
The amount available in the Tarbela Fund, including the balance of the
Indus Fund, is likely to fall short of this foreign exchange require-
ment by an amount probably around US$50 million. A more precise figure
cannot be given at the present time largely because of two major uncer-
tainties. The first of these arises from an arbitration award, made
under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International
Chamber of Commerce, to a French contractor in connection with the
construction of the Chasma Barrage, one of the major Indus basin works.
The validity of this award is being questioned by the Water Power Devel-
opment Authority (WAPDA), the agency responsible for the execution of
the Indus and Tarbela Projects, in the Pakistan couIts. Until this
matter has been settled, it is not possible to know how much will be
required from the Indus Basin Development Fund to meet the foreign
exchange requirements of the settlement and hence how large the
eventual balance of the Indus Basin Development Fund available for
Tarbela will be.
35.        The second uncertainty arises because WAPDA may be able to
recover some of the cost of t-he repairs (but not of the additional
remedial works) from the cont.ractor, its insurers or others.    A num-
ber of difficult and complex issues are involved in the insurance
claims and the insurers have not yet taken a position on the bulk of
the claims presented. In the meantime, the Government of Pakistan has
decided to defer any attempt to allocate responsibility for the accident
and it has made an arrangement with the contractor whereby, without
prejudice to the contractual positions of the contractor and the em-
ployer (WAPDA), monthly advances are made to the contractor roughly
equivalent to the estimated expenditures on the repairs. It may be
that the settlement of the insurance claims will take a considerable
time and it is, therefore, proposed that additional financing be pro-
vided to meet the full foreicin exchange cost of the repairs and addi-
tional remedial works. To the extent that, eventually, insurance
payments are received, the proposed Tarbela Development Fund (Supple-
mental) Agreerment, described in paragraphs 40-42, provides for them to
be shared pro rata among those, including Pakistan, who provided the
finance for the repairs and additional remedial works.

Arrangements for Additional Financing
36.       After the mishap occurred the Government of Pakistan asked
for the Bank's assistance in obtaining the additional funds required
to repair the damage and complete the project. As soon as a reasonably
firm cost estimate was available, the Bank, in its capacity as Admin-
istrator of the Indus Basin and Tarbela Development Funds, approached
the countries which had previously contributed to these Funds. As a
result of this approach, five countries, namely, Australia, Germany,
Italy, the U.K. and the U.S.A., indicated at a meeting in Paris on
May 8 that they were prepared to consider making available additional
funds as special contributions to the Tarbela Development Fund to help
meet the foreign exchange cost of the repairs and the remedial works.
In addition, France has indicated that it is prepared to make a contri-
bution, the amount and terms of which would be decided after the matter
of the Chasma barrage claim had been disposed of.
37.       To suit Germany's aid administration arrangements, Germany
will not be a party to the proposed Tarbela Development Fund (Supple-
mental) Agreement, but the bilateral agreement between Germany and
Pakistan by which Germany will make its contribution available, will
provide that its contribution will be disbursed and accounted for by
the Bank as Administrator of the Tarbela Fund as a special contribu-
tion by Pakistan, but otherwise in the same way as if Germany had
been a signatory of the Tarbela Development Fund (Supplemental)
Agreement. Similarly, Australia will not be a party to the Tarbela
Development Fund (Supplemental) Agreement but will make its assistance
available as a grant payable directly to the Tarbela Development Fund
as a special contribution made under Section 11.02 of the original
Tarbela Development Fund Agreement.
38.       The IDA credit here proposed would be for US$8.0 million,
an amount which is approximately the same proportion of the additional
funds as the Bank/IDA has already contributed to the foreign exchange
resources of the Tarbela Development Fund. The total of the contribu-
tions amounts to US$41.6 million equivalent as follows:

US$ million equivalent
Australia        A$      1,000,000                         1.3
Germany          DM     15,000,000                         6.3
IDA              US$     8,000,000                        8.0
Italy            Lit 6,300,000,000                       10.0
U.K.             £       2,500,000                         6.0
U.S.A.           US$    10,00l0,000                       10.0
41.6
39.        Canada has agreed that it will release, for untied use, the
balance of approximately US$3 million of its original contribution to
the Tarbela Development Fund. Under the Tarbela Development Fund
Agreement Canada's contribution had been tied to purchases in Canada
and, since further expenditures in Canada are riot expected to exceed
US$750,000, it was probable that the balance would not have been used
at all. Hence the agreement by Canada that this sum can be freely used
represents a real increase in the available funds. The total additional
foreign exchange which would therefore become available, including the
US$3 million equivalent from Canada, would be US$44.6 million equivalent.
Pakistan would meet the rupee costs of the repairs and additional works
as presently estimated and would provide any additional amount in for-
eign exchange required to meet any cost overruns on the repairs and
additional works. Under the 1968 Agreement Pakistan also has an obli-
gation to provide any additional funds required to complete the Project.
The Proposed Supplemental Aqreement and Credit
40.        The original Tarbela Development Fund Agreement of 1968 estab-
lished the Tarbela Development Fund and set out the contributions to be
made by the various parties, including the Bank. It also provided for
the Bank to act as Administrator, as it is doing for the Indus Basin
Development Fund.   In its capacity as Administrator, the Bank receives
the contributions from the parties, including the transfer from the Indus
Basin Development Fund, holds the assets of the Fund in trust and arranges
for the disbursement of the resources of the Fund to meet expenditures on
the project. The Bank, as Administrator, is also responsible for the gen-
eral supervision of the project on behalf of the parties to the Agreement.
It is entitled to re-imburse itself out of the Fund for expenses incurred
solely because of its services as Administrator.

41.        The proposed Tarbela Development Fund (Supplemental) Agreement,
1975, provides for the special contributions now proposed to be paid
into the Tarbela Development Fund and to be used to meet the cost of a
list of repairs and additional remedial works as determined by the Admin-
istrator of the Tarbela Development Fund (Sections 1.01, 1.02, 1.03 and
1.07). It also provides for the sharing out among the special contribu-
tors, including Pakistan, on a pro-rata basis of any recoveries by Pakistan
on account of the cost of repairs to the Tarbela Dam, or any surplus remain-
ing after completion of the repairs and additional remedial works (Sections
1.08 and 1.09). Pakistan would undertake to provide all funds required to
complete the repairs and remedial works over and above those that can be
financed from the special contributions and other available resources of
the Fund (Section 1.04). Under the proposed agreement, each contributor
would be free either to receive repayment of part of its special contri-
bution, or to apply its share of such recoveries or surplus to any other
purposes by agreement with Pakistan (Sections 1.08(h) and 1.09).
42.       The proposed IDA Credit would be for US$8.0 million equivalent
on standard IDA terms. The proceeds of the Credit would be withdrawn from
the credit account at the request of the Administrator. The contributions
by the other parties are to be paid to the Fund on specific dates between
October 1, 1975, and January 1, 1977; the dates have been selected to suit
the budgetary procedures of the various participating countries. The IDA
credit would be drawn upon as needed to meet the requirements of the Fund
taking into account the timing of the other contributions. All the con-
tributions are expected to be disbursed by the end of 1976.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Tarbela Development Fund (Supplemental) Agreement,
1975, the draft Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a
draft resolution approving the Association's participation in the Tarbela
Development Fund (Supplemental) Agreement and the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
44.       It is proposed that, when the Tarbela Development Fund (Supple-
mental) Agreement, 1975, becomes effective upon signature by all the pros-
pective parties, the Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan and the Association would be signed.
45.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
46.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the participa-
tion by the Association in the proposed Tarbela Development Fund (Supple-
mental) Agreement, 1975 and the proposed credit.

C.  Projects in Execution-
Credit No. 50    Education:  US$8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 1964;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project has suffered major delays on account of adminis-
trative difficulties, shortage of building materials, lack of local funds,
the 1971 war, the 1973 floods, and re-negotiation of some civil works
contracts at the agricultural university necessitated by sharp increases
in the cost of building materials and wages.    90%D of construction is
finished and the project is expected to be completed by the revised clos-
ing date, June 1976. Installed equipment at the university represents
more than 100%o of the original allocation. Of another $240,000 which
has been made available for further essential equipment, $180,000 has
been ordered and the remainder is to be procured by the extended closing
date. The other components of the project, i.e. equipment for technical
institutes and technical assistance for teacher training, have been 80%o
completed. Four fellowships may remain unused. Difficulties have been
experienced in installation and maintenance of the equipment due to in-
sufficient local funds.
Loan No. 548     Tarbela Dam:  US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first im-
poundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one
of the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reservoir, in the course
of which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is
nearing completion. The second filling of the reservoir is now in
progress. Additional resources will be required to meet the costs of
the remedial measures and agreement in principle was reached at a
meeting of the Parties to the Indus Basin and Tarbela Development Fund
agreements whereby special contributions would be made by a number of
the parties to help meet the costs of the repairs and additional remedial
works.
1/        These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regard-
ing the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to
report any problems which are being encountered, and the action
being taken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense,
and with the understanding that they do not purport to present a
balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

Loan No. 590     Development Finance Company - PICIC:   US$40.0 Million Loan
of March 21, 1969; Closing Date: September 30, 1975
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date of
March 31, 1974 has been extended to September 30, 1975 to enable disburse-
ments to be made for the last sub-project.
Loan No. 621     Railways:  US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on the renewal and improvement of track and bridges and
rehabilitation and improvement for workshops and depots has been satisfac-
tory. However, the proposed expansion of the marshalling yard at Samasata
has been dropped in favor of a new marshalling yard at Pipri. The original
Closing Date (December 31, 1972) has been extended by three years to Decem-
ber 31, 1975, to allow time for procurement of materials required in the con-
struction work at Pipri. Because of further delays caused through relocating
the yard, another extension of the Closing Date may be necessary. Consultants
(Sofrerail, France) have been appointed to assist in the implementation of
a program of operational improvements.
Cr. No. 157      Agricultural Development Bank:   US$30.0 Million Credit
of June 26, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The original Closing Date (June 30, 1972) was extended to June 30,
1975. During recent months there has been an improvement in tractor supply
to Pakistan and this credit will be almost fully disb ursed by the revised
closing date, although a further extension will be necessary. Before a re-
quested fourth credit can be considered, however, ADBP must undergo financial
and administrative rehabilitation. The East Pakistan liabilities issue should
also be resolved; and the overclues situation, which has become almost unmanage-
able, should be improved. ADBP's lending policies and organiza tion also
require thorough review. IDA is pressing the Government to deal with ADBP's
financial and managerial problems.
Cr. No. 177      Development Finance Company - IDBP:   US$20.0 Million Credit
of February 11, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Amendments to, the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. Th ese enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry wihtout bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its liabi-
lities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. Ihe original
Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to December 31, 1977. The
terminal date for submission of sub-projects has been postponed to December 31,
1975. IDBP has continued to improve its operational standards but recent en-
vironmental developments, including a textile crisis, have not permitted an



ANNEX II
Page 6
improvement in arrears, which is creating difficult liquidity problems.
While this situation remains, IDBP is expected to obtain the necessary
local funds from the State Bank of Pakistan. After a recent supervision
mission, the Association, in consultation with the Government and IDBP, is
exploring ways in which some of the issues presently confrontiong IDBP
can be resolved. Utilization of the IDA credit is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 206      Engineering Education:   US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Overall the project is about 24 months behind schedule. Construc-
tion of staff housing has been delayed due to the shortage of counterpart
funds, but is expected to be completed nine months before the closing date
(December 1976). Other construction and procurement of most equipment is
expected to be completed by the end of 1975. Progress in staff development
has been unsatisfactory, largely because teaching salaries are low compared
to those in industry. The Closing Date of the credit may be postponed because
of delays in using credit funds for fellowships and in recruiting experts.
Civil works costs are expected to be about 85% above the appraisal estimate
in rupee terms, but total project costs are unlikely to exceed the appraisal
estimate of US$6.3 million due to the 1972 devaluation of the rupee. Dis-
bursements remain slow but are expected to improve significantly in FY1976.
Cr. No. 213      Power Transmission and Distribution:    US$23.0 Million Credit
of August 13, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Implementation of the project, which had improved during the past
year, is presently suffering agaih from a setback which will require a
second postponement of the Closing Date to the end of 1976. The new delay
is caused by additional claims of Yugoslavian manufacturers on which nego-
tiations have been substantially completed.
The Credit is still limited to US$23 million, with WAPDA and the
Pakistan Government realizing that any overrun will be taken care of by
their own resources.
Cr. No. 422      Third Karachi Port:   US$18.0 Million Credit
July 19, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Construction not yet started due to protracted negotiations with
sole bidder for each major contract over price and joint venture agreement
which were only completed in June 1975.
Cr. No. 492      Fourth Karachi Port:   US$16.0 Million Credit of
July 8, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Tender documents for the oil berth have been issued to prequali-
fied contractors and bids are due for opening on July 21, 1975.



ANNEX II
Page 7
Loan No. 961     Industrial Investment:   US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to F'ICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign cur-
rency liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.
PICIC's arrears have remained high which is creating serious liquidity
problems. This has mainly been the result of environmental developments
including a textile crisis. While this situation remains, PICIC is
expected to obtain the necessary local funds from the State Bank of
Pakistan. Its management has also been weakened after the departure
of some of its senior staff including, most recently, the Deputy
Managing Director. After a recent supervision mission, the Bank,
in consultation with the Government and PICIC, is exploring ways in
which some of the issues presently confronting PICIC can be resolved.
Up to May 20, 1975, sub-projects amounting to Us$10.0 million had been
credited. Disbursements amounted to $3.3 million.
Cr. No. 466      Flood Rehabilitation:   US$35.0 Million Credit of
March 18, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Good progress was made before the 1974 monsoon in restoring
the protective bunds and canals damaged during the 1973 floods. The
restoration of road works has been considerably slower. The general
imports category of the credit has been fully disbursed but the importa-
tion of specialized spare parts for the repair of construction and farm
machinery has been delayed due to administrative difficulties.
Loan No. 988     Multan Fertilizer:   US$35.0 Million Loan of
May 24, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Procurement is making good progress and orders for 95%o of the
value of plant materials financed iwth the aid of the Bank loan have
been placed. About 50%0 of the plant being financed by the ADB loan
has also been ordered. First shipments of equipment are anticipated
in June 1975. It is now estimated that there will be a foreign exchange
cost overrun of about US$20 million, which has been met by an additional
equity contribution from the Government of Abu Dhabi.
Cr. No. 510      Third Telecommunications:   US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This credit which was signed in September 1974 is proceeding
satisfactorily though at an early stage. Procurement action for all
main equipment items is well-advanced.    Reorganization of T&T to a
form more suited to its commercial-type operation, which was an agree-
menit of the first Credit 145-PAK that was reiterated in the Credit
Agreement of 510-PAK, has not progressed. Assurances of action and
advice of a new implementation schedule have been receeived from the
Secretary of Communications and the Secretary, Economic Affairs Division.

STAGE I CONSTRUCTION
River Flow in Natural Channels
Start on excavation of the tunnels. Material from the tunnel intake and
outlet areas, from the diversion channel excavations and from Baisak Gandaf
(right bank) borrow area used to build the initial section of the main dam.
Construction of buttress dam across the channel to be used to close the
channel in Stage III. The river was successfully diverted on schedule
into the diversion channel in October 1970.
STAGE II CONSTRUCTION
River Flow in Diversion Channel
With river confined to the excavated diversion channel on the right bank,
construction of the main embankment continued using material from the right
and left bank borrow areas and from the spillway channel. Construction of
powerhouse and auxiliary and service spillways in hand. The auxiliary dams
constructed. Construction of the tunnels including intake and outlet works
completed. Stage II was completed on schedule by the end of September 1973.
STAGE III CONSTRUCTION
River Diverted through Tunnels
In Stage III, closure of the buttress dam across the diversion channel
forced the river flow through the low level intakes of Tunnels 1 and 2
and completed Tunnels 3 and 4. This allowed the completion of the final
section of the main embankment across the diversion channel just down-
stream of the closed buttress dam together with the two spillways. With
the main embankment substantially finished about the end of June 1974 the
diversion intakes of Tunnels 1 and 2 were closed. Work to convert these
to power tunnels whilst the river flows through Tunnels 3 and 4 only. will
follow. The power plant (for first four units) will then be completed
and connected to Tunnel 1 for the initial installation of 700,000 kw. Fol-
lowing mishaps which occurred during the first filling of the reservoir in
July/August 1974 a program of restoration and remedial works was undertaken
in accordance with program summarized in the attached Annex. The project
is now scheduled for completion in late 1976.
