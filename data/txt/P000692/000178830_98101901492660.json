 will, over four years, support the establishment of an\n            orderly grain marketing and input distribution system in\n            Ethiopia. It will provide the Agricultural Marketing\n            Corporation (AMC) with incremental storage facilities for\n            about 350,000 MT of produce and farm inputs, 85 vehicles\n            (cars, trucks, motorcycles), office and storage equipment, a\n            seven-man management team (28 man-years), staff training,\n            headquarters building and incremental permanent trading\n            capital. The project will also strengthen the Ethiopian\n            Grain Agency through the provision of 4 vehicles, office\n            equipment, 19 man-years of technical assistance and\n            operating costs for the new Internal Marketing and Market\n            Intelligence Departments, and through the establishment of a\n            fund to support improvements to local market places.\n            Finally, the project will improve crop forecasting by\n            providing a new Crop Information Unit within the Ministry of\n            Agriculture with two vehicles and office equipment, 3\n            man-years of technical assistance, consulting services and\n            operating costs during the project period.
