KEDUNG OMBO MULTIPURPOSE DAM AND IRRIGATION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         Republic of Indonesia
Amount:           US$156 million equivalent
Terms:            Repayable in 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
standard variabLe rate.
Project
Descripcion:   The main obiectives of the project are to increase food
production an some 59.340 ha, stimulate employment in the
project area. control damaging floods in rural and urban
areas, supplement water supplies for some 300 villages and
towns, generate 74 GWh of power which would be fed into the
national grid and improve water management in the project
area. The project includes: (a) construction of the Kedung
Ombo Dam, appurtenant structures, diversion works, a hydro-
power plant (28.5 MVA) and associated transmission line (30
km, 150 kV) and three micro-hydropower plants (about 1.8 MVA
each) and associated transmission lines (20 kV); (b)
improving existing irrigation (34,240 ha) and constructing
two new irrigation systems (25,100 ha); (c) establishing a
flood warning and water monitoring system for the dam and
irrigation operations; and (d) provision of technical assis-
tance for: Mi) training in dam construction and safety
inspection and in reservoir operations; (ii) design of
irrigation works serving 121,300 ha from the Jatigede Dam
(West Java); (iii) surveys for updating classification of
land for tax purposes to improve cost recovery; (iv) surveys
for monitoring resettlement and compensation payments; and
(v) studies for soil and water conservation. Although
Indonesia is now largely self-sufficient in rice, steady
increases in national rice consumption and the very limited
scope for expanding the irrigated area on Java make it vital
for the country to intensify food production by augmenting
dry season water supplies through the construction of
multipurpose dams. The increase in cropping intensity thus
permitted would also have a substantial impact on raising the
incomes of smallholders and landless laborers in an area
where more than 60Z of the population has incomes below the
absolute poverty line, about a third of farm households are
landless, and unemployment is high. The main project risks
are delayed land acquisition and inadequate operation and
maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation systems. However, land
acquisition has already begun and Government has agreed to a
schedule and has given assurances on adequate funding for



this purpose. Shortfalls in O&M budgets are not expected in
view of assurances obtained for adequate funding and
Government's willingness to fund O&M costs for irrigation
projects from its development budget, and from increased
allocation of land tax revenues collected at the local Level.

I. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has requested assistance for the
construction of the Kedung Ombo multipurpose dam, one    the major water
resource developments in the Jratunseluna River Basin    in Central Java.  The
dam will provide irrigation water for (a) 25,100 ha of new 2rrigation systems
in the Klambu Kanan (Juana) and Sidorejo (South Crobogan) -  areas and 2b)
34,240 ha in the Sedadi (Upper Sedadi) and Klambu Kiri (Lower Sedadi) I
irrigation systems which at present have only wet season irrigation. The
project will also control flood waters in che upper and lower Serang area,
improve drainage and augment domestic and municipal water supplies in che
service areas, and generate hydropower.
1.02      The Bank has been deepLy involved in planning and implementing proj-
ects in the Jratunseluna Basin since the Irrigation I Project (Cr. 127-IND) in
1968, under which the then largely inoperative Sedadi irrigation syscems were
repaired. Extensive tertiary development in the Upper and Lower Sedadi areas
was supported under Irrigation Projects VII and IX (Lns. 1268 and 1435-IND).
Master plans for the whole Jratunseluna Basin and designs for additional
drainage and flood procection works were also prepared under the Irrigation
VII Project together with feasibility studies and designs for a dam at Kedung
Ombo on the Serang River and related irrigation development. The flood
protection works and drainage are being implemented under the Irrigation XIV
Project (Ln. 1811-IND), while construction of the dam and related irrigation
facilities will be carried out under the proposed project. The proposed
project was prepared by PROSIDA (the special project agency responsible for
most Bank-assisted projects) which has now been incorporated into the
Directorate of Irrigation II in the Directorate General of Water Resources
Development (DGWRD), assisted by consultants (Snowy Mountains Engineering
Corporation of Australia).
The Agricultural and Rural Sector
1.03      GOI's major objectives for the agricultural and rural sector are
to: (a) create productive employment to raise incomes of the rural poor; (b)
increase domestic food supply, especially rice, to keep pace with rising
demand; (c) expand agricultural exports, particularly of smallholder tree
crops; and (d) ensure productive, sustainable use of Indonesia's land, water,
and natural resources.

Lusi Rivers which feed the coastal plain east of Semarang, the capital of
Central Java (Map 18555).
2/ GOI has renamed the irrigation areas.- based on the sources of water. The
names in parentheses refer to the names of administrative areas where the
irrigation systems are located.



1.04      Food crop production forms 60% of agriculturaL GDP and 18% of total
(DP. Rice is the most importanc food crop. Between 1968 and 1982, rice pro-
duction grew substantially in response co government interventions, including
expansion of the irrigation network, major changes in rice growing technology,
and price incentives. Production gains of other major food crops, while not
so impressive as those for rice, have exceeded population growth, although
some crops, for exampLe corn, are encountering market constraincs.
1.05      GOI's policies in food crop production, combined with the expansion
of the COI infrastructure investment program (e.g. INPRES, etc.) and the
strong linkages and multiplier effects between agriculcural incomes and other
rural industries, have had a substantial impacc on increasing incomes and
levels of living in a large portion of the rural areas. They have also
resulted in some reduction in the incidence of rural poverty, even though this
still remains a major probLem facing GOI.  Increases in income have not been
uniformly spread, especiaLly to dryland rood crop farmers.  in many cases,
inadequate infrastructure is also a contributory factor to slow growth in food
crop output, and needs to be addressed through further investments in rural
roads, etc.
1.06      The Bank, in cooperation with GOI, has undertaken a series of sector
studies related to food crop production, the most recent of which are Policy
Options and Strategies for Major Food Croos (October 1982, Report 3686-IND)
and the Irrigation Sector Review: An Issues Paper (October 1982 and updated
in May 1984) which reviewed the irrigation work program and budget included in
the GOI Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (Repelita IV) for the period
1984-88.
The Irrigation Subsector
1.07      Irrigation and Rice Production.  During 1970-83 rice production grew
from 13.1 million tons to 23.3 million tons.  Production increased at about
4.9% per year during 1970-81, but slowed to 2.2% per year from 1981 to 1983
mainly due to droughts. Rice production increases between 1970 and 1981
resulted from increases in the harvested area (25%) and yield increases
(75Z). About 16% of the production growth can be attributed solely to expan-
sion and improvement in irrigation, about 9Z is due to improved rice varieties
and fertil ,er use, and about 75% is due to the joint interaction of these
variables.-
1.08      Rice consumption steadily increased at 4.5% per year between 1970
and 1981, of which 2.3% p.a. was due to population increases and 2.2% p.a. to
income, price and other effects. In 1980 and 1981, Indonesia became largely
self-sufficient in rice, and rice imports plunged from 2.0 million tons in
1980 to 0.3 million tons in 1982. GOI buffer stocks increased to 2.3 million
in 1981. Successive droughts reduced production in 1982 and 1983, forcing
Government to import some 1.3 million tons of rice in 1983 and 0.3 million
3/   Source:  Indonesia - Policy Options and Strategies for Major Food Crops,
Report No. 3686b-IND, April 1984.



- 3 -
tons in 1984. The 1984 crop is tentatively estimated at 25.5 million tons,
and buffer stocks have increased once more to some 3 million tons. It is
expected that for most "average rainfall" years rice production will meet
demand, provided the present rate of irrigation development is maintained.
1.09      In the future, improved rice variecies and fertilizer use are likely
to play a lesser roLe in increasing Indonesia's rice production. The use of
high yielding varieties (HYVs) is already high (about 80% of the irrigated and
wetland crop) and is unlikely to expand beyond 90X in 1990. Several tradi-
tional varieties are preferred for taste and ceremonial reasons, and are
better adapced to difficult growing conditions such as saline. flooded or
water-short areas. Fertilizer use is also high. particularLi on 'ava where
about i35 kg of nitrogen and 50 kg of phosohate per hectare are now applied.
There is evidence chat nitrogen applications above this would be -wasted and
cause crop iosses due to lodging and greater insect damage. With such already
high fertilizer and HYV use, future yield increases will depend primarily on
improving the quality of irrigation and water management, and expanding
irrigation to exiscing dryland areas.
1.10      Strategy for Water Resource Development.  GOI's irrigation sector
investments include irrigation works to sustain self-sufficiency in rice;
swamp reclamation for transmigration; and river control works to develop
multipurpose use of water resources for irrigation, municipal water supply,
flood mitigation, and hydropower. The Bank sector work assisted by GOI
covering the Repelita IV plan period (1984-88) concluded that the following
investment program would be justified:
(a) Construction of 0.5 million ha of ongoing rehabilitation, and 0.2
million ha of new irrigation works including medium (sedang) and
large-scale (khusus) systems. New rehabilitation projects and
tertiary network construction of 0.6 million ha would be pursued,
together with 0.27 million ha of new small (kecil), medium (sedang)
and large-scale (khusus) irrigation works. Construction of at least
two major dams on Java to supply water for irrigation intensifica-
tion will be included as part of the program. These irrigation
works would enable GOI to maintain self-sufficiency in rice produc-
tion, which requires an annual growth rate of 3.5% (harvested area
growth of 1.4% and yield growth of 2.1%);
(b) Construction of 0.1 million ha of tidal swamp reclamation (gross
area), and a further 0.3 million ha of new reclamation works to
accomodate 20,000 to 25,000 transmigrant families per year.  An
additional 0.1 million ha of already settled inland swamp area need
rehabilitation and improved water control; and
(c) Construction of river control and improvement works (levees, dams,
etc.), and volcanic debris control in about 20 river basins
throughout the country for more efficient multipurpose use of water.
1.11      Multipurpose Use of Water and Dam Construction Program.  Java has
three million ha under irrigation (60X of all irrigated areas in Indonesia),
and very little scope (about 16,O000 ha) for new irrigation schemes. Basic



-4-
rehabilication of che Javanese schemes is almost completed. Crop productivity
could, however, be further increased through intensive system upgrading co
improve operations and facilitate maintenance; construction of better tertiary
networks; and augmentation of dry season w.ater supplies from multipurpose
storage dams. The increase in cropping intensity thus permitted would have a
significant impact on raising the incomes of very small farms (0.1 to 0.3 ha)
and the employment of surplus landless labor.
1.12      Water resources must also be developed for meeting municipal
supplies, hydropower and flood control. Excensive floods in the i980i'81 and
1982/83 wet seasons caused widespread disruption of road transportation and
damage to both agricultural and urban areas (e.z., Semarang in Certral
Java). Limited municipal and industriaL water suDpLies for key cities
(Jakarta, Semarang, Surabaya. etc.) have sLowed down their development. Since
groundwater in these sites is not promising, water storage through dams is the
only rationai alternacive to increase water supplies.
1.14      GOI started construction of two dams in late 1982, and has detailed
designs for nine others, the construction of which is phased to meet actual
requirements. At present, COI places highest priority on the Kedung Ombo
Multipurpose Dam Project on Java in view of its major irrigation benefits in
an area now largely without dry season water but subject to flooding in the
wet season. The proposed dam wouLd also generate power and develop municipal
water supplies for major towns in the commuand area (Demak, Grobogan, Pati)
once flows are controlled in the Serang River.
1.13      Investment Needs.  The indicative irrigation program and related
investments in water resources developr*nt are estimated to cost about Rp 4.5
trillion (US$4.1 billion) at current costs (see Table 1.1). About one-third
of this amount, equivalent to the foreign exchange cost of foreign-assisted
projects, is expected to be financed from external loans. This is somewhat
higher than the share (about one-quarter) financed from external loans during
Repelita III, due to the assumption that completion of ongoing foreign-
assisted projects will be given priority over the next few years. As in the
past, the balance of funding will come from the Government's domestic
budget. The indicative program is 30% smaller than the planned allocations
for irrigation and water management. This is partly due to cutbacks in
physical programs, due to the overall resource constraint and the changing
rice situation. It also reflects some substantially lower unit costs, based
on recent experience with international bids for civil works contracts.
During 1984/85 and 1985/86, actual budget allocations were only about 75% of
the level required for the indicative program, and .ctual expenditures may be
even lower. Therefore, to meet the physical program some further rephasing of
investments will probably be necessary. This rephasing might also help smooth
the projected bunching of investment costs in 1986/87.
1.15      There are a number of features worth noting in the composition of
the indicative investment program: (a) Close to 85Z of the costs are related
to ongoing projects, of which 77% are foreign-assisted. New foreign-assisted
projects are projected to cost Rp 384 billion while new GOI projects are
limited to Rp 293 billion; (b) The major components of the program are for
large-scale irrigation expansion (38Z), irrigation rehabilitation (14Z), river



improvement (12%), irrigation O&M (7U),  0ood control (7%) and medium-scale
irrigation (6Z). However. aew investments show a significant reorientation of
priorities, away from large-scale irrigation (11%) and towards flood controL
(23%) and swamp programs (15%). '-i These changing priorities also reflect a
shift in the regional distribution of investments. Java still accounts for
more than one-half of total investment costs. However. among new projects,
over 90% are located on the Outer Islands, mainly on Sumacra and on Sulawesi.

1.16      Major Constraints in irrigation development relate to improving
irrigation system operation and maintenance (O&M) and ensuring adequate cost
recovery. Current standards of 0&1M of the main systems are frequently inade-
quate, though GOI has consistentLy raised the level of funds allocated for
such purposes, and has decided in FY84/85 to slow the rate of new irrigation
construction and divert development funds to improve O&M standards. BanK
assistance in O&M is designed to improve the organization and training of the
provincial services which are responsible for all O&M activities and to deve-
lop and demonstrate new techniques (Irrigation XVII, La. 2119-IND and Second
Provincial Irrigation Development Project, Ln. 2375-2ND).  Cost recovery
through the IPEDA (land tax)  s an efficient mechod of colLection, and links
levies to the productive capacitv o- -arm Lands.  WhiLe capital cost recovery
is less than 10%, this is an equitabie position consisEent with che poverty
and small farm sizes of most beneficiaries. However. reclassification of
newly irrigated lands and raising of ..ew Land taxes have often been slow
because of the lack of coordination within the various agencies. Assurances
were therefore obtained from Governmenc that reclassification of Land
benefitting from the proposed project and collection of increased IPEDA taxes
will be carried ouE in a timeiy manner (para. 6.07). Bank assiscance will
also seek to introduce a more direct linkage of IPEDA levies to O&M
allocations and to ensure that O&M funds are spent effectively.
The Role of the Bank
1.17      Since 1968, the Bank has provided US$1,018 million for irrigation
projects in Indonesia. The earliest projects were designed to repair major
systems to quickly increase rice output. Later projects provided additional
rehabilitation of existing systems, drainage, flood protection, and tertiary
networks. The most recent projects include measures to strengthen planning,
programming, and budgeting capacity and management information systems
(Irrigation XV - Cr. 995 and XVI - Ln. 2118), and to build up the capacity of
provincial irrigation services in East Java Province (Irrigation XVII - Ln.
2119), and in eight other provinces (Second Provincial Irrigation Development
- Ln. 2375).
1.18      During Repelita IV, the Bank's involvement in the sector will
emphasize institution-building and address persistent sectorwide problems such
as operation and maintenance standards. Lending will focus on:
(a) strengthening of national, and especially provincial, irrigation
services, and improving their operation and maintenance performance;
and
(b) a small number of technically complex projects or projects which
present difficult economic choices, or in which Bank participation
can mobiLize significant cofinancing. Besides the proposed project,
these include the West Tarum Canal for irrigation and the Jakarta
water supply, and the Jatigede Multipurpose Dam project.
1.19      Project Performance Audits.  The .-first six Bank-assisted irrigation
projects have been compLeted. Project Performance Audits have been issued for



-7-
four of them 4  and a follow-up .mpact Evlluation Reporr on .he first project
(Cr. 127-IND) was released in July 1983.-;
1.20      The most serious implementation problems were construction delays
and cost overruns. The delays arose because of GOI's then cumbersome local
bidding, contracting and fund reLease procedures, and shortages of local
funds. Cost overruns were due to additional quantities of work required after
detailed design, and increased unic costs due to rapid inflation and construc-
tion delays. However, cost increases were more than offset by higher ricef
prices, and economic rates of return are expected to exceed 40X. Other prob-
lem areas include the need to improve operation and maintenance services (O&M)
at provincial leveLs; to provide cechnical and administrative support to water
user associations; and to promote efficient water use. These Droblems are
recognized in the strategy adopted for Bank assistance (para. 1.18) and have
been used in the planning and design of this project.
1.21      Disbursement Performance.  Disbursements currentlv run at about 73%
of appraisal escimates. Performance has improved (disbursements -vere below
61% in FY82) through more intensive supervision by Residenc Bank staff, accel-
erating start-up activities and disbursing against statements of expenditures
for small civil works contracts. In addition, consulting service needs are
usually agreed with the Bank prior to loan negotiations, and civil works for
the first year's construction are usually tendered and contracts negotiated
prior to loan effectiveness. Together with other continuing Bank assistance
to accelerate contracting procedures and improve the domestic construction
industry, these measures appear to be progressively reducing implementation
delays.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Background and Location
2.01      The proposed Kedung Ombo Multipurpose Dam and Irrigation Project is
part of the Jratunseluna basin development and is located in the flood plains
of the Serang River and its tributaries, about 75 km east of Semarang on the
north coast of Java. In 1971, DGWRD assisted by consultants (NEDECO) prepared
a master plan for the development of the water resources of the rivers of the
Jratunseluna basin, which, together with later studies, identified the
following priority schemes: (a) flood mitigation works (levees, etc.) along
the Jragung, Tuntang and Dolok Rivers; (b) rehabilitation of irrigation
schemes served by the Jragung, Dolok, and Tuntang; (c) tertiary irrigation
network construction in the Tuntang, Jragung, and Sedadi areas; (d) flood
protection and drainage in the Lower Serang and the river systems that feed
the Serang from Mount Muria, and drainage of the swamp areas in the Juana

'Valley; and (e) construction of the Kedung Ombo Dam on the Serang River and
the Glapan Barrage on the Tuntang River to improve water supplies for
irrigation and for flood mitigation.
2.02      The Bank has been involved in the Jratunseluna basin development
through the following projects: Irrigation I (Cr. 127-IND), Irrigation VII
(tLn. 1268-IND), Irrigation IX (Ln. 1435-IND), Irrigation XI (Ln. 1579-IND) and
Irrigation XIV (Ln. 1811-DID). The irrigation I Project rehabilitated the
main irrigation system in tr:e Serang area. Extensive tertiary development in
the Sedadi (Upper Sedadi) and Klambu Kiri (Lower Sedadi) areas took place
under Irrigation VII and rX, and main and some secondary drainage in the Lower
Serang and Juana Valley areas is being improved under Zrrigation :IV.  'fn
contrast to the Bank's eariier activities which concentrated on improving the
irrigation syscem and flood control, ,he prouosed Kedung Ombo projec. is
intended to enhance water availability through construction of a dam on the
Serang River in order to ex?and irrigation to the currentLy rainfed areas of
Sidorejo (South Grobogan) and Klambu Kanan (Juana Valley) and to the already
irrigated Sedadi and Klambu Kiri areas, where the system will be improved (see
Table 2.1). This will greatly increase the cropping intensity of the
previously rehabilitated irrigation systems and reduce floods.

2.03      The net area for development (59,340 ha) comprises Sidorejo
(6,100 ha) on the right bank of the Serang River near Purwodadi, Klambu Kanan
(19,000 ha) further downstream on the right.-bank, and the Sedadi and Klambu
Kiri irrigation area (34,240 ha) situated on the left bank, running from
Perawangan down to the coast (see Map 18555). The project area is comprised



of parts of four kabupatens (discricts) - Demak, Kudus, Pati and Grobogan -
and 22 kecamatans (subdistricts) with 308 villages. The area is well served
by air, rail and road transport, and port faciLities in Semarang.
Climate and Soils
2.04      The climate is tropical and monsoonal.  Mean annual rainfall is
about 2,000 mm, with 85% occurring in the wet season (October-November to
April-Hay). Mean monthly evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall in the June-
October dry season. Most rainfall is localized, short duration, and of high
intensity. This underlies the need for flood protection. drainage and
supplementary irrigation co achieve satisfactory Leveis oi oroduction in the
flood plains of the Serang aiver system.
2.05      The four project ayeas (Sidorejo, Klambu Kanan, Sedadi and Klambu
Kiri) have different soi s ∞  buC are ai. suited zo intensive rice cropping
and several secondary crops. The Sidorejo irrigation area is a relatively
well drained flat river plain ac about 20 m above mean sea level (MSL).  Due
to the flat grades and Lack of drains, shallow inundation occurs in some
locations for up to 24 hours following heavy rain. About 5,000 ha of lower-
Lying land is subject Eo inundation by the Serang River flood (every five
years), but total crop Loss occurs only on about 250 ha. The soils are
predominantly grumosols which are suited for intensive rice growing and for
dry season secondary crops. The Klambu Kanan area is located on the very flat
alluvial flood plains of the Babalan-Juana River at an elevation of 2-14 m
above KSL. These plains were built up rapidly by sediment deposition, due to
the construction of the Wilalung diversion structure in 1918 and subsequent
diversion of Serang River flows to the Juana Valley. The bulk of the area is
subject to regular flooding and poor drainage and is classified as permanent
swamp (see Map 18555). Works in progress under che Irrigation XIV project
(Loa'n 1811-IND) will have a significant effect in improving and extending the
cropping area in Klambu Kanan. The Sedadi and Klambu Kiri areas have alluvial
deposits of volcanic origin, well suited to intensive rice cultivation.
Existing Irrigation Systems
2.06      A large portion of the lower Serang basin, including Sedadi and
Klambu Kiri, is covered by irrigation systems. In the Klambu Kanan area,
minor streams are diverted to irrigate small areas scattered along the foot-
hills in the wet season. The Sidorejo project area has no irrigation.
2.07      The Sedadi irrigation system (previously known as the Glapan-Sedadi)
is the largest in the area. Most of the area receives irrigation water from
the Serang River through an intake structure (the Sedadi Weir) constructed in
1886, and remodelled in 1922 and 1976. There are four distinct irrigation
service areas. Two form the Sedadi area: (a) Serang (about 6,880 ha), served
by the secondary canal from the Sedadi River and a canal from the Tuntang
River at Glapan which provides an unreliable supply of excess water from the
6/   Detailed soil surveys have been carried out for all project areas.



Tuntang.  M4ost of :'.e area receives a fairlv reliable wec season water suppLy,
but dry season flows are adequace only for abouc 25Z of the area, and (b)
Tuntang-Serang (about 7,030 ha). supplied mainiy from the Sedadi Weir
suppLemented with excess water .rom tnie runtang River when avaiiable. An
additional pump intake for che main canal was constructed around 1970 at
Pondok on the Serang River. slightly upstream of the Wilalung diversion
structure, 29.4 km downstream from the Sedadi Weir. The Pondok intake was
badly silted up in 1973 and has not been used since. About 70% of the
Tuntang-Serang area has a reliable water supply for wet season rice but only
25Z receives water in che dry season.
2.08      The other cwo areas fail in Klambu Kiri:   (a) Pelayaran (about
10,560 ha) which recei7es water at the downstream end of the Si canal but is
Largely dependent on drainage water from the Tuntang-Serang area, fed into the
PeLayaran canal, about 10 km downstream from its junction with Si. SuppLies
are generally inadequate, particularly in the drv season, and ase of the
drainage return flow from Tuntang-Serang causes poor drainage conditions in
part of that area; and (b) Wedung (abouc 9,770 ha), which is supplied from the
iower section of the Serang or WuLan Rivers by means of a oumping station con-
structed at Karanganyar in 1968. Serious siltation problems and pump operat-
ing difficulties hamper a regular water supply. About 75Z of the Klambu Kiri
area has wet season irrigation buc only 25% has dry season water.
2.09      The structures of the Sedadi and Klambu Kiri system are, in general,
sound but several gates need replacing to receive water released from the
dam. Tertiary networks have been designed for the entire area, but have been
constructed only in Serang and Tuntang-Serang. ConstructiGn in the lower
parts of the Pelayaran and Wedung areas has been postponed until regular
flooding is prevented there, following completion of flood protection and
drainage works under the Irrigation XIV Project (Ln. 1811-IND).

2.10      Two power systems operate in Central Java under the Perusahaan
Listrik Negara (PLN, GOI's power authority): the Ketanger system to the west
and .the larger Tuntang system in the east. In addition, there are many
isolated diesel and a few micro-hydro units. The total installed generating
capacity in Central Java in 1984 was about 483 MW, comprising 80 MW (16.6Z) of
hydro, 300 MW (62%) oil-fired steam, 84 MW (17.5%) gas turbines and 19 MW
(3.9%) of diesel capacity. The total installed capacity has almost doubled
since 1979. The total firm capacity is about 250 MW (50%).
2.11      Demand for power in Central Java during 1978-83 increased by 26% a
year in peak, and 20% a year in energy, sales. With such dramatic increases,
it is expected that gas turbines and steam station capacity will be fully
utilized by the late 1980s. Any hydro station with even secondary power would
prove to be very economical in saving fuel costs from thermal stations. The
power component of the proposed project would help meet some of these require-
ments.

Town and Village Water Supplies
2.12      Protected water supplies are available only in the towns of Kudus,
Purwodadi, Demak and Pati, but only about 152 of the urban population is
served by these supplies. In ruraL areas, the onlv source of water is from
springs, wells, rivers and canals, and less than 10% of the rural population
has access to a protected water supply. Toward the coast, aLmost the entire
domestic water supply is untreated canal or river wacer. which is in short
supply and becomes heavily polluted as che dry season progresses. Under the
project, domestic, municipal and industrial water wouLd be augmented from the
dam to benefit people in the towns of Demak, Grobogan and Pati. Municipal
water will be treated at various points along the canais. GOI, assisted by
the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is currently identifying Ehe necessary water
supply investments, and their construction will be coordinated with this
project.
Agriculture
2.13      Some 69% of the gross project area of 82,600 ha is under rice or
secondary crops and 31X (25,310) is secttlements, dry fields, swamp lands, etc.
(Table 2.2). About 48% (27,350 ha) of the rice fields are irrigated and 52%
are rainfed wetlands (sawahs). About 50% of the rainfed ricelands are subject
to floods from the Serang River, but chey will largely be protected by drain-
age and flood mitigation works now being constructed under the Irrigation XIV
Project (Ln. 1811-IND). The same project will drain the 2,100 ha of permanent
swamps in Klambu Kanan, after which they will be reclaimed.

/a   Under Bank-assisted Irrigation XIV Project (Loan 1811-IND) to be completed
by the end of 1986.
2.14      The four project areas have varied levels of agricultural develop-
ment depending on the availability of water, drainage and flood protection.
In Sidorejo, production is entirely rainfed. Cropping intensity is high
(265%), mostly in maize and soybeans, but rice yields are low due to rainfed
conditions and the lack of irrigation. Klambu Kanan has wet season irrigated
rice on some 2,550 ha, and rainfed rice on about 15,300 ha, of which 10,000 ha
are affected by floods. The rainfed area will increase to about 17,600 ha as
a result of drainage improvements under the Irrigation XIV Project.  In the
dry season, irrigated rice is planted on about 1,000 ha, and maize and soybean
are planted over about half of the wet season cropped area. Klambu Kiri has
some 20,400 ha of wet season rice, of which 12,100 ha are irrigated and
8,300 ha are rainfed. Poor drainage on about 60% of the rainfed area is being
corrected by the Irrigation XIV Project. At present, dry season rice cropping
is possible on only about 500 ha due to the severe shortage of irrigation
water. In low drainage areas, half the fields are intercropped with maize and
soybean/mungbean, and in the dry season, chili, cucumber and watermelon are
grown. The Sedadi area has about 13,9G0 ha of wet season rice, 90% of which
is irrigated. Dry season rice is grown on about 6,300 ha, and triple cropping
is possible near the Sedadi weir on about 1,400 ha. Maize and soybean are
planted on about a third of the area which does not have a second rice crop.

Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.15      The Agricultural Census in 1983 indicated that farm land was distri-
buted among some 87,400 farms in the project area (Table 2.3). Almost 55% of
farms are less than 0.5 ha, which in conjunction with the high population den-
sity refleccs the pressure on land resources. Farm sizes cend to be smaller
in Sidorejo, particularly near the urban center of Purwodadi, -where 63% of
farms are below 0.5 ha. Almost 60% of farms are owner-overated. 31% are
operated by tenants and only 10% by sharecroppers. In most sharecropping
arrangements, the landlord and tenant share total oroduction, inpuc and hired
labor costs.  The tenant and his family provide their Labor. and the Landlord
pays the land tax. Land values and rentals vary considerably according co
productivity and demand, and are higher in Sidorejo and Kiambu Kanan (Table
2.4). The low averages for land values recorded for the Sedadi areas reflect
the poor water control and limited crop production in Klambu Kiri.

Population
2.16      In 1983, the project area had a predominantly rural population of
570,600 (about 125,000 households), distributed as shown in Table 2.5. The
relatively small household size (4.6 persons) and low population growth (1.64Z
per annum) are indicative of the impact of the family planning program. The
working age group (15-59 years) represents about 54Z of the local population,
although 42% of the project area population is under 14 years.

Employment
2.17      The workforce in the project area represents about 46Z of the total
populacion, reflecting a considerable degree of unemployment in addition to
non-pyeicipation for reasons such as schooling or household activities.
Data    f Eor 1982 indicate that agriculture provided employment for about 64Z
(209.000) of the total employed workforce of 261,000, or some 37Z of the total
population. Of the 87,000 farm households in the project area, some 33,000
consist of landless agricultural laborers. The opportunity for urban employ-
ment in the four major towns of Demak, Kudus, Pati and Purwodadi is limited,
although the seasonal tobacco industry in Kudus employs some 35,000 people.
Health
2.18      Most health problems, as elsewhere in Java, are related to diseases
commonly associated with poor nutritional standards and environmentaL sanita-
tion. The most common diseases are gastro-enteric and parasitic infections
(e.g., hookworm). Of primary concern under the proposed project are the
possible effects of project construction of a reservoir and new irrigation
systems    the incidence of water-borne and zoonetic diseases such as cholera,
malaria -  and filariasis.  The high incidence of malaria in irrigation areas
can be reduced by closure and draining of secondary and tertiary canals after
the establishment of dry season crops, which breaks the continuous vector
breeding cycle. This and other measures will therefore be taken under the
project to increase the effectiveness of malaria control programs in the
service areas (see para. 3.42(e)).
III. THE PROJECT
Objectives, Rationale for Bank Involvement and Scope
3.01      The major objectives of the project are to:  (a) increase food
production on some 59,340 ha through irrigation, and provide additional
employment opportunities, (b) control flooding in the upper and lower reaches
of the Serang River through construction of a dam which, together with works
under the Irrigation XIV Project (Ln. 1811-IND), will protect about 10,000 ha
of productive land in Klambu Kanan and 5,000 ha in urban areas; (c) supplement
municipal water supplies for about 300 villages and towns in the irrigation
area; (d) generate hydropower, mostly secondary power, which will result in
fuel savings at existing thermal stations; and (e) improve water management in
the project area.
7/   Kantor Statistics, Central Java Provincial Government.
8/   About 0.11-0.5Z of the population in most of the project areas is
infected with the dominant form of malaria (plasmodium vivaz), the
preferred breeding habitat for the vector being paddy lands. In multi-
cropped irrigation areas the infection rate probably exceeds 10X.



- 16 -
3.02      The recommended Bank participation is justified since (a) the 3ank
is supporting che overall develooment  rf the Jratunseluna Basin (para. 1.02)
through a series of Loans, and the Kedung Ombo Dam is a key component of this
development, (b) the Bank has oiayed a key role in the technical studies and
design of the project, and will be needed during implementation to assist GOI
to supervise the project, and (c) the oroject supports the sector strategies
agreLd with GOI for Bank irrigation assistance.
3.03      The main project components are as follows:
(a)  Dam and Irrigation Development
(i) construction of the Kedung Ombo Dam on the Serang River and
appurtenant structures;
(ii) construction of a new diversion structure at Sidorejo to
supply water for the Sidorejo svstem. and a new diversion
barrage at Klambu. with associated suppiy canals for the
Klambu Kiri and Klambu Kanan irrigation systems;
(iii) construction of two new irrigation systems: (a) the Sidorejo
system serving 6,100 ha; and (b) the Klambu Kanan system
serving 19,000 ha;
(iv) improvements to two existing systems: (a) the Sedadi system
of 13,910 ha; and (b) the Klambu Kiri system of 20,330 ha; and
(v) provision of supplemental municipal water suppLy for 300
villages and small towns through expansion of the irrigation
canal system.
(b)  Power Development
gi) construction of a powerhouse and installation of electrical
and mechanical equipment, for a generating capacity of 28.5
MVA;
(ii) construction of a 30 km single-circuit transmission line
(150 kV) and the substations to connect with the grid at
Purwodadi and Tanggung; and
(iii) construction of micro-hydro power pLants at the Klambu barrage
and the Sidorejo ana Sedadi weirs, including 30 km of 20 kV
transmission line.
(c)  Establishment of a Flood Warning and Water Monitoring Center at
Kudus for overall operation of the dam and irrigation systems.
(d) Technical Assistance for (i) training in dam construction
supervision, dam safety inspection, reservoir operation and water
quality management and monitoring; (ii) design of the Jatigede



- 17 -
irrigation systems; (iii) stucv oi upland soil and -water conserva-
tion in the cacchment area of the Jatigede Dam; (iv) surveys for
resettlement monitoring and compensation payments; and (v) surveys
and assistance for updating maps for reclassixicaEion ror land tax
(IPEDA) purposes.
Project Details
3.04      The Kedung Ombo Dam site is located on the Serang River near the
village of Kedung Ombo and is accessible by a 30 km all-weather road from the
town of Purwodadi. The drainage basin is 614 sq km. The selection of the
site was decided based on the availabilitv of construction materials and
hydrological considerations as the most suitable to regulate che maximum
quantity of water (85: of the annual flows) at the lowest cost per cu m of
water stored. The Dam wilL be a rockfiiLirandomfill embankment with a central
impervious core bounded by filter and gravel transition zones. rhe founda-
tions consist of interbedded claystones and sandstones and are considered
suitable for a fill type dam. The dam will be of 61 m maximum height and
1,600 m crest length. The total embankment volume will be 6.3 million cubic
meters (MCM). The design crest level is Elevation (EL) 96. with a full supply
level of EL 90. Minimum operating level is EL 64.5 below which the dead
storage is 88 MCM and above which the active storage is 635 MCM. The
reservoir surface area at maximum flood level EL 94.2 will be 60.4 sq km.
3.05      The appurtenant structures include:  (a) a concrete lined diversion
tunnel, 4 m in diameter and 325 m long through the right abutment of the dam,
which will discharge 180 cu m/sec during the design diversion flood of a 200-
year return period; (b) an ungated service spillway incorporating a 40 m long
ogee crest with a discharge capacity of 1,000 cu misec during a 15-day prob-
able maximum flood; (c) a 250 m wide emergency spillway incorporating a
2-element fuse plug embankment to prevent overtopping of the dam in the event
of an extreme flood (the estimated peak discharge during a 15-day probable
maximum flood is 4,540 cu m/sec); (d) a 51.7 m high reinforced concrete intake
structure and a 270 m long, 3.8 m diameter pressure conduit; and (e) an irri-
gation outlet, branching from the pressure conduit, controlled by a fixed
dispersion cone valve with a butterfly guard valve. These and other features
are indicated in Table 3.1 (see Annex 3, Table 1 and Figure 1).
3.06      Materials sources for the dam will be as follows:  (a) the rockfill
for the main cofferdam and upstream shell of the embankment will consist of
calcarenite from a source near the town of Juwangi, situated 15 km by a new
haul road from the damsite; (b) the downstream shell of the dam will consist
of randomfill of fresh claystone with interbedded sandstone, the main source
being a borrow area, about 1-1/2 km from the damsite, with the balance from
required excavation in the emergency spillway area; (c) the impervious core
will be weathered claystone, obtained from the dam abutments, and material
removed to expose the foundations; and (d) a 2.5 m thick filter drain con-
structed against the downstream boundary of the core, as well as filter
blankets and finger drains over the foundations downstream of the core, will
consist of processed andesite, brought from rock sources close to the site.

3.07      Durinz conscruction, the Serang River flow will be diverted through
the diversion tunnel by a coffer dam approximately 30 m high. The coffer dam
will be constructed in the first Piacement season and will form part of the
main body of the dam. A water controi plant will be installed in the intake
of the diversion tunnel to allow for irrigation releases to existing areas
during dam construction.
3.08      An instrumentation network of piezometers. settlement gauges,
extensometers and horizontal movement indicators will be inscalled to monitor
the behavior of che dam during and after the construction. The dam .s
designed and sized to maximize irrigation, although ic has multipurpose bene-
fits.  The optimum dam height was decided after nvdroLogicai, geologicai, and
soil investigations and simulation studies on reservoir operations.
3.09      Water Requirements were estimated for two rice crops over the entire
area and for secondary crops for 302 of the area. The wacer requirements were
estimated using the Penman formula and crop factors developed for Java by
DGWRD's Directorate of Irrigation II (DOI-II) and the International Rice
Research Institute (Philippines). Water requirements needed for the designed
dry year (one year in five years) vary from 1,880 mm co 2,023 mm per year for
the various areas. The maximum water duties for which canals were designed
vary from 1.35 to 1.5 liters per sec per ha (see Table 3.2).
3.10      Reservoir Characteristics and Operation.  The reservoir will have a
normal maximum operating water surface level (NWSL) of 90 m MSL, and minimum
operating level of 64.5 m MSL. When full (at NWSL) the reservoir will
inundate 46 sq km (4,600 ha) upstream of the dam. Its normal maximum operat-
ing capacity will be 635 million cubic meters (MCM). The dead storage volume
is 88 MCM. On the basis of simulation studies covering a 31-year hydrological
cycle, the average annual inflow to the reservoir is 796 MCM of which 647 MCM
will be released for irrigation, 108 MCM released for dump power to prevent
spilling, and 11 MCM for urban water supply, while 10 MCM will spill over the
dam (see Chart 26681). The dam thus will regulate 85Z of the upper Serang
River flows. The reservoir will be operated to guarantee that sufficient
water is available to meet the full water requirement for a cropping intensity
of 230Z with a 1% risk during the second rice crop season (50% rice crop loss
for one year in 31 years) and a 10Z risk during the secondary crop season
(three crops of secondary crops lost in 31 years) (see Chart 26681).
3.11      Releases from the dam will form 34% of total cropwater requirements,
with 66Z from rainfall and downstream uncontrolled riverflows (Table 3.2).
Riverflows must be forecast and rainfall monitored over the service areas
daily to provide flow data for reservoir operations and scheduling of dam
water. A telemetered hydro-meteorological network will be installed, linked
with a minicomputer operation at a Water Control Center to be established for
the project at Kudus.

3.12      The power generated is essentially due to irrigation releases, and
is incidencal. A totaL of 74 CWh of energy will be generated, of which peak
power of 14.6 GWh is about 10 MW for 4 hours daily for 952 of the year.
3.13      The Sidorejo irrigation system will provide irrigation and drainage
to a net area of 6,100 ha within a gross area of 9,230 ha. Water will be
supplied from the Kedung Ombo Dam, approximately 9 river km downstream through
a gated intake in a new diversion weir on the Serang River. In addition to
the diversion weir, the project works (see Table 3.3) include 87.3 km of
primary and secondary irrigatior canals, 46 km of inspection roads for opera-
tion and maintenance of the canaLs, 18 km of secondary drains, and appurtenant
structures. The Sidorejo system will be equipped with automated
hydrotechnical gates in the main and some secondary canals and flow modules
for all other secondary/tertiary canals over 6,100 ha on a pilot basis for
improved water management. The irrigation area will be divided into 109
tertiary umits, with an average size of 56 ha net irrigable area. The
tertiary facilities will comprise tertiary and quaternary canals and drains
and minor structures for up to 8-10 ha lots. Additional access roads of 31 km
will be constructed for better farmer access.
3.14      The Klambu Kanan system will supply water to a net irrigable area of
19,000 ha in a gross area of 24,000 ha. Works include the construction of a
new barrage at Klambu; 192 km of primary and econdary irrigation canals;
111 km of new and improved secondary drains,9 including some "river training'
works; and 107 km of inspection roads for operation and maintenance along the
irrigation and drainage canals. The irrigation area will be divided into 321
tertiary units with an average size of 59 ha net irrigable area. Additional
service roads (90 km) will also be constructed.
91   88 km of primary drains will be consLc.^ted under Irrigation XIV
(Ln. 1811-IND).

3.15      improvements to Existing Irrigation Systems.  For the Sedadi
irrigation area (13,910 ha), water will be supplied from the Sedadi weir which
will be upgraded. Capacity of the main Si canal (41 km) (see Map le529) will
be increased at the upstream end from 12 to 21 cms to supply the 13,910 ha.
The supply from the Tuntang River via the Tl canal will be diverted to supply
the Tuntang irrigation systems. One secondary canaL will be expanded. che
S2/S16 (10 km) canaL, and most secondary canals (58 km) will have minor
adjustments (Table 3.3). Tertiary systems have been completed, but minor
adjustments in the structures will be made to accommodate changes in the
secondary canal.  Main (58 km) and secondary (66 km) drains will be
rehabilitation. Additional inspection roads (20.5 km iong) will be
constructed (see Annex 3 for details).
3.16      Klambu Kiri will have its main and tertiary canal system upgraded
with new tertiaries in 50Z of the Lower area (Wedung). A new (twin) main
canal (16 km) parailel to the Si canaL will be constructed from the Klambu
barrage (see Map 18529) to provide water for the entire 20,330 ha.  The only
other supply will be the Sedadi-Pelayaran (7.9 km) secondary canal connecting
the main canal to che Pelayaran canal. Adjustments will be made to a further
24 km of main canal to increase its capacity. Major adjustments will be made
on the secondary canals (128 km) in the Wedung area and modevate adjustments
will be made on canals (41 km) in the Pelayaran area. The main system
structures in Wedung and the Pelayaran area require major adjustments or
replacement (see Table 3.3). Main drains (97 km) are being upgraded under
Ln. 1811-IND while secondary drains (164.5 km) will be constructed under this
project.

3.18      New Diversion Structures will consist of the Sidorejo and Klambi
barrage/weirs (see Annex 3. TabLe 3 for details). The Sidorejo weir is a aew
weir located on the Serang River 9 km from the dam which will divert water for
the Sidorejo scheme. The weir is a concrete overflow structure 10 m high and
80 m crest length with a primary canal intake on the left side of the weir.
The diversion barrage will be on the Serang River near Klambu. The barrage
consists of a crested concrete weir 8 m high and 93 m wide.  The left and
right irrigation intakes pass through desilting basins; the left intake feeds
the new twin main canal to the Klambu Kiri scheme and the right feeds the new
main canal to the Klambu Kanan system.
3.19      Hydropower Stations and Transmission Line.  The main power station
will be located on the left bank at che toe of the dam; this affords the most
economical aligwnent and provides no interference with the spillway. Mhe
plant wiLl consist of one Kaplan-type turbine with 22.5 MW design power. and a
three phase vertical shaft generator, with a power rating of 28.5 MVA.  The
capacity and unit size of the plant were determined as optimum taking into
account the economies of secondary power generation utilizing the high irriga-
tion releases and spilLs from the reservoir. The generated power will be
stepped up to 150 kV through a switchyard at the powerhouse for transmission
to Purwodadi and Tanggung substations, 30 km away via a single circuit trans-
mission Line. Also included will be the construction and installation of 3
micro-hydro power stations, 1.8 MVA each, at the Sidorejo and Sedadi weirs and
the Klambu barrage, with associated substations and a transmission line 30 km
long at 20 kV to Purwodadi. The construction of the micro-hydro will be
subject to a detailed feasibility study.
3.20      A Flood Warning and Water Monitoring Center will serve to (a) warn
the entire river basin of possible floods in the Serang and Lusi basins; and
(b) schedule water to the various irrigation systems in the basin based on the
availability of water in the river systems and the inflow to the Kedung Ombo
reservoir, and on the rainfall over the irrigation service areas. The
construction of the center includes: (a) a master control center at Kudus
with a building (1,000 sq n) and facilities including auxiliary power supply;
(b) a network of telemetered rainfall and water level stations (100) in the
catchment area of the Lusi, Serang and Muria basins; (c) operational
communication and computer systems with software for rainfall and river flow
analysis, flood forecasting and water scheduling; and (d) a radar computer
facility to interface with existing radar at the Bureau of Meteorology and
Geophysics in Semarang (for advance warning of rainfall). There will be one
supply contractor for che equipment, computers and software, who will install,
maintain and operate the system and train the staff for a period of two years
after installation. Details of the system are given in Annex 7.
3.21      Technical Assistance for Training will focus on dam construction,
dam safety inspection, reservoir operation studies and water quality
management and monitoring:

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Some special equipment for inspection
purposes will be procured (Annex 5).
(b) Computer-based Reservoir Operation and Water Resources Analysis
Training will be for DGWRD and IHE staff who are heavily involved in
physical and mathematical model analysis on use of several
generalized operational hydrologic and hydraulic computer
software. The type of computer software covers hydrologic water
control and reservoir system analysis and water resources planning
analysis. Three experts from institutions like the Hydrologic
Engineering Center (HEC) of the U.S. Corps of Engineers will train
IHE staff to set up some 35 HEC operational software in the IHE
computer systems and train the staff to apply the use of these
software to their reservoir operating rules, hydrologic and
hydraulic problems. The training will be composed of six 3-week
intermittent sessions interspersed over 18 months in order to ensure
that IHE can apply the HEC software on actual problems faced in
their day-to-day operation.
Cc) Water Quality Management and Monitoring training will consist of:
Ci) on-the-job training of staff with foreign expert inputs of 24
man-months in IHE's Division of Environmental Water Quality (DEWQ)

Consulting Services
3.23      Consultants (265 man-months foreign and 385 man-months local) will
be recruited by DCWRD's Directorate of Irrigation II (DOI-II) to supervise
construction of the dam (see Annex 6). They will prepare working drawings and
will be responsible for supervision of dam and powerhouse construction (para.
4.04). GOI wishes to appoint the foreign consultant Snowy Mountains
Engineering Corporation (SMEC) which designed the dam and powerhouse as
consultants for construction supervision and equipment installation. The
proposed contract for SMEC was reviewed during negotiations and appointment of
the consultants will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
3.24      An expatriate consultant will be recruited to supervise establish-
ment of the Flood Warning and Water Monitoring System (18 man-months) and
additional consultants for water quality training (24 man-months). Local and
foreign consultants (469 and 165 man-months, respectively) will be recruited
to bupervise irrigation system construction to assist the Irrigation Project
Office (para. 4.04). Consultants for detailed design of irrigation works,
construction supervision of the diversion tunnel and bid evaluation of the dam
have been recruited under Loan 1811-IND and have been in place since September
1984 (see Annex 6).
3.25      Consultants (510 man-months; 450 man-months local and 60 man-months
foreign) will also be recruited for the Jatigede irrigation designs
(para. 3.22) Terms of reference for the designs have been reviewed and agreed
by the Bank. The consultants will be recruited in September 1985.

Status of Project Preparation
3.26      The designs and all major investigations for the main dam and power-
house have been completed. Bidding documents have been reviewed by the Bank
and found satisfactory. The schedule for tendering the main dam and
powerhouse for international comperitive bidding CICB) is: invitations were
issued on August 6, 1984 for 19 Drequalified contractors; bids were opened on
December 6, 1984; DGWRD' s recommendation for cender award -was on February 28,
1985 and the award will be in .av 1985. A condition of loan effectiveness
will be the signing oi the concract -sr dam and powerhouse construction.
Designs for che diversion tunnel. base camp and hauL road have been reviewed
by the Bank. Their construction is under way by local contractors and will be
completed prior zo the contract award for the main dam. These initial works
have been fully funded by GOI, and demonstrate GOI's incenc to oroceed with
the project.
3.27      Geotecnnical investigation and detailed surveys and designs for the
Klambu barrage and all other major irrigation structures and canals have been
completed. Detailed designs for secondary and tertiary systems will be
completed in stages by the end of 1986. The existing designs and
investigations for these systems are to a sufficient standard for computing
firm cost estimates. Detailed tender documents and specifications would be
available in mid-1986 for calling of tenders for the irrigation works (see
Annex 4). Detailed specification and designs for the Flood Monitoring System
have been completed, are being reviewed by the Bank, and will be tendered in
July 1985.
3.28      Land acquisition for the area (340 ha) around the dam site has been
completed and about 300 families have transmigrated. The GOI has firm plans
to acquire most of the settled land in the proposed reservoir area by
1987/88. The Governor of Central Java has set up coordinating committees for
(a) land acquisition and (b) resettlement.
Dam Safety
3.29      A panel of three international dam experts have been recruited, have
reviewed design and tender documents for the dam, and have found the designs
and investigations satisfactory. This panel will continue to review any
design modifications and safety arrangements needed during construction up
till 1990. GOI will keep the Bank continually informed of the panel's
findings (para. 4.02). Dam safety inspections will be performed by ;HE
inspection teams on a routine basis (twice a year or more frequently) after
the dam is completed. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that by
December 31, 1989 IHE wilL submit for the Bank's review a plan for the
proposed dam inspection arrangements, and will carry out such plan as
acceptable to the Bank.

Implementation Schedule
3.30      The implementation schedule for the project is presented in
Annex 4.  The dam will be compLeted in four years (by early 1989) while the
irrigation system construction will be completed in six years (by mid-
1991). The implementation targecs are modest in terms of what has been
achieved in dam and irrigation construction in Indonesia.
Cost Estimates
3.31      Total project costs are estimated at US$283.1 million (excluding
taxes of US$17.2 million) of which US$122.7 million (or 44%) will be foreign
exchange. Project costs are expressed in January 1985 prices and at an
exchange rate conversion of Rp 1,100 = US$1.00. Unit rates for the irrigation
system are based on similar irrigation works in the project area, and for the
dam on the lowest bid prices of the ICB tenders which were submitted in
December 1984.  A 19 i   allowance for physical contingencies has been
included for the dam, 15Z for the irrigation works, and 5% on consultant
services and special equipment. Expected price increases total about 21Z of
the base cost and were estimated on the basis of the following inflation
rates: for local costs 8% in 1985-90, 5% thereafter; and on foreign costs, 5%
in 1985, 7.5Z in 1986, 8% in 1987-90, 5Z thereafter. Details of project costs
are given in Annex 1, Table 1 and are sumnarized in Table 3.4.
10/ 20Z for the dam embankment, 15Z for appurtenant structures and and 10%
for the power plant.

Financing
3.32      The proposed loan of US$156 million (see Annex 1, Table 6) will
finance about 60Z of total project costs excluding taxes (US$17.2 million),
reserve procurement of vehicles (US$2.1 million) and equipment for the power
component (US$21.3 million) wnich will be financed by export credits. The
loan will finance the remaining Eoreign exchange costs (US$104.1 million) of
the project and US$51.9 million of local costs. GOt wiLl finance the balance
of the costs of US$105.8 million (Table 3.5) and is arranging for financing of
the power component by export credits to be available by December 1985. The
proposed cost sharing arrangements are justified since (a) the project
benefits almost entireiy low-income farmers or iandless agricultural laborers
(paras. 6.05-6.06), and (b) without external assistance COI would have to slow
down implementation to che detriment of economic viabilicy.

Procurement
3.33      Civil Works.  The dam and associated works (US$43.7 million) will be
constructed through a single contract procured using international competitive
bidding (ICB) procedures. The Klambu barrage, Klambu Kanan main canal and
Sidorejo weir (US$35.0 million) will be contracted through ICB. A series of
about 56 smaller contracts (US$77.0 million) will construct a series of
smaller and widely dispersed irrigation works which are unlikely to attract
foreign contractors. For these, local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures
open to foreign contractors and acceptable to the Bank will be used. Table
3.6 summarizes procurement arrangements under the project.

Review of Procurement
3.35      All civil works contracts are reviewed by the Procurement Control
Unit (DCWRD) and for contracts Larger than US$500,000. clearance must aLso be
obtained from the Ministry of Public Works procurement unit and the SEKNEG -
the State Secretariat. The Bank reviews contract evaluation and award through
its RSI (Resident Staff. Indonesia) which works closeLy with these agencies on
procurement matters. The 3ank has reviewed the contract cocuments for the dam
(US$43.7 million) and found them sacis.actory. The Bank will review prior to
tendering and award about 24 additional contracts (USS79.0 million) each
valued at over USS1.5 miLlion. About 32 other contracts (US$33 million), each
valued at less than USS1.5 million, will be reviewed by the Procurement
Control Unit, and subsequently by the Bank, on a sample basis after award.
The two ICB contracts for equipment (totaLling US$11.2 million) will be
reviewed by the Bank prior to tendering. Equipment procured in smalL lots not
exceeding US$0.2 million in value will be reviewed after award on a sample
basis.

Disbursements will be made against contracts, except for training costs and
civil works costs for contracts Less than USS1.5 million -hich wiLl be
disbursed against statements of expenditure (Annex 10)._1I  rhe proposed
allocation of loan proceeds is presented in Annex 1, Table o.  rhe disburse-
ment profile (Annex 1, Table 7) is projected over a six-year period from
September 1985 to June 1991. The profile follows fairly closelv tne
Indonesian and Bankwide disbursement profiles for similar works. Loan Closing
is expected by December 31, 1991.
Accounts, Audits and ReDorting
3.37      Detailed separate accounts and records are kept by DGWRD and PLN for
each budget item by project and budget year. Carrv-overs of unspent funds
(SIAP) are permitted for two vears.  3ecause SIAPs are permitted, cash books
and accounts are not closed until the budeet for the Line item has been fully
spent. Project accounts are subiecc-to two audits: (a) by the Inspector
General of the Ministry of PubLic Works (MPW), and (b) by the Financial and
Development Supervisory Board (BPKP). The work of both auditors has been
found to be generally satisfactory on Bank-assisted irrigation projects.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that adequate and separate accounts
will be maintained: all contracts, orders and receipts will be kept for at
luast one year after loan closing; and independent audits by BPKP of each
year's accounts will be submitted to the Bank within nine months of the cLose
of each GOI fiscal year. Assurances were also obtained that DGWRD would
prepare a Project Completion Report which will be submitted no later than six
months after loan closing.
Environmental Impact
3.38      Resettlement.  Senior environmental specialists and managers from
the Institute of Ecology, Padjadjaran University, supervised by international
consultants, have been involved since 1981 in identifyir7 the detailed reset-
tlement needs of the project, and preparing an environmental impact
assessment.
3.39      In 1982, the Government of Central Java set up a coordination
committee at the provincial and district levels to coord:nate the transmigra-
tion and resettlement of the popuLation to be inundated by the reservoir. The
coordination committee is responsible to: (a) carry out `.tailed surveys of
the area through the provincial Agraria for purposes of compensation of land
and facilities; (b) supervise land transactions; and (c) establish resettle-
ment and transmigration implementation teams to coordinate with the peopLe
affected.
11/  A revolving fund wilL not be used in the proposed project because of
existing prefinancing arrangements with GOI for the irrigation sector.
The introduction of such a fund for future projects is being discussed
with GOI.

3.40      Some 5,390 families (23.380 oeopie) in 2C vilLages wiil be relo-
cated.  About 12,200 of these people are in che iabor force and 50  are far-
mers, 27% are Laborers, 18Z are unempioyed, and 5% have other employmenc.
Sample surveys of villages show chat 55% of the people nave incomes below the
minimum poverty level. Popuiacion densities vary from 860 to 1,060 people/sa
km. In the most recent survey in 1983, 75Z of the famiLies wanted to trans-
migrate. Resettlement within the catcnmenc is discouraged because of _ne very
high population density and the low productivity of the upland areas. ReDre-
sentacives of the affected villages have visited the proposed transmigracion
sites in Irian iaya and Bengkulu in Sumatra, and were sacisfied wich Ehe
sites. Some 300 families have already cransmigraced. The Proiect Office. in
cooperation with the Central Java Provincial Coordinating Committee. has ore-
pared a resettlement plan, compensation payments and schedules acceDcable to
the Bank (see Table 3.7). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
GOI will provide adequate and timely budgecary resources for compensation pav-
ments and will provide the Bank with annual reports on the resectlement,
compensation, and welfare of people affected by the reservoir construction
commencing December 31, 1985.

3.41      Judging from the experience gained on similar dam sites in Central
Java, the present number (25%) of all families who preferred relocation in
Java will probably decrease to 1OZ as transmigration accelerates. The remain-
ing 10% have land outside the catchment, or may choose to live with rela-
tives. For these people, the Kabupatan Coordinating Development Comittee
will give them preference for vocational training, work in local rural works
programs, and in the project's civil works construction program (see Annex 8).

3.42      Other environmental aspects of the project include:
(a) The dam will substantially reduce flooding in the upper Serang River
at the junction of the Serang and Lusi. The upper Serang with the
modified flows will peak in the dry season. The present flooding
downstream of the basin will also be substantially reduced;
(b) The Serang and Lusi watersheds are the subject of a recently
approved Upland Agriculture and Conservation Project (Ln. 2474-IND)
supported by the USAID and the Bank. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that the measures taken for catchment procection under
this loan will focus on soil and water conservation. in addition,
studies will be undertaken by the Directorate General of Land
Rehabilitation and Reforestation (DGLRR) for improved soil and water
conservation for the proposed Jatigede Dam catchment on che Ci.anuk
River;
(c) Public health will be improved due to the increased quantity and
quality of water available year-round for drinking. Assurances -were
obtained during negotiations that a plan for a continuous canal
water quality monitoring system will be established by the IHE in
consultation with the Provincial Health Services by December 31,
1988 and the system will be in place by June 30, 1991;
Cd) There are no archaeological sites or artifacts of any significance
in the area to be submerged. Construction of the project is also
not expected to adversely affect fauna in the valley; and
Ce)  Public health authorities, with the cooperation of the Project
Office, will intensify malaria control efforts as the irrigation and
cropping patterns intensify, since some of the vectors are present
and there is some incidence of malaria in the project area.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations on appropriate measures for
malaria control in the project area.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT

powerhouse, major diversion, irrigation and drainage works. PLN, under the
Ministry of Mines and Energy, will be responsible for the construction of the
superstructure of the powerhouse, electrical and mechanical facilities,
equipment installation for the powerhouse, and construction of the
transmission line.
4.02      DGWRD will carry out its responsibilities through its Directorate of
Irrigation II (DOI-II) (see Chart 26628). A panel of dam experts, established



- 35 -
to review designs, will continue to review design modifications, safety and
economy throughout conscruc:ion. and report to DOI-II (para. 3.29).
Assurances were obtained ac aegotiations that the dam panel's comments prior
to and during construction regarding safety and economy in construction shail
be properLy taken into accounc and that their periodic reports shall be made
available to che Bank not :.acer than one month afrer each visit. IHE will
organize the inspection teams on a routine basis (three times a year) for a
period of five years to perform dam safety inspections. IHE in consultation
with the Directorate oi Rizers (DOR), DOI-I and DOI-II will implement the
training component of the project.  IHE with DOI-II's Project Office will
establish the Flood Warning and Water Monitoring Center.
4.03      PLN will implement the power component (see Chart 26718) through its
Directorate of Construction, which will manage the consultancs for the power
station, and the procurement and instalLation of the electrical and mechanicaL
-equipment according to the schedule shown in Annex 4. An assurance to this
effect was obtained during negotiations.
Field Level Organization and Management
4.04      At the field level. DOI-II's Jratunseluna General Project Office
which was established in 1976 in Semarang, will be responsible for the
project.  To manage day-to-day supervision of construction this office has two
Project Offices for the Kedung Ombo Dam and Irrigation (Chart 26629). The
Kedung Ombo Dam Project Office is located in the town of Purwodadi, with a
site office at the dam location. The Government wishes to continue the
services of consultants, SMEC, who will be responsible for supervising
construction of the dam at the site (Chart 26630). The Irrigation Project
Office has been established at the town of Godong, and will be responsible for
supervision of construction of all irrigation works, assisted by local and
some foreign consultants (Chart 26631). The present and future staff needs
are shown in Table 4.1. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that
all staffing requirements will be met by September 30, 1985 for the Dam
Project Office and by January 31, 1986 for the Irrigation Project Office, and
that vehicles required for implementation will be provided on a timely basis.

4.05      For the power component, the Central Java Hydropower and Transmis-
sion Project Offices of PLN in Semarang will be responsible for day-to-day
supervision of the project. The Hydropower Project Office will set up a
Project Office at the dam site to supervise construction of the powerhouse and
the installation of the generator sets. The transmission line contractor will
be supervised by the Transmission Office of Central Java in Semarang.
4.06      IHE's Division of Hydrology will establish by June 1986 a Subproject
Office within the Jratunseluna General Project Office to implement the Flood
Warning and Water Monitoring System. This Subproject Office will supervise
the contractors responsible for the installation of telemetry, the water leveL
monitoring stations, computers, and software in the Kudus Water Control
Center, and will work closely with the Provincial Public Works Office in
Semarang, the new Regional (wilayah) office of Pati, and with the Project
Offices for the Dam and Irrigation. The Jratunseluna General Project Office
will also be responsible to ensure that the Water Control Center at Kudus will
be adequately staffed and sufficiently trained by the contractor to manage the
water allocation and flood warning operations (para. 4.09).



- 37 -
4.07      IHE through its Training Divison will be responsible for all train-
ing components in the project. IHE will coordinate with the relevant dir-
ectorates in DGWRD to organize training, including the recruitment of experts
to teach the dam construction, dam inspection and reservoir operations
courses. The dam construction, dam safety and reservoir operations courses
will be scheduled for 1986 and 1987. Participants in these courses will be as
follows: three each from the iratunseluna Office and the three Project
Offices; two each from DOI-I, DOI-II and DOR; and three from tHE. Course
material will follow that used by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
Project Coordination
4.08      Since agencies from three Ministries at the national, provincial and
kabupaten levels are involved in the project, effective coordination of proj-
ect activities will be needed at all stages and levels. The following
arrangements have been established and are shown on Chart 26718. DGWRD as the
principal executing agency wilL coordinate with PLN's central office and the
Directorate General of Civil Government and Autonomy (DGCGA) under the
Ministry of Home Affairs at the national level. At the field level the
Jratunseluna General Project Office will coordinate with the newly established
Kedung Ombo Development Coordinating Team under the Office of the Governor of
Central Java. The Project Offices for the dam and irrigation will coordinate
with the subteams of the Development Coordinating Teams at the kabupaten level
for all land and water control and agricultural aspects of the project. The
Jratunseluna General Project Office will also coordinate with the Central Java
Hydropower and Transmission Project Units of PLN for all aspects of the power
component.
Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
4.09      Organization for O&M. At present the four project irrigation areas
fall in three irrigation regional (wilayah) offices (i.e., Wilayah Pati,
Semarang and Surakarta) and four irrigation sectional (seksi) offices. During
negotiations assurances were obtained that the Provincial Irrigation Service
in Central Java will reorganize its irrigation offices and operations by April
1, 1989 (two years before project completion) as follows:
(a) reconfigure the wilayah boundaries so as to follow watershed
boundaries of catchments, and, for the project irrigation, all areas
will fall under one wilayah office (called the Pati Wilayah) with
its headquarters at Kudus (Map 18531);
(b) establish a new seksi office for the operation of the dam;
(c) establish the four project irrigation areas under three seksi
(Serang Bawah, Serang Atas and Pati). The Serang Bawah Seksi will
be responsible for the maintenance of all waterways in the lower
Serang;



- 38 -
(d) for the operation of the project, a Water Allocation Committee will
be set up composed of the four seksi representatives (Serang Bawah,
Serang Atas, Pati and Kedung Ombo). The Committee will meet at
least once a week. or more frequently as needed, at Kudus to
determine the weekly operating rules for water releases from the
dam, and proposed allocations for the various systems; and
(e) the Water Control Center at Kudus with all the necessary telemetric,
hydrologic and hydraulic information will advise the Water
Allocation Committee (WAC) on the possible options for water
allocation for the various systems and the releases from the dam.
Water allocation will be decided by the WAC. The Water Control
Center will have adequately trained staff, who will be in place by
April 1, 1989, two years prior to project completion.
4.10      initial Operations and Maintenance (O&M).  During construction, the
Irrigation Project Office will be responsible for O&M of the new irrigation
systems (Klambu Kanan and Sidorejo). O&M of the existing Sedadi and Klambu
Kiri systems will remain the responsibiLity of the Central Java Provincial
Irrigation Services under the existing Serang Atas and Serang Bawah irrigation
section offices. O&M of the tertiaries and quaternaries will be the
responsibility of existing water user organizations (see Map 18534) and new
ones to be organized in newLy developed areas. After completion of construc-
tion, the Project Offices, together with the new Water Control Center at
Kudus, will be responsible for O&M of the dam, the Klambu barrage, the new
twin canal leading to Klambu Kiri, and the Klambu Kanan and Sidorejo systems
for a period of not less than two years. On completion of the power station,
PLN will set up its own site office close to the dam site which will be
responsible for O&M of the power station. This office will be under PLN's
Region XIII Office located at Semarang.  PLN's site office will coordinate
with the Project Office during the initial period of operation.
4.11      PLN will enter into an agreement with DGWRD and the Provincial
Covernment by July 31, 1989, prior to the commissioning of the power station,
providing, among other things, operational rules and criteria for utilization
of reservoir water for irrigation and power purposes. In the event that any
substantial changes in the cropping pattern and/or irrigation releases from
the dam are proposed which could affect power generation, DGWRD will consult
PLN before such changes are adopted. The Government will inform the Bank of
any such proposed changes in sufficient time to give an opportunity to
comment. A share (50Z) of the cost of operation and maintenance of the intake
of the dam and irrigation/power tunnel will be borne by PLN. PLN will bear
the cost of O&M of the powerhouse. Assurances on the above were obtained at
negotiations.
4.12      Sustained O&M.  Two years after completion of construction,
responsibility for O&M of the dam, Klambu barrage, main linking canals, and
main system irrigation and drainage for the Klambu Kanan and Sidorejo sub-
systems will be turned over to the Provincial Irrigation Services of Central
Java (Kedung Ombo, Serang Atas and Pati irrigation section offices, respect-
ively). PLN's regional office (Region XIII) will continue to undertake O&M of
the power station. Day-to-day operation of the entire irrigation system and



- 39 -
dam will be controLled by the newLy established Water Control Center's Water
Allocation Committee at Kudus.  PLN's new office at the dam site will be res-
ponsible for the operation of the power station. In addition, the three
irrigation seksi will be responsible for day-to-day operations of the three
irrigation subsystems up to the tertiary level in the service area. The water
users associations will continue to be responsible for OL& of the tertiary and
quaternary canals (see Map 18534). New associations will be formed in the
newly irrigated areas. Within each irrigation seksi the overall water
allocation will be determined by the existing irrigation advisory committees
(Panitia Pengairan) at the village levels.
4.13      O&M of the canal inspection roads is carried out in conjunction with
the O&U for irrigation. The O&M of the kecamatan and village roads will be
performed by the local kabupaten public works offices.
4.14      O&M staffing needs for the various irrigation section offices are
indicated in Annex 9, Table 1. O&M cost allocations which should adequately
cater for the dam, irrigation and downriver works are US$0.50 million, US$0.89
million, and US$0.34 million, respectiveLy, and are based on existing irriga-
tion O&M costs for the Serang Bawah and Atas Section offices for irrigation
(see Annex 9, Tables 2 and 3) and on future needs. The average costs per ha
for dam, irrigation and downriver works are US$8.40/hatyr, US$15.00/ha/y-r and
US$5.8O0haIyr, respectively (see Annex 9. Table 4). An assurance was obtained
during negotiations that adequate (as indicated in Annex 9, Table 4) and
timely funding and staffing will be provided for 0& (para. 6.09).
4.15      Monitoring and Evaluation (MXE). M&E of the project during and
after implementation are important to ensure that project objectives are
met. The N&E information on water management will be obtained from telemetric
data on every 1,000 ha, available through the water control center at Kudus,
and from information gathered by irrigation section and subsection offices and
by village water masters. The M&E information on agricultural production,
input supply, etc. will be gathered by agricultural extension workers (PPLs,
PPMs. etc.) and by village contract farmers and village chiefs. The evalua-
tion of the general performance of the irrigation systems would be performed
at three levels (the village, kabupaten, and regional (wilayah)) through
government-established committees known as "Penitia Pengairan" using the
above information. The committees have representatives from local government
irrigation, agriculture and district sectional offices. The village, district
and regional level committees meet at bimonthly and monthly frequencies. In
the existing irrigation areas in Sedadi and Klambu Kiri, these committees are
operational and functioning satisfactorily. For the new irrigation areas, GOI
legislation requires that committees will be set up prior to the completion of
the project.

V. AGRICULTURAL SERVICES AND PRODUCTION
Agricultural Services
5.01      Agricultural support services in the project area are being streng-
thened by several Bank-assisted projects and government programs. Ongoing
projects include the Second National Agricultural Extension Project (NAEP II,
Cr. 996-IND) and the Seeds II Project (Ln. 2066-IND). The main source of
inputs for rice production in the four project area districts is the Govern-
ment's INMAS program.  The INMAS program provides Earmers with subsidized HYV
seed, fertilizer and agrochemicals and technical advisory services by field
extension staff. Under the program, farmers pay cash for the production
inputs which are supplied through the local outlets. Since 1979 a group
approach called the INSUS program has also been expanding in the project
area. The objective of the INSUS program is to encourage farmer groups in an
area of not less than 10 ha, to organize land preparation and planting within
specific time limits, to organize water management, to use HYVs and
fertilizer, etc. In 1984/85, the INSUS program covered almost 80% of the
total planted area in the project districts.
5.02      Crop production intensification methods with use of HYVs and
fertilizer inputs are well established in the project area, and during each of
the past five years data on fertilizer use and farm surveys indicate that
improved technology has been adopted on more than 90% of the area planted with
rice. Seeds, fertilizer and pesticides are readily available in the project
area, and no supply constraint is expected under the project. Extension
services under the Directorate General of Food Crops Agriculture are also
adequate.
5.03      Crop Marketing.  About 90% of the marketable surplus of rice in the
project area is sold by farmers as padi to private traders or millers. The
numerous private traders operating in villages in the area provide competition
and offer services such as farm collection and drying of produce. About 370
private rice mills and 26 government mills serve the project area subdis-
tricts, and almost 200 rice mills are located within the project area bounda-
ries. Milling capacity is expected to be adequate for incremental production
under the project. Marketing of palawija crops is handled almost entirely by
private traders, and well-established marketing channels exist, especially for
soybean and mungbean. In order to cater for increased marketing needs as a
result of the project, market and village access roads will be constructed
under Government's INPRES program. Village Class V roads will be upgraded to
Class IV roads in ledadi/Klambu Kiri (57 km); Klambu Kanan (10 km); and
Sidorejo (11 km).1   New farm-to-market roads will be constructed in
Sedadi/Klambu Kiri (42.5 km); Klambu Kanan (73 km); and Sidorejo (335 km).
Assurances on the access road construction program were obtained at
negotiations.
12/ Class V and IV roads are, respectively, 3.0 and 3.5 meter wide, sealed
all-weather roads.

Changes in Crop Production under the Project
5.04      The project will increase agricultural production on about 59,340 ha
in the Serang River Basin. The major crops grown are rice, maize, soybeans,
mungbeans and sorghum. Minor crops such as groundnuts, sugar and cassava have
been ex.cluded from the analysis.  The main benefits will result from the
provision of a reliable and timeLy supply of adequate irrigation water and the
mitigation of flood damage, allowing production of two crops of irrigated rice
in the project area followed by secondary (palawija) crop production on about
one third of the area.
5.05      Cropped Areas and YieLds.  Overall cropping intensity for rice will
increase from a current (weighted) average of about 105% in the four areas to
200Z at full deveLopment. Cropping intensities for the total cropped area
(rice plus palawija) will increase from a present weighted average of about
175% to 230% with the project at full development (Table 5.1).

Tb   Weighted.
0c   High cropping intensities of 240% have been achieved in the Jatiluhur Project
over 200,000 ha (Irrigation V, Cr. 512).
5.06      Based on water availability and the existing technology available to
farmers, a cropping intensity of 230% with the project is reasonable. Thnis
change results in an incremental area of 83,430 ha growing rice (wet and dry
season), an 236% increase over the present. The area planted with palawija
crops will decline by 20,200 ha or 52% (Table 5.2). The only net increase in
commandable area is in Klambu Kanan where a 15% increase occurs due to the
impact of drainage activities under the Irrigation XIV Project (Ln. 1811-IND).

5.07      Paddy yields are expected to improve by about 25% to 55% over the
four areas and palawija yields by about 8-35% with the project (Table 5.3).
The expected future yield estimates are shown in Annex 2, Table 3. The
projected yield estimates take into account both the impact of the Irrigaticn
XIV Project (due to be completed at end-1986) and the negative impact of any
continuing flood problems in the area.
5.08      Production.  Paddy production in the area will rise substantially
from about 0.20 million tons per year in 1984 to about 0.54 million tons per
year with both the proposed project and Irrigation XIV. Incremental annual
rice production at full development (1993) will be about 0.34 million tons,
but secondary crop production will decline by about 12,780 tons from the
current level of output. Eliminating the impact of the Irrigation XIV
Project, incremental rice production due solely to the proposed project will
be about 0.29 million tons per year at full development, but palawija produc-
tion may decline by 35,480 tons per year (Table 5.4). These increases in
agricultural production will generate about US$41 million in annual
incremental agricultural benefits (Annex 2, Table 11).

VI. MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      Central Java is only now approaching self-sufficiency in rice.
Although the world price of rice has fallen sharply (para. 6.02) almost
eliminating the subsidy received by farmers, production will be encouraged to
guarantee the stability of Central Java's rice self-sufficiency and provide
surplus rice for other regions. Thus marketing prospects for paddy should
remain favorable, and in the event of lower prices, farmers are expected to
increase palawija crop production.



-45-
Prices
6.02      Economic and financial prices for major agricultural inputs and
outputs are presented in Annex 2. Table 1. Estimated farm inputs and outputs
are valued in constant January 1985 prices in farm budgets and economic
analyses. Economic prices for rice, maize, soybean, mungbean, sorghum and
fertilizers are based on the world market price forecasts produced by the
Bank's Commodities and Export Projections Division adjusted for
transportation, processing and handling costs to che farmgate. Financial
prices for all commodities and economic prices for inputs not traded
internationally have been updated from actual farmgate orices. In the past,
COI maintained low consumer food prices by subsidizing the sale of imported
rice and holding domestic floor prices Low. To offset an adverse impact on
producers, GOI subsidized fertilizer and pesticide prices. in recent years in
order to encourage production, paddy floor prices have been raised consider-
ably. In addition, recent declines in the world rice prices have contributed
to almost eliminating the rice subsidy. For project analysis, financial
prices of rice have been assumed to converge with economic prices. To dis-
courage the excessive use of fertilizers and reduce subsidy elements, COI, in
early 1983, raised the price of urea and triple superphosphate (TSP) from Rp
70/kg (unchanged since 1977) to Rp 90/kg. However, the domestic price is
still below the border price and is expected to remain low in the 1990s.
Farm Incomes
6.03      Three typical farm sizes (0.2 ha, 0.4 ha, 0.6 ha) have been selected
for farm income analysis in Sidorejo and Klambu Kanan and three (0.1 ha, 0.4
ha and 0.6 ha) in Sedadi and Klambu Kiri. In the analysis it is assumed that
the farm family, consisting of 4.6 persons, provides 1.7 man-days of labor for
22.5 days per month. In the months of peak labor requirement such as planting
or harvesting, when most of the month's activity must be completed in about
ten days, it is assumed that labor is hired. This amounts to about 20% of the
total labor requirements at full development. It is aLso assumed that all
animal labor will be hired. In addition, there are a few off-farm employment
opportunities, the majority being seasonal tobacco or factory work in centers
such as Semarang, Demak or Kudus. These employ predominantly women or young
adults at an average wage of about Rp 600/day. These representative farm
models, shown in Annex 2, Tables 15a-d and 16 a-d are summarized in Table 6.1.

value.

year, similar to the level for all tndonesia of about US$103.1.131 However,
consumption estimates indicate chat since i980, the position of Central Java
compared to the ryX5 of Indonesia has worsened. Bank estimates of the inci-
dence of povercy _ reveal that rural areas in Central Java have a greater
concentration of poverty (62%) than all Indonesia (43% of the national popula-
tion are estimated to have incomes below the absolute poverty Line).  It is
expected that the majority of notentiaL beneficiaries would remain at incomes
below the absolute poverty level without the project. On the smallest farms
(0.1 in the Sedadi and Klambu Kiri and 0.2 ha in Sidorejo and Klambu Kanan),
incomes will remain below the absolute poverty level with the project.
Nevertheless. farmers wilL stii be substantially better off, and incremental
incomes are espected to rise between about 47% and 145%, with a weighted
average increase of 98Z over the whole project area.
6.06      Encome Distribucion.  The project area inciudes:  about 87,000 farm
operator households; about 11,000 farm laborer househoLds which are separate
from owner-operators and about 22,000 living within owner-operator households;
and about 23,000 nonfarm households. An area of about 2,000 ha of drained
swamp land in the Klambu Kanan area will be redistributed to landless agricul-
tural labor in the project area. Comparing tenant income with owner-operator
income, the income of former cenants will increase by about 20-25% in Klambu
Kanan, 15-20X in Sidorejo and about 15% in Sedadi and Klambu Kiri. The income
of landless laborers (only 101 in project areas) is estimated to increase by
5-10% due to increased farm employment.
Project Charges
6.07      Indonesian farmers pay land taxes (IPEDA) and make contributions to
village watermasters who are responsible for tertiary network operation and
maintenance. Land is classified according to a number of physical criteria
and IPEDA is charged at a fixed tariff which varies by land class and total
land holding. The revenue is collected by village heads and turned over to
the local (Kabupaten) and provincial administration for financing local devel-
opment. Projected increases in land classes due to irrigation and other
improvements and consequent IPEDA increases in each area are detailed in Annex
2, Table 17a. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOI will
(a) reclassify for IPEDA purposes all land benefitting from project works,
section by section within one year of completion of works, and (b) reassess
and collect IPEDA taxes from all project beneficiaries in accordance with an
agreed implementation schedule. At full development, IPEDA in the project
area will range from about US$13/ha/year to about US$22/ha/year. In-kind
contributions for water in the project area are 25 kg of paddy per crop. At
full development, water contributions are expected to be about US$8/ha.
13/  These estimates are drawn from the 1980 Indonesia Household Expenditure
Survey, released in 1983. The 1980 rupiah estimate is inflated by a
price index for nine basic items of 56% from 1980 to end 1983 and
converted to US$ at the prevailing exchange rate of.Rp 1,000 = US$1.
14/ Also from the 1980 Household Expenditure Survey.

Farmers will also contribute about 20 man-days of their labor, equivalent to
about Rp 26,GOO/farmIyear. to operate and maintain the village level irriga-
tion system.
6.08      Cost and Rent Recovers.  Present and estimated future levels of
IPEDA, water service concriDuEions and O&M labor contributions are summarized
in Annex 2, Table 18a. At -ull development, incremental IPEDA and other
charges wiLl more than offset incremental O&M outlays for main and secondary
networks. It is oer-haps miore meaningful to observe the cost and rent recovery
indices jhich estimate cost and rent recovery due to the stream of charges
over the project's .ife. The cost recovery index. ranging becween about 6%
and 26% (averaging i6Z), is the ratio of the present vaLue of incremental
direct revenue (IPEDA and other contributions) to the presmgg value of
incremental financial project costs in January i∞85 terms.-' The rent
recovery index, ranging from about 6% to almost 23%. is che racio of the
present vaiue of incremental direct revenue (IPEDA and other contributions) to
the present zalue of incremental net financial project rent. These rates are
in line with those in similar recent projects in 7ndonesia. The recovery
rates are considered reasonable due to the low incomes of Droject bene-
ficiaries (para. 6.05). O&M cost recovery ranges *rom about 86Z in Sedadi
(0.6 ha farms) to about 355% in Sidorejo for 0.2 ha (Annex 2, Table 18c).
Incremental streams of O&M contributions over the oroject's life and the
resultant cost and rent recoverv index are shown in Annex 2, Table 18c.
6.09      O&M Funding.  Support for O&M on the main irrigation system from the
central government has been increasing steadily over the past few years. In
addition, for Bank-assisted projects, part of the capital development budget
(the DIP) has recently (in the 1983/84 budget) been directed to support O&M
activity which has reduced the shortfalls in O&M budgets from 40% to 20%.
Shortfalls in 0&M can have consequences on the agricultural benefits achieved
over the project's life (para. 7.12). Additional funding sources for OE& have
been agreed in principal with GOI by use of revenues collected from IPEDA.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that sufficient (see Annex 9, Table
4) and timely funds will be allocated to O&M, and that GOI will increase 1PEDA
rates for reclassified land (para. 6.07), and furnish to the Bank by December
31, 1988 a plan to allocate the incremental IPEDA thus collected to O&M of
project works following construction.

VII. 3ENEFITS, ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
General
7.01      The project complements the previous Bank,gupport in water resource
development in the project area.  EarLier projects        concentrated on
rehabilitating the existing irrigation system, mitigating flood problems
through constructing main and some secondary drainage, and undertaking
extensive tertiary development in the Sedadi and Klambu Kiri areas. The
proposed Kedung Ombo Multipurpose Dam and irrigation Project will enhance
water avaiLability through water storage in a dam, expansion of the irrigation
area to the Klambu Kanan and Sidorejo areas. and substantial improvement of
existing irrigation svstems in the Sedadi and KLambu Kiri areas. The project
will also assist ongoing flood control activities through reservoir operation
and the continuation of drainage works.  Yainly secondary power (a total of 74
GWh per vear) will be generated resulting from the operation of the
reservoir. Municipal and industrial water will also be supplied through the
irrigation canals throughout the year. The proposed proiect is high on COI's
development priorities in view of its large agricultural and flood control
benefits, in an area mostly without dry season water, yet subject to flooding
in the wet season.
Benefits
7.02      Agricultural Benefits.  Approximately 87,000 farm families will
directly benefit from the project and their incomes will increase (para. 6.05)
due to increased agricultural production valued at US$41 million (See Annex 2,
Table 11). An additional 33,000 farm laborer households, 20,000 cf which are
contained within farm operator households, will also benefit. There will also
be indirect beneficiaries due to the improved access and communications in the
area from the new feeder roads and access tracks to be constructed or upgraded
(para. 5.03). The full costs of these roads have been charged to the project,
although no road user benefits have been quantified.
7.03      Power Benefits.  Power generation will be incidental to the
operation of the reservoir and will be secondary to the main objective of
providing irrigation. On average, 74 GWh of electrical energy will be
generated per year. The main benefit from the energy generated will be the
saving of cost of fuel from oil, diesel or coal stations. PLN's simulations
indicate that for the proposed future network of generating stations starting
from 1989 onward, the Kedung Ombo power station will initially accrue saving
on fuel from oil fired steam stations (1989 to 1994), while in the latter
years (1995-2020), it will save fuel from the coal fired plants (see Annex 2,
Table 22b). Fuel savings range from US$2.7 million to over US$4.0 million per
year (till 1994) and subsequently average US$4.3 million per year in financial
16/ Irrigation projects I, VII, IX, and XIV (Loan numbers 127-IND, 1268-IND,
1465-IND and 1811-IND) all in the Jratunseluna River Basin, Central Java.
See Chapter 1.



- 50 -
terms.  The economic benefic of this power is equated to the tariff revenue
collected.  From the commencement of power generation in 1989, this is about
US$6.16 million per year.-
7.04      Employment.  As a direct resuir of increased agricultural
production, theLe will be a substantial increase in agricultural employment in
the project area. Three distinct peaks in Labor demand will occur due to the
increased cropping intensity. At full development, the incremental agricul-
tural labor demand is about 8.7 million man-days (40.000 man-years), an
increase of abouc 65%. This represents an increase of 10.3 million man-days
(47,000 man-years) or 89% over the present (see Annex 2, Table i9).
7.05      Flood control benefits have been taken into account in formulating
yield estimates. The Klambu Kanan and Klambu Kiri areas will predominantly
benefit from flood control. Improved municipal and industrial water supply is
Likely to reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases in village and muni-
cipal areas. Health benefits and possible fishing and recreational benefits
from the use of the Kedung Ombo Dam reservoir area have not been quantified in
the analysis.
Main Assumptions Used in the Economic Analysis
7.06      Financial costs have been converted to economic costs using the
factors in Annex 2, Table 14. Expected price increases and taxes have been
excluded from economic costs. No shadow price has been applied to the cost of
animal labor due to the shortage of animals in the project area. However, the
labor component of a team day (two mpn) has been shadow priced at 50% of the
market wage. The consequent conversion factor for an animal team-day is thus
0.7.
7.07      Foreign Exchange.  The exchange rate of US$1.00 = Rp 1,100 is
considered to reflect the value to the economy of the foreign exchange used in
the project.
7.08      Operation and Maintenance.  Based on updated estimates of O&M costs
for other multipurpose dams, O&M for the irrigation system alone is estimated
at US$15/ha/year. The system is expected to operate at about 502 efficiency.
Annual O&M for the dam and reservoir is estimated at US$0.5 million and
US$0.13 million for the power plant (see Annex 9 for detailed costs).
Equipment for O&M on the irrigation systems (US$1.72 million) and downriver
works (US$0.87 million) is replaced in its fifteenth year.  Wal O&M for all
irrigation and dam facilities per ha is about US$29/ha/year._
17/ After allowing 15Z transmission losses, negligible incremental
distribution costs and an average tariff of Rp 98/Kwh in 1985 constant
terms.
18/ Excluding O&M on the power component.



7.09      Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  Based on the assumptions above and a
project financial and eccenomic life of 30 years, the ERR is estimated at about
17.4% (17.6Z for a 50-vear scream) which is satisfactory. The flow of
economic costs and benerics over the project life is presented in Annex 2,
Table 20. The ERRs for che irrigation and power components taken individually
are 16.7% (Annex 2, Table 21) and 25% (Annex 2, Table 22a) respectively. The
equalizing discount rate for che power component taking only fuel saving is
14.1Z (Annex 2, Table 22b).
Risks and Sensitivicy Analysis
7.10      The main risks associated with the project concern delays in land
development due to delayed Land acquisition and inadequate operation and
maintenance.
7.11      If, due to deLayed land acquisition for the dam, construction costs
are lagged two years and benefits are lagged more than two years, the ERR
falls to just under 13.4%. A future reduction in rice yields of about 12% in
all areas except Sidorejo would result in a reduction of rice benefits of
almost 20%. However, the project ERR will be 14.2%. If total benefits fell
50%, costs should decrease to just over 20% for the project to remain viable
at 10%, the opportunity cost of capital. Similarly, an increase in costs of
50z could still maintain the project's viability at 11.8%. The project is
less sensitive to cost overruns than to reductions in benefits, and the
project can withstand a reasonable degree of cost overruns and reduced bene-
fits.  Cross-over values for a number of critical variables are summarized in
Table 7.1.
7.12      Varying Levels of O&M.  The standard level of O&M assumed for the
project (para. 7.08) aims to produce an irrigation system efficiency of 50%. The
estimated impact of different levels of O&M on project beneg'ts was investigated
and summarized in Table 7.2. A cut in O&M budgets of 50% _t (very poor O&K)
produ87d over time a system efficiency of 30%; poor O&M due to a cut in O&M of
30Z ' resulted in system efficiency of 40%. In these cases, it is assumed that
O&M for the dam, reservoir, and the power component continues.  In addition, it
is assumed that the impact of the O&M changes occurs over 20 years. Due to the
discounting process, the ERR is little affected by the impacts of changes in O&M
expenditures. Comparing the change in O&M costs to agricultural benefits over
the project life, however, shows a considerable trade-off. In the case of very
poor O&M, "savings" of US$1.99 million (NPV) in O&M costs result in losses of
US$30.25 million in incremental agricultural benefits over the life of the
project. Similarly in the case of poor O&M, "savings" of US$1.31 million in O&M
costs result in losses of US$8.58 million in agricultural benefits over the life
of the project.
L9/ Complete neglect of maintenance and operational staff is also reduced.
20/ Costs of maintenance reduced by 60% but operational staff is not reduced.

KEDUNG OMBO MULTIPURPOSE DAM AND IRRIGATION PROJECT
Flood Forecasting and Water Monitoring System
Introduction
1.        The flood and water supply monitoring system will consist of a net-
work of sensors and telemetry to report meteorologic and hydrologic data in
real time to a central operations center equipped with computer systems and
systems softcware to fully automate the reception and archiving of data and
their subsequent use. Computer models and applications software will be used
for the purpose of forecasting floods, flood warnings, flow routing, and
scheduling the delivery of irrigation water to diversion points. The contrac-
tor who will be awarded the job will oversee the operations and maintenance of
the data colLection, communications, computer system, and water control appli-
cations for a period of four years after installation. During installation
and the subsequent four-year period the contractor will provide training to
the Indonesian staff in all facets of operational activities.
Description of the System
2.        The geographical area to be covered with the precipitation and water
level gauge network includes the upper catchment of the Juana River, as well
as the Serang-Lusi-Wulan catchment (see Map 18555). The Kedung Ombo Dam will
completely regulate the flows of the upper Serang and will provide all of the
supplemental water to the Upper Sedadi (Sedadi) (13,900 ha) and the South
Crobogan (Sidorejo) (6,100 ha) irrigation schemes. This is about 40Z of the
total required. The supplemental water routed from Kedung Ombo to the Juana
Valley (Klambu Kanan) (19,100 ha) and Lower Sedadi (Klambu Kiri) (20,400 ha)
is augmented by the unregulated Lusi River (2,057 sq km) and the intervening
catchments.
3         Historically the Serang-Wulan and the adjacent coastal areas have
been subjected to frequent and serious flooding from the Upper Serang and Lusi
Rivers, and streams draining the southern slope of Mt. Muria. A comprehensive
program of channel dredging and levee improvements under Irrigation XIV (Ln.
1811-IND) is under way to increase drainage and provide greater protection
from floods. However, the threat of flooding of Godong from the Lusi River
has not been reduced.
organizacion for Project Operation
4.        Administration.  The operation of a data collection network system,
river flow forecasting, flood forecasting and warning, and scheduling of
supplemental irrigation water will be managed from one water control center.
This center will be located in Kudus.

Page 2
5.        The Water ControL Center will be the technical arm of the irrigation
counictee which allocates water to the irrigation areas. During project
construction the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering (IHE) will establish a
Subproject Office in the Jratunseluna Project Office and will be the agency
responsible for implementing the data collection system, flow forecasting, and
other water management activities. IHE, with project staff, will continue on
and operate and maintain the Water Control Center for two years after the
project is completed. The Wilayah (regional irrigation) staff will be phased
into the Center with the IHE staff during this period and ultimateLy will
asvume management responsibilities.
6.        Project Elements.  The project proposal is to provide the Provincial
Public Works Department (PU) with a computer-based real-time system for data
acquisition, communications, and hydrologic modeling tailored to the project
area. Data acquisition includes point rainfall measurements, radar rainfall
data, and water levels in streams and canals, and at water control devices.
There are nine basic program elements required to provide this complete water
resources management system: (i) network of data stations; (ii) Master
Control Center at Kudus; (iii) operations communications system; (iv) computer
system with software for data management, analysis and water control opera-
tions; (v) training; (vi) four-year program of operations and maintenance for
the system; (vii) radar computer facility - Semarang; (viii) computer system
with systems and applications software for process and analysis of radar
rainfall data; and (ix) local support.
7.        The entire program is designed for a minimum 20-year life.  This
will be reflected in both the design and the level of training and support.
All electronics will be estimated at a 10-year life.
Data Collection Network
8.        A number of radio-linked precipitation and water level gauges will
be required to satisfy the data requirements for flood warning, flood control
operations, reservoir operation, forecasting and determination of water
supply, flow routing, forecasting irrigation water requirements, and
scheduling and managing irrigation water delivery. Approximately 100 radio-
linked precipitation event recording rain gauges will be required. About 60
gauges will be installed in the irrigation areas. The spacing of the gauges
in the irrigation areas will be such that areas of approximately 1,000 ha can
be represented. These gauges will provide a measure of the irrigation water
derived directly from rainfall. About 40 gauges will be required in the Upper
Serang (7), Lusi (22), Mt. Muria (5) catchments, and the reservoir (1) and
diversion structures tl).
9.        About 86 radio-linked event recording water level and control
sensors will be required. At Kedung Ombo Dam, the reservoir level will be
monitored by a water level recorder installed in the intake tower. In
addition, output will be monitored from two ultrasonic flow meters installed
in the conduit supplying water to the power turbine and irrigation outlet.

Page 3
10.       Radio-linked water level sensors and rain gauges will be used to
establish 12 stream gauging stations in the Upper Serang above Kedung Ombo Dam
(2), the Lusi (3), the Juana (2) and the Mt. Muria catchments (4). In
addition, a water level monitoring station will be established on the Bum
Drain and the Serang Lama River (see map 18555).
11.       In the irrigation areas, water level sensors will be coupled with
the 60 radio-linked event recording rain gauges. The water Level sensors will
be used on the primary, secondary, and tertiary canals. This group of water
level sensors will provide a measure or the distribution and utilization of
the diverted water volume in the irrigated areas. This information will be
used in the assessment of irrigation water needs.
Central Control Center - Kudus
12.       The master control center will be located in Kudus and will be
equipped with communications facilities to receive and decode data transmitted
from a network of about 120 field transmitters and one or more repeaters. A
complete computer system and systems operations software to be linked to the
communication system will serve the following functions: (i) receive data from
the communications system; (ii) store received data in short- and long-term
data bases; (iii) provide alarm notification for floods and other significant
events; (iv) provide a maintenance logging function to aid in system diagnosis
and repair; (v) interface with real-time radar rainfall data; (vi) provide a
graphic display of telemetered data; (vii) provide real-time computer models
capable of forecasting river flow, potential flooding, reservoir and diversion
control management, and irrigation water accounting; (viii) provide necessary
communications to link WSR-74 WMS system with the computer in the Kudus
Central Control; (ix) transmit operational instructions to reservoir and
diversion control stations; and (s) in addition the tenderer will furnish,
install and operate a weather monitoring systetm in the Bureau of Meteorology
Radar in Semarang.
Radar Computer System - Semarang
13.       The Radar Computer Facility will be located at the Bureau of
Meteorology in Semarang. The Facility consists of an EEC WSR-74-S band
meteorology radar equipped with a digital video integrator and processor
(DVIP) already in place and operational. A computer system, compLete with
systems and applications software, will be furnished and installed by the
tenderer to provide real-time distributed rainfall amounts over the project
area and also to provide a variety of rainfall and storm movement informa-
tion. Models will be used to forecast firm and probable (as appropriate)
short-term unregulated flow and reservoir storage in the system that is
available for irrigation supply. The output will be used periodically by the
irrigation committee to aLlocate and schedule water delivery to the irrigation
areas. Given the irrigation water schedules, models will be used to determine
reservoir releases, if needed, and to modify reservoir releases and flows in
the system during the delivery period in order to account for direct rainfall
to the irrigated areas and for differences in projected and actual unregulated
flow supply.

Page 4
14.       Communications System.  The network of rainfall, water level, and
flow measuring sensors will be linked to che Water Control Center in Kudus by
a line-of-sight radio communicacions system. The system will consist of
demand- and event-actuated VHF radio transmitters at sensor sites,
strategically located repeaters. and a central radio receiver in Kudus to
provide the interface between remote data stations and the central computer
facility.
15.       Flood Forecasting and Flow Routing.  The network of gauges providing
real time data for rainfall and water levels together with the computer
systems and applications software will provide the following capabilities
during flood : (i) reservoir management for flood control and hydro power
operation; (ii) rainfall-runoff simulations in the upper catchment areas,
including Mt. Muria; (iii) flood forecasting and flood routing for reaches of
the Upper Serang, Lusi, and Wulan Rivers; (iv) flood warnings for Purwodadi,
Godong and at selected points in the lower reaches for levee monitoring and
emergency spillway operations.
Water Accounting and Management
16.       The data network provides continuous real time data related to the
delivezy of water to each irrigation area.  Within each area the network of
rainfall gauges provides a measure of water supplied directly to the area.
The water level gauges provide an index to the distribution of water within
the system. Water level gauges will usually be located on secondary and
tertiary canals. Whenever possible gauges will be located at existing
parshall flumes or structures with fized control characteristics. Records
from these gauges, used individually and collectively, will provide accurate
real time information of flows and water supply delivered to selected subareas
within each irrigation area.
Cost Estimates
17.       Annex 5, Table 4 gives the sumary of quantities and cost estimates
of equipment and services.
Implementation Program
18.       The whole system will be implemented in four phases (see Figure
1): (i) The first phase will involve the setting up of a flood warning system
in the Serang River during the construction of the coffer dam. This system
will forecast floods upstream of the coffer dam and will give advance warning
downstream of possible dam break conditions. This system will have to be
completed by the 1986/87 wet season (September 1986). (ii) The second phase
of the system should be installed to perform the entire flood forecasting
operation for the Lusi-Serang Rivers through the center at Kudus in September
1987. (iii) The third phase of the system should be installed to perform both
(i) and (ii) and to do water allocation for the South Crobogan (Sidorejo) and
Upper Sedadi (Sedadi) systems in June 1989. (iv) The fourth phase of the
system should be installed to perform the entire flood forecasting operation
in June 1990.
