workers and\n            regular, scheduled visits by extension workers to\n            farmers' fields. The project faces no special risks,\n            although realization of the expected benefits will depend\n            heavily on the State Government's ability to\n            effectively manage the reorganized extension system,\n            maintaining a clear single line of command from extension\n            headquarters to the field-level workers."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
