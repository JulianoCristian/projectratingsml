                             Sector consolidation. 104 entities have been certified by the CNBV as of December 1, 2011, an additional 12 certification applications are under review and another 212 are in a
                         Transition period (i.e. authorized to operate but not fully certified), bringing close to 90% of the sector's assets and members under the strongest institutions. Depending on the
                         willingness of the authorities to send a strong signal to the sector that the certification deadline with not be postponed past the current date of December 31, 2012, a large additional
                         number could be certified by the end of 2012 as BANSEFI has the capacity and the methodology in place to assist entities go through the final certification process. A substantial

                          Deposit Protection Fund established and operational. Two federations (FMEAC and FINE) have established the deposit protection funds, and have started to receive contributions
                         from member entities. COFIREM, an authorized Confederation of six federations, has also commenced operating a fund. In addition to the contributions that authorized entities must
                         provide to their protection fund, Hacienda had yet to provide the start-up capital for these protection funds. Under the new Cooperative Law passed in August 2009, these funds have
                         now transited to two broad funds (one for financial partnerships and another for financial cooperatives) with BANSEFI as the administrator.

                                  Technology infrastructure is in place to offer new financial products and reduce costs of operation. Although only 10% of entities have integrated their activities onto the
                         platform, the technology infrastructure now provides a much broader ranger of services, including reporting, anti money laundering, transfers of remittances or payment of
                         government subsidies to the population (Oportunidades).
