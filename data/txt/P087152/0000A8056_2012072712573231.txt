                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in strengthening the SCI sector with SCIs which are compliant with the Popular Savings and Credit Law, financially
                         viable, operationally effective, managerially sound, technologically upgraded, and providing an enhanced level of outreach and access to financial services by the
                         underserved Mexican populations.

                         The activities of the Project are currently winding down and are expected to be completed by the Closing Date (July 31st, 2012). At the moment, 112 institutions have been authorized
                         by CNBV. By the Closing Date, about 75% of the sector's assets and members/clients are expected to belong to institutions that have been authorized by the CNBV. Institutions
                         representing an additional 20% of members and assets of the sector may be authorized by December 31, 2012, the date set by the law.

                         Outreach has continued to grow, with the sector growing from 4 million to about 20 million clients/members (not including those who only use the sector as beneficiaries of
                         Government Programs, the most important of which is Oportunidades).

                         The IT Platform is being used by 372 entities and provides a wide range of services to about 10 million clients/members, not including the 9.5 million beneficiaries of Government
                         programs such as Oportunidades payments.

                         The impending deadline of December 31, 2012, by which all entities above the "basic" level need to be authorized by the CNBV will continue to present a particular challenge for both
                         Bansefi, which supports the sector to reach authorized status, and CNBV, which will need to review and approve the applications for authorization or enforce the law for institutions
                         that cannot get authorized. The deadline may change the landscape of the sector and may require Bansefi to review its business model and the Bansefi III Project to review its
                         indicators. Bansefi is already making plans for this eventuality.
