                            Sector consolidation. Ninety-eight institutions have been certified; request for 11 institutions is with CNBV, the regulatory agency. These 109 entities account for close to 69% of
                         the sector membership and 70% of sector assets. An additional 207 entities are almost ready for certification, having been classified as B+ and B entities. Together, these 316
                         entities account for about 86% of the sector membership and 90% of sector assets. Under the provisions of the Popular Savings and Credit Law, 60% of the sector entities
                         representing less than 7% of the total membership would have ended up with assets below the certification threshold. Many of these small below-threshold entities may opt for a no-
                         certification approach, rather than get liquidated. At this stage, no more than 20 entities above the threshold may need to be merged or liquidated. Nine cooperatives have already
                         been merged/liquidated.

                            Deposit Protection Fund established and operational. Two federations (FMEAC and FINE) have established the deposit protection funds, and have started to receive contributions
                         from member entities. COFIREM, an authorized Confederation of six federations, has also commenced operating a fund. In addition to the contributions that authorized entities must
                         provide to their protection fund, Hacienda had yet to provide the start-up capital for these protection funds. Under the new Cooperative Law passed in August 2009, these funds have
                         now transited to two broad funds (one for financial partnerships and another for financial cooperatives) with BANSEFI as the administrator.

                                    Technology infrastructure is in place to offer new financial products and reduce costs of operation. The first stage of the roll-out is underway in about 46 participating
                         entities, two external agencies, and all 500+ BANSEFI branches. An additional 20 entities are expected to be added during 2011. Measures are in place to make the platform
                         achieve financial sustainability.
