The National Development Plan of Mexico\n            envisions the Mexican economy to demonstrate, among others,\n            the two key attributes of human development and competitive\n            growth. These two attributes are represented in the three\n            objectives of: (a) increasing and expanding competitiveness;\n            (b) promoting balanced regional development that includes\n            all population segments; and (c) increasing equity and\n            equality of opportunity. The 2004 Country Assistance\n            Strategy (FY 2005 through FY 2008) supports the Mexican\n            government\u0092s efforts to achieve these three objectives\n            through initiatives under the two broad themes of: (a)\n            reducing poverty and inequality; and (b) increasing\n            competitiveness. The project is essentially a technical\n            assistance project. No negative impact is foreseen; rather\n            the project is expected to benefit some of the savings and\n            credit sector entities operating in marginal areas (which\n            are identical to the ones in the ongoing project) where\n            indigenous population is high. The project will continue to\n            assist about 195 entities, some of which are in the marginal\n            areas, and for which indigenous population aspects are\n            already being addressed under the on-going project. It will\n            assist about 45 new entities, very few of which may be\n            situated in the identified marginal areas. No indirect or\n            long-term negative impacts are expected as a result of\n            project activities. The technical assistance is expected to\n            deepen the outreach of the assisted entities, and will\n            improve access to financial services in the underserved\n            areas in Mexico, benefiting all categories of populations."}, "docdt": "2012-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
