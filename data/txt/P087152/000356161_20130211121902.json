development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: a technical assistance effort focused on improving\n            a hitherto unregulated and unsupervised rural financial\n            sector has to be a medium-to-long term initiative to produce\n            solid institutions. Governments should allow for a longer\n            lead time for the entities to get certified and encompassed\n            under a regulatory framework. Where the sector consists of a\n            large number of initially poorly performing entities, which\n            most likely need to be merged or liquidated, the political\n            ramifications emanating from liquidation could easily\n            jeopardize the sector consolidation process. The complexity\n            of designing and implementing a technology platform that\n            serves a heterogeneous industry and generates sufficient\n            revenue to be sustainable cannot be underestimated. In order\n            to reach low-income households where literacy rates are low\n            and functional literacy is practically nonexistent, efforts\n            need to be made in the area of social intermediation. The\n            three Bansefi projects, which overlap over time and have\n            similar objectives, are good examples of projects that would\n            benefit from a holistic evaluation, rather than individual ones."}, "docdt": "2013-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
