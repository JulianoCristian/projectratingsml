The performances of both the Bank and\n            the Borrower are rated satisfactory. Lessons by component\n            cited were several by project : 1. Within the limited fiscal\n            space of developing countries, involvement of community\n            volunteers provides a complementary and inexpensive method\n            for delivery of social services. 2. Given the importance of\n            health outcomes in early stages, if funds are limited,\n            community nutrition programs should primarily target\n            children below the age of two years old. 3. The project\n            design needs to be flexible to adapt to local realities. 4.\n            Sensitization and capacity building at all levels are\n            crucial for the project's success. 5. Poor access to\n            potable water hinders the project outcomes. 6. Street\n            children programs could achieve better results if they are\n            not limited just to basic assistance to children in the\n            street, but rather include development-oriented activities\n            through integration into the family, school and labor\n            market. 7. Not every NGO has enough knowledge and expertise\n            to deal with street children, and ,furthermore, NGO programs\n            alone are not enough to significantly reduce the number of\n            children in the street. It is crucial that NGOs cooperate\n            among themselves and with local governments to achieve\n            long-term impact and sustainability of interventions in the\n            area. 8. Strengthening the capacity of the family and\n            community to take care of their young members can increase\n            the efficiency of street children programs. 9. Strengthening\n            the poverty monitoring capacity of district assemblies leads\n            to their empowerment, increases accountability and informed\n            decision making. 10.  Poverty monitoring capacity building\n            for district assemblies needs to be harmonized and carried\n            out within the PRSP poverty monitoring efforts. 11. Given\n            the short time and limited resources allocated to learning\n            and Innovation Loans (LILs), such projects should not be\n            complicated in design and implementation. 12. The Bank staff\n            need to be more engaged in the preparation of LILs in order\n            to explain the learning and innovation nature of this\n            lending instrument. 13. The national team's lead on\n            project design, preparation and implementation builds\n            capacity and increases ownership of project objectives and outcomes."}, "docdt": "2006-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
