PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Tnird Highway Project vas the Bank Group's fourth intervencton
in Benin's road sector. The major project objectives vere to restore the
heavily trafficked Godomey-Bohicon-Abomey trunk road to good condition, to
eliminate the backlog of maintenance on bituminous and laterite roads through
resurfacing of 195 km of paved and regravelling of 273 km of laterite roads;
to procure road equipment; to carry out a preinvestuent study of a major road
improvement and to provide technical assistance to help the Government imple-
ment the project and to develop the institutions responsible for the sector.
2.        The Government's cumbersome administrative and procurement proce-
dures delayed project implementation by about two years. During this time
advancing deterioration augmented the planned quantities of works, which,
coupled with high inflation during 1978-81 increased project costs consider-
ably. The IDA financed bituminous road resurfacing component was particularly
adversely affected by delays and inflation. Its scope was therefore reduced
and those sections not resurfaced under the project were included in the
follow up Fourth Highway Project. The technical assistance component vas
generally effective and the pre-investment study was completed.
3.        The reduced project achieved its objectives.  The project's esti-
mated rate of return (ERR) is 122%.
4.        The following points may be of particular interest:
(a)   the further deterioration of the roads resulting from the
delay in commencing road work (paras. 3.03 and 3.07);
(b)   problems experienced in the execution of the road work
(para. 3.08); and
(c)   project cost (para. 3.16, 3.17).

THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT - CR . 746-BEN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01     Together vith previous highway projects financed by the Associa-
tion, the Third Highway Project evolved from the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) financed Dahomey Land Transport Study (1969) for vhich IDA was
executing agency. The first IDA operation, the Highvay Maintenance and
Engineering Project (Credit 215-DA. US$3.5 million. 1970) was followed by a
Highway Construction Project (Credit 415-DA, US$11.8 million, 197-, which
included technical assistance for highway maintenance. Credit 415-DA was
later increased to US$20.8 million to cover increased project costs. The
third IDA operation was the First Feeder Road Project (Cr. 717-BEN, US$5.5
million, 1977) in line wiLi' the evolving needs of the sector. The feeder
roads project was mounted almost concurrently with the Third Highway Project.
Audit Report 1768 dated October 25, 1977 and a project completioa report dated
November 19, 198L have been issued for the two previous projects. These
reports conclude that although the physical works were accomplished as
planned, there were cost over-runs ar.d institution building aspects were not
fully successful, particularly attempts to strengthen the Ministry of
Transport and Comunications in areas of planning and policy making (the
Directorate of Land Transport and the Directorate of Studies and Planning
(DSP)). Institution building objectives have also not been fully achieved
under this project for lack of Government's commitment . rapid staff turnover
and lack of suitably qualified personnel for training. Beside the road
subsector. IDA and several donors have also financed the almost completed
Cotonou Port Project (Credit Cr. 826, US$9.7 million). Additionally, a Second
Feeder Roads Project (Cr. 1090). is ongoing.
1.02     Benin's transport system consists of about 7,200 km of roads, 580 km
of railways, and at Cotonou, a deep-water port of about 1.2 million tons
annual capacity and an international airport. The backbone of the system is
the "Benin Route" which extends the length of Benin from Cotonou to Niamey,
the capital of landlocked Niger, and comprises 440 km of the Cotonou-Parakou
railway and the Parakou-Malanville road (320 km). The Benin Route carries most
of Niger's exports and imports. Transit traffic to Nigeria has virtually
disappeared in recent years but the Niger traffic continues to account for a
large share of the export-import traffic from Cotonou.
1.03     As many of the two-lane trunk roads had degenerated to mere tracks in
the 1960's, the needs were to restore them to maintainable conditions. Thus
the Association financed projects, the second in conjunction with the United
States Agency for Internation4l Development (USAID) and the third in asso-
ciation with the Kuwait and OPEC Funds, provided for extensive assistance in
maintenance and rehabilitation of principal roads. The Second Highway Project
financed the reconstruction of 320 km of the Parakou-Malanville section of the
Benin Route, and the Third Highway Project the rehabilitation of the Bohicon -



-2-
Godomey road, which is the heavily trafficked southern segment of the Benin
Route. The highway maintenance elements concentrated on the removal of the
considerable backlog of periodic maintenance of laterite roads and developing
institutional capacity to carry out maintenance. Beside IDA, USAID, FAC, FED
and Nigeria helped finance the road improvement program through the L970-1976
period. Together, these donors accounted for about 902 of road investments
and over 70% of government's expenditures on roads, including maintenance.
1.04     Tbo Directorate of Roads and Bridges (DROA) in the Ministry of
Equipment - is responsible for the construction and maintenance of roads.
DROA's operations were reorganized under the two prev'ous highway projects and
its highway maintenance capaciZy was strengthened. Additional technical
assistance and additional staff training were provided under this project.
IDA's two feeder roads operations have established a feeder roads division in
MTPCH for construction, maintenance and coordination of the hitherto
uncoordinated efforts of several institutions. The virtually completed
Cotonou Port Project has increased port capacity and laid the foundations for
more efficient handiing of transit traffic through training and technical
assistance to the port authority.
1.05     At the end of 1972 -/ when the military took over power, foreign
enterprises in key sectors were nationalized and foreign management replaced
by Beninese staff in the public services. These vere mostly untrained nation-
als. The administration and management of public services continued to
deteriorate also because key staff were frequently rotated. The Director of
DROA was changed twice during implementation of the Third Highway Project.
The sudden dismissal of DROA's director who had made preparations for the
project, caused substantial delays in implementing the project (para. 3.01).
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
2.01     The project was first identified in 1974 and subsequently formu-
lated on the basis of a report by DROA's consultants. It was appraised in
July 1976. 2.02. As appraised, the project comprised:
(a)   Civil Works
(i) rehabilitation of the Godomey-Bohicon-Abomey road
(107  km);
(ii)  resurfacing of about i95 Km of bituminous roads;
(iii) regravelling of about 273 km of laterite roads;
1/   Subsequently named the Ministry of Public Works, Construction and Housing
(MTPCH)1.
2/   At that time the country's name was changed from Dahomey to Benin.



-3-
(b) Consultant Services
For detailed engineering and supervision of vorks.
(c) Procurement
Strengthening of the ongoing routine maintenance program
through the purchase of equipment and spare parts.
(d) Institution Building
Technical assistance and fellowships to DROA for the pre-
paration of the maintenance component, staff training and
strengthening of road maintenance planning, and assistance
to DSP in the Ministry of Transport and Comunications; and
(a) Preinvestment Studs
Ouidah-Allada road (40 km).
Implementation was scheduled for the beginning of 1978 and the project was
expected to be completed by 1980.
2.03     The congested two lane Godomey-Bohicon road had completely dete-
riorated under heavy traffic (500 to 1,200 vehicles per day). It required
extensive base course reconstruction and resealing throughout plus the re-
building of some drainage structures.
2.04     The objective of both the paved and larerite road resurfacing was
substantially to reduce the maintenance backlog in order to make these roads
maintainable on a routine basis. The magnitude of the maintenance backlog was
considerable: the paved roads selected for the project had not been resur-
faced for 11 to 16 years, while the regravelling of laterice roads was over a
decade overdue.
2.05     Lack of spare parts and limited repair facilities in Cotonou and
Parakou were constraining road maintenance and the use of the equipment
procured under the two previous highway projects. To remedy this, the project
provided for the establishment of a good stock of spare parts and improvement
in record keeping and stock control.
2.06     Technical assistance to DROA consisted of 55 man-months comorising
two highway engineers and a mechanical expert to assist in managing and monitoring the
resurfacing and regravelling programs, help administer the equipment repair
shop, prepare a comprehensive staff training program and assist and advise on
management, budget and procurement studies. Technical assistance to DSP
consisted of a transport economist and a transport engineer (30 man-months) to
help reorganize DSP to handle data collection, coordinate investments In and
operation of the transport modes and formulate general transport policy.
2.07     The Ouidah-Allada road pre-investment study vas to determine the most
economic road improvement in order to reduce the high maintenance costs on the
existing road. It proposed paving the road. Hovever, in view of the low



4 
economic rate of return shown by the study. Government and IDA decided that
gravelling under the Fourth Highway Project would be more appropriate than
paving.
Proiect Cost Estimate
2.08     The net of taxes project cost estimate vas US$21.3 milllon. V  Cost
estimates for the construction and rehabilitation couponents. vere based on
the consultant's studies and updated to reflect 1977 prices. The estimates
for consultants services were based on unit prices then applicable to Benin
and similar West African countries. The cost estimDta included a physical
contingency of 10X and a price contitgency of 142. The IDA Credit of US$10
million was intended to finance US$9.0 milllon of foreign costs and US$1.0
million of local costs, or 482 of total project cost.
Financing Plan
2.09     The Kuvait Fund and the OPEC Fund financed tbh  project in parallel
with IDA. The Kuwait (US$7 million) and OPEC (US$1.6 million) credits were
expended entirely on the Godomay-Bohicon rocd. The co-financing plan vas as
follows:
Component                    IDA         IF      OPEC    Govt       Total
1SUS millions

Disbursements Plan
2.10     The credit provided for disbursing 92% of expenditures on the resur-
facing components, 100% of foreign and 902 of local expenditures on spare
parts and equipment for road maintenance and office construction, and 902 of
expenditures on consulting services. technical assistance and fellowships.
Retroactive financing of $300,000 vas provided to cover consulting services
needed to prepare the maintenance program.
2.11     The paved road maintenance works consisted of shoulder clearing and
drainage rehabilitation (US$1.0 million), patching (US$0.2 million) for which
a special unit was set up in DROA, and surface treatment on about 195 km
(US$3.9 million).  Two road maintenance brigades established under the proj-
ect were charged with regravelling about 273 km of laterite roads (US$1.2
million). Equipment and spare parts (US$2.4 million) were to be procured on
J    The Government exempted the project from payment of taxes and duties
following the precedent set under the Second Highway Project.



ICB basis.  Except for surface treatment which was czecuted under contract.
all other maintenance was by force account.
Negotiations and Board Presentation
2.12      During negotiations in August, 1977, It was agreed that effective-
ness of the credit agreements with the two co-donors would be a condition of
effectiveness of the IDA credit. This cross-effectiveness requirement
increased by more than 2 months the already very long delay between credlt
approval and effectiveness. The credit was approved by the Board in November
1977 but became effective only in'June 1978 after Bank's intervention at the
highest level of the Government.
IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      The Director of DROA made advanced preparations for procurements
and contracting in the hope of ensuring smooth implementation. These plans
were disrupted when he was abruptly dismissed a few weeks after
effectiveness. As the new director was not familiar with the job, the
earlier momentum was lost and project implementation languished until about
the end of 1978.
3.02      Rehabilitation of the'Godomey-Bohicon Abomey road (co-donor
financed) was awarded following ICB to a joint venture of a Benin firm with a
French firm in October 1978 and Canadian consultants, were retained for
supervision. But the Government failed to put the IDA financed resurfacing
and regravelling works to bid till over a year later.
3.03      The extent of road resurfacing and regravelling and the magnitude
of spare parts requirements were based on conditions during appraisal.
However'Government's slow performance both prior to effectiveness and during
procurement and contracting, caused a good two years to elapse before these
road works started. During the intervening time, and in spite of some
routine maintenance (already weak from lack of equipment), rapid
deterioration of the paved roads continued, and was spurred by an
unprecedented wet season, to the point where the works as provided for under
the project (i.e., surface resealing) were no longer sufficient and
appropriate. Thus, an extensive base course reconstruction became
necessary. Additionally, some of the idled equipment, because of lack of
spare parts and/or repairs, deteriorated further while the rest, through
cannibalization, became uneconomic to rehabilitate. This result showed that
the practice of specifying detailed equipment and spare parts requirements
far ahead of their use was unsound because road conditions change, and many
of the spare parts are no longer needed or become unusable. In the
meantime,because of its obligations, MTPCH intentionally carried out periodic
maintenance rather than routine maintenance because the equipment normally
used for routine maintenance had been taken to make up the regravelling
brigades for the earth feeder roads under a separate program..
3.04      In order to minimize further delays, due to slowvGovernment
procedures, the Association agreed to the award of a contract for IDA



6 -
financed paved roads (nine months behind SAR schedule) based on tenders
received for the'Godomey-Bohicon Abomey road (comprising the same scope of
work) rather than requiring a new bidding procedure which would have led to
further delays. With hlndsight, the judgement on making tiais decislon was
incorrect (para. 3.07 through 3.09). However, a contract for resurfacing of
the paved roads was awarded to the Benin/French joint venture fir. on the
same terms and unit prices as for the'Godomey-Bohicon road (para. 3.02).
Contracts for equipment procurement were awarded following ICB under the
concurrent Feeder Roads Project.
3.05      A French consulting firm, was retained ln'July 1978 for the
Ouldah-Allada road feasibility study. The study was satisfactorily completed
a few months ahead of schedule at the end of 1979. A contract for the
technical assistance component was awarded in November 1978 to the same
Canadian consultant as had already been selected for the supervision of the
Godomey-Bohicon road rehabilitation.
'Godomey-Bohicon Abomey Road Reconstruction
3.06      The works as designed consisted of resurfacing throughout, with
long stretches of base reconstruction in failed areas. As the job
progressed, further deterioration took place, the rectification of which
absorbed what might have been a small surplus in the Kuwait/OPEC loans. The
work proceeded without major difficulties (the job site was closer to the
quarry) and with extensions for the extra works the final cost reached US$10
million and was within the appraisal estimate at approximately SlOO,000/km.
Resurfacing Program, Bituminous Roads (195 km)
3.07      The works progressed poorly and it soon became evident that the
scope of work had increased substantially. In particular, accelerating
deterioration on about 35 km of roads made reconstruction a necessity as
opposed to the simpler resurfacing. Several reasons account for the poor
progress of works; some of the shorter stretches of reconstruction were
interspersed with stretches requiring extensive patching and resealing,
thereby obviating economies of scale; there was interference from traffic on
the outskirts of urban areas. A major reason for the delays, however, was
the bad functioning of the contractor's quarry. Because of labor
difficulties, poor management and organization, the quarry was frequently
shut down. In addition, the quarry itself was 120 km away from the coast
where the works were being executed and so the supply of aggregates became
irregular, and costs increased because the long haul from the quarry to the
work sites was not foreseen in the SAR.
3.08      As a result of the above circumstances, poor progress and increased
costs, it was agreed to reduce the scope of the works initially planned by 84
km (from 195 km to Ill km) and to include the balance of the works in the
Fourth Highway Project, (Credit 1142).6/ (The Association estimated that
6/ The Four'h Highway Project, Credit 1142 was signed 'June 19, 1981.



the additional cost to complete work on all of the 195 km would be about US$6
million). It vas expected that resurfacing and rehabilitation works included
in both the Third aun the Fourth Highway Projects would be finished in early
1982, with about a six-month delay. The credit closing date for the Third
Project was accordingly extended to June 30, 1982.7/
3.09      However, the contractor suffered further delays and increased
costs, principally due to the poor output from their quarry, and only 55 km
out of the 111 km were surface dressed or rehabilitated under the project.
The average cost was US$57,000 per km vs. the estimated cost at appraisal of
US$26,500 per km. The Association considered it reasonable to assess the
liquidated damages against the contractor. However, the MTPCH did not accept
this on the grounds that contractor was a State enterprise and assessing
damages would therefore be against the MTPCH's interest.
Regravelling Program, Laterite Roads (273 km)
3.10      Award of tenders for equipment for regravelling were delayed
because of poor management, admInistration and intervening price rises.
Eventually the equipment was delivered in mid-1979 instead of early 1978 as
scheduled at appraisal. In the interim, the Governmemt in late 1978, with
considerable difficulty, assembled two brigades from the equipment normally
used for routine road maintenance. Progress of the force account brigades
however, remained relatively slow until arrival of new equipment in 1979. By
early 1982, 252 km were rehabilitated out of the planned 273 km but with
drainage (ditches, culverts and small bridges) completed on only 55 km of the
roads. Eventually, the brigades came to function more effectively but their
costs were still high at $17,000/ka of fully completed regravelling and
drainage (1981 prices) as compared with the appraisal estimate of $6,800/km.
The works were continued under the Fourth High Project when the number of the
force account reconstruction brigades was increased from two to four.
Technical Assistance to the DSP of the Ministry of Transport
3.11      An early supervision mission found that the assignment of this
Technical Assistance relative to its size (30 man-months) was too extensive.
It was therefore agreed with the Borrower to concentrate on selected elements
from the terms of reference for technical assistance. This may reflect to
some extent the discontinuity in Bank personnel during the project
7/ Due to the continued slow performance of the Government, the Credit
1142-BEN for the Fourth Highway Project became effective only in April
1982, nearly one year after approval by the Board. As a consequence,
payments to the contractor under Credit 1142-BEN were also delayed for
more than one year and the contractor slowed down execution of works.
This lead to two successive extensions ofthe closing date.



- 8 -
identification-appraisal-supervision cycle and the differing perceptions of
the amount of Technical Assistance appropriate and capable of being absorbed.
3.12      During the two years of implementation, the technical assistance to
DSP in the transport ministry was involved in day-to-day procedures and were
consulted on policy decisions. They made studies concerning various aspects
of transport policy and management, ranging from overall transport policy, a
proposal for a national traffic counting organization and the Oiudah-Allada
road preinvestment study (para. 2.07).  The transport engineer also acted
part-time as an unofficial team leader in DROA. The two counterparts worked
closely with the technical assistants, becoming familiar with traffic
projections and surveys. They were later sent to Canada for six months under
the fellowship component of the credit for university training and to gain
work experience with public and private transportation bodies. Although they
came back later to DSP, Ministry of Transport has apparently abandoned the
momentum provided under this technical assistance consultancy.
3.13      The project provided funds for a small extension to the office
building housing DSP, to make space available for the two technical
assistance experts and counterparts. As no serious space problems arose the
building was not extended. Some of the funds were made available for the
urgent purchase of office equipment and furniture in the existing building
and the remaining funds were allocated to other project components.
Technical Assistance to DROA
3.14       The technical assistance provided to DROA in the management
equipping and execution of the regravelling and resealing programs was
successful. The experts functioned in an integrated manner vith DROA and
were an important factor in the accomplishment of works.
3.15      Some of the funds for fellowships were used to provide a ten-month
course at the polytechnic institute in Cotonou for twelve Engineering
Technicians which required a high school certificate for entry. The course
was successful and was repeated in 1982. On conclusion the trainees returned
to DROA. As initially planned they were placed either as counterpart of the
expatriate experts or as chiefs of torce account brigades.
Project Cost
3.16      The final cost of the project in its reduced scope (US$22.2
million) has not changed much from the appraisal estimate. However, an
advancing deterioration made it necessary to substitute strengthening or
rehabilitation works where surface treatment was originally planned, the cost
per kilometer has increased significantly. As a result, the scope of paved
road maintenance had to be significantly reduced from 195 km planned to 55 km
accomplished. The final cost of rehabilitating the Godomey-Bohicon road is
about the same as estimated at appraisal.
3.17      The cost experience reflected generally the rise in prices
following the oil crisis in 1978, the delay in mobilization, the severe



construction constraints (para. 3.07), the under-estimation of the rapidity
with which the roads and (existing) equipment would deteriorate (paras.
3,03), and the weakness of the local contractor. This points, inter alia, to
*           the need for realistic project plannIng, using appropriate procurement
p-ocedures for civil works, and to the importance of minimizing delays
between appraisal and execution.
Procurement and Disbursements
3.18      Disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates by at least a year
throughout the project. As of June 30, 1983, US$9.95 million of the S10
million credit had been disbursed, and the small balance was cancelled.
Procurement followed the provisions of the credit documents except for the
contract for resealing of roads where a negotiated contract was awarded.
Other procurement problems related to the excessive delays in administering
the tendering and to delays in the award procedures by DROA.
Covenant Experience
3.19      In general, covenants were complied with.  Difficu'lties arose with
the following:
(a)   lack of qualified staff prevented regular exchange of
information for maintenance planning;
(b)   the budget for maintenance operations was generally ac-
ceptable and reasonable in relation to staff and equipment
constraints but the budgeted amounts were not fully disbursed
during the financial year because they were made available too
late. Although the contributions from ear-marked fuel taxes
vere regularly disbursed. the state contributions were erratic;
Cc)   study of the characteristics of the public and private trans-
port and recommendations concerning the maintenance of a
balance were the subject of the DSP consultants' reports, but
there is x.o ind4cation that the Goverument took any action on
these recommendations;
(d)   an acccunting system for spare parts inventory and manage-
ment was only partially implemented.
Consultants Performance
3.20     The consultant's team members performed well, integrating themselves
to an unusual degree within DROA operations and with its personnel.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
4.01     As indicated by the covenant experience, the practice of making funds
for road maintenance available on a timely basis made little progress. The
collection and processing of information for planning maintenance, the
establishment of an adequate accounting system for inventorv management and



- 10 -
the beginning of an attempt to rationalize policies for freight and passert%er
transport and revising tariffs and taxes, vere also addressed only in part.
IDA is continuing institution building under ongoing Port, Feeder Roads and
the Fourth Highway Projects.
4.02     The technical assistance for institution building was generally
successful after its scope was reduced (para. 3.11). The DROA integrated the
consultants into its activities. This was less the case within DSP. but tIe
technical assistants assigned made a contribution by their studies and
reports.
V. REEVALUATION OF THE ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
Background
5.01 - The project vas justified on the basis of quantified benefits Atising
from:
(a)   savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) resulting from the
rehabilitation of the GodoMey-Bohicon road. This road i$
the southern leg of the "Benin Route;"
(b)   VOC savings resulting from resurfacing 55 km of the heavi 4
trafficked paved links of the country's major east-vest c'astal
highway; and
(c)   VOC savings due to improving about 252 km of very poor
laterite roads to good gravel standards.
Other benefits resulting from improved road conditions such as journey Cl15
savings and enhanced road safety were not included in the analysis. The
economic analysis was based on simulating total transport costs (rehabill-
tation/resurfacing. maintenance and VOC) with the aid of the Highway Des:gn
and Maintenance Model (EDW) which relates the impact of road deterioratlon
under alternative maintenance policies and traffic loads to VOCs.
5.02      At appraisal the estimated economic rate of return (ERR) for the
Godomey-Bohicon road was 35% with individual sections yielding a low of 13% to
a high of 47% under conservative assumptions. Similarly the overall ERA for
surface dressing the paved roads was 155% with individual sections rangirig frova
37% to 335% again under conservative estimates of traffic growth.  For the
laterite road resurfacing the overall ERR was 54Z which varied for individual
links between 29% to 79%. Because the costs were not based on bid pric6e and the
traffic data were somewhat uncertain, the appraisal presented extensive tensirtv-
ity analysis incorporating cost increases of up to 250% and benefits decteases of
up to 70% simultaneously.  Even under these extreme cases of costs and bFnefiEt
fluctuations, the estimated ERR's were acceptable which pointed to the Ptoject's
high priority.



- 11 -
Re-estimated ERRs
5.03     Upon project completion, based on final costs and aztual traffic, the
re-estimated overall ERR of 122% confirms the project's priority despite the
reduced scope of works for the paved roads. The re-estimat.ed overall ERR's
for paved and unpaved roads are: 142% for paved roads compared vith 155%
estimated during appraisal and 272 for gravel roads compared vith 54% esti-
mated during appraisal.  The re-estimated ERR's take into account the higher
than anpraisal estimates of maintenance costs because of the overall higher
than expected traffic, and because part of the Cotonou-Guezin road passes over
a causeway and traverses swampy terrain,( not the Digie swamp over which
there was difficulty on a prior IDA project). Additionally, in view of the
economic difficulties in Benin and the neighboring countries. as vell as
modest chances of growth in the short-term, future traffic growth has been
assumed at 4% per year instead of the 102 to 4% range assumed during ap-
praisal. The civil works costs also include supervision and technical assis-
tance-the latter for force account brigades. However, although the
re-estimated ERRs should have taken into account the accelerating road deteri-
oration under the base case (and the consequent increase in vehicle operating
costs), this was found impracticable for lack of information needed to cali-
brate vehicle operating cost coefficients. Therefore, the appraisal estimates
of VOC's (Table 2) have been used in the re-estimated ERR's. However, in view
of the country's limited road maintenance capacity, road conditions after
improvements have been assumed to remain less than ideal with an average road
roughness index of 4,000 mm/km for paved and 6,000 mm/km for gravel roads.
5.04     The re-estimated ERR's for works compare reasonably with the ap-
praisal estimates. This is due primarily tG the higher than expected traffic
on the roads which could be explained by considering that: (a) the Cotonou-
Seme-Porto Novo road connects the two largest cities and traverses a zone of
the heaviest industrial activities in the country; (b) the intensely traf-
ficked Cctonou-Guezin road (Table 3) is the east-west trunk road connecting
Nigeria and Togo. The cumbersome border formalities along the frontiers
having been gradually relaxed, a significant barrier to development of heavier
vehicle traffic in particular has been removed; (c) the Godomey-Abomey road
links the economically active Mono and the Atlantic provinces; and (d) the
gravel roads link areas of significant population density and economic acti-
vities.
5.05     The re-estimated ERR for all paved roads is 142%, vs the 155 ap-
praisal estimate. On the Cotonou-Seme section the re-estimated ERR is 276%
vs. 2002 at appraisal and on the adjoining Seme-Porto Novo section the re-
estimated -RR is 267% compared with 335Z estimated during appraisal. This is
because actual traffic is twice as high as estimated during appraisal on the
Cotonou-Seme road while on the Seme-Porto Novo road it is only a third higher
than expected and not enough to absorb the combined effects of a lower traffic
growth rate and lower benefits because road roughness after improvements is
assumed to be higher than at appraisal to account for the maintenance ineffi-
ciencies. The re-estimated ERR for Cotouou-Guezin road is 161% vs. the 287%
appraisal estimate. The main reason for the lower ERR is that only about 40%
of the road has been completed at about twice the appraisa'l estimated cost of
completing the whole road (62 km). On the other hand, the adverse effects of



- 12 -
the increased construction costs on the ERR have been considerablv dampened bv
a significant increase in the truck traffic on this major trunk road--over
half compared with 10% estimated during appraisal. Finally, the re- estimated
ERR on the Godomey-Abomey road is 110% compared with the appraisal estimate of
35%.  This road links the country's two most economically active provinces of
Atlantic and Mono.  In addition to an over 40% increase in traffic over the
appraisal estimates, nearly half the traffic consists of heavier vehicles, for
which the unit benefits of road improvements are four to five times higher
than lighter vehicles. This yields a 2002 increase in benefits from the
additional heavy traffic which largely explains the higher re-estimated ERR.
5.06     The re-estimated ERR for gravel roads vary from a high of 522 t±r the
Ketou-Kpedekpo road to a low of 15% for the Kerou-Banikora section compared
with the appraisal estimate of 32% for the former and 79% for the latter. The
overall re-estimated ERR for the gravel roads is 27% compared with the ap-
praisal estimate of 54%. Although traffic has increased over appraisal
expectations. the lower re-estimated ERRs are explained mainly by the lower
benefits resulting from less than ideal road conditions. The appraisal
estimates of benefits assume appropriate and timely maintenance which is not
expected to be the case. Thus, overall, the benefits used to re-estimate the
ERRs are about 30 to 40% lower.
5.07     For both the paved and gravel roads the re-estimated ERR is 122Z. The
lowest re-estimated ERR is 15% for one gravel road section. Thus. the re-
estimated ERRs confirm the project priority. However, as the traffic data
used in the analysis shows apparent inconsistencies, the re-estimated ERRs are
subject to a margin of error which, nevertheless would be in the acceptable
range given the overall high ERR values. Efforts, under the ongoing Fourth
Highway Project, are being directed to improve, inter alia, traffic statis-
tics.
VI. BORROWER AND BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01      The Borrower's performance vas mixed.  The MTPCH performed
adequately but the Government's cumbersome procedures for procurement and
disbursement were unsatisfactory. Senior staff was frequently and
unnecess4rily changed with negative effects on administrative efficiency.
6.02      The Borrower agreed to reduce the scale of bituminous road
surfacing in view of escalating costs and increased quantities of works. The
original project scope, should in retrospect, have been more modest. The
Borrower also reached agreement with the Association to award the contract
for the roads to be resurfaced to the Godomey-Bohicon road contractor,
on a basis compatible with the Bank's procurement guidelines, and with IDA
agreement. Despite this contractor's adequate performance on the Godomey-
Bohicon road, his performance was very poor on the resurfacing contract.
6.03      The Borrower was generally cooperative in regard to technical
assistance. However, given the Borrower's limited capacity to absorb
technical assistance, the impact On institution building is less than
expected.



- 13 -
6.04      The Association's supervision of the project was less than
adequate, considering the difficult economic and political environment
prevailing during project implementation. There should have been more
supervision from the Association (only 2.5 man week/year were provided) and
there should have been more continuity of Association supervisory staff.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      Overall, the project was moderately successful.  Its full impact
should be assessed in combination with the Fourth Highway Project when the
latter is completed. The completion of all three road components was delayed
by up to two years because of slow Government administration and poor
performance by a contractor.
7.02      Technical assistance efforts vere fairly successful, but with the
Borrower's limited absorptive capacity, the impact of those aimed at
institutional building is uncer:ain. There were sound advances in training,
and the borrower became aware o' the importance of proper budgeting for
maintenance. Detailed plans were made for a reform of DROA's management and
of its budget structure, and were incorporated in the Fourth Highway Project.
which was prepared entirely by DROA, the Consultants and IDA during the third
project. The training component was a major success and has led to the
creation of a small permanent trair'ng center during the fourth project.
7.03     As part of a series of IDA interventions aimed at rehabilitating
Benin's road network and improving the institutional capacity for road mainte-
nance, the project achieved adequate results.

(Extended subsequently to 31.12.1981, 31.12.1982
and 31.12.1983)
Loan Amount           : 2.25 Million Kuwaiti Dinars
Interest Rate         : 2.0%

This was Kuwait Fund's first loan to Benin. As we were
financing only the rehabilitation of Godomy-Bahicon-Aboney Road
(including consultants services) our experience of the
borrower's performance was rather limited but similar to yours
in that Benin mainly suffers from cumbersome and slow
administrative and prucurement procedures. This has lead to
the delay of implementation of the project by about two years
and hence the further deterioration of the road.
Luckily, on the credit side, our loan was sufficient to
meet the rehabilitation of the whole road, which was completed
satisfactorily as you know, leaving a small balance of about
150 thousand Kuwaiti Dinars. However, the contracts with both
the civil contractor and the consultants had to be extended
twice to cater for the additional work. This also involved
considerable delay.
We hope that you will find the above remarks of some
use in preparing your final report. If any additiona:
information is needed we shall be happy to provide it.
With best regards
Yours sincerely,
Abdulwahab Al-Bader
Director of Onerations
