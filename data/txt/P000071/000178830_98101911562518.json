Cotonou by providing for the rehabilitation of a\n            107 km section of the country's main north-south road\n            axis. The project would also expand the highway maintenance\n            program begun under the two previous highway projects,\n            including the elimination of the backlog of bituminous and\n            laterite roads resurfacing. It would provide technical\n            assistance for highway maintenance and for strengthening the\n            country's transport planning and coordination capacity.\n            Finally, it would include some pre-investment studies. The\n            major beneficiaries of vehicle operating cost reductions\n            would be the local truck owners and operators, but cost\n            reductions are expected to be passed on to farmers in the\n            form of higher farmgate prices. About 300,000 people live in\n            the area influenced by the main road and more than one\n            million in the areas served by the other project roads."}, "docdt": "1977-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
