The\n            project hopes to achieve: (a) increased agricultural\n            production and productivity in the State of Bahia; (b) more\n            employment opportunities for low-income farm families; (c)\n            increased state and regional institutional capacity to\n            provide efficient agricultural services to small farmers;\n            and (d) greater water resource development and technology\n            generation and diffusion. This latter objective will\n            decrease small farmer vulnerability to recurring drought\n            cycles. The project, itself, will support water resource\n            development for both agricultural and domestic use,\n            agricultural research at the state and regional levels,\n            rural extension, investment credit, marketing services,\n            funding for community subprojects, and project\n            administration and training."}, "docdt": "1986-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
