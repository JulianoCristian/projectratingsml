framework\n            for improved national trade logistics, transportation,\n            Information and Communication Technology, or ICT, and trade\n            facilitation. Policy reforms supported by this operation\n            will focus on the following pillars: i) strengthening\n            national coordination and regulation; ii) strengthening\n            intra-island connectivity; iii) improving inter-island\n            connectivity; and iv) improving International connectivity\n            (trade facilitation). The DPL to Indonesia for US$100\n            million is designed to assist the Government of Indonesia\n            (GoI) to strengthen the policy framework for improved\n            national trade logistics, transportation, and ICT and trade\n            facilitation. In developing the operation, the Bank and the\n            Government considered several design alternatives, including\n            the possibility of supporting such reforms through a single\n            multisectoral DPL. The overall focus of the INSTANSI DPL,\n            Connectivity DPL and Financial Sector and Investment Climate\n            Reform and Modernization Development Policy Loan (FIRM DPL)\n            is consistent with the World Bank's Development Policy\n            Review (2008), and they are fully aligned with the 2009-2012\n            Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR). The\n            connectivity DPL is expected to further enhance coordination\n            and implementation of GoI reforms in the connectivity\n            agenda, which is critical for accelerating growth to 7\n            percent and beyond, and continuing improvements in social\n            outcomes over the medium term."}, "docdt": "2012-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
