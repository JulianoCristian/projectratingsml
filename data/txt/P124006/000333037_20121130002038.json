Directors expressed support for the objectives\n            of the loan, which aims to assist the Government of\n            Indonesia to strengthen the policy framework for improved\n            trade logistics, transportation, Information and\n            Communication Technologies (ICT) network, and international\n            trade facilitation. They agreed that this DPL is fully\n            aligned with the country's national connectivity\n            strategy and action plan. Directors commended the Government\n            for this initiative to include remote groups in the\n            country's economic development. Executive Directors\n            encouraged the Government to continue efforts in\n            strengthening policy coordination to accelerate improvement\n            in connectivity and instill confidence in investors.\n            Directors further called for a stronger regulatory\n            environment for sea transport and logistics services. In\n            addition, Directors emphasized the need to incorporate the\n            targeting of vulnerable groups in the design and\n            implementation of the operation to address inter-regional\n            economic disparity. Lastly, Directors noted the extensive\n            consultation with development partners, and encouraged\n            continued strong cooperation with International Finance\n            Corporation (IFC)."}, "docdt": "2012-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
