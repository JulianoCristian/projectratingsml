Indonesia were moderately satisfactory with\n            substantial risk to the development outcome. The\n            performances by both the Bank and the Borrower were\n            moderately satisfactory. There were no significant changes\n            or restructuring made to to this program. There were seven\n            recorded lessons learned from this project and are as\n            follows: (1) The Bank needs to strike a balance between\n            (Development Policy Loans) DPLs supporting reform in narrow\n            areas with narrower outcomes but less risk, versus a widely\n            cross-cutting DPLs supporting reform in broader areas that\n            is riskier but often could have more development impact. (2)\n            A cross-cutting DPL does not automatically translate into\n            improved coordination within the implementing ministries. A\n            suggested approach would be for the Government to focus on\n            policy actions themselves and structure the coordination\n            meetings around their relation to the strategic-level\n            Government connectivity agenda. (3) Complementing Bank\n            instruments, such as TAs, could be used for an effective\n            implementation of widely cross-cutting DPL. The\n            cross-cutting nature and the lack of focus of the\n            Connectivity DPL made it difficult to use complementing\n            existing Bank instruments to improve its effectiveness. (4)\n            Having more than one strong counterpart is a suitable\n            arrangement for cross-cutting DPLs involving several\n            ministries and agencies. It is key that the counterpart\n            champions policy reforms, as in the case of Bappenas that\n            had a high-level representative, whereas some of the other\n            agencies were represented by echelons 3 or below. (5)\n            Electoral cycles may have an impact on the momentum of\n            reforms and it is important to consider the potential\n            bureaucratic obstacles to reforms that appear especially\n            during the pre-election period. (6) In a middle-income\n            country without problems to access financial markets, a DPL\n            should be seen as one instrument, among others, to improve\n            the chances of long-term, structural, reforms. (7) In light\n            of the experience of the first two Connectivity DPLs, a\n            number of factors would need to be considered (see Section 6\n            for further elaboration)."}, "docdt": "2014-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
