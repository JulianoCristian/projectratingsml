      Executive Directors approved the Connectivity Development Policy Loan (DPL) to
the Republic of Indonesia in the amount of US$100 million on the payment terms and
conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum (R2012-0217).

       Directors expressed support for the objectives of the loan, which aims to assist the
Government of Indonesia to strengthen the policy framework for improved trade logistics,
transportation, ICT network, and international trade facilitation. They agreed that this DPL is
fully aligned with the country’s National Connectivity Strategy and Action Plan. Directors
commended the Government for this initiative to include remote groups in the country’s
economic development.

       Executive Directors encouraged the Government to continue efforts in strengthening
policy coordination to accelerate improvement in connectivity and instill confidence in
investors. Directors further called for a stronger regulatory environment for sea transport and
logistics services. In addition, Directors emphasized the need to incorporate the targeting of
vulnerable groups in the design and implementation of the operation to address inter-regional
economic disparity. Lastly, Directors noted the extensive consultation with development
partners, and encouraged continued strong cooperation with IFC.
