1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Economic context
The economy proved resilient to the 2008/9 global financial crisis and the subsequent slow
and uneven recovery in high-income economies. Growth slowed from 6.0 percent in 2008 to
4.6 percent in 2009, but subsequently rebounded and has remained in the 5.8-6.5 percent range in
every quarter since the beginning of 2010. This resilience can be attributed to strong initial
conditions going into the crisis, the related availability and deployment of sizable fiscal and
monetary buffers to cushion the shock, and Indonesia’s lower dependence on external demand
relative to many of its regional peers. Consumer inflation moderated, from an average of 8.7
percent per year in 2003-08 to 4.9 percent in 2009-12, helped by the absence of any major food or
administered price shocks through mid-2013. This solid performance attracted strong investor
interest, fueled by abundant global liquidity. However, portfolio investment inflows, although
generally strong, were prone to bouts of significant volatility, providing a reminder that Indonesia
remains susceptible to external shocks through the financial channel, given high foreign
ownership shares of both stocks and bonds.

By the time of the second Connectivity DPL, Indonesia’s economy was showing signs of a
slowdown, having been hit by a negative trade shock as global commodity prices and
demand have fallen since 2011. Over 2012, the major drag on growth was net exports, with
export volumes rising just 2.0 percent but import volumes increasing by a more robust 6.7
percent, reflecting the strength of domestic demand; net exports consequently reduced growth in
2012 by 1.5 percentage points. Investment growth also fell over the second half of 2012, and by
the start of 2013 was decelerating from 12.5 percent yoy in Q2 2012 to 4.7 percent yoy in Q2
2013. The main cause of weaker investment growth has been a sharp slowdown in machinery and
equipment spending, and the softening in international commodity prices since early 2011 has
likely filtered into investment. On the production side, weakness was concentrated in
commodities sectors, such as mining and quarrying (contracting 1.2 percent yoy in Q2 2013),
compared with more robust performance in manufacturing (up 5.8 percent), construction (up 6.9
percent), and especially the services sector (up 7.5 percent).

Indonesia’s current account balance has deteriorated since 2011. In 2012 Indonesia recorded
its first annual current account deficit since 1997, of US$ 24.2 billion or 2.8 percent of GDP,
compared with a small surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2011. Pressure on the current account has
persisted in 2013, with quarterly deficits of US$ 5.8 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) and US$ 9.8
billion (4.4 percent of GDP) recorded in Q1 and Q2. While the bulk of this swing was due to
decreasing goods trade surpluses, sizable structural deficits on the services trade and income sub-
accounts also continued to weigh on the overall current account balance.

Policy and political context
From 2001 to 2010, Indonesia experienced a deepening and entrenching of democracy and a
return to stable and strong economic growth. The beginning of the current administration’s
second tenure saw widespread public disenchantment with weak law enforcement and high-
profile corruption cases. Yet despite political tensions within the Parliament, the coalition
structure and consensus-oriented approach of the ministerial cabinet were maintained. Policy-
making continued to benefit from the reform-orientation and technocratic background of several
key cabinet members as well as leadership from the President and Vice President. A cabinet

reshuffle in the second half of 2011 saw some significant changes, including in the economic
ministries, but the overall reform orientation of the cabinet has remained.

By 2013, the political outlook was clouded by uncertainties over who might become the next
president and the direction of the new government. Adding to this, were the uncertainties over
the prospects for the continuation of market-oriented policymaking. The former Jakarta governor
increasingly gained popularity, as a clean governance reformer with a focus on improving public
service delivery, especially to the poor. Meanwhile, as election year approached, the political
pressure for the government to take more populist policies was mounting. Resistance for
reduction in fuel subsidies, regulatory uncertainties in the extractive sectors (i.e., mining, oil, and
gas), and pressure to increase regional minimum wage rates were among the politically sensitive
issues that the government was confronting. The uncertainties undermined the already stretched
mandate of the Connectivity Working Group in charge of policy reform in the area of
connectivity.

Strategic context
Improved connectivity and national market integration have been recognized as important
means to reduce poverty and to increase competitiveness and economic growth. The
connectivity agenda was reflected in the Medium-Term National Development Plan (RPJMN)
2010-2014 and the Masterplan for “Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia’s Economic
Development 2011-2025” (MP3EI). The RPJMN recognized improved transportation
infrastructure as an important component in achieving better connectivity and market integration.
Meanwhile, the MP3EI, launched in 2011, sought to accelerate growth by: (i) fostering centers of
growth across economic corridors; (ii) strengthening national connectivity to link growth poles
across and within economic corridors; and (iii) complementing connectivity by improving human
resources capabilities and increasing investments in research and development. The plan set an
ambitious target for Indonesia to grow beyond 7 percent annually and achieve a status of an
emerging industrialized country by 2025.

The first and second Connectivity DPLs supported the 2009-2012 Country Partnership
Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR) and the 2013-2015 CPS, respectively. The first
Connectivity DPL was fully in line with the emphasis of the CPSPR, issued in 2011, on
strengthening Indonesia’s institutions and systems, a key cross-sectoral engagement theme. The
second Connectivity DPL supported the broader goal of the 2013-15 CPS, which is to enhance
Indonesia’s domestic capacity for reducing poverty and boosting equitable and sustainable
prosperity. The CPS highlighted the Connectivity DPL program as a key World Bank Group
(WBG) instrument, particularly in the pro-growth engagement area, by promoting prosperity
through enhanced connectivity, strengthened competitiveness and promotion of infrastructure
development. The CPS recognized that the key to addressing connectivity challenges lies in
policy coordination and implementation across multiple levels of government and consultation
with the private sector

The Connectivity DPL series was designed as a two-year programmatic DPL series. To
ensure full ownership of the program, a detailed mapping out of the programmatic DPL series
was developed jointly with Bappenas, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs and the
relevant line ministries/agencies. The Connectivity DPLs provided a time-bound process for GoI
to coordinate and implement policy reforms on connectivity. This process was critical to ensure
sustained follow-up for Government and parliamentary initiatives in issuing regulations to
support the connectivity agenda. Given that the implementation of GoI’s connectivity agenda
involved agencies beyond the core economic ministries, the DPLs also supported GoI’s efforts to
strengthen the coordination and reform processes among the various agencies, including the

                                                   2
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of Public Works. The Government has
indicated the possibility of continuing the engagement through a follow-on Connectivity DPL
operation. However, considering the current political transition, actual design and preparation for
a third DPL would have to wait until early 2015 at the soonest.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The overall goal of the Connectivity DPL program is to assist the Government of Indonesia
to strengthen the policy framework for improved national trade logistics, transportation,
ICT, and trade facilitation.

The original Key Outcome Indicators of DPL1 focused on contributing to the achievement of the
following targeted outcomes by 2013:
• Better coordination and implementation of connectivity reform efforts, as measured by better
   policy making process through effective functioning of the Connectivity Working Group and
   National Logistics Team to coordinate and implement policy reforms;
• Improved intra-island connectivity, as measured by increase investors’ confidence,
   stakeholders participation in the national connectivity agenda, strengthen progress in
   restructuring of the railway sector, and improve planning and implementation of public road
   investment;
• Improved inter-island connectivity, as measured by strengthen ICT connectivity between
   Eastern and Western Indonesia and introduce more competition in broadband services;
• Improved international connectivity, as measured by reduced time for import and exporting.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

There were no changes to the PDO between the first and second Connectivity DPL. The
Key Outcome Indicators had minor revisions for the 2014 targeted outcomes. These were:
• Strengthened National Coordination and Regulation, as demonstrated through increased
  Government effectiveness and rapidity in supporting infrastructure development, and use of
  the Viability Gap Financing;
• Strengthened intra-island connectivity, as measured by effective application of the legal and
  regulatory frameworks for land acquisition, clear PSO compensation for the railway operator
  and use of performance based contracts in the national road network;
• Improved inter-island connectivity, as measured through increased share of Indonesian
  population with broadband access and informed policy-making on sea port development; and
• Improved international connectivity through improved customs and border management in
  facilitating trade.

The changes reflected a shift in policy focus for more concrete regulatory deliverables and
more advanced reforms that exceeded previous expectations in the respective policy areas.
For example, the focus of the first pillar shifted from supporting the Connectivity Working Group
and the National Logistics Team in the first DPL to VGF mechanism in the second DPL. For the
second pillar, the shift reflected developments in the land acquisition, railway, and road sector
regulations. The third pillar, in the second DPL, added an important element of inter-island
connectivity: port development. Finally, the last pillar expanded on the institutional mechanisms
of the Indonesia National Single Window. These changes are also examples of the need to
maintain flexibility in a multi-year DPL reform agenda and the usefulness of having benchmarks
to map out the necessary reforms.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

Policy reforms supported by this operation focus on the following more specific objectives:

(i)     Strengthening National Coordination and Regulation through establishment of
        regulatory and institutional frameworks for improved coordination and implementation of
        the connectivity agenda;
(ii)    Strengthening Intra-island Connectivity through improved connectivity among and
        between growth poles, with improved regulatory framework for land acquisition for
        public purpose development and optimal use of resources for sustainable improvement
        and maintenance of island-transport network;
(iii)   Improving Inter-island Connectivity through improved access, efficiencies and service
        performance in ICT and domestic shipping; and
(iv)    Improving International Connectivity (trade facilitation) by strengthening the
        institutions and processes in handling traffic and trade volume.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

There were no major changes except for an addition of domestic shipping objective under
pillar III. The absence of a domestic shipping policy action in the first DPL was due to the
request of the Ministry of Transportation, who felt unsure that the National Port Master Plan
would be finalized in time. The Master Plan was signed during the discussions for the second
DPL.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

Both DPLs were prepared and delivered within their time frame. The four specific objectives
were maintained throughout the two DPLs with minor changes. Policy actions as stipulated in the
Program Document were fulfilled at the time of the approvals. The final achievement status of the
indicators is detailed in Section F (a) on PDOs above.

Progress of the prior actions reflected regulatory development and their contribution to the
Government’s connectivity priorities. Table 2 shows the Policy Actions for each pillar, as
agreed and implemented by the Government. Policy actions numbers 1 and 7 – on the National
Logistics System Blueprint and on road PBC – were not carried on in the second DPL, but the
indicators were refined to make them more measurable. Policy action number 2 was taken further
in the second DPL to reflect a more specific action relating to the VGF funding mechanism for
PPP projects. Policy action number 3, on land acquisition, was developed further from higher
legal products – a Law and a Presidential Regulation – in the first DPL into two policy actions
(numbers 3 and 4) to cover more specific land acquisition guiding regulations in the second DPL.
Similarly, policy action number 5 was also developed into two policy actions in the second DPL
– numbers 5 and 6 –, to specify regulatory guidelines for railway sector subsidy and TAC and
IMO payments. Policy action number 8 evolved from a regulatory action to a more specific action
relating to the use of the ICT Fund. Policy action number 9 – on the Port Master Plan – was not

                                                4
   ready to be included in the first DPL, but it firmed up by the time of the second DPL. Policy
   action number 10 moved from regulatory action in the first DPL to the establishment of an
   agency in the second DPL. Policy action number 11 expanded on the number of agencies linked
   to the SSO system of the INSW.

   One emerging pattern from this DPL is the lag between policy and regulatory reforms and
   actual implementation. Therefore the full achievements of the DPLs will take longer to
   materialize. The outcomes and impact of the DPL will continue to be constrained by layers of
   administrative, bureaucratic, legal, or political hurdles. There are also some specified lags
   between the issuance/signing of a regulation and the effective date of implementation of the
   regulation – these include, for example, the land regulations and the INSW regulation. These
   administrative lags would need to be taken into consideration when measuring achievements of
   the DPLs.

   The DPLs established traction in furthering important connectivity policy issues and
   institutional development. The DPLs were able to contribute to advancing significant agenda,
   including on land acquisition, PPP financing, and INSW. Progress on specific sectors – such as
   railway, roads, and ports – also reflected important institutional development. Despite limits to
   technical-level buy-in, and although the pace of reforms slowed during the political transition in
   mid-2014, connectivity remains an important component of Indonesia’s development strategy and
   is likely to continue under the new Government that took office in late October 2014. The
   Connectivity DPL series, in spite of the political transition at the time of the writing of the ICR,
   helped strengthen institutional foundations within the Government, as well as putting in place the
   necessary interface between the Bank and the Government, that could be relevant and responsive
   to the connectivity agenda of the new Government.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Several factors contributed to the performance of the Connectivity DPL series. The positive
ones include strong government ownership and relevant policy priority. The challenges faced by
the DPLs have more to do with nuances related to coordination, programmatic focus, and the use
of complementary Bank instruments.

Government ownership was strong. The main counterpart for the DPL, the National
Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) envisaged the DPLs as tools to accelerate policy and
regulatory reforms that the Government was already preparing or planning to prepare. The same
was true of the secondary counterpart, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs. In
general, there was a wide consensus on the need for connectivity reforms.

The high level of ownership is a reflection of the importance of the connectivity agenda as a
Government priority, set out in the Masterplan for the Acceleration and Expansion of Economic
Development (MP3EI) and other policy documents such as the Logistics Blue Print and the
Connectivity Master Plan. The selection of Bappenas as the main counterpart also seemed
sensible at the design stage since the Vice Minister of Bappenas serves as the Chair of the
Connectivity pillar of the MP3EI.

Yet, there was a gap between the high-level ownership and technical coordination. While
coordination at the Vice-Ministerial and echelon 1 (director-generals) levels were strong,
coordination at the technical level was not very strong. This was partly due to Bappenas’ lack of
convening power. As a planning agency, Bappenas had no effective authority over the
implementing ministries/agencies and was not able to force line ministries to meet the deadlines
of the policy targets. Another cause of the imperfect technical coordination was the lack of
understanding, at the technical level of the line ministries, of the purposes and the uses of the
DPL. These resulted in technical coordination meetings that were devoid of substantive
discussions on the contributions of the policy actions (and the ministries) to the wider
connectivity reforms as stipulated in the MP3EI. This reflects the overall weakness of the
implementing structure of Connectivity Agenda.

The programmatic design was based on the lessons of previous Indonesian DPLs (core DPLs
and FIRM DPL), which found that a programmatic approach would allow for a more
meaningful mapping of multi-year reforms and alignment with GoI priorities. The trade-off
between a narrowly focused DPL versus a cross-cutting one is a question of balance and
proportionality. With the right balance, a cross-cutting DPL could have positive and
transformative impact on Government policy reforms. In the case of the Connectivity DPL Series,
this design worked to improve strategic coordination and helped to meet the objectives of policy
reforms; but some specific targets might not fully contribute to achieve the intended overall
impact of improved connectivity.

The DPL benefited from the use of complementary Bank instruments. At the time of the
DPL, a number of technical assistance and advisory programs were also in place. These included
trust funds to support activities on PPP, road maintenance, broadband spectrum, and trade and
investment climate. They were used to facilitate discussions with Government counterparts and
implementing ministries/agencies. Yet, because of the breadth of the issues covered by the DPL,
it would have been better to find a systematic way to link the TAs/TFs to policy impact in the

                                                8
overall connectivity agenda. By contrast, the ADB provided one specific TA to accompany its
Connectivity DPL series.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The design of the results framework (Section F (a) and table 2) benefited from the flexibility
of a multi-year DPL series to respond to developments in the reform agenda, which was
reflected in the changes between the second and the first DPL targets. The second DPL
refined the targets for more direct links to policy actions. For example, those relating to the
Logistics Performance Index and dwell time were dropped in the second Connectivity DPL in
favor of regulatory and qualitative aspects of connectivity. The target for road improvements was
also refined from a vaguely worded “Expanded use of performance based contracts” in the first
DPL to a more measurable target of 50 kilometers of PBC in the second DPL. In general, these
refinements made the targets more realistic and achievable.

However, the results framework lacks sometimes direct linkage between Outcome
indicators, PDOs, and targets. Cases where there was an absence of linkage include the lack of
relevant results indicators for intra-island connectivity outcomes of increasing investors’
confidence and stakeholders’ participation in the national connectivity agenda. Some qualitative
targets were also vague and difficult to measure against impact. For example the target on
National Logistics Strategy was to have it ‘internalized’ by relevant agencies, while the policy
action for the INSW in the second DPL only asked that the Borrower decided on the legal nature
of the proposed INSW agency.

Some of the implementation risks were either foreseen by the team, fall beyond the scope of
the DPL, or were overlooked. For example, coordination risk related to the implementation of
the land acquisition regulations was noted in the 2nd Connectivity DPL Program Document. The
case of the new Parliament failing to approve the railway subsidy budget causing delay in PSO
payments and the case of delays in VGF project selection would be difficult to address, even with
a DPL. However, the mismatch between the target date for the effective application of the land
acquisition regulations (end of 2014) and the actual letters of the law, which specified that
existing projects may use the old guidelines until 31 December 2014, as well as the need for a
revision of a Government Regulation that affects IMO and TAC provisions, were clearly
overlooked by the team.

The monitoring of the DPLs was conducted through regular inter-ministerial meetings of
the implementing ministries/agencies, organized by Bappenas. The field presence of the Bank
team also allowed for continuous close monitoring of the supported reforms. The Bank team on
the ground continuously monitored and evaluated the reforms supported under the project,
throughout the preparation, appraisal and implementation of both the first and second
Connectivity DPL operations. Monitoring also benefited from policy engagement through other
Bank instruments (AAA and TA activities) that have synergies and complementarities. However,
as mentioned above, the use of other Bank instruments failed to provide coherence to the
connectivity agenda. They have also not improved coordination with the implementing
agencies/ministries, whose buy-in was crucial to the performance of the DPL.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

A third Connectivity DPL was planned during the appraisal of the second Connectivity
DPL. However, considering the transition to a new Government, this plan will need to be


                                                9
revisited after the inauguration of the new President in late October 2014. The connectivity
agenda will remain relevant for the new Government. Aspects of connectivity in which the
incoming President is likely to be interested include inter-island connectivity (maritime
highways) and trade facilitation (reduction of dwell time). At the time of the ICR, counterparts at
the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs and Bappenas have expressed the relevance and
their interest in a subsequent connectivity program.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation 21

The overall objective of the DPL series could be seen as at the right level of ambition and
was likely to be achieved. It sought to “…assist the Government of Indonesia to strengthen the
policy framework for improved national trade logistics, transportation, ICT, and trade
facilitation.” This objective explains the focus on regulatory reforms and existing, or pipeline,
policy actions.

The Connectivity DPL series remain relevant with the Government’s medium-term
objectives. The DPL supported key reforms of the connectivity component of the RPJMN and the
MP3EI, including the integration of different connectivity-related plans – the National Logistics
System, the National Transportation System, the regional development and spatial plans, and the
development of ICT –, improved coordination function of the Committees for MP3EI, and better
trade facilitation. The DPL series also remains consistent with the Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategies, both for FY2009-2012 and FY2013-2015.The first DPL was in line with the FY2009-
2012 CPS’ focus on strengthening institutions and systems. This cross-sectoral focus was served
by the coordination and regulatory reforms that the DPL helped to achieve across the four pillars.
The second DPL was also in line with the FY2013-2015CPS, which highlights connectivity and
infrastructure as part of the pro-growth engagement area by promoting prosperity. This suggests a
rating of High for the relevance of objectives.

Programmatic design and implementation followed an analytical framework that the Bank
produced in 2010, Connecting Indonesia – A Framework for Action. The report identified the
main areas of connectivity improvements – inter-island, intra-island, and international
connectivity. It also identified the need for a strong institutional framework – strategic-level
coordination, monitoring scheme, and central-local governments coordination –, effective public
spending, and smarter regulations. The report suggested that, “In order to achieve a higher level
of integration, it is important to develop a structured approach that encompasses the different
initiatives, prioritizes reform actions and promotes a high level of coordination between
government agencies.” 22 The Connectivity DPL Series is a direct follow-up from the analyses
provided by the report and should be conducive to achieving the intended objectives.

The implementation of the program remains relevant to the overall objective of
strengthening connectivity policy frameworks. However, when applied separately, the sub-
objectives or policy areas lack coherence and overall impact on connectivity improvements. For
example, the intra-island outcome indicators of increased investors’ confidence and stakeholders’

participation in the national connectivity agenda lack direct linkage to improved connectivity –
through which infrastructure investment would be the presumed transmission mechanism, but the
measurement of which was absent in the DPL. The direct link between these qualitative and
process-oriented reforms to overall connectivity improvement would need to be made more
explicit. These do not diminish the importance of institutional reforms and development, on
which the DPL is focusing, nor question the decision on the cross-sectoral approach, which can
yield a more transformative change. It merely suggests that the implementation relevance to
overall objectives and impact may have been stronger. This suggests a rating of Modest for the
relevance of design and implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

1: Strengthening National Coordination and Regulation
Objective: improved coordination and implementation of the connectivity agenda through
establishment of regulatory and institutional frameworks
Ratings: Substantial

The objective under this pillar aimed at specific aspects of coordination reforms in regard
to connectivity. In the first Connectivity DPL this meant a focus on operationalizing the National
Logistics Blueprint. In the second DPL it focused on an even more specific component of
connectivity – the Viability Gap Fund for PPP projects. The government realized the prominence
of strengthening policy coordination across ministries and agencies in order to move forward with
its connectivity agenda. A weak mandate in resolving bottlenecks on decisions over key priority
infrastructure projects can weaken confidence to invest in connectivity infrastructure. In that
regard, a National Logistics System Blueprint is considered a best practice to coordinate a
national connectivity strategy and could snow-ball into improved overall coordination on other
connectivity-related reforms (transport, ICT, ports, roads, maritime connectivity) at the national
level. Additionally, the design of a clear, transparent market-based mechanism to channel public
sector resources into well-prepared infrastructure PPPs is important to improve their financial
viability.

The first Connectivity DPL supported institutional steps to operationalize the Logistics
Blueprint. This was built on reforms supported by previous DPLs, especially Indonesia DPL
Series 7-8, which already identified the Logistics Blueprint as a critical component of the
Government’s connectivity agenda. The Logistics Blueprint does not only aim at improving
logistics infrastructure, but also service providers, human resources, logistics technology, and
streamlining regulations. The first Connectivity DPL sought to further this reform by supporting
steps to internalize the Logistics Blueprint into key ministerial working plans and regulations. By
the time of the ICR, the target specified in DPL1 of improving the functioning of the
Connectivity Working Group and the National Logistics Team is achieved, with both groups
meeting regularly and the Connectivity Working Group releasing annual reports on the progress
of the Logistics Blueprint, ICT development, and Transportation and Energy policies. 23 In the
second DPL, no prior action was supported for this policy area, but a target was added, which
then sought to internalize the Logistics Blueprint. Throughout the period of the DPL Series, The
Logistics Blueprint has been ‘internalized’ in the Ministry of Transportation’s strategic plan and
implemented by other ministries. Its ‘big win’ targets have also been implemented and serve as

international traffic and the construction of Kalibaru as extension of Tanjung Priok port.

Initial impact on logistics performance is shown by Indonesia’s improvements along the
Logistics Performance Index (LPI). Between 2012 and 2014, its LPI rank moved up by six
places, as shown in Figure 1. Its scores also improved for infrastructure, border agencies, and
logistics competence, and declined slightly for timeliness, tracking and tracing, and international
shipments. Although many other factors affect logistics performance, including increased freight
traffic, these improvements showed the fruit of the Government’s priority on improving logistics
and connectivity. In addition, the Bank team is also working with a number of key agencies –
including the Ministry of Trade, DG Customs, the Indonesia Port Corporation, the Ministry of
Transport, and the Ministry of Finance – through other Bank instruments to continue supporting
logistics reforms.

              -30


Coordination on PPP projects should also benefit from the establishment of the Committee
for the Acceleration of the Provision of Priority Infrastructure (KKPPIP-Komite Percepatan
Penyediaan Infrastruktur Prioritas) in August 2014. The Committee was established through the
issuance of Presidential Regulation No. 75/2014. It is headed by the Coordinating Minister for
Economic Affairs and comprises the Minister of Finance, the Bappenas Minister, and the Head of
the Land Agency. The committee will focus on priority projects, provide incentives, and is
allowed to recruit private consultants for project preparation works. Yet, it is too early to foresee
the future effectiveness of this Committee and the sustainability of this initiative will very much
depend on the implementation mechanisms that the incoming Government will retain or establish
(see section on risk, below).

Results of the DPL policy actions and targets 24 on the operationalization of the Viability
Gap Fund (VGF) are less clear. The VGF committee, at the Ministry of Finance, has been
established to manage the technical, financial, and legal assessments of requests for proposals
(RFP) for VGF funding. There are now at least three projects short-listed for VGF funding. These
are: the Umbulan and Lampung clean water supplies, and the Medan-Kualanamu Airport railway
in Sumatra. VGF funding has also been budgeted in the 2014 state budget, fulfilling part of the


24
  It is noted that the target for this policy action was refined and made more specific in the second DPL
and therefore this assessment is made for the target in both first and second Connectivity DPLs.

                                                     12
target in the second DPL. 25 Actual approvals for the short-listed projects were not forthcoming
due to the reluctance of the former Minister of Finance to the use of public budget to subsidize
the private sector, especially in light of the longer term fiscal risk. 26 However, the new Minister,
formerly Vice Minister of Finance, is highly likely to proceed with VGF approval, considering
that he was instrumental in designing the VGF scheme as Vice Minister, and has made statements
to this effect soon after taking office as Minister of Finance. 27

2: Strengthening Intra-island Connectivity
Objective: Improved connectivity among and between growth poles, with improved regulatory
framework for land acquisition for public purpose development and optimal use of resources for
sustainable improvement and maintenance of island-transport network.
Ratings: Substantial

Linking rural areas with growth poles within an island can be constrained by inadequate
road infrastructure and an underdeveloped rail network. In addition, the slow pace and
uncertainties surrounding land acquisition have proven to be a significant barrier to infrastructure
investments in Indonesia. Improved legal and regulatory framework for land acquisition for
public projects, clear accounting guidelines for the railway sector, and improved road
management practices would improve investors’ confidence in infrastructure investments, as well
as improve the due diligence process and compensation standards for land acquisition, accounting
standards and public financing certainty for the railway sector, and services standards for road
construction and maintenance.

Land acquisition law, regulations, and guidelines passed since 2012 improve the clarity of
public projects. The DPL policy actions help to provide legal frameworks to address key land
acquisition issues. The law provides for a more rigorous and time bound land acquisition process,
fairer consultation process, and compensation procedure for the affected parties. The 2012
Presidential regulation the Head of Land Agency regulation provide more detailed guidance on
how planning, preparation, implementation, and transfers related to land acquisition are to be
carried out. The policy actions for the second Connectivity DPL help to further these reforms
with specific guidelines on the eligibility criteria for public funding of land acquisition at both the
national and local levels. In this regard, the PDO has been achieved. 28 When they are effective,
they would also complement the implementation of existing Bank projects. The MoF and MoHA
regulations will be used, for example, for the Western Indonesia National Road Improvement
Project (WINRIP) investment loan accounting for USD 300 million.

Although, the impact of these reforms will only be seen from January 2015, private
investment in toll road has increased in expectation of the application of the regulations. 29


25
   VGF has been budgeted since 2013 and the 2014 allocation was doubled from about IDR 600 billion to
IDR 1.1 trillion (Ministry of Finance, 2014 State Budget).

Budget,” http://www.kemenkeu.go.id/Berita/ tekan-pendanaan-infrastruktur-dari-apbn-pemerintah-dorong-
kps
28
   Again, the target for this policy action was refined, including by specifying a targeted timeline, and made
more specific in the second DPL; this assessment is, therefore, made for the target in both first and second
Connectivity DPLs. It is also noted that the targeted timeline of 2014 was mistakenly chosen, against the
stated effective implementation date of new land acquisition projects, which would start in January 2015.
29
   For example: http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/10/13/astra-launch-new-toll-road-east-java.html

                                                     13
The regulations will face a number of implementation challenges, including the capacity of the
Land Agency to fulfill its new role as responsible to implement land acquisition, vis-à-vis its
previous role as land registration agency, the uncertainty as to who should be responsible for
land provision for public projects – national, local governments, or a separate land bank agency.
These discussions will have an important implication in terms not only of the mechanisms of land
acquisition, but also on the governance aspect of it. The decision of the incoming Government to
elevate the Land Agency to an Agrarian Ministry was partly taken to strengthen the
implementation of land acquisition policy.

For the railway sector, the regulatory guidelines covering public service obligations (PSO),
infrastructure maintenance operation (IMO), and track access charges (TAC) are already
effective in 2014. The 2014 budget allocation for the state-owned railway company, PT KAI,
already uses the new guidelines, as stipulated in a 2013 ministerial regulation (Minister of
Transport Regulation PM.10/2013), which provides certainty as to how much the railway
company would need to provide subsidized economy-class fares; with an increased PSO amount
from IDR 682 trillion in 2013 to IDR 1.2 trillion in 2014, using a new formula. The initial target
of establishing an accounting system can be seen as part of the guidelines. IMO, in the amount of
IDR 1.7 trillion, and TAC, of IDR 1.5 trillion, payments are also proposed for the 2014 state
budget. These policy actions should serve as a stepping stone for an eventual separation of PT
KAI assets in a move towards a line-of-business management structure. 30

But, reforms of the railway sector are proceeding slowly. Actual implementation of IMO and
TAC payments still require a revision of a Government Regulation governing non-tax revenue for
the Ministry of Transportation, which has been revised in November 2013, but still lacks the
provisions for TAC payment. 31 Meanwhile, actual disbursement of PSO budget in 2014 was also
subject to negotiations between the Government and PT KAI, therefore causing uncertainty as to
the pricing of economy-class ticket fares. 32 Railway sector reforms will also entail not only
separation of assets, but also the management of these assets and the provisions for the related
commercial and public services, and competition issues. Resolving these issues will be difficult
especially when PT KAI, for legacy reasons, remains the only railway firm, owner, and operator
in the country.

Performance-based contracts (PBC) for roads have been piloted by the Directorate General
for Roads, Ministry of Public Works. The Ministry has awarded contracts for the maintenance
of 120 km of roads in Central and East Java and Central Kalimantan between 2011 and 2014, 33
exceeding the 50 km targeted by the Connectivity DPL. 34 In addition, the Ministry of Public
Works has expanded the pilot to four large urban areas – Jakarta, Semarang, Medan, and
Makassar – covering 100 to 250 kilometers of roads using PBC and submitted a proposed budget

   It is noted that the target for this policy action in the first DPL was focused on the establishment of an
improved accounting system that would help the Ministry of Transportation to make informed decisions on
issues such as the PSO. The second DPL refined this target to focus directly on the use of clear calculation
formula to determine PSO amounts. The second DPL also added an additional target on the provisions of
IMO and TAC.

to Parliament in August 2014. 35 The PBC approach has aimed at improving the quality of roads,
while increasing the value-for-money of public spending on roads. It integrates three aspects of
road management – design, construction, and maintenance – and provides both incentives (by
providing a long-term contract) and risk-sharing (by levying punitive charges for lack of quality)
for private road contractors and operators.

From the available metrics, Indonesia’s infrastructure performance is improving. This can
be seen from the increase in the infrastructure scores of the LPI (see figure 2) and the Global
Competitiveness Index (GCI) compiled by the World Economic Forum – in whose ranking
Indonesia moved up from 78 to 61, out of 148 countries, between 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. 36 It
is too early to measure the impact of railway management and physical road improvements at this
stage; and the scale of the reforms facilitated by the DPLs may be relatively small to warrant
attribution. However, the LPI and the GCI could be used in the future to measure the indirect
impact of the Connectivity DPL Series.

3: Improving Inter-island Connectivity
Objective: Improved access, efficiencies and service performance in ICT and domestic shipping.
Ratings: Modest

Inter-island connectivity is crucial to achieving economic integration within an archipelago
and the weak performance of Indonesian ports has led to high inter-island shipping costs.
Improving port productivity can be effective to lower transport costs. Improving intra-island
connectivity, outside of transport, can also be accelerated through expanding access to
information and communication technology (ICT). The use of the ICT Fund would support the
development of broadband ICT infrastructure in underserved areas in Indonesia. Meanwhile, port
development is perceived as an important pre-requisite for improving domestic sea freight in
Indonesia.

The ICT policy action has been achieved, although the target of completing the tender
process of the ICT Fund has not. The tendering process is on hold as an unintended

of connectivity improvement.

                                                  15
consequence of an unrelated governance issue at the Ministry of Communications and
Information. The ministry is under investigation by the Government’s audit office for the
management of its Universal Service Fund, which drew payments from telecommunications firms
for the development of mobile internet centers. Because of this case, the parliament has asked that
major programs at the Ministry are also put on hold, including the tendering process for the ICT
Fund. The revision of the ICT policy actions between the first and the second Connectivity DPL –
initially aimed at operationalizing the ICT Fund, then changed to identification of remote districts
to be funded by the Fund – reflected this development.

In hindsight, this governance risk, even if only indirectly related to the DPL, could have
been flagged in the Program Document. The team revised the relevant policy action to work
around the case. However, this lowering of ambition for the policy action also reduced the impact
of the proposed policy reforms. In a country both suffering from widespread corruption and with
an active anti-corruption campaign, this general risk should have been apparent. Secondly, any
public procurement-related policy action is also susceptible to this governance risk. Mitigation
measures could have been taken, including due diligence, in-depth consultation with line
ministries, and proper costing not only of procurement projects, but also of policy actions with
significant public investment components.

The National Port Master Plan is in place with the issuance of the Minister of
Transportation Regulation No. KP414/2013. Individual port development plans have also been
developed for new and existing ports, including Cilamaya, Kalibaru, Kuala Tanjung, Teluk
Lamong, and Tanjung Priok expansion. The Master Plan outlines different aspects of port
development, including private investment, the role of port authority, price-setting of port
services, competition, vessel safety and port facilities. In addition, the Master Plan has also led to
actual constructions of two port projects: a new port at Teluk Lamong in East Java and the
Tanjung Priok port expansion in Jakarta. However, port development by itself may not directly
improve inter-island connectivity, which might be better served by improved freight traffic,
service standards, stevedoring (loading-unloading) productivity, and measures to improve
economies of scale of serving remote and low-density ports in eastern Indonesia. It is noted that
the Bank team is also working with the National Logistics Team on the implementation of 24/7
services in Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta.

4: Improving International Connectivity (trade facilitation)
Objective: Stronger institutions and processes in handling traffic and trade volume.
Key outcome indicators: Improved customs and border management in facilitating trade.
Ratings: High

International connectivity is a key factor for Indonesia to maximize the benefits of
international trade. The purpose of a National Single Window (INSW) was to reduce the time
and cost of importing and exporting by allowing single submission, single processing and single
approval of import/export documents. Sustaining INSW requires proper institutional
arrangements and participation from the key, relevant, government border agencies. Additionally,
the single sign-on (SSO) and single submission procedures are the final goals of the INSW, which
will facilitate speedier import/export clearance processes.

The expansion and improvements of the Indonesia National Single Window is a key factor
in improving its international connectivity. An improved INSW would help to reduce port
inefficiencies, congestion, and border transactions. Currently, 18 agencies and ministries are
participating in INSW, which is implemented in six ports and three airports, representing 80
percent of Indonesia’s international trade volume. While the INSW was initially developed by a

                                                  16
private company, its formalization is necessary to sustain and accelerate customs and trade
facilitation reforms. During the period of the DPL, the Government made a decision to upgrade
the institutional status of the team in charge of coordinating the INSW, from the INSW
Preparatory Team anchored at the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs to an INSW Task
Force under the Ministry of Finance, with a steering committee chaired by the Coordinating
Minister and comprising the relevant ministers. This was subsequently done through the issuance
of the Presidential Regulation No. 76/2014 in July 2014. A task force has a weaker and less
permanent mandate than an agency, which was the target of the DPL. However, this task force,
paired with a ministerial-level steering committee, will likely set the stage for further
institutionalization and expansion of the INSW to cover more agencies/ministries and more ports
and airports. Additionally, Indonesia’s actual LPI score for border management in 2014, of 2.87,
exceeded the target set in the first DPL of 2.70.

Ultimately, the Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism will improve processing time for
export/import licenses. This system will link individual systems of the different agencies and
ministries to the INSW system. This will reduce the costs for traders and improve the efficiency
of cargo clearance process. The Government has managed to link more agencies and ministries
during the DPL period than was initially targeted. These are the Ministries of Trade and Health,
the Plant and Animal Quarantine Agencies, the Food and Drugs Agency, and the Nuclear Power
Monitoring Agency. In addition, the original target in the first DPL, a decrease of dwell time
from 6.3 days in 2011 to 5 days in 2014, has been achieved. Throughout the period of the DPL,
from late 2012 to late 2014, the monthly average dwell time decreased from 6.3 days in
November 2012 to 5.2 days in September 2014, as shown in Figure 3 below, despite increases in
freight traffic. In particular, the dwell time reduced sharply from a peak in January 2014 and if
the tendency continues throughout the year, the dwell time could be further reduced. A number of
factors contributed to this achievement, including closer collaboration between border agencies,
pushed by the former Vice Minister of Finance; substantial increase in tariffs for container
storage after they have been cleared by Customs, which induced freight companies to clear their
containers faster; and elimination of pre-verification inspection for priority lane importers, which
expedited movements of containers for this category of importers.

These reforms may have helped improve Indonesia’s logistics performance (see figures 1 and
2). Yet, there is a need to differentiate direct results and impact indicators in this pillar. Although
this pillar has met all of its targets in both DPLs, it is noted that the LPI and dwell time figures
could be considered as impact indicators, while the INSW agency status and SSO participating
agencies could be considered as more direct results of the DPL. Any changes to INSW status and
participation in the SSO would take time for them to have an impact, if any, on the decrease of
dwell time and increase in LPI score. Having said that, dwell time and LPI indicators seemed to
point to improved logistics improvement despite increased cargo traffic and a higher number of
import permits issued by line ministries since 2011; more import permits that need to go through
pre-clearance process would also increase pre-clearance time and, subsequently, longer dwell
time.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings: Moderately satisfactory

The DPL supported the Government to achieve progress on important connectivity reforms.
The DPL series objective is highly relevant to the Bank’s engagement program and to both the
outgoing and incoming Governments’ priorities. The policy actions were relevant to achieve the
objective of assisting the Government of Indonesia to strengthen the policy framework for
improved national trade logistics, transportation, ICT, and trade facilitation. The overall DPL
series has delivered highly relevant progress in three of the four targeted policy areas. The
outcomes associated with the first sub-objective of the loan series resulted in improved
coordination across different line ministries. The second and fourth sub-objectives resulted in
improved regulatory frameworks for intra-island and international connectivity. Even the third
sub-objective, despite the set-back on ICT reform, managed to improve the policy framework
associated with maritime connectivity. In summary, the DPL series has satisfactorily supported
overall connectivity reforms. At the end of this two-loan series, while there are outstanding
reform agenda, the regulatory and institutional foundations for improved connectivity in
Indonesia are significantly stronger in three of the four policy areas. Taking these considerations
into account, the rating for the overall program outcome is Moderately satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The programmatic DPL series does not have explicit targets or indicators related to poverty
reduction; yet, improved connectivity can reduce poverty. Improving connectivity increases
access to services and resources by reducing trade and transport costs, stimulates growth and
employment, and links less developed regions with more developed regions, thus reducing
poverty. To the extent that remote regions in Indonesia have higher incidence of poverty, lack of
connectivity limits the opportunities of lagging regions to link themselves with their nearest
growth centers. Households in remote regions are also relatively more exposed to higher risk of
food insecurity as food prices tend to fluctuate more in their regions.

While the Connectivity DPLs were considered to be gender neutral, improved connectivity
can enhance women’s lives by providing more access to important public services, such as
education, health, job opportunities and markets. A recent study using census data 1995 and
2005 (SUPAS) shows that better connectivity has increased women’s mobility to Jakarta from the
Bodetabek suburban areas (Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi). Better connectivity provided


                                                  18
better access for women to commute for educational reasons and increased the number of women
commuting for work. A survey on rural women groups in Indonesia shows that women have been
able to earn additional incomes through their increased access to internet through which they
acquired skills in manufacturing superior products or providing services.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The connectivity DPLs were instrumental in convening a forum for policy dialogue between
different ministries and development partners. Some of the reform areas supported by the
DPLs involved several line ministries and agencies, as in the case of the adoption of the legal
framework on land acquisition that involved among others the Land Agency, Ministry of Home
Affairs, Ministry of Finance, among others. The DPLs contributed to strengthen the forum of
policy dialogue and coordination.

Yet, DPLs cannot always rush institutional change, despite strong policy relevance. Despite
the achievement of the policy actions, the reform areas covered in these DPLs would need to
clear additional layers of bureaucratic and legal institutions. This was the case with the delay in
VGF approval, the railway sector, and the INSW organizational set up. This multiple-layer
institutional set-up is not unique to Indonesia, but will reduce effective implementation of reforms.
The Bank team, given this constraint, has, however, managed to balance ambition and realism.

Despite the mixed outcomes and impact of the Connectivity DPL Series, it laid the
foundation for further work on connectivity reforms. The DPL focused on institutional and
regulatory development that would help further reforms in the future. It is noted that subsequent
to the DPL, a Reimbursable Advisory Service with the Indonesian Port Corporation (Pelindo) has
materialized. This direct collaboration with an SOE could also strengthen connectivity reforms in
the future.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Overall ratings: Substantial

Despite the incoming President’s plans to focus on maritime connectivity, political risk has
risen due to the minority representation of the incoming Government. This will particularly
impact policy and regulatory implementation. The new Government will need to have a better
implementation structure to implement current regulations and those in the pipeline – such as
operationalizing the PPP-related organizations, railway charges, and port developments. In terms
of strategic policy, there could be changes to the use of the MP3EI, should the incoming
Government choose not to continue with it. This risk will somewhat be mitigated by the inclusion
of the connectivity agenda in the Medium-Term National Development Plan. It is also expected
that the new Government would need time to get a grip on its policy plans and the necessary
implementation mechanisms.

Implementation risk will remain an important factor, as the link between policy and
regulatory changes and actual implementation is not automatic. The DPL program
documents rightly pointed that bureaucratic complexity could hinder coordination and

                                                 19
implementation of reform agenda. The experience of the DPL showed that this risk could have
multiple layers. While senior officials were able to provide guidance and support to the DPLs,
technical level officials would be reluctant to take the lead in areas in which they do not have
clear authority. At the regional level, the risk of overlapping responsibilities between local and
national governments could also diminish the effectiveness of connectivity reforms.

Macroeconomic risks, also identified in the program documents, could also affect
infrastructure-related connectivity reforms. Recently the economy has faced increased and
sustained pressures to its external balances, with current account deficit growing from -2.8% of
GDP in 2012 to -3.3% in 2013, and expected to moderate at -3% for 2014. A number of external
factors – lower global commodity prices, slower recovery in Europe and Japan, end of the US
quantitative easing –, and internal factors – the partial raw mineral export ban, lack of fiscal space
for 2015 –, contribute to macroeconomic uncertainties in the medium term. These challenges are
super-imposed on structural growth bottlenecks that the Connectivity DPLs sought to untangle.
There is a risk that the macroeconomic and fiscal environment would not be conducive for
increased investment in long-term infrastructure projects, which are important for improving
connectivity.

Policy Area 1: Strengthening National Coordination and Regulation (Moderate)

It is likely that political and institutional risks will affect this pillar, albeit with a low impact
on its development outcome. It is noted that the president-elect will prioritize on-the-ground
results and will demand his ministers to deliver quickly. The way the incoming Government
structures its responses to connectivity issues will also affect delivery of results. At this point,
indications of new ministries related to connectivity issues – including an agrarian ministry and a
maritime ministry – could elevate the issue and expedite reforms. On the other hand, the plan to
abolish most vice-ministerial positions will put heavy policy and implementation burdens on the
ministers and could slow down reforms. The implementation of the VGF might also face
challenges in the context of limited fiscal space, as well as within a political environment that
may not favor the perception of public support for the private sector. While institutional risks
could hamper the implementation of this pillar, the policy focus of the new Government on
connectivity makes it unlikely that there would be major reversals.

Policy Area 2: Strengthening Intra-island Connectivity (Substantial)

This pillar faces a high likelihood of bureaucratic and regulatory complexities and medium
likelihood of governance risk; should the latter take place, it will have a high impact on the
pillar’s development outcome. For example, despite the relative clarity of the new Land Law
and its implementation regulations, it still takes a maximum of 500 days to finalize land
acquisitions. Land acquisitions will also face different capacity issues with local governments.
Railway reforms are already facing another layer of regulatory hurdle, in the form of a revision to
a Presidential Regulation necessary for IMO and TAC changes to take place. In addition, as was
the case with the ICT Fund, governance risk to public procurements – which affect land
acquisition and road performance-based contracts – is also significant and could delay
implementation of reforms.

Policy Area 3: Improving Inter-island Connectivity (Substantial)

This pillar faces a moderate likelihood and high impact possibility of governance,
implementation, and economic risks. As mentioned above, the ICT Fund tendering process has
been delayed due to an unrelated corruption charges at the Ministry of Communication and

                                                 20
Information. While, the National Port Master Plan has been issued and implemented, it remains
susceptible to the availability of public and private financing.

Policy Area 4: Improving International Connectivity (trade facilitation) (Moderate)

This pillar faces a low likelihood and a substantial impact possibility of implementation
risk. The INSW enjoys strong buy-in from the participating ministries and from the private
sector. Indonesia’s regional commitment on this, as part of the ASEAN Single Window, also put
this reform on a strong foundation. While further progress on INSW and the SSO mechanism
would depend on each ministry’s timeline, they are unlikely to be reversed. Yet, trade facilitation
not only involves establishing the INSW but also streamlining trade related regulations to
facilitate more efficient trade. In the past, the Ministry of Trade issued measures that have had an
impact on the overall border management (pre-departure inspection, more restrictive import
licensing regime for several products). However, this trend was reversed in 2014 and the new
Government is likely to reduce trade-related licenses further. 37

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Ratings: Moderately satisfactory

The DPL series was underpinned by strong analytical work, ongoing technical assistance,
and continuous policy dialogue led by staff based on the field. It drew on recent analytical
works published by the Bank since 2009. These include: WDR 2009 on Reshaping Economic
Geography; Connecting Indonesia: A Framework for Action (2010); Indonesia’s Logistics
Performance Index 2012, Infrastructure Public Expenditure Reviews on the rail (2011) and roads
(2012) sectors, and State of Logistics Indonesia, 2013.

The policy loans were delivered in a timely manner at the request of the Government for
financing. Senior Bank staff responded quickly to the Government’s initial requests for
development loan, followed by engagement at the technical level across the Bank office and with
the relevant implementing ministries/agencies. The workload was well-coordinated within the
Bank’s multi-sectoral team.

However, although the design of the DPL Series followed the relevant analytical framework,
the results lacked coherence and linkage to overall impact. This was partly due to the
complexity of connectivity issues themselves, but also to contextual constraints in the form of the
political transition happening at the end of the DPL Series. Many of these challenges were
identified during the review of the Program Document and the team took the available measures
to minimize these risks, for example by also using other Bank instruments to leverage buy-in
from the Government.

(b) Quality of Supervision

                                                  21
Ratings: Moderately satisfactory

Given the structure of the DPL, all policy actions were fulfilled prior to loan disbursal.
Hence, the supervision of the DPL mainly took place during policy dialogues for the DPL
preparation. The preparation for the second DPLs also entailed continuous dialogues with the
Government and as follow-up on policy actions. With team members in the field, monitoring of
progress towards outcome indicators was done on a relatively continuous basis. The process was
coordinated by Bappenas.

The Bank could have explained better the mechanics of the DPL to senior and mid-level
officials of implementing agencies and ministries involved in the DPL, through a seminar
for instance, and could have presented experiences from other countries and sectors. As the
DPL covered a wide range of reforms where many line ministries and agencies were involved, a
government official reported that not all technical officials from other ministries other than the
main counterparts understood the DPL mechanism.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Ratings: Moderately satisfactory

The Bank’s performance contributed to the sense of government ownership and
commitment to the implementation of the reform program. The DPL series was delivered
timely. Effective dialogues, with the participation of ADB, were maintained with the Government
throughout the series, which strengthened ownership of the program. Although it was a joint
operation with ADB, the Bank maintained a separate set of prior actions that were more focused.
Key counterparts at Bappenas and the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs facilitated
communication with other parties involved (Ministry of Finance, Land Agency, Ministry of
Home Affairs, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Communication and Information, and
Ministry of Transportation). Lead Government counterpart facilitated follow-up meetings with
other units and agencies on the status of policy actions. Bank’s staff involved has strong technical
capacity to both deliver the results and manage the engagement with the Government and co-
financiers.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Ratings: Moderately satisfactory

Bappenas was responsible for the coordination of the Connectivity DPL series. This was a
natural extension of the role of the Vice Minister of Bappenas as Chair of the Connectivity pillar
of MP3EI. The Vice Minister played an active role, convening senior officials when necessary,
and delegating the more technical coordination to the Director General for Infrastructure and
Director for PPP Development. This ensured high-level buy-in and facilitated communications
across the line ministries. Bappenas also played as an active conduit between the Ministry of
Finance and the Bank, especially in identifying the opportunity for a DPL to fill a part of the
fiscal need. However, given that Bappenas lacks the authority to oversee other line ministries 38, it
was perceived that it could have played a stronger leadership role.


38
  It is noted that in the new Government, Bappenas’ role is elevated to be part of an expanded Office of the
President, directly answering to the President. It is not yet clear, however, whether this will also mean a
power to convene line ministries.

                                                    22
Another important Government counterpart was the Coordinating Ministry for Economic
Affairs. The CMEA has played an active role in past DPLs and is familiar with the use of the
DPLs. It also has the mandate to convene other economic ministries. It is responsible for key
aspects of the connectivity agenda, including logistics, infrastructure, and regional development.
Future DPLs with cross-cutting policy issues could explore the use of two strong counterparts
such as the CMEA and Bappenas, or the CMEA/Bappenas and another line ministry. This would
strengthen coordination and oversight across different levels of officials.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Moderately unsatisfactory

As with other DPLs, the experience with implementing agencies/ministries was varied, very
much dependent on their understanding and perception of the uses of the DPLs. The set of
policy actions was completed on time. The DPLs were more acceptable to ministries with which
the Bank has a program, but many still perceived the policy actions as an added burden without a
commensurate increase in their budgetary resources. This was even the case with the Ministry of
Finance, who came to Bappenas initially to sound out the possibility of an alternate source of
financing. Not all implementing agencies were able or will be able to meet deadlines of policy
targets. As a planning agency, Bappenas had no effective authority over the implementing
ministries/agencies and was unable to force line ministries to meet the deadlines of the policy
targets. Moreover, as mentioned before, there was a lack of understanding of the mechanism of
the DPL at the technical level of some of the implementing ministries. The Bank would need to
improve its socialization of the use of DPLs as a drive for regulatory reforms that the ministries
themselves are trying to complete. It could also explore, with the Ministry of Finance, the
possibility of a fungible increase of resources for the line ministries, as a portion of the DPL
amount.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Moderately satisfactory

The Government’s ownership of the program and its commitment to the overarching
agenda of connectivity form the basis for this rating. Yet, the gap between senior level buy-in
and the lack of understanding of the DPL at the technical level, as well as between the key
counterpart ministries (Bappenas and CMEA) and the line ministries could have been closed
further. This is not a reflection of the performance or the level of effort of Bappenas, but this
shows the need for improved Bank engagement in terms of socializing the value-added of DPLs,
as well as its relatively low cost of financing.

6. Lessons Learned

The Bank needs to strike a balance between DPLs supporting reform in narrow areas with
narrower outcomes but less risk, versus a widely cross-cutting DPLs supporting reform in
broader areas that is riskier but often could have more development impact. One logical
path is to go with the option that maximizes the positive outcome with the minimum risk, which
is rarely available. If the aim is about transformative changes, then risk-taking should be more
encouraged. This operation is about complex regulatory and institutional issues related to a
complex area of reform: connectivity in Indonesia. Perhaps a narrower DPL focusing on fewer
aspects could have led to higher ratings, but what was expected to be achieved would have been
less transformative.

                                                23
A cross-cutting DPL does not automatically translate into improved coordination within the
implementing ministries. The gap of understanding between the senior Government officials
familiar with the DPL mechanism and the technical staff at line ministries in this particular case
contributed to this. A suggested approach would be for the Government to focus on policy actions
themselves and structure the coordination meetings around their relation to the strategic-level
Government connectivity agenda.

Complementing Bank instruments, such as TAs, could be used for an effective
implementation of widely cross-cutting DPL. The cross-cutting nature and the lack of focus of
the Connectivity DPL made it difficult to use complementing existing Bank instruments to
improve its effectiveness. The available TAs and loans on trade competitiveness, ICT reforms,
road development, and PPP institutions, were modular enough to support the respective DPL
pillars; but in the end they may have lacked concentrated fire power. ADB’s experience, of using
one dedicated TA to complement its Connectivity DPL series, could be considered.

Having more than one strong counterpart is a suitable arrangement for cross-cutting DPLs
involving several ministries and agencies. It is key that the counterpart champions policy
reforms, as in the case of Bappenas that had a high-level representative, whereas some of the
other agencies were represented by echelons 3 or below. Yet, if its capacity to convene,
coordinate and oversee a big number of ministries and agencies is deemed weak, the use of a
second strong counterpart, such as CMEA, could strengthen the coordination and oversight across
different levels of officials and entities.

Electoral cycles may have an impact on the momentum of reforms and it is important to
consider the potential bureaucratic obstacles to reforms that appear especially during the
pre-election period. The implementation of the second phase of the DPL coincided with pre-
election period; both the team and management were aware of the political and implementation
risks associated with the election and the transition of governments and took them into
consideration. Nevertheless, the team could have been more realistic about the potential
bureaucratic obstacles during implementation, especially those relating to additional layers of
bureaucratic, administrative, and legal issues.

In a middle-income country without problems to access financial markets, a DPL should be
seen as one instrument, among others, to improve the chances of long-term, structural,
reforms. The changes a DPL try to encourage in middle-income countries like Indonesia do not
relate to the availability of funding; but, rather to assist in the institutional development –
coordination, regulatory reforms, and governance – of complex issues such as connectivity. The
policy focus of a DPL should be highlighted and used as vehicles for structural reforms by the
Government. At the same time, despite the challenges faced by a DPL series, it could position the
Bank to deliver a medium-term agenda that is relevant to the Government. The new incoming
Government, for example, made connectivity, especially maritime connectivity, a major part of
its economic agenda and the establishment of a Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs
reflects this priority. The experience of working with Bappenas could also improve the reform
agenda in the future as the President has chosen to elevate the role of Bappenas in the Cabinet to
be part of an expanded Office of the President.

In light of the experience of the first two Connectivity DPLs, a number of factors would
need to be considered (see Section 6 for further elaboration). First, programmatic focus would
need to be revisited – whether or not to package the loan into more focused DPLs with a larger
set of policy actions. A more concentrated program would enable the Bank and the Government

                                                24
to deliver policy reforms in more depth and improve the chances of success in a few number of
policy areas – i.e. separate logistics, transportation, infrastructure, and ICT programs. However,
as mentioned above, this is a question of balance. A more concentrated focus would have a higher
likelihood of success, but at the price of a less transformative and less ambitious program. The
sequencing of reforms would also need to be taken into consideration for programmatic design. A
more immediate need for institutional development – rules, regulations, ministerial coordination –
may necessitate a higher level of ambition with higher risks and a lower likelihood of success, but
would contribute to building the foundations for longer term successes in key connectivity sectors.
Second, a more strategic use of complementary Bank instruments, such as a parallel technical
assistance, could improve coordination and implementation of policy actions. Finally, lack of
technical-level understanding on the part of the implementing ministries/agencies suggests that
the Bank team would need to improve its socialization of the uses of the DPL itself to improve
the understanding of line ministries.

Annex 3. Borrower’s Comments on Draft ICR

On October 2, 2014, the ICR team met with the Vice Minister of National Development Planning,
the Director for PPP Development, Ministry of National Development Planning, and the Expert
Staff to the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs on Regional Development, to discuss key
outlines of the ICR and to seek comments. The officials suggested the following key points to be
highlighted in the ICR.

   1. Government commitment to the connectivity agenda remains strong. This is reflected in
      the establishment of the Committee for the Acceleration of the Provision of Priority
      Infrastructure (KKPPIP-Komite Percepatan Penyediaan Infrastruktur Prioritas). The
      revamped KKPPIP will ensure clear policy direction and implementation as it will be
      responsible to channel public infrastructure projects according to the relevant funding
      mechanisms – through SOEs, PPPs, or state budget. It is also noted that connectivity is
      also a priority for the incoming Government.

    2. The DPL may benefit from an impact evaluation, for example, one year after its
       completion. This would be useful to measure the implementation effectiveness of
       regulatory changes and policy actions, some of which would not be effective several
       months after the completion of the DPL.

    3. Should a follow-up DPL be considered, it could comprise the following items:
          • Inter-island connectivity, especially sea transport. This could include investment
              regulations, business environment and sea freight.
          • PPP and financial schemes for infrastructure. This could include regulatory
              reforms on PPP schemes and the consolidation of the Government’s PPP
              financing firm (PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur) and the Ministry of Finance’s
              Government Investment Center (Pusat Investasi Pemerintah – PIP).
          • Customs-related reforms, especially the development of Special Economic Zones
              (SEZs). The development of eight SEZs in Indonesia would require improved
              connectivity.




                                              29
Annex 4. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The ICR team met Edimon Ginting, Deputy Country Director/Senior Country Economist, ADB
Indonesia Resident Mission, Jakarta, on 30 September 2014.

Mr. Ginting agreed that Government ownership was strong and connectivity remains a strong
policy issue. This is reflected in the way that Government’s policy actions are stronger in the
ADB Connectivity DPL than ADB’s other DPLs.

Mr. Ginting also believed that coordination among the line ministries was also strong. Bappenas
was effective in coordinating the line ministries at different levels. Policy coordination was led by
a Director General, while technical meetings on policy actions were led by a Director. The
Bappenas Director General for Infrastructure was singled out as very effective in unlocking
bottlenecks and providing advice and direction. The relevant Government officials also
understand that the loan was for budget support and would deliver the policy actions that are most
important to them. Mr. Ginting underlined the need to see the DPL policy actions as the
Government’s own reform program.

In terms of future possible work on connectivity, Mr. Ginting saw that the new Government will
maintain a focus on connectivity, logistics, and infrastructure. There are risks in terms of big
regulatory changes that require parliamentary support, which is lacking for the incoming
Government. But, the Government could still undertake technical reforms and implement existing
regulations. Future DPLs could support some of these implementation reforms.
