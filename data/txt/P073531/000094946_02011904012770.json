infrastructure, support economic infrastructure and income\n            generation, develop institutional capacity, and, provide\n            support to the institutional, and operational aspects,\n            through relevant studies. The potential for environmental\n            adversity lies basically during construction, and operation\n            of roads, schools, health care centers, and water supply,\n            and sanitation systems. This environmental management plan\n            stipulates that subprojects, with potentially irreversible\n            negative impacts, will not be approved for funding, namely,\n            those requiring terracing for a high percentage of slope\n            lands; those requiring deforestation, or affecting natural\n            habitats and biodiversity; those affecting cultural heritage\n            sites; and, those requiring the use of pesticides and\n            herbicides. Mitigation calls for measures as follows.\n            Ditches and outlets will be maintained to control clogging\n            of naturally damaged channels, while drainage facilities\n            will be functional to appropriately conduct storm water\n            drainage. Site locations should be selected for disposal of\n            excavated soil, and, re-vegetation practices along road\n            sides, etc., would combat erosion. Water contamination, and\n            degradation of water quality, will undergo regular quality\n            tests, surveyed according to local water regulations, and\n            management practices. Priority will be given to\n            rehabilitating toilets, and sanitary installations to\n            control improper wastes disposal, including medical wastes,\n            and to prevent water borne diseases. Aforestation through\n            new techniques, and the use of renewable energy sources,\n            will be introduced to control grazing, and deforestation."}, "docdt": "2001-11-30T09:37:03Z"}
