Social\n            Development Agency Project for Morocco were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: ADS\n            (Agence de Developpement Social - Social Development Agency)\n            has repositioned its role in participatory diagnostic and\n            planning, capacity building of local actors, and income\n            generating activities. A clearer Government support for this\n            'niche' could help equip the agency with the\n            resources that will be needed to maximize its impact on\n            poverty. The social agenda is large and complex. Several\n            entities and/or programs can be the implementing vehicles\n            but their roles and responsibilities need to be\n            well-delineated, promoting coherence/complementary of\n            interventions and avoiding overlap. The lack of attention to\n            the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system during\n            preparation and the early stage of supervision prevent a\n            full assessment of the cost effectiveness of ADS'\n            approaches to community participation or capacity building\n            of local actors. A strengthened M&E system is also\n            necessary to produce the analysis that can justify ADS'\n            institutionalization in the territorial development/poverty\n            alleviation agenda by substantiating its areas of strengths.\n            To do so, it will be important that ADS quickly revise its\n            M&E framework and adapt it to its new areas of focus.\n            Finally, Bank technical support to the impact evaluation\n            should have been better planned to influence the quality of\n            the evaluation. Social fund projects should be supervised by\n            social fund specialists. This helps projects benefit from\n            all the knowledge on social funds accumulated by the Bank in\n            the last 20 years and from the tools that have been\n            developed. It ensures that critical dimensions of social\n            funds are not missed during supervision. The project\n            benefited from an excellent exposure to international\n            experience during preparation when the project was managed\n            by a social fund specialist, but less so during supervision."}, "docdt": "2009-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
