KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
A.     Background
1.    Introduction: The proposed ADS Project aims at introducing new approaches and
mechanisms for meeting poor communities and vulnerable groups. The specific objectives of the
project are:
-      To test new approaches for delivering social services in a more relevant and cost
effective manner by supporting the establishment of a participative demand-
driven mechanism that will reach out to poor communities; and
-      Better organize local communities to take advantage of setting development
priorities and implementing development activities by strengthening the capacity
of local NGOs.
2.     Investment components: The project will consist of the following four main
components:.
(i)    Community Development and Social Infrastructure: subprojects will cover
areas from basic education and primary health care to literacy activities as well
as rural drinking water and wastewater.
(ii)   Support to Economic Infrastructure and Income Generation: three kinds of
subprojects will be supported and include:
-  Subproject that enhance the economic infrastructure in rural and slum areas
such as irrigation, small markets and rural roads.
-  Subprojects that finance training and non-financial support activities that are
directly related to creating employment opportunities
-  Subprojects that support the expansion of the existing micro finance
operations to new geographical areas.
(iii)  Institutional Development for Intermediaries: this component supports and
increase the effectiveness of the first two components by supporting the capacity
of ADS' intermediaries to identify, appraise and implement sub-projects.
(iv)   Studies and ADS Capacity Building: this component will provide support to
different institutional and operational aspects of the ADS to learn from
experience with similar operations in other countries.
3.     Institutional Arrangement: The implementation of the Project falls under the
responsibility of the Agence de Developpement Social who would be in charge of coordinating
the various activities with concerned sectoral ministries, local governments, communities, and
NGOs. The Agency will operate at both the national and local level. ADS' intermediaries, who

﻿would include NGOs, associations and local government, will be responsible for the
implementations of the subprojects.
4.     Project Environmental Category: The proposed project would support environmental
improvements through rehabilitation and improvements in roads, schools, primary health care
centers, small water supply and sanitation systems in small poor communities and villages.
Potential adverse environmental impacts during both construction and operation are restricted in
magnitude and severity.
Environmental guidelines to be used during the various project stages will be prepared and will
enable the identification of all environmental concerns prior to project implementation through
the development of an EMP that would include mitigation activities and monitoring procedures.
In addition, an environmental assessment report will be prepared for the construction of low cost
sanitation and new rural road subprojects. Furthermore the project will not fund any sub-project
that would require resettlement, land terracing on slopes greater than 40%, deforestation, or
would adversely affect natural habitats, biodiversity, and cultural heritage sites. Accordingly, the
proposed project has been placed in "Category B" in accordance with World Bank Operational
Policy (OP 4.01) on Environmental Assessment (January 1999).
5.     Legal and Regulatory Framework for Environmental Assessment
Since January 2000, the Department of Environment, part of the Ministry of land use planning,
environment, urbanism and habitat, is the governmental institution responsible for the
development of a national policy for environmental management. The DOE is undergoing several
review procedures to up-date the country's environmental policies and regulations including the
preparation of a law for the protection of environment, an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) decree, as well as norms and standards for environmental protection. Although the ETA
decree has not been passed by the Government, EIA studies are being undertaken for some
projects especially those that are being funded by International Organizations and Lending
Agencies. A national committee grouping representative of several ministries have been formed
for the environmental assessment evaluation of projects. It is estimated that so far around 60 EA
studies have been reviewed by the DOE in collaboration with the national EA committee.
In addition to the environmental laws that have been prepared by the Department of Environment,
a number of regulations exist in Morocco regarding environmental protection. For instance the
water law No. 10-95 of August 1995 includes several articles related to the protection and
preservation of surface and ground water resources, the disposal of wastewater, as well as water
re-use for agriculture purposes. The Government has also ratified a number of international
conventions for Environmental Protection.
6.     Environmental review of subprojects funded by ADS
A rapid environmental review was conducted on subprojects already submitted to the Agence de
developpement social for approval and funding from the budget of the Agency. The cost of the
nine subprojects that were recently approved for funding vary between 3500 USD and
73000USD. Out of these nine subprojects, there are six water and irrigation subprojects, one for
EMP-final (November 2001)                                              Page 2 of 8


﻿a 60-m length wadi overpass and two construction subprojects for a day care and a youth center.
None of the subprojects would have major irreversible environmental impacts, on the contrary all
subprojects would contribute to positive environmental impacts. However, in the future the
cumulative impacts from subprojects located in the same area might be significant if
environmental considerations within each subproject are not properly addressed.
As subprojects are identified on a demand-driven basis, their evaluation will take into
consideration technical, socio-economic, institutional, gender and environmental aspects.
The following illegibility criteria related to environmental requirements will be observed during
the project cycle:
(i) Subprojects that can have considerable irreversible negative impacts will not be approved for
funding and would include:
-  Land terracing on slopes greater than 40%
-  Subprojects requiring deforestation
-  Subprojects adversely affecting natural habitats and biodiversity
-  Subprojects that would affect cultural heritage sites.
-  Subprojects that include the purchase and use of pesticides and herbicides.
(ii) Depending on the magnitude and the extent of the environmental impacts, the following
subprojects would require an environmental assessment report to be prepared according to the
terms of reference provided in the environmental guidelines manual:
-  New rural roads;
-  Subprojects adjacent to critical natural habitats or protected areas.
Post- review of EA will be subsequently undertaken as part of the regular Bank supervision
missions.
(iii) Subprojects with minor environmental impacts would require the implementation of an
environmental management plan (EMP) according to the typical examples that will be provided
in the environmental guidelines manual include:
-  Rehabilitation and upgrading of public schools
-  Rehabilitation and upgrading of health centers
-  Community potable water supplies
-  Wells and spring protection
-  Low-cost sanitation subprojects
-  Rehabilitation of rural roads
-  Small scale irrigation and drainage schemes
Subprojects requiring the preparation of EMP will be reviewed and approved by ADS as part of
its prerogatives. The first three subprojects will be reviewed by the Bank after which only
subprojects costing above 200 000 USD will require prior approval of the Bank.
Periodical monitoring of subprojects will be conducted by ADS to ensure compliance with
submitted monitoring plan.  Moreover, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects will be

﻿conducted by a local or international consultant during the midterm review and at the end of the
project.
7.     Assessment of Environmental Capacities
L'Agence de Developpement Social was recently created and is still in the process of recruiting
its staff members. So far, the Agency has managed to recruit a number of qualified professional
staff members. At present there are around eight persons working on the evaluation of
subprojects that are being submitted for funding. There is good environmental awareness among
the staff of the Agency, however there is limited capacity with respect to environmental
requirements such as environmental assessment, mitigation measures and monitoring. Moreover,
the Agency is not planning to have a full time environmental specialist within its core team.
Consequently it will be necessary to provide the Agency with technical assistance for
environment including training workshops and provision of short-term environmental specialists.
Environmental awareness is also present among most intermediaries that will be executing the
subprojects. However, most associations do not have environmental specialists within their
members and it would be recommended to provide them with technical assistance with respect to
environmental matters.
The Department of Environment (DOE) has a special division for environmental assessment
studies. Under the Mediterranean Environmental Technical Assistance Program (METAP), the
World Bank provided several capacity building activities including training workshops for the
division of environmental impact and other line ministries. METAP also assisted in the
preparation of environmental assessment guidelines. However, at present the division of
environmental assessment has only one staff member for preparing terms of reference, reviewing
environmental assessment studies and assisting at the meetings of National committee.
Con-sequently the DOE will not be able to provide major technical assistance to ADS.
B.     Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
8.     Objectives and Structure of the EMP
The objectives of the EMP are to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts identified in each
subproject. The implementation of the EMP will improve the quality of subprojects and will
ensure the participation of concerned stakeholders. The EMP will consist of three kinds of
activities:
-  Implementation of mitigation measures;
-  Strengthening the capacities of ADS, NGO, associations and local government;
-  Monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measures identified during subproject formulation or
within the environmental assessment report.

﻿9.      Implementation of Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures identified following the desk/or field review shall be properly implemented.
Typical environmental impacts and possible mitigation measures are given in Table I for
guidance. Intermediaries will be required to adapt the generic mitigation measures for the various
subprojects to be executed.

10.     Training Program and Capacity Building
Environmental expertise within implementing bodies will be strengthen. Training programs will
designed and implemented with the assistance of local or international experts and will target two
levels:
(i)     ADS staff and Intermediaries: Training workshop will be provided to the staff of ADS,
selected intermediaries and line ministries to raise environmental awareness and to clarify
the specific environmental requirements related to design and implementation of the
ADS. The training workshop will include case studies and will cover the following
topics:
-   EIA techniques
-   Screening projects for environmental review
-   Use of practical checklists
-   Best environmental practices in design and implementation of projects
-   Effective implementation of mitigation measures
-   Project supervision
-   Monitoring and evaluation
(ii)    Local NGOs and Communities: Workshops for local NGOs and communities, focusing
on public awareness, case studies of environmental issues experienced in similar projects,
use of environmental guidelines and implementation of mitigation measures.

﻿11.     Environmental Monitoring
Environmental Monitoring will be the responsibility of the intermediaries in close coordination
with the relevant authorities and will include:
-   Compliance monitoring during construction
-   Monitoring of significant impacts during the operation of the subproject.
ADS regional representatives will also conduct periodic monitoring by visiting the sites of the
various subprojects at least twice a year.
Monitoring indicators shall be developed for both the construction and the operation phase of the
subprojects. Monitoring of construction activities will have to ensure that mitigation measures of
construction impacts are being implemented properly, while the monitoring of operation is to
ensure that no unforeseen negative impacts are arising.     Typical examples of monitoring plans
are given in Table 2.
