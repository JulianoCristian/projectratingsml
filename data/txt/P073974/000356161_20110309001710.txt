1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.     The Health Modernization Project was approved on June 10, 2004. The Credit
Agreement was signed on July 30, 2004 and the Credit became effective on December 14,
2004. The Project was the second health supported project by the International Development
Association (IDA) 2 . The Project was the first phase of a two phase Adaptable Program
Lending (APL) to support the Government health sector reform programs3. The Project was
cofinanced by a Trust Fund from the Japan Policy and Human Resources Development Fund
(PHRD), which was also signed on July 30, 2004.

1.1     Context at Appraisal

2.     During the period 1998 and 2003, Armenia began to overcome the hurdles created
by disruptions of the post-Soviet transition era with an average economic growth rate of
nine percent annually. Improvements on the economy were a result of the Government's
reform program of trade liberalization, improved business environment, and export and
investment promotion. Sustained output growth and low inflation led to a decrease in
poverty, with the headcount index of poverty falling from 55 percent in 1998/99 to 47
percent in 2001.

3.      Notwithstanding these improvements, public spending on health care was only 1.3
percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2001, compared to 3 percent average of
other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and 6 to 10 percent average in
most developed countries. Health outcomes were commensurate with the socio-economic
situation. Armenia's average health outcomes were consistent with those countries at similar
socio-economic development levels and compared favorably with those of other newly
independent states (NIS). However, mortality rates of the main public health challenges,
such as hypertension and ischemic heart disease had increased over the previous decade,
even as morbidity rates of these diseases had decreased. This was partially attributed to
diminished access to health services and essential drugs.

4.     Progress had been made towards achieving the millennium development goals
(MDGs), with infant mortality (IMR) dropping from 18 per 1,000 births in 1990 to 16 per
1,000 births in 2000; and with maternal mortality (MMR) falling from 40 per 100,000 in
1990 to 22 per 100,000 in 2001. Surveys undertaken prior to appraisal suggested that IMR
and under five mortality were about 1.5 times higher in rural than in urban areas. The key



2
 The first health supported operation was the Health Financing and Primary Health Care Development Project
US$10 million equivalent, approved on July 29, 1997.

3
  The APL2 for US$22 million equivalent was approved on March 8, 2007. An additional financing loan and a
restructuring of the result framework of the ongoing APL2 are currently being processed for Board presentation
on December 20, 2010.


                                                    1
challenge in terms of health outcomes was to sustain the levels by assuring adequate access
to essential health services and implementing adequate public health programs.

5.       The poor lacked adequate access to essential health services. The drastic drop in
public spending on heath since the onset of the transition was mirrored by a marked drop in
health care utilization rates. Formal and informal out of pocket (OOP) expenditures made up
for the drop in public spending. The Poverty Assessment of 2001 found that health care
utilization varied significantly across income groups and that utilization was higher among
urban than among rural households. Overall, the 2001 household survey suggested that an
important share of those in low-income groups forwent health care because they could not
afford it.

6.     The oversized hospital infrastructure was unsustainable and the quality of services
was deteriorating. Like many countries in the Europe and Central Asia region (ECA),
Armenia inherited an oversized and overstaffed health care system oriented towards hospital
based care. Ratios of hospital beds and physicians per population remained significantly
higher than in industrialized countries, while hospital utilization and efficiency remained
extremely low. Armenia had 142 hospitals, including 44 in the capital Yerevan where the
population was 1.2 million. Average occupancy rates were between 30 and 40 percent, with
an average length of stay (ALOS) of 11.7 days4. The over-extended but low performing
hospital sector continued to be a wasteful drain on scarce public resources and the quality of
care was increasingly hampered by low service volumes and deteriorating infrastructure.

7.     The quality of Primary Health Care (PHC) was poor and PHC was underutilized.
A network of rural ambulatories and urban policlinics had historically provided PHC.
Because of chronic under-funding, low professional status and poor quality of PHC, the
population tended to self-refer to hospital specialists and to emergency care. Strengthening
PHC was an effective and affordable alternative for hospital based care that had been one of
the Government's main reform priorities in the sector since the mid-1990s.

8.     The organizational structure of the health sector had changed substantially over
the past ten years. The role of the Ministry of Health (MOH) had been redefined as a policy
making and supervisory body. Operation and ownership of health care institutions had been
devolved to local governments for PHC and provincial governments for hospitals, with the
exception of public health service and selected tertiary care hospitals.

9.      Armenia was and has continued to be a low HIV/AIDS prevalence country.
Although the country had a an adequate surveillance and monitoring capacity for infectious
diseases, the capacity to minor behavioral risk factors of HIV/AIDS and other public health
threats, such as non communicable diseases and injuries, was considerably weak.




4
    ALOS in 2009 in hospitals supported by the Project was 7.4 while the average bed occupancy rate was 76%.


                                                     2
1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

10.     The objective of the Project was to support the implementation of the Government
health reform program through expanding access to quality primary health care; improving
quality and efficiency of selected hospital networks; and laying the groundwork for effective
health sector policy making and monitoring.

11.   The wording of the PDO was the same in the main text of the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) and Annex 3 of the PAD. Although it was slightly different in the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the difference in wording did not alter the substance.

12.     The achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following five performance
indicators as identified in the main text of the PAD and the Minutes of Negotiations:

         Increased coverage of population by qualified family medicine practices;
         Key health sector quality and efficiency indicators improve in the areas of project
         intervention;
         Government is able to demonstrate the impact of health policies on health status and
         access to services from key health policy monitoring documents ­ Health System
         Performance Reports (HSPR) and National Health Account (NHA) Report;
         Public hospitals use updated financial accounting procedures, are supervised by
         effective Supervisory Committees, have independently audited accounts and publish
         annual performance reports; and
         Monitoring and Evaluation system for HIV/AIDS prevention strategy are in place.

13.      The trigger indicators from APL 1 to APL 2 were the following:

         Meeting the yearly targets for health sector public expenditures as set out in the
         Poverty Reduction Support Credit - PRSP (these were to be upgraded in accordance
         to changes of these indicators in the PRSP;
         Meeting at least 75 percent of the targets of a time-bound action plan to improve
         financial management and accountability of public hospitals: (i) ensure that all public
         hospitals use updated financial management and accounting procedures; (ii) all public
         hospitals are supervised by effective Supervisory Committees (SC); (iii) accounts of
         at least 80 percent of public hospitals are independently audited; and (iv) 20 percent
         of hospitals issue annual public performance reports;
         Successful implementation of the selected hospital network optimization projects
         under APL 1 and realizing the efficiency gains: average stay in these hospitals is no
         longer than 10 days and productivity of inpatient services improves by at least 20
         percent compared to the 2003 baseline;
         At least 40 percent of the population is covered by family medicine (FM) practices
         that: (i) are staffed by trained family doctors and family medicine nurses; (ii)
         managerially autonomous from specialist care; and (iii) have independent contracts
         with the State Health Agency (SHA); and
         The first (HSPR) and first set of (NHA) will have been issued and an updated
         national health strategy drafted with clear performance goals.

                                              3
1.3    Revised PDO

14.    The PDO was not revised.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

15.     Direct beneficiaries of the project investments were the communities benefiting
from scaling up of the PHC development program and populations who are being served
by the hospitals supported by the Project. Poor people have benefitted disproportionately
more from policy interventions that include better targeting, and targeting poorer
communities through the PHC program. Family doctors, family nurses, and hospital
managers are professional groups who benefitted directly from the Project. Longer-term
benefits are expected to the whole society from improved governance, public health policy
making and replication of best practices. In addition: (i) participating hospitals in Yerevan,
Tavush and Kotayk marzes benefited from improved infrastructure, strengthened institutional
capacity, improved regulatory environment, and institutional capacity for better hospital
governance and optimization. This allowed efficiency improvements, resulting in economies
of scale, improved quality of care, and less financial access barriers for patients; (ii) MOH,
SHA, local governments, National Institute of Health (NIH), Basic Medical College (BMC),
and State Medical University (SMU) benefited from strengthened institutional capacity; and
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) benefitted from improved targeting and transparency of
public resources.

1.5    Original Components

16.    The Project supported: (i) scaling-up of family medicine based PHC; (ii)
optimization and modernization of selected hospital networks; and (iii) strengthening of the
government capacity to develop and monitor effective health sector policies. It had four
components:

17.      Component A ­ Family Medicine Development (US$7.1 million or 28 percent of
total project costs) supported the: (i) strengthening of the institutional capacity to train well
qualified family doctors (FD) and family nurses (FN) as first line PHC providers using
internationally peer reviewed curriculum; (ii) provision of incremental support to train and
retrain 980 FD and 980 FN, estimated 60 percent of the country's needs; and (iii) expansion
of the PHC Development Program to improve the PHC infrastructure beyond the 81
communities supported under the first health project, and further development of FM
relevant PHC guidelines, including primary and secondary prevention of avoidable mortality.
The component also financed: (i) renovation and equipping academic and clinical training
facilities; (ii) training of trainers (TOT); (iii) technical assistance (TA) for curriculum
evaluation and improvement; (iv) tuition and stipends for the staff to be retrained as FD and
FN; (v) developing and publishing practice guidelines; (vi) medical equipment and supplies
for PHC; (vii) rehabilitation of PHC infrastructure; and (viii) vehicles for PHC in remote
communities.




                                             4
18.     Component B ­ Hospital Network Optimization and Modernization (US$15
million or 59 percent of total project costs). The component supported the development and
implementation of strategic restructuring plans for selected hospital network organization (up
to four in Yerevan and one per region, subject to resource constraints). The plans included:
(i) consolidation of infrastructure and services; (ii) modernization of management structures
and improving management capacity; (iii) strengthening accountability arrangements; (iv)
quality assurance systems; (v) assistance to help mitigate social consequences from staff
retrenchment, and (vi) improving management of health care waste.

19.     Component C ­ Strengthening Government Capacity to Develop and Monitor
Health Sector Policies (US$2.4 million or 9 percent of total project costs). The component
supported the strengthening of the capacity of the MOH and its key agencies to perform its
major functions of policy development and implementation monitoring, regulation, and
oversight of the health sector. It also supported strengthening of governance and
management structures of health care provider institutions and the oversight function of
regional Government (marz) structures. The component (i) built capacity for evaluation of
health sector performance by developing core monitoring instruments that were needed to
inform decision makers (HSPA, NHA); (ii) strengthened the legal and regulatory
environment, improved quality assurance mechanisms, improved public awareness about
health reforms, as well as institutional capacity to improve supervision, accountability and
management of public hospitals; (iii) improved public expenditure management in the health
sector; and (iv) improved surveillance of HIV/AIDS and other public health threats by
complementing the activities supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria
(GFTAM).

20.     Component D ­ Project Management (US$1.0 million or 4 percent of total project
costs) supported the: (i) establishment of a supportive structure within MOH for the strategic
planning and operational management of the Project; (ii) capacity to monitor and evaluate the
reform progress and outcomes within MOH; (iii) organization of information dissemination
and consultation activities; and (iv) operations of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to
support the MOH in the administration, coordination, and fiduciary aspects of the Project.

21.     The PHRD financed technical assistance and training activities in support of the
project to: (i) strengthen the Government's institutional capacity to monitor and evaluate
health sector policy; (ii) modernize the hospital network and improve the capacity of MOH
as a regulatory agency; (iii) strengthen the SHA capacity in public expenditure management;
(iv) strengthen MOH's capacity to monitor and evaluate implementation of the HIV/AIDS
strategy; and (v) further develop family medicine.

1.6    Revised Components

22.   There were no revisions to Components A and D. Some revisions were made to sub-
components under Components B and C as follows:

23.   Sub-component B.4 - Merger of Kanaker-Zeytum Medical Center. In agreement
between the GOA and the Bank in 2005, this merger did not proceed as originally planned.

                                            5
Two of the facilities that were to be merged ­ Institute of Cardiology and Polyclinic No. 11
obtained independent status and contracts with the SHA. Therefore, agreement was reached
to reallocate the funds for this merger to support the marz hospitals' optimization plans.

24.    Sub-component C.4 ­ Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of national HIV/AIDS
strategy. During a Bank mission in 2005, it was agreed with the GOA that the HIV/AIDS
M&E system should be part of the overall framework of the public health surveillance
system. Therefore, the sub-component was not implemented as originally designed.

1.7      Other significant changes

25.  There were three amendments to the Credit Agreement and one amendment to the
PHRD Grant Agreement:

IDA Credit

         The first amendment, letter of November 14, 2006 made adjustments of allocations
         between civil works and goods to reflect: (i) increased prices of works, which had
         been estimated at 2003 market prices, and (ii) appreciation of the Armenian Dram
         against the US dollar.
         The second amendment, letter of September 18, 2008: (i) increased the amounts
         allocated to civil works because of cost over-runs mainly due to the appreciation of
         the Armenian Dram against the US dollar, (ii) decreased the allocation for goods
         because of considerable savings in the procurement of medical equipment, and (iii)
         increased the allocations for consultants' services and incremental operating costs to
         accommodate the evolving needs of the Project.
         The third amendment, letter of May 6, 2010 made small adjustments to reflect the
         amounts of ongoing contracts and ensure that all categories of expenditure were fully
         utilized.

PHRD Grant

         The amendment increased the consultants' allocation to ensure full utilization of
         funds.

26.      The closing dates of the IDA Credit and PHRD Grant were extended once for a
total of 12 months for the Credit (letter of February 24, 2009) and 16 months for the Grant
up to June 30, 2010. The original closing date of the Credit was June 30, 2009 and February
28, 2009 for the PHRD Grant. The extension of the closing date of the Credit was required
for: (i) the successful completion of civil works for the renovation and refurbishment of two
regional hospitals ­ Harazdan Medical Center and Ijevan Medical Center, and (ii) completion
and dissemination of the 2009 HSPA report and the 2009 NHA. The extension of the PHRD
Grant allowed for completion of technical assistant contracts.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

27.    The ICR team rates Design and Quality at Entry as Satisfactory on the basis of the
following features:

28.      Soundness of background analysis. The Project's main focus on financial,
institutional, and structural issues of the Armenia health system were based on the premise
that the main adverse effects of the system on the poor were: (i) high OOP payments
affecting access, and (ii) deteriorating infrastructure, equipment and staff morale impacting
quality. This premise was based on sound analyses of: (i) lessons from the design and
implementation of Bank support to health sector development in ECA and of the successful
experience from the first Bank-supported health project in Armenia; (ii) analytical work to
inform project preparation; (iii) application of lessons based on the review of analytical work
related to experience with hospital optimization in other ECA countries; (iv) consistency with
Government and Bank strategies; (v) complementarity with other Bank-supported
projects/programs, including the structural adjustment credit program that included policy
benchmarks on improved financial management and supervision of hospitals, and targets for
hospital optimization; and (vi) complementarity with other development partners-financed
activities supporting PHC reform (USAID) and emerging HIV/AIDS threats (GFTAM).

29.    Quality Enhancement Review (QER). A QER was conducted prior to the appraisal.
The QER found that the project preparation documentation was substantially advanced and
ready for appraisal. Discussions at the QER suggested that the task team's knowledge and
thinking had developed beyond what was written in the PAD in a number of important areas
and made recommendations on how these could be fully documented in the PAD. Most
recommendations by the QER were taken into account in the revised PAD.

30.     Assessment of project design. Project preparation was supported by technical
assistance financed under a PHRD grant, which helped the GOA develop detailed project
design. It also financed the development of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP). In
addition, several pieces of economic and sector work provided important insights to barriers
for health services utilization among the poor, which helped shape the design of the Project,
including: (i) Poverty Assessment and its update; (ii) a policy research working paper "the
Effects of a Fee-Waiver Program on Health Care Utilization among the Poor"; (iii) Public
Expenditure Review; (iv) Government's Medium Term Expenditure Framework; and (v)
draft Poverty Reduction Strategy. In the view of the ICR team, the project objectives,
scope and institutional arrangements were appropriate. The Project's aims and scope
were appropriate to the stage of development of the health sector in the country and built on
experience within Armenia and elsewhere in the region. The APL investment vehicle was
appropriate given the scope of reforms to be pursued and the GOA's and Bank's commitment
to work together in further developing the sector. Further, the Project was consistent with the
objectives of the 2004 Country Assistant Strategy (CAS), which focused on: (i) promoting
private sector led economic growth; (ii) making growth more pro-poor; and (iii) reducing



                                            7
non-income poverty through better health, education and basic services.           The Project
objectives were directly linked to the CAS third objective.

31.     The Project's emphasis on the following areas were also appropriate: (i) regulatory
environmental and institutional capacity for better hospital governance; (ii) regulatory and
financial incentives for hospital sector rationalization and strengthening management
capacity of public hospitals; (iii) accelerated implementation of PHC reform; (iv) improved
targeting and transparency of public resources; and (v) strengthened institutional capacity for
MOH and related agencies to implement PHC and hospital care

32.     Lessons Learned and Incorporated. As noted earlier, the Project design addressed
several key lessons learned from the review of health care reforms in the poorest CIS
countries, including: (i) need to enhance efficiency of the supply side by changing clinical
protocols, reforming outpatient care, changing skill mix of the labor force, and strengthening
providers' managerial capabilities; (ii) need to strengthen the role of the Government using
budgetary and regulatory instruments, by improving public budget management; and (iii)
need to design and implement mechanisms to meet demand, particularly among the poor.
Lessons were also integrated to the design from ECHSD's report on HNP work experience in
ECA and its implications for the future involvement in the sector and services to clients.
Specifically, the key lessons from the report, integrated into Project components, supported
scaling up high-impact activities (family medicine development), investing into infrastructure
when these help to leverage difficult policy and structural reforms (hospital optimization and
modernization), and improving institutions and governance through better regulations and
skills development (strengthening government capacity to develop and monitor effective
health sector policies).

33.      Risk Assessment. The PAD identified three risks from outputs to objective and four
risks from components to outputs. The risk assessment assumptions made at appraisal
reflected experience with implementation of health reform in the country with support from
the first Bank-financed health project and the fragile economic situation of the country. The
mitigation measures were adequately identified and successfully applied during
implementation.

34.     Provision was made for technical assistance, workshops, surveys and policy
formulation at various levels of the system. Health reforms supported by the Project and the
health aspects of the PRSC operations were supervised closely by the same Bank health team
ensuring that the policy dialogue with central and regional authorities was consistent and
linked to the overall macro level dialogue between the Bank and the GOA.

2.2    Implementation

35.     The ICR team rates implementation as Satisfactory. The Project was successful in
delivering most of the outputs under the four components and achieving its expected
outcomes (see details in Annex 2, Section 3.2, and data sheet). The Project was never
considered at risk during its implementation period. In fact, due to its achievements and the
momentum gained in: (i) the retraining of family doctors and family nurses; (ii) hospital

                                            8
network optimization and modernization; (iii) initiatives of marzes (regions) to initiate
hospital optimization programs beyond the two marzes included in the Project; (iv) excellent
progress with building the policy and analytical capacity at the MOH and SHA; and (v)
meeting most of the APL 2 triggers, it was agreed with the Government to accelerate the
processing of APL 2. Overall, the Project performed well both at the central and regional
levels and the Government's commitment (see Section 5.2) to its implementation was strong
from the outset. GOA's commitment continues under APL 2 and the processing of its AF.
The Project was managed well; its rating was Satisfactory for Implementation Progress and
Progress towards achieving of development objective for all its implementation period.
Financial Management and Project Management were consistently rated Highly Satisfactory.

36.     The good performance of the Project reflects the strong leadership by MOH in
guiding the Project from its inception and effective supervision and guidance by the Bank
Team. During project implementation, the Minister of Health changed only once. From the
outset, the second Minister acknowledged the importance of the Project in supporting health
reforms and demonstrated strong commitment to its objectives. In addition, the effective and
efficient coordination efforts by the PIU in all aspects of project administration were crucial
to ensuring efficient and timely completion of activities. Implementation was successful in
most ways and less successful in a limited number of others.

Positive factors and events that influenced project achievements

37.     The Project has contributed to the successful implementation of the GOA's PHC
strategy. Implementation of family medicine and PHC reforms in the country has been
successful. With support from the Project, the transition phase of moving the PHC system
from the previous ambulatory-polyclinic system to FM practice accelerated considerably. By
the closing date, 85% of the population was covered by qualified family medicine practices,
exceeding the 60% target for the end of the Project. The Project has been instrumental to
support GOA's efforts to accelerate the pace of health reforms in general and most
specifically PHC, particularly to: (i) expand the retraining and residency training of FD and
family nurses (see Tables 1 and 2); (ii) further broaden the role of FD and the scope of
services they deliver; (iii) introduce more flexible contracts with the SHA with incentives to
improve performance, quality, and provide additional health promotion, prevention and
extended PHC services by family physicians; (iv) increase remuneration for family
physicians and nurses; (v) ensure that users have the freedom to choose their family
physicians (open enrolment); (vi) refine resource allocation mechanisms to reflect need and
enhanced equity; (vii) place more emphasis on evidence-based medicine; (viii) reinforce the
gate keeping function of PHC with FD acting as the first point of contact for patients; (ix)
change reporting mechanisms in PHC that reinforced the old tripartite model (pediatric,
women's, and adult clinics) and hindered unified service provision; and (x) strengthen PHC
infrastructure, through civil works, and provision of medical equipment, supplies, and
vehicles.

38.    The WONCA's evaluation (World Organization of National Colleges and Academies
of Family Doctors) of the family physicians' training courses conducted in May 2009
reported that the training program works well at all levels and the satisfaction of retrained

                                            9
physicians and those in training is unanimously very high. The WONCA report
acknowledges that Armenia and the HSMP have achieved a great deal in terms of the
quantity and quality of the retraining. It also noted that the curriculum for family physicians
retraining is a huge success and that the political support, the infrastructure, and the
manpower are in place. All the key players have acquired experience, have adequate
working conditions, and are highly motivated and dedicated to successfully finish the
retraining program.

39.     Surveys undertaken during project implementation show clearly that with the
implementation of the FM model, the scope and content of health services have significantly
expanded. The FM model has: (i) strengthened health education, disease prevention, and
promotion services; (ii) enhanced gate keeping; (iii) introduced more frequent application of
medical techniques and procedures; and (iv) expanded management of key first contact and
chronic conditions. Analysis of referral data shows a decline in the number of hospital
referrals for key acute and chronic conditions typically managed in the PHC setting. These
findings demonstrate that FM reforms are having the desired benefits of enhanced care
management in the PHC setting with reduced referrals to a hospital, with consequent
improvement in efficiency and effectiveness. The following tables/charts present a
breakdown of retraining of family physicians and nurses by cohort and illustrate the
breakdown by marzes:

40.      Hospital network optimization and modernization has been effective. As designed, the
Project was to support four hospital mergers in Yerevan, namely (i) Mhkitar Heratsi State Medical
University Hospital; (ii) Surb Grigor Lusavorich; (iii) Saint Marie; and (iv) Kanaker Zeytun Medical
Center. In addition, two marz hospital mergers were supported in Kotayk (Hrazdan Medical Center)
and Tavush (Ijevan Medical Center) marzes. However, in 2005, the Kanaker Zeytun Medical Centers
merger was dropped out of the Project and funds reallocated to support the regional merger program
(see Section 1.6). Implementation in the remaining mergers met the component's objective to
implement the optimization and modernization plans for the selected hospital networks. In the
international context of how difficult such reforms are, the successful implementation of hospital
optimization under the Project becomes even more notable. The productivity and efficiency in pilot
hospital networks has continued to improve as evidenced by their related indicators (see Table 3 of
Section 3.2, and Annex 3). In addition, all public hospitals use updated financial management and
accounting procedures developed under the Project.

41.     Progress with implementation of network optimization promoted enthusiasm among
other regional health authorities to pursue similar activities in other marzes. Encouraged by
the results in Yerevan and the regional enthusiasm, the GOA approved on November 2,
2006, the master plan for the optimization of health facilities in the remaining marzes and a
decision was made to advance the preparation of the APL 2 to ensure that the momentum
gained was sustained. All planned activities with regard to three hospital mergers in Yerevan
and two hospital mergers in marzes were completed and all main intermediate targets
reached. Activities included major reconstruction/rehabilitation of hospital premises,
provision of up to date biomedical equipment and furniture, management training, as well as
training and supplies for management of medical waste. By all accounts, the quality of the
reconstruction work is high in all the five mergers. As illustrated by survey results, medical
personnel and patients have expressed high levels of satisfaction with the facilities and
improved services. The ICR team visited all five hospital facilities and observed the high
volume of patients being treated, including high bed occupancy rates. Data on ALOS and
occupancy rates is presented in Table 3 of Section 3.2.

42.    Strengthening of capacity for evaluation of health sector performance; regulatory
oversight and management functions; and public expenditure management. The
accomplishments of the Project in the area of HSPA and institutionalization of the NHA
cannot be under-estimated. The ICR team concurs with the last Aide Memoire (May 2010)
that "Armenia is well ahead of many other comparable countries in the development and
frequency of NHA reports and the number of HSPA reports completed". The 2009 HSPA is
a comprehensive assessment of the following areas with concrete recommendations on the
way forward: (i) health system stewardship, (ii) health management information system, (iii)
development of human resources for health, (iv) equity in financing and financial protection,
(v) health system efficiency, (vi) access to health care services, (vii) quality and safety of
health care services, (viii) risk factors, health promotion and disease prevention, (ix) health
system responsiveness, and (x) improvements in health status.

43.     These reports are providing quality information for decision-makers to help improve
policies. Efforts will continue to be needed to ensure that the findings and recommendations
of the reports are actually used as tools for policy decision. Equally, the Project has been
successful in: (i) supporting the improvement of health legislation; (ii) development of
quality assurance mechanisms and overall improved MOH capacity as the regulatory agency


                                              11
for the health sector; (iii) strengthening central and local government oversight functions, (iv)
building-up management structures of hospitals, and (v) developing regulations for health
care waste management. In addition, the Project has been effective in supporting the SHA to
become a more advanced and capable purchasing agency. With support from USAID, MOH
is working to develop a methodology and model for per capita normative costing,
differentiated per type of service, age and gender aiming to improve public resource
management.

44.    Strong Project Coordination.         All Aide Memoires attest to the effective
administration of the Project by the PIU. Project implementation was coordinated well by
the PIU team, who provided strong coordination, administration, procurement, financial
management, and technical support to multiple institutions at the central and regional levels.
Procurement and financial management were particularly strong under the Project (see
relevant sections). During ICR discussions, it was evident that the Project Director and the
three project coordinators were highly committed to the objectives of the Project and work
well to meet difficult deadlines. Two of the component coordinators had been with the
Project since its inception. A third one changed, but clearly the departure of the third
component coordinator had limited effect in the performance of the Project as the new
coordinator quickly took over his responsibilities and performed well. Equally meetings with
the Procurement and Financial Manager confirmed the high ratings in ISRs.

Less effective factors and events which influenced project's achievement

45.     The implementation of community grants had not been as successful as most
activities; only four such grants were signed. As per the Credit Agreement, only
communities, which had already benefitted from investments under the first Bank-supported
project, were eligible for these grants provided they contributed 30 percent of proposed
expenditures. The grants were to help these communities to finance additional activities such
as procurement of additional equipment and training, minor repair works, etc. The idea was
that if the community was willing to contribute further to their health needs by financing
30% of proposed expenditures, the Project would make additional funds available to fully
cover the cost of the proposed interventions. During ICR discussions with the PIU and
marzes' authorities, one of the main reasons given for the lack of interest in these grants was
the high requirement by the Project for counterpart funding from beneficiaries.

46.     Some activities remain to be fully implemented, some of which are being pursued
under APL 2 and/or its Additional Financing loan. These include: (i) full scale
implementation and monitoring of strategic development plans for hospitals; (ii)
administrative guidelines and operationalization of regulatory documents produced under the
Project on licensing and accreditation; (iii) improved performance of the FM model in urban
settings in large part due to the continued presence of narrow specialists at polyclinics; and
(iv) implementation of independent group practices.

47.    Other challenges that remain include: (i) further clarification of the PHC delivery
model in urban polyclinics to encourage family physicians to exercise the full scope of their
responsibility; (ii) possible adjustment by sex and age in the PHC capitation formula; (iii)
getting better value for money allocated to PHC by introducing performance-based


                                             12
reimbursement to PHC staff aiming to improve the quality of PHC services by focusing on
preventive activities; (iv) making further use of NHA and HSPA' findings for policy
decisions, including full institutionalization of production and publication of these reports;
and (v) strengthening of owners' oversight and establishment of Hospital Oversight Boards.
Some of these issues are being addressed under the ongoing APL 2 and its additional
financing loan, while others are being supported by USAID.

48.     One activity planned was independent audits of all hospitals. However, the country
legislation (2002 Law on Accounting) clearly states that only companies with annual revenue
exceeding 1 billion dram or with balanced value of assets exceeding 1 billion dram (as of the
end of the year) must carry out independent financial audits. Only three hospitals meet this
requirement ­ Grigor Lusavorich Medical Center, Norq Marash Medical Center, and Surb
Astvatsamayr Medical Center. Audits for these three institutions were undertaken and audit
reports issued in July 2010. Notwithstanding the law, the Government recognizes that
further progress needs to be made in the implementation of activities to improve governance
arrangements of public hospitals. However, no progress was made in independent audits of
hospitals in 2009, beyond the three mentioned above, as allocation of funds for public
hospitals to undertake the audits was not considered a priority by GOA due to constraints in
the State budget because of the economic crisis. In support of improved governance and
financial accountability, the AF will support independent financial audits for project hospitals.
In addition, it is important to note that the results framework for the Additional Financing
loan was fine-tuned to address the current situation with regard to Supervisory Committees
(SC) at public hospitals, audits and financial reporting from public hospitals, and data
availability on non-communicable diseases. In parallel, the respective targets have been
either dropped or re-worded under the AF as they were judged unrealistic as originally
planned under APL 1 given: (i) the undefined functions of the SCs and the fact that the
introduction of corporate governance in the health sector was premature at that time and not
tied to overall public sector reforms; (ii) the country regulations (2002 Law on Accounting;
and (iii) the high cost associated with independent audits. During ICR discussions, the
appraisal team noted that the indicator on audits at appraisal had been included because of
expectations that improvements in the economy would result in the hospitals' ability to
finance such audits.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

49.    Design, implementation, and utilization of M&E are rated high for reasons
elaborated below.

50.     Design. The PAD included a comprehensive set of PDO and intermediate outcome
indicators, which reflected well the PDO and project components. Although the number was
extensive (10 PDO and 11 intermediate outcome indicators), the PIU monitored and reported
systematically on them.

51.    Implementation. The PIU has been responsible for collecting and reporting on
project monitoring indicators. The PIU was successful in establishing a system to collect
monitoring indicators that was useful in monitoring progress in achieving project objectives



                                            13
and outcomes. Information on indicators was issued regularly and reported through quarterly
progress reports and reflected in Aide Memoires. The M&E system allowed measurement of
three types of indicators: (a) result indicators associated with investments/expenditures, (b)
outcome indicators aimed at measuring the Project's results in relation to its development
objectives, and (c) intermediate indicators associated with project components.

52.     The Project was monitored regularly during implementation. Project progress
monitoring was a key instrument of project management that ensured timely receipt of
comprehensive and regularly updated information. A number of monitoring and evaluation
activities were developed and these activities were effective in monitoring various aspects of
project implementation. The M&E system was supported by surveys (providers and user'
satisfaction, NHA and HSPA) and a database capable of providing three types of monitoring.
This database was updated regularly with information from the health institutions, the Health
Information and Analytical Center of NIH, and the National Statistical Services. The system
supported monitoring of: (i) project implementation progress; (ii) patient and
physicians/nurses satisfaction surveys conducted in project hospitals; (iii) retraining
schedules for FD/FN as well as hospital managers; and (iv) efficiency and productivity gains
in the participating hospitals.

53.     Patient and physicians/nurses satisfaction surveys were carried out in pilot
hospitals networks in Yerevan and two participating marzes in 2008. In total, 1,420
physicians/nurses and 2,054 patients participated in the surveys in Yerevan and 300
physicians/nurses and 227 patients in the two marzes. In general physicians/nurses were
fully or partially satisfied with a number of patients pointing out to the good working
relations, adequate coordination of hospitals different departments, adequate working
conditions and medical equipment. Around 85% of patients were satisfied with the quality of
health care services provided.

54.    During the early stages of NHA development, indicators were developed related to
household health expenditures. Two surveys on household expenditures for health services
and financial activities of health care organization and drugstores (2005-06 and 2008) were
conducted with support from the National Statistical Agency.

55.     With support from USAID, indicators have been selected and agreed upon with MOH
and SHA to be part of the performance-based contracting scheme for PHC providers, which
is to be implemented with the 2011 contracts.

56.     Utilization. M&E has been used under the Project not only as a management tool to
evaluate the status of implementation of activities, M&E has served to inform policy makers
for decision-making purposes. This has been particularly the case for assessing the evolution
of efficiency and productivity gains in the hospital sector. M&E has become an important
tool providing the authorities at Yerevan and marz levels with timely and relevant data. New
forms for FM and hospitals (MIDAS 2 and 3) recording and reporting were produced and
disseminated throughout the PHC and hospital systems. Staff received training for the use of
the system. On the basis of experience with implementation, the indicators were refined as
part of the Additional Financing loan.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

57.     Safeguards implementation is rated Satisfactory. An environmental analysis
conducted during project preparation identified potential adverse environmental impacts,
which were found to be restricted in scope and severity. As a result of the analysis, measures
were designed to mitigate the risks in the design, planning, and construction supervision
process as well as during the operation of the health facilities. As noted earlier, an EMP was
prepared, in consultation with the main stakeholders to integrate environmental concerns into
the design and implementation of the Project. As per the EMP, the Project supported: (i)
establishment of environmental expertise within the PIU, including inclusion of
environmental issues in the Project Operational Manual; (ii) implementation of a capacity
building training program; (iii) site-specific environmental screening for all rehabilitation of
hospital and PHC centers supported by the Project; (iv) M&E of mitigation measures
identified in the site-specific reviews and implementation of these measures; and (iv)
development of environmental guidelines and capacity building for ecological planning and
design of health care facilities and for waste handling, including demolition and construction
debris. With technical assistance provided under the Project, draft national guidelines on
Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) were developed and adopted by Decree No. 03-N
of the Minister of Health of April 3, 2008.

58.     Training on sustainable design/environmental guidelines/environmental checklists
and utilization resulted on the PIU ability to: (i) effectively supervise the design process and
the civil works, work out environmental management plans and checklists for supervision
and reporting, (ii) coordinate the environmental aspects of the Project, participate in working
out a management plan and checklists for supervision and reporting, (iii) supervise the
development of sustainable designs for ambulatories and hospitals, and (iv) assess and
supervise civil works according to the EMP.

59.     At the regional level, training on organization and implementation of the in-hospital
health care waste management system and procedures by local consultants, improved the
ability of regional health management and staff to: (i) get acquainted with HCMW guidelines
and plans developed by hospital staff, and (ii) increased knowledge of hospital administrators
on HCWM planning as an integral part of hospital strategic plans. Additional training by the
consultant highlighted the practical aspects of HCWM stipulated by the national guidelines
resulting in the ability of hospitals to implement logistic systems of collection, interim
storage, and disposal of solid waste. Contracts with the central waste disposal facility
(incinerator) have been signed by all hospitals.

60.     The Project did not have significant or irreversible negative environmental impact
at the construction phase of the facilities. Impact of the construction phase were typical for
all medium scale rehabilitation/construction activities and were limited to the project sites,
which were state-owned land plots with user rights already granted to the medical institutions,
operating in those plots. However, based on the review by the Bank's Environmental
Consultant (May 2010), the use of chemicals in the daily operations of the hospital will, if
not appropriately processed, become an environmental hazard. The situation is a follows:




                                            15
61.      Solid Medical Waste. During discussions with the five hospital directors, the ICR
team confirmed that each hospital has signed contracts with an incinerator company for the
collection and incineration of solid medical waste in publicly owned and run incinerator
facilities. In two of the large hospitals in Yerevan, the frequency of removal of waste was
weekly while in the smaller hospitals is less frequent. In addition, in the Muratcan Hospital
merger of the Yerevan State Medical University (Merger B.1), the project financed the
procurement of an incinerator that has been installed and is operating in the premises of the
hospital.

62.     Liquid Waste from sanitary facilities and from laboratory and other hospital areas is
disposed of directly in the main public sewer system. In a number of hospitals, a system for
chlorination5 of the waste is installed after which the waste passes directly into the sewer
system. In some hospitals it was reported that a treatment plant was indeed taking care of the
further degradation of the waste before disposal into the general environment. However, the
presence of such facilities unfortunately was not witnessed during the ICR mission. The
Bank's environmental consultant has recommended that systems to treat liquid medical waste
from the hospital facilities be installed in all redeveloped hospital campuses.

63.     Financial Management (FM) is rated Satisfactory. The FM arrangements at the
PIU, including accounting, reporting, budgeting and planning, internal controls, funds flow
and staffing were considered to be strong throughout implementation and rated consistently
Satisfactory or Highly Satisfactory. The level and timeliness of Government co-financing
was also satisfactory. External audits have been prepared and issued on a timely manner and
have consistently been unqualified. The contract with the external auditor was extended to
cover the audit of FY2010 financial statement, which was closed in June 2010. Accordingly,
the PIU opened an escrow account for the payment of the final audit; the final audit is being
completed and expected to be issued in December 2010. Disbursements under the Project
proceeded generally as planned and the proceeds of the credit were almost entirely disbursed.
As of November 2010, US$20.526 million equivalent had been disbursed from the proceeds
of the Credit. Withdrawal applications were prepared regularly and supporting
documentation was complete.

64.     Under the Project, there were three training institutions involved in the provision of
training ­ Yerevan State Medical University, National Institute of Health, and the Yerevan
State Basic Medical College. All the three institutions have maintained satisfactory payment
and record keeping systems and accounting functions in place, which were found satisfactory
by the Bank.

  The original SDR amount of SDR 13 million was equivalent to US$19 million at the time of project approval.
The availability of more US dollars reflects the appreciation of SDR currencies against the US dollar. The total
credit proceeds at the time of expiry of the grace period (October 31, 2010), were equivalent to US$20.56.



                                                       16
65.     Procurement is rated Satisfactory. The PIU managed procurement effectively.
Procurement was rated Satisfactory during the life of the Project. Procurement management
and implementation was carried out by three procurement specialists in the PIU's
Procurement Unit. The Procurement Plan was updated as required. Procurement under the
Project included: (i) civil works; (ii) biomedical equipment; (iii) office equipment; (iv)
furniture; (v) medical supplies; and (vi) consulting services procured under various types of
procurement methods as per the Credit Agreement. Since the institutions mentioned in para
64 are state-owned, a special waiver was granted by the Bank's Regional Procurement
Advisor to allow for contracting with each of these institutions.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

66.     The two-phase APL that supports the GOA health sector reform program is expected
to be implemented in eight years (2004-2012). The overall objective of the Program is to
improve the organization of the health care system to provide more accessible, quality and
sustainable health care services to the population, in particular to the most vulnerable groups
and better manage public health threats. The Project (APL 1) has expanded access to quality
PHC, improve the quality and efficiency of selected hospital networks, and lay the ground for
effective health sector policy making and monitoring. The APL 2's objective (Credit No.
4267-AM) approved on March 8, 2007 aims at: (i) scaling up family medicine based PHC
reform by expanding the renovation of PHC facilities and upgrading of the medical
equipment in the remaining marzes; (ii) optimizing and upgrading hospital networks in the
remaining marzes; (iii) strengthening Government's capacity to develop and monitor
effective health sector policies in the area of health financing, resource allocation and
provider payments; and (iv) expanding investments in human resources to include formal and
continuous education in health (medical, nursing, auxiliary health professionals).

67.      The additional financing loan approved on December 20, 2010 would help finance
the costs associated with a financing gap for ongoing activities as well as to scale-up
activities. APL 2 experienced a shortage of funds due to: (a) an increase of over 35 percent
in construction costs as compared to appraisal estimates; (b) an increase in civil works
expenditures due to Government's decision to make changes in the Marz Hospital
Optimization Plan; and (c) procurement of furniture for the marz hospitals, which was
initially not included under APL 2 design. The additional loan will also support additional
activities included as part of APL 2 project restructuring in response to evolving
circumstances, and scaled-up activities to enhance the impact of this well-performing project,
including: (a) the expansion of the implementation of Marz Hospital Optimization plans by
investing in the modernization of an additional six marz hospital networks (in Syunik marz -
Meghri and Kapan hospitals, Kotayk marz - Abovian hospital, Lorri marz - Alaverdi and
Vanadzor hospitals, and Tavush marz ­ Berd hospital); and (b) the financing of training for
medical staff on clinical case management and provision of clinical reference materials to
enhance the quality of hospital services.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

68.     The relevance of objectives, design, and implementation arrangements are rated
High. Supporting the implementation of the Government's health reform program through
expanding access to quality PHC and improving quality and efficiency of selected hospital
networks were important development priorities of both the Government and the Bank at the
time of Project approval. Equally, it was important to address in parallel activities to lay the
ground for effective health sector policy and monitoring. At the time of the ICR mission, the
PDO continues to be highly relevant because: (i) PHC continues to be at the core of the
Government's agenda to improve access and quality of services of the population, especially
in the rural areas, (ii) addressing hospital optimization while improving quality and
efficiency of hospital networks continues to be an integral part of the Government's strategy,
as is (iii) further improvements of efficiency, quality and effectiveness of health care
spending.

69.    The Project has had significant impact in the frame of ongoing health reforms in the
country. In particular, the Project has made significant achievements in: (i) implementing
PHC reform with emphasis on the family medicine model, (ii) improving hospital service
delivery, (iii) strengthening institutional capacity of the SHA to become an active purchaser
of services, and (iv) scaling-up optimization of the selected health services networks in
Yerevan and marzes.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

70.     This evaluation rates achievement of PDO as Satisfactory based on the Project
achieving almost all of its outcome indicators and in some cases even over-achieving them,
and achieving most of its intermediate indicators (also refer to Section F of the data sheet).
The ICR evaluation was based on analyses of outcome and intermediate indicators and data
linked to the development objectives of the Project as well as an evaluation of how project
activities were linked to the achievement of the PDO. In general, the Project should serve as
a positive example of what other projects could achieve as it tackles critical service delivery
issues of a modern PHC system while at the same time addressing efficiency and quality
issues at the hospital sector. These two elements have been complemented with activities
that have laid ground work for further reforms by building the capacity and knowledge
through instruments like national health accounts and health sector performance assessments.
Achievement of the PDO is addressed below:

71.      PDO 1 ­ expand access to quality primary health care. All outcome indicators have
been achieved and in some cases the Project has over-achieved them. The Project has led to
important achievements in: (i) FM retraining of doctors and nurses, (ii) improvement of PHC
facilities infrastructure, (iii) provision of medical equipment and supplies, (iv) provision of
autonomy and independent decision making of PHC facilities, (v) overall access of the
population to improved PHC services, and (vi) population satisfaction with the quality and
access to PHC services. By the end of the Project, 85% of the population was covered by



                                            18
qualified family medicine practices, exceeding the 60% target for APL 1 and almost reaching
the end of the APL 2 target of 90%.

72.     By the end of the Project, 1082 family physicians and 988 family nurses had been
retrained (for details of number of physicians and nurses re-trained please refer to Tables 1
and 2 of Section 2.2). The percentage of population in target areas rating quality and access
to PHC health services has increased from baseline 87.6% to 90% in 2009, reaching 95% by
the end of the Project. In addition, the utilization of outpatient services (per person per year)
increased from 3.0 in 2007 to 3.3 in 2008 and referral rates to specialist care in project target
areas has decreased from 32% in 2004 to 25% in 2009. Infant mortality (IMR) and under 5
mortality (U5M) has declined from 11.6 (IMR) and 13.0 (U5M) in 2004 to 10.4 and 11.9
respectively in 2009.

73.    PDO 2 ­ improve quality and efficiency of selected hospital networks. As with PDO
1, most outcome indicators have been achieved and in some cases they were over-achieved.
Two of the indicators have been partially achieved for reasons explained in the data sheet.
The consolidation activities in the 3 Yerevan hospital mergers and the two marzes' mergers
led to: (i) substantial bed reductions, (ii) elimination of duplication and overlap in
administration, diagnostic capacity and clinical departments, (iii) improved service utilization,
(iv) improved efficiency and productivity indicators, and (v) reduction on square meters of
hospital space (19,180 sq m). In the international context of how difficult such reforms are,
the successful implementation of hospital optimization under the Project becomes even more
notable. In addition, by the end of the Project 75% of hospital low, middle and top
management have received management training. Table 3 illustrates the considerable
improvement in terms of reduction in ALOS, average bed utilization rates, and full time
equivalent (FTE) per 1000 bed-days. More details can be found in Annex 3.

74.     PDO 3 ­ Lay groundwork for effective health sector policy and monitoring.
Excellent progress has been made to establish capacity for health policy making and
monitoring: (i) all public hospitals use updated financial management and accounting
procedures; (ii) the M&E system for the health sector (not only for HIV/AIDS) is being
utilized and annual reports are produced; and (iii) core instruments for health sector policy
development and decision making were developed and issued on an annual basis ­ National
Health Accounts and Health Sector Progress Assessment Reports. This evaluation concurs
with the last supervision mission's statement in its Aide Memoire of May 2010, which notes
that Armenia is well ahead of many other comparable countries in the frequency and content
quality of these reports.

75.     While PDO 8 indicator called for external audits and public performance reporting for
major hospitals, these were judged unrealistic by the supervision team. The ICR team agrees
with this assessment given the country's regulation (2002 Law on Accounting), which does
not require independent audits for hospitals with annual revenue of less than 1 billion dram
(see para 47). Only three hospitals in Yerevan meet this requirement and external audit
reports have been issued for them by the end of the Project. The ICR team also agrees with
the last mission's assessment that the prohibitive cost associated with independent audits is
not conducive to such activities on an annual basis (please also refer to para 47). However, it
is important to point out that the selection of this indicator at appraisal was driven by the fact
that as the health budget was rapidly increasing during the period, there was a sense of
optimism that the hospitals would have sufficient revenues to conduct audits.

3.3    Efficiency

76.     Efficiency is rated High. The PAD assigned the major share of anticipated project
benefits to the primary care component, but the strong performance with respect to
reductions in ALOS and increase in bed occupancy at hospitals as well as the estimated
impact of a more effective SHA through the institutional development component activities
also yielded large efficiency gains, leading to a more balanced outcome across the
activities. Overall, the economic analysis conducted at the ICR (Annex 3) indicates larger
benefits than those estimated at the time of appraisal.

77.     The Project has had significant impact in the frame of ongoing health reforms in the
country. In particular, the Project has made significant achievements in: (i) implementing
PHC reform with emphasis on the family medicine model, (ii) improving hospital service
delivery, (iii) strengthening institutional capacity of the SHA to become an active purchaser
of services, and (iv) scaling-up optimization of the selected health services networks in
Yerevan and marzes. Armenia has achieved significant milestones with PHC and hospital
reforms despite a resource-constrained environment. The comprehensive nature of the
reforms, with changes in the legal basis of the health system, organizational arrangements,
financing, provider payment systems, and service provision, has meant that strong platforms
have been established to expand and sustain the changes achieved. The multifaceted nature
of the reforms is particularly welcomed by all key stakeholders. The APL program has been
successful as demonstrated by improved key indicators on: (i) utilization of hospital and


                                             20
outpatient services, (ii) population satisfaction with the quality and access to PHC services,
(iii) optimization of regional hospital network, and (iv) efficiency of hospital services
provision. The percentage of the population in target areas rating quality and access to PHC
health services increased from the baseline of 87.6% to 90% in 2009, reaching 95% at the
end of the Project. The utilization of outpatient services increased from 2.0 in 2004 to 3.3 in
2008, utilization of hospital services increased from 8.9 in 2007 to 9.5 in 2008 (baseline was
5). The number of SHA hospital contracts decreased from 125 in 2004 to 106 in 2009 in
accordance with the hospital optimization plan. Equally, the referral rate to specialist care in
project target areas decreased from 32%, baseline in 2005 to 25% in 2009.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

78.     The Project's overall outcome is considered Satisfactory based on the Project's
significant achievements, its continued relevance, its contribution towards strengthening
Armenia's health sector program, and making it more accountable and efficient. While the
ICR team has rated outcome as Satisfactory, it is worth debating whether the project's strong
outcomes merit a higher rating. As Armenia continues its challenges regarding hospital
optimization and further expansion of family medicine, especially in urban settings, the
Project's contributions will continue to be highly relevant. The Project's contributions are
being further supported under APL 2, which is under implementation and which project's
performance is rated Satisfactory at this writing. The project's contribution will also be
supported under the APL 2 additional financing.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

79.      While the Project was not explicitly classified as a poverty-targeted operation, it has
had a positive impact on the poor. Data on utilization of basic services by different income
quintiles was monitored as well as the difference in utilization of basic services by the richest
and the poorest quintiles. While utilization rates by the poor improved at a low pace during
implementation of APL1, the physical and system improvements in the five hospitals
mergers supported by the Project and the PHC facilities achieved with the contribution of the
Project have had an impact in improving access and quality of care of populations of all
socio- economic groups, including the poor and women, especially in rural areas. During
ICR discussions, patients noted that with the improved physical condition of hospitals in
marzes for example, they did not have to travel (and spend money in transport) to Yerevan to
have access to quality hospital services. Poor people have benefited from policy
interventions that included targeting poorer communities through the PHC program. Longer
term benefits are expected to the whole society from improved governance, public health
policy making, and replication of best practices. It is worth noting that the indicator
measuring reduction in the utilization rates of PHC services between the lowest and the
highest income quintiles was revised under the AF loan to better reflect the trend of
utilization rate of out-patient and in-patient services by the poorest quintile of the population.




                                             21
(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

80.     It is difficult to attribute success in capacity building to a single project as other
intervention factors are always at play. However, during ICR discussions, both Yerevan
and marzes authorities as well as facilities' manager recognized that project investments have
resulted in substantial institutional development impacts at the different levels of the health
system. The Project strengthened institutions (MOH, SHA, NIH, SMU, SMC, hospitals and
ambulatories) and, inter alia, supported development of a comprehensive family medicine
system and development of a legal framework for health care waste management. Project
investments also played an important role as catalyst for change in the hospital optimization
policy in marzes not supported by the Project. This role was acknowledged during ICR
discussions. Staff highlighted the direct benefits of the Project in retraining of doctors and
nurses allowing them to work as teams in the family medicine setting. In participating
hospitals, physicians and nurses acknowledged the positive role the Project has played not
only in considerably improving the physical infrastructure and availability of medical
equipment, but in promoting efficiency and productivity gains.

81.     Each of the components supported institutional strengthening in their respective
areas. The Family Medicine Component supported: (i) training of physicians and nurses
trainers; (ii) re-training of physicians and nurses; (iii) further support to Chairs of Family
Medicine at NIH, SMU and BMC through provision of additional skill labs and teaching
materials; (iv) additional training to family medicine faculty; (v) integration of family
medicine modules in the under-graduate program for all medical students; (vi) training for
automated information recording at the ambulatory level; and (vii) development of FM
guidelines. The Hospital Network Optimization and Modernization Component
financed technical assistance and training for: (i) use of information systems, (ii) medical
waste management, (iii) development of optimization plans for the 10 marzes, (iv)
assessment of building conditions and seismic stability of 40 principal regional marz
hospitals; (v) architectural design of participating hospitals, (vi) management training for
hospital management, and (vii) development of software for hospital financial accounting
and reporting system. In the case of Component C ­ Strengthening government capacity
to develop and monitor effective health sector policies, the Project supported: (i)
development of core instruments to inform decision makers ­ NHA and HSPA, surveys, (ii)
revision and improvement of health legislation, governance and management, and (iii)
overall improvement of public expenditure management. Under the third component, the
Project has provided an opportunity to improve overall project management and coordination
through participation in training courses and on-the job training provided by consultants in
the course of short-term assignments. It is clear that the technical knowledge and
performance of the PIU staff is high. In the view of this evaluation, this PIU would rate well
above many of other PIUs in the ECA and other regions.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

82.     Close coordination and synergies with activities financed by WHO and USAID
have resulted in better outcomes for the sector. USAID has supported health financing
efforts and has worked with SHA to strengthen contracting mechanisms and to develop a



                                            22
performance-based contracting scheme for PHC providers to be introduced with 2011
contracts. WHO has provided technical assistance for the development of NHA and HSPAs.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

n/a

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

83.     The risk at the time of the ICR that development outcomes (or expected outcomes)
will not be maintained is rated Negligible. The MOH's and related institutions' ownership
and commitment to sustaining gains are strong. In addition, the APL 2 continues to provide
financial support for the various areas addressed by the Project.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

84.    The Bank's Task Team Leadership changed only once during early stages of project
implementation. Although there were changes in the composition of the project team as staff
changed to other assignments, the same TTL (field-based in Armenia) continued with the
Project and is also the TTL for APL 2. The close synergies between the Project and
adjustment operations have ensured that the Bank spoke with one voice and delivered
consistent messages.

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

85.     The ICR team rates the Quality an Entry as Satisfactory. The Project design was
relevant to the objectives of the CAS and the Government's strategy as described in Section
1.1. The Project design was sound and activities were clearly linked to objectives that the
project intended to achieve. The Bank team applied lessons drawn from the implementation
of projects in the country as well as lessons for hospital optimization in the region. It
recognized that in addition to the need for resources to pay for one-time costs related to
optimization activities that can be provided through a Project, there is a need to mitigate
social consequences and stakeholder politics. In this context, there was recognition that: (i)
merger of the hospitals should precede rehabilitation of premises; (ii) for staff optimization,
all possible risk-mitigation and retrenchment strategies should be employed, including
natural attrition, compensation packages, retraining, re-development; (iii) arrears need to be
cleared before mergers so the new hospital would not inherit the burden of previous arrears;
(iv) a new legal entity needs to be created as a result of the merger of equals to avoid
"winner-loser" tensions to arise; (v) management and staff for the new entity need to be
selected through fair competition; and (vi) implementing optimization is a political difficult
exercise that requires transparency, consultation with the public, mitigation of social
consequences and time.




                                            23
(b)      Quality of Supervision

86.     The ICR team rates the quality of supervision as Satisfactory. Generally there were
two supervision missions annually conducted in conjunction with design and supervision of
PRSC/SAC operations ensuring consistency in the policy dialogue and the messages
delivered to the GOA at the macro and micro levels. Project implementation was monitored
regularly by the Bank during and between missions. The Bank team was diligent in its
communication with GOA and Bank management, providing up-to-date information and
analysis on the status and impact of project activities, issues encountered, and options as to
how best to address issues that arose as a result of evolving circumstances. The team
developed a strong relationship with the institutions involved and all the institutions
contacted during the ICR mission recognized that the team was proactive in identifying and
jointly agreeing with the government on ways forward. The team provided effective support
during implementation. The skills mix was appropriate, comprising HQ-based and Armenia-
base staff. The continuity of the TTL played an important role in ensuring strong
communication and building a relationship with authorities, which was based on trust and
respect. The team coordinated well with development partners active in the health sector
such as WHO and USAID to ensure optimization of resources. Project supervision promoted
strong coordination arrangements among all the government agencies participating in the
Project, as well as international partners, with the Bank taking the lead in providing effective
and strong leadership to ensure consistent policy messages, not only in the areas supported
by the Project by in overall health policy. Other positive points of supervision included:

         The focus on the PDO and systematic reporting on indicators in Aide Memoires are
         exemplary.
         The overall focus on macro and micro issues, combined with analytical work
         conducted by the Bank and under the project as well as close monitoring of targets,
         helped ensure that the sector performance continued to improve.
         Missions were particularly effective in reviewing overall sector development in
         conjunction with Project specific progress. Aide Memoires comprised good analysis
         of overall health policy issues and recommendations in addition to the review of the
         Project's implementation progress.
         The team promoted a culture of regular contacts with counterparts to help resolve
         issues and/or address client requests and needs during and between missions.
         Missions coordinated well with development partners to ensure complementarity
         rather than duplicative efforts (WHO and USAID).
         Financial management and procurement guidance was systematic and timely.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

87.      Overall Bank performance is rated Satisfactory on the basis of:

         The Bank's role in ensuring quality at entry as described in Section 5.1 (a);




                                              24
         Sound supervision throughout the implementation period, including the team's
         proactivity in identifying issues and effective ways to help resolve complex issues
         together with the Government; and
         Commendable efforts in ensuring continuity of Bank support to the health sector in
         general both at the macro and micro levels.

5.2      Borrower Performance

(a)      Government Performance

88.     Government's performance during project preparation and implementation was
Satisfactory. Prior to Project approval, GOA had developed several key strategic documents
such as the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the Poverty Reduction
Strategy that contained reform and development measures that were in line with the Project
design. In addition, GOA: (i) had adopted resolutions that provided legal basis for hospital
optimization, (ii) had established a high level Project Coordination Board chaired by the
Minister of Health that included representatives from the key ministerial departments,
Yerevan municipality, and SHA, and (iii) agreed to finance the incremental recurrent costs of
the investments supported by the Project.

89.     In addition, prior to the Project, the Government had introduced key pieces of
legislation to create an enabling environment and to establish platforms for systemic,
comprehensive, and multi-faceted health reforms to reduce inefficiencies, enhance equity and
access (financial and geographic), and improve quality. The scope and content of family
medicine services have been articulated in law and defined in detail in the State Guaranteed
Basic Benefits Package. During the implementation period, the GOA has taken steps to
update legislation on the basis of evolving needs. Despite financial constraints, its
commitment to further develop the health sector has continued. Equally, prior to project
approval the GOA approved a time-bound action plan to improve financial management and
accounting in public hospitals, and in 2004 prepared and adopted an action plan to improve
governance arrangements that was based on four pillars: (i) introduction of hospital
supervisory committees; (ii) improved SHA contracting; (iii) reporting arrangements for
public and private hospitals; and (iv) strengthened regulatory functions of the MOH for
public and private hospitals.

90.    In general, the Project benefited from strong support and active interest of the GOA
throughout its implementation. Despite the financial crisis of 2008-09 with subsequent
decrease in GDP in 2009, the health budget was kept flat, doing better than other sectors.

(b)      Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

91.     The performance of the MOH is rated Satisfactory. The MOH moved decisively to
establish working groups to collaborate in the various areas addressed by the Project,
including: (i) licensing and accreditation, (ii) legislation, (iii) NHA, and (iv) purchasing
function of the SHA. In general, MOH's commitment to health reform has been strong.
Prior to project approval, MOH recognized the need to strengthen its stewardship role in


                                           25
policy setting and monitoring and oversight function. MOH management was effective in
helping resolve complex issues that arose during hospital optimization and has coordinated
well with other agencies participating in the Project such as SHA, NIH, hospital management,
SMU, SMC, and marz authorities.

92.    The commitment of the MOH to the Project extended to the end of Project
implementation. As noted earlier, the Minister changed only once during project
implementation. The core staff at the MOH remained unchanged in spite of civil service
reforms implemented in the country during project implementation. Stability in the
leadership of the Ministry played an effective role in overall project oversight. The MOH's
management and staff participated actively in ICR discussions and the MOH prepared a solid
contribution to the ICR (Annex 7).

93.     The general good performance of the Project reflects the strong coordination
among all related institutions assisted by strong efforts from the PIU. The effective role
played by the PIU and its strong leadership in supporting the reform was crucial to ensure
effective implementation of the Project. Overall coordination, as well as procurement,
financial management, and M&E worked well. The PIU was successful in building and
maintaining productive relationships at all levels of the health system. It worked effectively
to help achieve the PDOs and in facilitating the full participation of a number of institutions
implementing various parts of the Project. As indicated earlier, project management and
coordination was consistently rated Highly Satisfactory. As noted earlier, in the view of this
evaluation, the PIU would rate well above many of other PIUs in the ECA and other regions.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

94.     The key reasons include: (i) overall commitment to the objectives of the Project
and overall health reform agenda at the central and marz' levels; (ii) adequate allocation
of counterpart budgets for civil works; (iii) compliance with fiduciary requirements; and
(iv) effective administration and coordination of project activities.

6.       Lessons Learned

95.      Lessons learned can be categorized into the following major headings:

Government ownership and capacity development

       Institutionalization of important activities such as NHAs and HSPAs can be
       achieved with strong commitment from relevant staff and management who
       understand the benefits for decision making derived from the reports.
       Complex reforms require holistic and well sequenced approaches. The Program
       has been able to achieve success because reforms spanned key areas of the health
       care system, including stewardship functions of MOH, to financing reforms, to the
       way that care is delivered including changing the balance between the different
       levels of the system.



                                            26
         The health strategy in Armenia gives evidence of a balanced choice between visible
         results in terms of rehabilitation/construction and service delivery on the one side
         and the development of a policy framework and medium-term planning on the other
         side.

Coordination

       Close coordination with development partners was critical.              Close
       coordination and collaboration with USAID and WHO in supporting
       implementation aspects of the program helped keep key activities on track and
       ensured complementarity of interventions.

Implementation guidance by the Bank

         Providing continuous guidance and actively engaging in the overall policy dialogue
         in the sector was crucial to ensure consistency of the messages being delivered to
         the Government. Bank supervision must be continuous and intensive. Adequate
         supervision resources must be allocated. The continuity of the Bank's TTL played an
         important role in guiding project implementation as did the fact that the TTL was
         based in Armenia.
         Close coordination between supervision of macro and micro issues is key. Health
         reforms supported by the Project and the health aspects of the PRSC/SAC operations
         were supervised closely by the same health team ensuring that the policy dialogue
         with central and regional authorities was consistent and linked to the overall macro
         level dialogue between the Bank and the GOA.

Other issues

         Resources for investments should be accompanied by adequate resources for
         maintenance. Resources for maintenance should be made available at the hospital
         level to enable maintenance/repair of assets to ensure sustainability of investments. A
         system of routine maintenance with adequate resources would be highly cost-
         effective.
         Selection of a limited number of marzes and using the experience with optimization
         of these two as the vehicle to test measures was the right instrument to support and
         expand hospital optimization in the remaining marzes.
         Criteria for utilization of grants should be realistic. Criteria and eligibility should
         be revisited during implementation and adapt with experience.

7.       Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)      Borrower/implementing agencies

96.    Authorities contacted by the ICR mission commented positively on the role the
Project has played in helping to promote hospital optimization and expansion of family
medicine in the country. The GOA reviewed the draft ICR and provided useful comments,


                                             27
which were incorporated into the final report. Activities under the Project are regularly
highlighted by the country's leadership. Both APL 1 and APL 2 are showcased by GOA, the
national TV, and the press. During the ICR mission, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
of Territorial Affairs commented positively about the achievements of the Project and the
role the Bank has played in the development of the sector.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      As noted in the main text (Section 3.3), the project activities resulted in significant
efficiency gains particularly as a result of a strengthened primary health care sector and
reductions in hospital capacity and related improvements in performance indicators. The
activities undertaken as part of the two major components represented a major step in the
progression away from the previous soviet service delivery model and towards the current
European and international norm, with their emphasis on a strong primary health care model
and a streamlined hospital sector. While these reforms should also result in improved health
outcomes, a more efficient health sector is a key motivation for their implementation. This
annex provides an estimate of these economic benefits with reference to the original Project
Appraisal Document.

2.     The PAD enumerates both direct and indirect benefits arising from the primary health
care and hospital sub-components. The same framework is used as a departure point in the
updated analysis, but bases its estimates on the related performance indicators instead of
previous parameter assumptions. Table 1 summarizes the main benefits.

                            Table 1 ­ Summary of Main Benefits

3.       The results of the cost-benefit analysis are as shown in Table 2. The alternative
parameters for time horizon (10 and 20 years) and discount rate (5 and 10%) are chosen to
facilitate comparison with the original analysis. Indirect benefits are excluded due to the
difficulty of estimating these gains, and thus the figures provide a conservative estimate of
overall benefits.

4.     The PAD assigned the major share of anticipated project benefits to the primary care
component, but the strong performance with respect to reductions in ALOS and increased in
bed occupancy at hospitals as well as the estimated impact of a more effective SHA through
the institutional development component activities also yielded large efficiency gains,
leading to a more balanced outcome across the activities. Overall, the analysis indicates
somewhat larger benefits than those estimated at the time of appraisal (the figures use the
"base case" from the PAD).

                            Table 2 ­ Cost Benefit Analysis

                                         PAD (2004)                    ICR (2010)

rate


5.      A full fiscal impact is not undertaken here. The operations and maintenance costs
associated with five merged and/or renovated hospitals do not impose a major fiscal burden,
and while the PAD based its assumptions on the ratio of government health spending to GDP
rising from 1.7% in 2004 to 2.5% by 2015, in reality this ratio remains relatively low at 1.7%
in 2010 due to the unusual macroeconomic developments during the project's lifespan (very
high growth followed by the global crisis). As a result, the fiscal burden associated with
Armenia's health sector is one of the smallest among any middle income country.

1.     DESCRIPTION AND PROJECT START UP

1.       The HSMP was the first of a two-phase Adaptable Program Lending projects to be
implemented over a period of about eight years. The rationale behind the HSMP was to
support the reform of the health sector in three main areas: (i) development of PHC, (ii)
hospital optimization and modernization, and (iii) strengthening of the government's
institutional capacity. The APL1 (Credit 3920 and PHRD Grant 53436 TF) started in
December 2004 and closed in June 2010.

1.1.   Historical Context

2.       Armenia faced enormous difficulties after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This led
to crisis in the social sphere, including that of the health care system. Since independence,
the health care system in Armenia had undergone numerous changes that transformed a
centrally run state system into a fragmented health care system that was largely financed
from out-of-pocket payments. The elderly and unemployed populations had limited access to
health care services. This often resulted in the most vulnerable groups postponing access to
services and therefore to late referrals to health care providers. Inequalities in the utilization
of essential health care service remained strong. In 2004 17.9 percent of the sick and injured
sough health care equaling to 17.9% in quintile 1 (poorest 20% of the population) in contrast
to 44.1% in quintile 5 (richest 20% of population). The services that were available were
often of questionable quality, as health care standards and quality assurance systems were
absent. Medicines were generally not affordable to those in need. Many health care
facilities, especially in regions, had inadequate infrastructure and were short of modern
medical technology and equipment. Despite significant investments in primary care, a
disproportionate share of resources continued to flow into secondary and tertiary care.

3.     The main issues in the health sector of Armenia since independence were the
following: (i) low access and use of health services; (ii) under-funded healthcare system with
poorly and inequitably used resources; (iii) high out-of-pocket informal payments; (iv) low
perceived quality of care especially in regions; (v) excess capacity of physical infrastructure
of hospitals and polyclinics; and (vi) relatively high number of narrow specialists and
geographic mal-distribution of the health workforce between Yerevan and the regions, etc.

4.      In summary, main health sector issues were how to: (i) ensure equitable access to
essential health services on a sustainable basis; (ii) manage public health threats and prevent
avoidable mortality; and (iii) reduce substantial overcapacity in the hospital sector while
improving the role and quality of PHC and strengthen the key functions of the State in the
sector, particularly in the areas of governance and quality assurance.

5.     The reform process initiated in the mid-1990s aimed at enhancing efficiency and
ensuring accessibility and quality of essential health services, particularly for vulnerable
groups. The reform focused on three main areas: (i) strengthen PHC, (ii) separate the
provider from the financing function with accompanying improvement in provider payment



                                             42
methods, and (iii) initiate optimization of the extensive health services network and improve
health system governance.

1.2.   Project objectives

6.       The goal of the whole Program was to improve the organization of the health care
system in order to provide more accessible, quality and sustainable health care services to the
population, in particular to the most vulnerable groups, and better manage public health
threats.

7.      The APL 1 aimed to support implementation of the Government's health care reform
program in the areas of PHC, hospital network optimization and modernization and policy
making, planning, regulation and management of the health sector. Specifically, its
objectives were to: (i) expand access to quality primary health care (PHC); (ii) improve the
quality and efficiency of selected hospital networks; and (iii) lay groundwork for effective
health sector policy making and monitoring. The objectives remained valid throughout
project implementation and were not revised.

1.3.   Project Components

8.    The Project original components were the following: (A) Family Medicine
Development; (B) Hospital Network Optimization and Modernization; (C) Strengthening
Government Capacity to develop and monitor effective health sector policies, and (D) Project
Management.

        Component A: Family Medicine Development. The component was designed to
support: (i) strengthening of institutional capacity to train well qualified family doctors (FD)
and family nurses (FN) using internationally peer reviewed curriculum; (ii) provide support
to retrain 980 FD and 980 FN; (iii) improve the PHC infrastructure, and (iv) further
development of family medicine (FM) relevant guidelines. The project also helped to
strengthen communities' participation in addressing local health issues through a small grant
program. The component financed: (i) renovation and equipment of academic and clinical
training facilities; (ii) training the trainers (TOT); (iii) technical assistance of curriculum
evaluation and improvement; (iv) stipends for the staff to be retrained as FD and FN; (v)
development and publication of FM practice guidelines; (vi) medical equipment and supplies
for PHC teams; (vii) rehabilitation of PHC infrastructure in 20 communities; and (viii)
vehicles for PHC in remote communities.

        Component B: Hospital Network Optimization and Modernization. The
component was designed to support the development and implementation of strategic
restructuring plans for selected hospital network organizations (in Yerevan and in regions),
which included: (i) consolidation of infrastructure and services; (ii) modernization of
management structures and improving management capacity; (iii) introducing quality
assurance systems; and (iv) improving management of health care waste. The component
financed: (i) relocation of services due to internal reorganization of hospital networks; (ii)
medical equipment for hospitals; (iii) technical assistance for managerial functions and



                                            43
quality assurance; (iv) IT equipment for basic financial management systems; (v) training
and supplies for health care waste management; and (vi) technical assistance to update
regional health services master plans.

        Component C: Strengthening Government capacity to develop and monitor
effective health sector policies. The component was designed to strengthen capacity of the
MOH and its key agencies to perform its major functions of policy development and
implementation monitoring, regulation, and oversight of the health sector. The project was
to: (i) build capacity for evaluation of health sector performance by developing core
monitoring instruments that were needed to inform decision makers (Health Sector
Performance Assessment Report ­ HSPA report, National Health Accounts - NHA); (ii)
strengthen the legal and regulatory environment, as well as institutional capacity contributing
to improved supervision, accountability and management of public hospitals; (iii) improve
public expenditure management in the health sector; and (iv) improve surveillance of
HIV/AIDS and other public health threats by complementing the activities supported by the
Global Fund. The Project financed: (i) technical assistance and training; (ii) publication of
policy reports; (iii) special studies and surveys; (iv) IT and office equipment; and (v)
laboratory equipment.

        Component D: Project Management. This component provided for a Health
Project Implementation Unit (HPIU) to assure overall project management and coordination.
The HPIU was to: (i) plan and coordinate implementation of project activities; (ii) ensure that
resources were utilized in accordance with implementation plans; (iii) manage procurement,
contracting and disbursements; (iv) maintain financial accounts and records; and (v) monitor
project progress and impact and report to the project Steering Committee, the MOH and the
WB. The PIU also coordinated and supported the work of technical working groups (WG)
which were established under most project sub-components.

Revised Components

9.      There was no restructuring of Component A during project implementation. Some
revisions/corrections were made to components B and C. Significant changes were the
following:

        Sub-components B.4. (Merger of "Kanaker-Zeytun" Medical Centre). Merger
B.4 did not proceed as originally planned. Optimization activities did not take place as the
parties were not able to reach an agreement. Two of the facilities, the Institute of Cardiology
and Polyclinic No. 11 obtained independent status and independent contracts. The
Government reallocated the funds for this merger mainly to support marz hospitals
optimization plans.

        Sub-component C.4. (develop a monitoring and evaluation system for national
HIV/AIDS strategy). During the Bank mission of 2005 it was agreed to fold the HIV/AIDS
monitoring and evaluation system within the overall framework of the public health
surveillance system.

2.     PROJECT DESIGH, IMPLEMETATION AND IMPACT

2.1.   Assessment of Project Design

10.     The HSMP was adequately designed to meet the Government's reform priorities.
The objectives of the HSMP were crucial as they were consistent with the ongoing health
reforms being carried out in Republic of Armenia. All its objectives were in full compliance
with the strategy of global reforms of the health care system of Armenia. Being an integral
part of these reforms and with financing to support the reforms, the project was to play a
central role.

11.    The project was also consistent with the objectives of the 2004 Country Assistant
Strategy, which focused on promoting private sector led economic growth; making growth
more pro-poor; and reducing non-income poverty through better health, education and basic
services. The project objectives were directly linked to the CAS third objective.

2.2.  Main results achieved for each project development objectives (i.e., key
performance indicators) and component

12.    The project mainly has met its development objective as demonstrated by
achievement of most outcome indicators (see Annex 1).

Objective 1 - Expand access to quality primary health care

13.     The Project has contributed to the successful implementation of the PHC strategy,
approved by the GOA in 1997. Armenia has made significant efforts focusing on the
establishment of FM based PHC. The project has led to notable achievements in: (i) the FM
retraining of doctors and nurses, (ii) improvement of PHC facilities infrastructure, (iii)
provision of medical equipment, (iv) provision of autonomy and independent decision
making for PHC practices (in particular in rural areas), and (v) improved access of the
population to PHC services.

14.     There was a significant progress with regard to performance indicator measuring
Objective 1 - expanding access to quality PHC services. By the end of the sixth year of
implementation, 85% of the Armenian population was covered by qualified family medicine
practices, exceeding the 60% target for APL1 and almost reaching the end of APL 2 target of
90%.

15.     As of June 2010, 1182 physicians completed the FM retraining, while 144 physicians
are currently being retrained with completion in October 2010 (88 FDs) and in February
2011 (56 FDs). Previously, 221 family physicians had been retrained within the frame of the
first Bank-supported project. The population being served by retrained rural and urban FDs
comprises about 31% and 54% of the Armenian population, respectively.




                                          45
Objective 2 - Improve quality and effectiveness of selected hospital networks

16.     There has been considerable progress with regard to achieving Objective 2 ­
improving quality and effectiveness of selected hospital networks. Three of the four hospital
networks (Merger B1 - Merger of Mkhitar Heratci Yerevan State Medical University
Hospitals, Merger B2 - Surb Grigor Lusavorich Medical Center, Merger B3 - Saint Marie
Medical Center) in Yerevan and two medical centers (Hrazdan and Ijevan MC) in marzes had
been selected for project implementation. The consolidation activities in hospitals mergers
lead to substantial bed reductions along with the elimination of duplication and overlap in
administration and maintenance, diagnostic capacity, and clinical departments. According to
baseline data of 2003 and data of 2004-2009 from newly created hospital networks, there has
been improvement in service utilization, efficiency and productivity indicators compared to
previous years against the project targets. In particular, there has been considerable
improvement in terms of reduction in Average Length of Stay (ALOS) and increase in total
admissions, admission per physician, and annual bed occupancy rate. The total number of
out-patient visits in the merger and their proportion in the total hospital admissions
considerably increased. Free access to PHC services was introduced for all Armenians in
January 2006.

17.    In 2009, the bed occupancy rate in merger B.1 increased to 65% as compared to 41%
in 2004 and 37% in 2003. At the same time, the ALOS in merger B.1 decreased from 9.9 in
2003 to 8.6 in 2007 and to 8.0 in 2009. Full Time Equivalent (FTE) per 1000 bed-days
decreased from 10.8 in 2003 to 9.4 in 2009. It represented 13% improvement compared to
the 2003 baseline.

18.     In 2009, the bed occupancy rate in Merger B.2 increased to 88% as compared to 54%
at the baseline. At the same time, the ALOS in merger B.2 decreased from 10.8 in 2004 to
8.1 in 2007 and to 7.0 in 2009. FTE per 1000 bed-days decreased from 16.6 in 2003 to 9.2 in
2009. It represents 45% improvement compared to the 2003 baseline. In 2009, the bed
occupancy rate in Merger B.3 increased to 70% in 2009 in comparison to 61% in 2007 and to
53% at the baseline. The ALOS in merger B.2 decreased from 10.6 in 2004 to 7.9 in 2007
and to 7.7 in 2009. FTE per 1000 bed-days fell from 14.7 in 2003 to 10.0 in 2009, i.e. an
improvement of 32%.

Objective 3 - Lay the groundwork for effective health sector policy making and
monitoring

19.    There has been some progress towards achieving Objective 3 ­ establishing capacity
for health policy making and monitoring. All public hospitals use updated financial
management and accounting procedures and these procedures are regulated by law. Core
instruments for health sector policy development and decision making were developed.
HSPA reports for 2006 and 2008 have been developed, published and distributed. Annual
NHA reports for 2004-2008 were developed and the reports for 2006 and 2008 were
published and distributed among key stakeholders.
20.    Hospital Supervisory Committees have been formally established in all marz
hospitals with clearly defined roles and responsibilities and appropriate staffing as described


                                            46
in Governmental Decree N-1187-N "On formation of and regulation of activities of
Supervisory Committees of Joint Stock Companies with 50 and more percent of State Shares"
of May 19, 2005. The main functions attributed to the Supervisory Committees in this
decree are: (i) carry out the supervision related to financial and economic activities; (ii)
review the results of the annual financial performance of the company and inspect the
financial activities of the company; (iii) check if decrees of governance bodies of the
company and documents of the company correspond to the ones of the country, and (iv) meet
the requirements of other legal acts and charter of the company. However, the main issue of
concern with regard to the Supervisory Committees development and their functions is that
their full spectrum of activities is not yet defined and their financial remuneration is the
exclusive responsibility of hospitals with scarce financial resources. No further progress has
been observed in the implementation of activities on improving governance arrangements of
public hospitals, as described in the Government action plan.
21.    No progress has been made either in conducting independent audits of public
hospitals for the 2006-2009, as funds were not allocated by the Government to the public
hospitals to conduct audits due to constraints with the State budget.

Outputs by components

        Component A - Family Medicine Development. The transition phase of moving
the PHC system from the previous ambulatory-polyclinic system to FM practice was
successfully continued and almost completed with support from the project. In particular,
special emphasis was put on the retraining of practicing PHC providers in FM.

        Sub-component 1 - Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Training of
Family Doctors and Family Medicine Nurses. The institutional capacity for FD and FN
training and re-training was strengthen with support of the project. As a result of the Project,
the training centers in Yerevan and marzes have qualified trainers, adequate infrastructure,
required medical equipment, and relevant training materials (skill labs, learning materials and
medical literature).

         Training centers. In 2006, training centers in Shirak, Lori and Syunik marzes were
renovated and equipped with training furniture, medical equipment, medical supplies and IT
equipment. Family nursing chairs were established in Shirak, Lori, and Syunik marzes
nursing colleges. The State Medical University (SMU), the National Institute of Health
(NIH), and the Basic Medical College (BMC) family medicine and family nursing chairs
were provided with training furniture, IT equipment, and vehicles. In 2007 training
institutions and training centers (NIH, SMU and BMC FM and FN chairs, Gumri, Vanadzor,
Kapan nursing medical colleges) were provided with six sets of skill labs. In 2005 the
Yerevan Municipality proposed to the MoH to establish a second FM clinical training centre
in the facility vacated after the projected consolidation of OB/GYN services in the maternity
hospital of "Surb Grigor Lusavorich" merger. Starting from 2007 and during 2008-2009, the
performance indicators of maternity services improved by more than twice, including the
numbers of deliveries, surgeries and bed occupancy rate, based on which the MC
administration submitted a proposal to the Government requesting to return the one and a
half floors allocated to the training centre to the hospital for the purpose of enrollment of


                                            47
additional obstetrical capacity. In response to that proposal the space in question was
returned to the "Surb Grigor Lusavorich" MC by Government Decree No. 1333 dated Nov
20, 2008 cancelling former Decree No. 1132 of June, 2006.

        Training of family physicians and family nurses' trainers. Training of FD and FN
trainers was organized with the support of the Project. Two-month "Training of Family
Physicians Training" and one-month "Training of Family Nurses Training" courses were
developed with the assistance of the FM/FN chairs. In 2005-2006, sixty FD and thirty FN
from all marzes and Yerevan, completed TOT course and were recognized correspondingly
as FD and FN trainers.

        Guideline development were developed with Armenian professionals in 2005-06 for
standardization of the work of newly retrained physicians, FD practical guidelines for
screening, diagnostic procedures, and different disease management algorithms. In total, 18
new guidelines (4 volumes ­ 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th) for FD were developed with the
"Armenian Association of Family Physicians". Two thousand one hundred (2100) copies
were issued and distributed to health professionals of FM departments of the SMU and the
NIH, training centers in marzes, 86 polyclinics of Yerevan and marzes, 41 health centers and
211 ambulatories of Yerevan and marzes. In addition, 127 guidelines (13 volumes)
developed under the first health project were revised, updated, re-published (2100 copies )
and distributed to PHC facilities in Yerevan and marzes.

        Subcomponent A2 - Re-training and Residency Training of Family Doctors and
Family Nurses . The FD re-training is based on the Unified Family Medicine curriculum
(RA Minister of Health Order No. 613, of 2003) that includes 8 months academic education
and 4 months practical/clinical training. The FN re-training is based on the Unified Family
Nursing curriculum (RA Minister of Health Order No. 1254 of 2006) that includes 5 months
academic education and 1 month practical/clinical training. The FD retraining process was
organized by modules grouped in four major blocks combined with practical training on
trainees own working places and/or marz practical training sites. Academic training for
physicians was carried out in the NIH and the Yerevan SMU; and for nurses in the NIH and
the BMC. Practical/clinical training was provided in training and family medicine centers in
Yerevan, Shirak, Lori and Syunik marzes. Trainees (physicians and nurses) selected were
working as district therapeutists, district pediatricians, narrow specialists, and nurses
employed by urban polyclinics, rural ambulatories, and health centers.

22.     With support from the Project, 1082 family physicians completed the retraining
program for FD. The breakdown is the following: (i) 288 physicians from rural
ambulatories and health centers, (ii) 353 physicians from marz urban polyclinics, and (iii)
441 physicians from Yerevan polyclinics. The distribution of retrained physicians by marzes
was as follows: (i) 95 (8.8%) from Kotayk, (ii) 84 (7.8%) from Shirak, (iii) 104 (9.6%) from
Armavir, (iv) 42 (3.9%) from Aragatsotn, (v) 102 (9.4%) from Ararat, (vi) 38 (3.5%) from
Lori, (vii) 57 (5.3%) from Tavush, (viii) 69 (6.4%) from Gegharkunik, (ix) 37 (3.4%) from
Syunik, (x) 13 (1.2%) from Vayots dzor marzes, and (xi) 441 (40.8%) from Yerevan.




                                          48
23.    With support from the Project, 988 family nurses completed the retraining program
for FN. The distribution of retrained nurses by marzes was as follows: (i) 87 (8.8%) from
Kotayk, (ii) 90 (9.1%) from Shirak, (iii) 96 (9.7%) from Armavir, (iv) 44 (4.5%) from
Aragatsotn, (v) 92 (9.3%) from Ararat, (vi) 56 (5.7%) from Lori, (vii) 64 (6.5%) from
Tavush, (viii) 62 (6.3%) from Gegharkunik, (ix) 58 (5.9%) from Syunik, (x) 19 (1.9%) from
Vayots dzor marzes, and (xi) 320 (32.4%) from Yerevan.

24.    The retraining process has been regularly internally evaluated by the HPIU and
externally by periodic consultancy visits of foreign experts. The assessment of knowledge
acquired is done as follows: (i) there are three MCQ tests during the training - one at the
beginning in the first week of the training, one in the middle, and the final one. Adequate
and detailed analyses of the training have been done, which show a significant knowledge
improvement throughout the training period. It is consistent in all cohorts as well as within
all modules. Physicians' and nurses re-training were highly effective in improving
physicians' knowledge and skills.

25.     In 2006 and 2009, two independent evaluations of FD and FN retraining courses and
curriculum were carried out by international consultants. The consultants were of the
opinion that Armenia and the HSMP achieved great success in the quantity and quality of the
retraining. The training was successful in terms of numbers, quality of education, practice of
skills acquired, facilities, overall satisfaction and evaluation results. The satisfaction of
retrained practicing physicians and other trainees was generally very high. Retraining
programs are well designed and have all elements of a good program for retraining and
evaluation. They mentioned that the quality of teaching was very good with good
combination of practical and theoretical teaching. Training facilities are in place and
adequately equipped to provide a solid base for teaching.

        Sub-component A3: Strengthening PHC Infrastructure. The Project was built on
the successful Health Project I experience, aiming to improve access to PHC services in rural
areas. As a result of the 20 micro-projects financed by the first project, PHC infrastructure was
improved in 20 selected rural communities. The project rehabilitated rural ambulatories/health
centers in fifteen communities and constructed rural ambulatories/health centers in five
communities. The community ambulatories had very poor physical conditions and had no
appropriate medical equipment although they were serving a large number of the population.
Community meetings and promotion activities were organized in twenty beneficiary
communities of Aragatsotn, Armavir, Ararat, Kotayk, Tavush, and Gegharkunik marzes.
Facility management boards, including representatives from Marz health department, PHC
team, community and head of the hamaynk (local community) were established to conduct
community health needs' assessments, submit proposals and business plans, and oversee the
implementation of the program at the local level. Civil works for renovation and new
construction started in 2006 and were completed in 2007. The communities contributed 5
percent of the cost of the rehabilitation and/or construction costs. In 2006, twenty beneficiary
PHC facilities included in the project were provided with vehicles. In addition, in 2005-2009,
the Project supported investments in basic medical equipment, supplies, medical furniture,
and IT equipment for 200 PHC facilities in rural areas.




                                             49
26.     In addition, the Project provided grants to communities to undertake initiatives to
strengthen the community role about local health care issues. In 2005, promotion and
information campaigns were organized with all communities targeted by the Bank's supported
first health project on their possible inclusion in the small grants program and on how to
present proposals. Four final proposals presented by PHC facilities were selected according to
the Small Grants Operational manual and contracts were signed for implementation. Local
heating systems were installed in the four rural ambulatories with assistance of the small
grants. The new and renovated PHC facilities (ambulatories and health centers) staffed with
trained FD and FN, adequately equipped with medical equipment, supplies, and furniture
have demonstrated the potential for increasing quality, effectiveness and accessibility of PHC
services.

Other activities

27.     International technical assistance in environmental issues related to civil works in the
health care sector was provided. Establishment of independent family physicians group and
solo practices was approved by the Government Decree No. 497-N, dated April 19, 2007.
According to the Government decree, family physicians group practices can be implemented
only after establishing a legal entity and receiving an appropriate license for providing PHC
services. A working group (WG) was established to support the introduction of FM
independent group practices. The WG with assistance of the USAID-funded PHCR project
developed a manual, describing in detail how to create legally independent practices and how
to apply to MoH for receiving a license and state order.

        Component B - Implementing Hospital Network Optimization and
Modernization Plans. This component supported internal optimization of selected newly
established hospital networks in Yerevan and in Kotayk and Tavush marzes. This was
achieved through supporting the costs of: (i) re-location of services, (ii) provision of essential
bio-medical equipment (for radiology and functional diagnostics departments, intensive care,
operating theatres and central sterilization department), (iii) IT equipment for clinical and
non-clinical departments, (iv) training and supplies for management of medical waste, and
(v) development of improved management systems and functions of project hospitals,
including in-hospital quality assurance system, development of a health care waste
management (HCWM) plan, and relevant training on HCWM for hospital staff.

28.     On November 21, 2003, the Government adopted a decree that consolidated twenty
four public hospitals and thirteen outpatient health care facilities into ten networks in
Yerevan. Four out of the ten merger organizations created, namely the Mhkitar Heratsi State
Medical University Hospitals, Surb Grigor Lusavorich, Saint Marie and Kanaker Zeytun
Medical Centers of Yerevan, which are multi-profile hospital organizations were initially
selected for implementation under sub-components B1-B4 of the project.

       Sub-component B1-B4 - In the Merger of Mkhitar Heraci Yerevan State Medical
University Hospitals, the Project supported the internal optimization plan of the three
university hospitals: (i) Hospital No.1 (previously adult hospital No. 1), (ii) hospital No.2
(previously Hayk Medical Center), and hospital No. 3 (previously pediatric hospital No.1).



                                             50
The tripartite agreement for this merger was signed on May 22, 2005 between the University
Rector, MoH, and the Ministry of Science and Education, based on the original proposal on
re-location of adult hospital services from hospital No. 1 and concentration of all medical
services (adult and pediatric) in hospital No. 2, and of all surgical services (adult and
pediatric) in hospital No. 3. In 2005 and 2006, the university hospitals administrations
proposed changes in the tri-partite agreement and amendments were made to reflect them
based on the no-objection received from the WB. According to the final agreement signed
on August 8, 2006, the Medical University had to cover all the rehabilitation instead of the
initially agreed 50%. Accordingly, relevant credit funds totaling US$560,000 for civil works
were reallocated for purchasing of additional medical equipment for university hospitals. All
activities envisioned on the scope of the Project, including provision of equipment and
technical assistance activities were successfully completed.

29.     The Surb Grigor Lusavorich Medical Center consisted of a multi-profile hospital
(formerly Emergency Scientific-Medical Centre), maternity hospital (formerly maternity No.
4), children's hospital (formerly neurology hospital No. 6), adults and two polyclinics
(formerly No. 14 and 5). At the start of the Project, there was disagreement on the issue of
suggested transfer of maternity services into multi-profile hospital. In 2005, the Yerevan
Municipality and the MoH discussed a new proposal on options for the use of the maternity
hospital space with the purpose of keeping the building within the merger. The proposal was
discussed with the WB in Yerevan in November 2005. It was agreed to consolidate services
on 2 and a half floors of the building, allocating one and a half floors to the second FM
training center to be established within the component and empting one floor (the third floor).

30.     The tri-partied agreement for this merger was signed on December 16, 2005. All
activities envisioned on the scope of the Project, including architectural design and
renovation of the maternity hospital, construction of a new boiler unit for heating of hospital
and polyclinic buildings, provision of medical and IT equipment and technical assistance
activities were successfully completed. Pediatric services were re-located to the multi-profile
hospital building 4th floor by financial means of the hospital. Thus the children's
neurological hospital No. 6 building was vacated (5782 sq. meters) and returned to the
municipality.

31.    The sole deviation from the tri-partite agreement was the space of the maternity
hospital initially allocated to the FM training centre that (see above under the report on
component A activities of the project) was returned to the MC by the Government based on
increased activity indicators of maternity services, including the numbers of deliveries,
surgeries and bed occupancy levels during past years. At the same time, the third floor of the
maternity, which was initially subject to vacation and renting out has been renovated at the
expense of the MC funds and currently used for high-risk pregnancies services and the
pharmacy department, while the second floor is still vacant. The plan of the hospital
administration is to do minor reconstruction on the second floor for transfer of the above
departments and use the third floor for expansion of obstetrics and delivery services
(currently located on the fourth floor) of the maternity hospital.




                                            51
32.    The Saint Marie Medical Centre consisted of two multi-profile hospitals (formerly
Children's Emergency Hospital and hospital No. 6), a maternity hospital (formerly "Saint
Marie" maternity), and two polyclinics (formerly polyclinics No.18 and No. 9).

33.     A tri-partite agreement was signed by the parties on April 9, 2005. All activities
envisioned under the Project, including: (i) architectural design and renovation of civil works
in multi-profile hospital related to re-location of services from hospital No. 6, and in (ii)
maternity hospital related to consolidation of obstetrics and gynecology services, provision of
medical and IT equipment and technical assistance activities were successfully completed.
Adult polyclinic of former medical union No. 6 was transferred to children's polyclinic
building at the expense of the MC own funds, and the adult hospital services (adult general
surgery, adult internal medicine and neurology) of the medical union No. 6 have been
transferred to the 8th and 9th floors of the Saint Marie MC multi-profile hospital building
(former pediatric hospital) with funding from the Project, resulting in a saving of space of
9795 sq. meters.

34.     Patient and physicians/nurses satisfaction surveys were carried out in pilot hospitals
networks in Yerevan. In total, 1420 physicians/nurses and 2054 patients participated in the
surveys from Yerevan pilot hospitals. In general, physicians/nurses satisfied (fully or
partially) with number of patients, good working relations, adequate coordination of hospitals
different departments, adequate working conditions and medical equipment, etc. Around
85% of patients were satisfied with the quality of health care services.

35.    Kanaker-Zeytun Medical Center was dropped out of the Project and no activities
were implemented. Following the signing of the credit agreement, the "Kanaker-Zeytun"
hospital merger was unbundled by the Government Resolutions No. 67A of 20.01.2005 and
No. 1323 A of 11.08.2005, according to which the Cardiology Scientific MC and later
Polyclinic No. 11, were taken out of the merger structure having obtained independent status
and independent contracts. Upon the agreement of the issue between the WB and the
Government, the funds under this sub-component were re-allocated mainly to support the
marz hospital optimization plans.

        Sub-component B5 - Support to regional hospital optimization programs. This
component supported regional initiatives to optimize and modernize hospital capacity. The
sub-component provided support for the development of regional (marz) optimization master
plans following upon the first optimization round in 2001. It also financed modernization of
the two marz hospital networks. The activities implemented under the sub-component were
the following:


       Local technical assistance on development of health system optimization plans for the
       10 marzes and international consultancy to review and conduct an economic analysis
       of the proposed plans in 2005-2007. The plans contained the description of the
       current situation of the health care system in terms of the number, profile, and
       distribution of the facilities and staffing, reports on the progress made with the
       implementation of the previous optimization program, and proposals for further



                                            52
       optimization through hospital/polyclinic mergers, desegregations of ambulatories
       from polyclinics and reduction in the number of beds. On November 2, 2006, the
       Government approved the master-plans of optimization of regional health care
       delivery systems.
       Expert assessment was carried out of building conditions and seismic stability of the
       40 principal regional marz hospitals.
       Assessment of current capacities, utilization and patient flows of regional hospital
       services was carried out by "Avag Solutions" consulting firm. Based on the
       assessment, a mapping of regional hospital services was completed by a local
       consultant.
       Architectural design and civil works of the Kotayk marz Hrazdan MC and Tavush
       marz Ijevan MC.

         Subcomponent B6 - Improvement of hospital management systems. This sub-
component provided management support for the hospital programs included in the Project.
The project hospitals received international and local technical assistance to develop and
implement their particular management systems and functions, including developing strategic
plans, management procedures, quality assurance systems, internal communications, etc.
Technical assistance activities performed under this sub-component included: (i) assessment
of the current management structures of the three selected hospital mergers in Yerevan, and
suggested improved management structures with underlying job descriptions, (ii) design and
institutionalization of quality assurance systems, including editing of process maps with
detailed description of key hospital processes in University hospitals, Surb Grigor Lusavorich
MC and Saint Marie MC, development of questionnaires and implementation of patient,
physicians/nurses satisfaction surveys, and (iii) development of strategic plans in pilot
hospitals.

36.     Some resources were made available under this sub-component to support relocation
and mobility grants as well as retraining cost for staff that would elect to relocate to under-
serviced regions in Armenia assisted by the National Employment Service for locating job
vacancies. Project Operational Guidelines on Managed Redeployment and Severance
Program had been prepared during preparation phase and adapted by the HPIU, agreed by the
WB and adopted by a ministerial decree. The manual described the options and mechanisms
of the health care staff (doctors and nurses) for voluntary relocation. The implementation of
the medical staff redeployment and severance program, however, did not take place and the
funds were re-allocated to other project activities. The only staff reductions that took place
were due to retirement and contract termination of employees.

        Component C - Strengthening Government Capacity to Develop and Monitor
Effective Health Sector Policies. The capacity of the MoH and its key agencies to perform
their major functions of policy development and implementation of monitoring, regulation
and oversight of the health sector was strengthen with support from the Project. Most of the
trainings and technical assistance was financed from the PHRD Grant for institutional
capacity building.




                                            53
       Sub-component C1 - Build capacity for evaluation of health sector performance.
The sub-component supported development of core instruments to inform decision makers in
the process of health policy development and monitoring: reports on the HSPA and NHA.

         Development of NHA. The Project supported the development and
institutionalization of the NHA. NHA improves transparency in health sector financing and
offers a better base for policy decisions, since it represents comprehensive, consistent and
internationally comparable information on how health resources are spent, on what types of
services, and who pays for them. In 2005, a Multicultural NHA Steering Committee was
established to oversee the analytical work on NHA development. It includes high level
representatives from the MOH, MOF, SHA, and the National Statistical Service (NSS). A
WG on NHA development was formed comprising representatives from the MOF, NSS and
SHA. The WG collaborates closely with USAID and WHO representatives.

37.    Indicators that were included in the NHA classification and indicators related to
household health expenditures were developed. During the APL 1, two surveys were
conducted on household expenditures for health services and financial activities of health
care organizations and pharmacies for the years 2005-2006 and 2008 by the NSS of RA. The
final NHA reports for years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 have been developed by the WG;
the reports for the years 2006 and 2008 were published and disseminated among key
stakeholders. Two Workshops on NHA were conducted, where the published NHA reports
were presented.

38.    Development of the National HSPA Report. The Project supported the
Government to get evidence-based information for health policy analysis and health sector
performance monitoring and evaluation. The previous M&E system did not provide a
balance picture of health sector performance and was particularly lacking in terms of
coverage of access, equity, quality, effectiveness and efficiency. The health sector
performance assesses whether the entire health system is moving toward success and its
policy objectives. It allows measuring and monitoring a core of set indicators. The methods
of measurements of these indicators were diverse and included both primary and secondary
data collection (routine data from NAIC of NIH of MoH, data from surveys of households
conducted by NSS and information obtained from tertiary specialized hospitals).

39.    In 2005 to avoid duplication of functions and responsibilities at the Information and
Flow Department at the MOH and Health Information and Analytical Centre (HIAC), it was
decided to add activities of the mentioned entities and reassign these activities to the HIAC in
NIH (Minister's Order N519-A, dated 30 May, 2005). On the basis of the HIAC, the WG,
which further was reorganized as an HSPA department, was established for the development
of the HSPA report. The WG collaborates closely with USAID and WHO representatives.
During the APL 1, two surveys on health sector performance assessment for the years of
2006 and 2008 were conducted by the NSS. The final HSPA reports for 2006 and 2008 were
developed, published and disseminated among key stakeholders. Two Workshops in 2007
and 2010 on HSPA and NIH were conducted, where the published HSPA and NIH reports
were presented. IT equipment for NIH HIAC was purchased, distributed, and installed.



                                            54
        Subcomponent C2 - Strengthening of regulatory, oversight and management
functions. The Project successfully provided support for revising and improving health
legislation, improving MoH capacity as regulatory agency for the health sector, strengthening
the Government oversight function, building up management structures of hospitals, and
developing regulations for health care waste management.

40.     Licensing and accreditation. The licensing of physical persons in the health sector
was suspended in 2001, and it is not yet re-established. However, some steps have been
taken by the Project for the purpose of introduction of a new licensing system for health care
professionals. In particular, international and local consultancies on developing of
mechanisms of licensing in Armenia have taken place. An international consultant reviewed
the current licensing system and emphasized some contradictions and problems. It was
strongly recommended not to introduce (again) the licensing system for health care
professionals, but to introduce a registration system. A local WG developed a list of medical
specialties as well as draft a Government decree for the implementation of the proposed
strategy for registration of health professionals. The final report developed by the
international consultant on Licensing and Accreditation systems development was distributed
among major stakeholders.

41.     Some structural changes are planned to create within MoH a separate agency on
licensing of health care facilities and health care professionals. In addition, a Law on Health
Care has been developed and currently is under discussion with main stakeholders. The
Health Care Law is planned to be adopted by the end of 2010. The above-mentioned Law
contains a separate chapter on licensing of health care facilities and health care professionals.

42.     Health Care Waste Management Regulatory Documents. There were no legal
acts that directly regulated the field of healthcare waste. A new legal framework to address
healthcare waste was developed within the frame of the Project by international and local
consultants. Consultants reviewed the legal framework on waste management, developed a
legal package and national guidelines with detailed description of: (i) classification of health
care waste, (ii) process of estimating waste generation, (iii) current management practices,
(iv) waste management implementation plan, (v) waste segregation and collection containers,
(vi) waste collection, (vii) transportation and treatment, (viii) common treatment technologies,
and (ix)training. In addition, a TOT course on Health Care Waste Management (in
accordance with developed guidelines) was conducted for epidemiologists who are
responsible for waste management in merger hospitals as well as for specialists from the
State Hygienic and Anti-Epidemic Inspectorate. The Health Care Waste Management
Regulatory Documents were adopted in 2008 ("Governmental Decree of 4 March 2008, No.
N03-N on approval of N2.1.3-3 sanitary norms, and rules on hygienic and anti-epidemic
requirements for medical waste management").

43.     Strengthening of hospital management. Oxford Policy Management Ltd & Pi
Associates Ltd. developed the curricula of basic management and health care governance
courses. In collaboration with the local management faculty at the NIH, a detailed course for
training in hospital governance and basic management was developed based on the curricula.
The course consists of main competence clusters, including management people, information,



                                             55
services, resources, strategy. Training programs were designed for 3 different management
levels (top management - CEO's, middle management ­ division/departmental heads and
lower management - nurse in leader role). TOT for NIH management faculty members was
provided to adjust the way they teach according to the suggested curriculum, as well as, to
promote "complex" teaching focused on managerial rather than academic disciplines. The
management training courses (top, basic and lower level management programs) were
conducted in 2006-2008. Management training was provided for 726 health care managers,
including 108 representatives of top, 271 representatives of middle and 347 representatives
of low level management. IT equipment was purchased, distributed and installed to provide
technical support for the faculty of NIH. This equipment contributed to the creation of
sustainable training capacity in both health care management and health care governance,
providing a core knowledge base that will be used to build management and governance
capacity in hospitals, the MoH, municipalities, and marz health departments.

44.     Strengthening of owners' oversight. MOH has recognized the need to strengthen its
stewardship role in policy setting and monitoring, and oversight functions and it has taken
concrete steps to improve the oversight of the sector. The Government approved a decree in
2003 that sets out an implementation plan to improve financial management and
accountability in public hospitals. The decree calls for introduction of uniform sets of
accounts and a set of standard forms, training of accountants in hospitals, introduction of a
hospital governance board in a pilot public hospital, requirement of independent financial
audits, and introduction of new reporting mechanisms to MOF. A time-bound action plan of
improved supervisory and oversight arrangements of hospitals was developed by MOH and
approved by a Governmental decree in 2004 to improve governance arrangements that are
based on: (i) introduction of Hospital Supervisory Committees; (ii) improved SHA
contracting; (iii) reporting arrangements for public and private hospitals; and (iv)
strengthened regulatory functions of the MOH for public and private hospitals.

45.      Within the frame of the Project, regulatory and oversight functions of the MOH, the
Yerevan Municipality and the Marzes' health departments were strengthened. A review of
an appropriate accountability system was conducted, which includes the board model that is
internationally considered as best practice for the supervision of public hospitals. Hospital
Supervisory Committees were formally established and have their basic regulation in the
Government Decree N-1187-N "On formation of and regulation of activities of Supervisory
Committees of Joint Stock Companies with 50 and more percent of State Shares" of May 19,
2005. This regulation applies to all public hospitals in Armenia. The committees' main
functions are to carry out supervision related to financial and economic activities, inspect
results of the annual financial performance of the company, and inspect the financial
activities of the company. Committees have been established in all marz hospitals. However,
the main issue of concern related to the committees' development and their functions is that
their full spectrum of activities is not yet defined and their financial remuneration is the
exclusive responsibility of hospitals with scarce economic resources. Development and
introduction of hospital board governance structure is in the process of active discussion.




                                           56
46.     Developing hospital accounting and services cost accounting standard software
requirements specification. Within the frame of the Project, hospital accounting and
services cost accounting standard software requirements specifications was developed for
improvement of hospital financial accounting and reporting system. A local company
examined the current hospital accounting and cost accounting system (including systems of
hospital management accounting, financial accounting, taxation accounting, and statistical
accounting) through review of existing documents, hospital accounting related data,
collection forms and reports as well as through meetings with hospitals chief accountants of a
sample of public hospitals and defined strengths and weaknesses of accounting software
packages used by health care providers. The final report with detailed description of hospital
accounting and services cost accounting standard software requirements specification was
issue in 2006.

47.     Strengthening of Health Legislation. Health sector legislation has been reviewed
and improved with the support from the Project. Several legal acts, which regulate the heath
sector, such as the laws of RA on "Health care delivery for population", "Regarding drugs"
and "Regarding licensing" have been reviewed. The detailed discussion on VHI, FM
institutes, statuses of health care establishments, their governance and supervision, as well as
the health services provided by the mentioned institutions, their norms and related problems
took place. The local consultant for the strengthening of health legislation also revised
specific sanitary and epidemiological safety norms, rules and requirements for hospital
structures. Sanitary-regulatory norms were developed for inpatient department, radiology,
central sterilization, obstetrics, blood transfusion and functional diagnostic, clinical
diagnostics, nutrition, pathology, hospitals' pharmacies, laundries and disinfections
departments. IT equipment was purchased, distributed and installed in all public hospitals.

       Subcomponent C3 - Improvement of public expenditure management. This sub-
component provided support to the SHA for improving its capacity to use efficiently public
funds for purchasing of health care services.

48.     MIDAS Development. The management information system (MIS) of the SHA, in
particular MIDAS-2 software package was further improved with support from the Project.
A local company worked on software means development for standardization and coding of
PHC standard reports. Software means for forming and transfer of reports about the treatment
process of a given patient was developed. MIS provides regular information to MoH and the
information system has been linked with MoH HIS and other software packages. An
internet site for SHA was developed. The web site contains laws related to SHA mandate,
information about all SHA procedures and structure, services provided under state orders,
and data about hospitals.

49.     Basic Benefits Package Costing Study. With support from the Project, a Basic
Benefit package (BBP) Costing Study was conducted to: (i) analyze and calculate the real
cost of delivering BBP services including primary and secondary health care; (ii) analyze and
calculate the cost of receiving primary and secondary health care services (formal and
informal private out of pocket expenditure); and (iii) make recommendations for
improvement of the cost-accounting and pricing methodology used by the SHA. For the



                                            57
assignment of the BBP Costing Study, HPIU invited an International Expert, who in
collaboration with the local company "Business Consult", developed methodology and tools
for the costing study implementation. As the real cost of the BBP cannot be estimated just at
the health provider side, the Consultant proposed that the total real cost should include the
actual expenditure at the supply side (health providers) and the real out of pocket expenditure
(OOPE) at the demand side (patients). The approved sample for the Costing Study includes
the primary and secondary care levels, the rural and urban areas, and the public and private
sector. In addition, a demand side survey was implemented through the phone. All data
were obtained and analyzed by international and local experts and were presented to major
stakeholders during a workshop organized in SHA.

50.     Voluntary Health Insurance. The concept paper on the "Development of Voluntary
Health Insurance in the ROA" was developed by a local company, which described the
current state of VHI development and obstacles, recommendations for VHI development,
such as, improvement of insurance and tax legislation, raising of the population awareness,
development of state guaranteed free of charge health care plans, improvement of activities
of health care providers and improvement of insurance companies activities. A seminar
organized by WB, MoH, WHO and European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies
on "Directions for Development of VHI in the Armenian health system" was conducted.
Discussions involved representatives from MOH, SHA, Central Bank, MOF and health care
providers. The "Initial Options Paper of VHI in Armenia" report was developed by WHO
experts, where several options were presented to consider in introducing the VHI in Armenia.
All the above mentioned documents were sent to the Central Bank and MOF for further
regulation and discussion.

51.      Strengthening of SHA capacity. The organizational and governance arrangements
of the SHA were reviewed by international consultant. It was recommended to enhance the
role of the SHA from that of a contracting and payment agency to that of a strategic
purchaser. The consultant: (i) presented current weaknesses in the performance of the
purchaser role and the boundaries of SHA decision making authority, (ii) defined
performance criteria for SHA, and (iii) developed procedures for increased transparency of
its operations. The consultant also proposed an action plan to implement with suggested
institutional changes to enable MOH/SHA to become a strategic purchaser. A medium-term
health financing scenario was projected in the report that would enable the SHA to act more
as a strategic purchaser and a number of ways were suggested in which the SHA should
develop its capacity to more efficiently and effectively use public funds for the purchasing of
health care services. Priority activities were agreed and a plan outlined to enable the SHA to
remain a central and integral part of the continuing reform effort in the Armenian health
sector through gradually adopting more of the characteristics of a strategic purchaser. These
were presented at a workshop hosted by the SHA in 2006. IT equipment for the SHA was
purchased and installed.

       Sub-component C4: Development of Armenian Public Health System. In 2007
the consultants of EuroHealth Group International Consulting organization implemented
an assignment on "Development of Armenian Public Health System, needs assessment
plan and monitoring evaluation system for Avian Influenza, HIV/AIDS and other Public



                                            58
Health threats". They developed a proposal to modernize the public health system of
Armenia, legal and regulatory framework of the Armenian health care system, including
proposals for changes towards a public health oriented system, proposal for establishing an
effective health system laboratory network in Armenia with the Centre for Disease Control
and Prevention as the National Reference Centre, report on strengthening the National
Disease Surveillance System in Armenia, report on Elements for a Public Health
Monitoring and Evaluation System, and curriculum for TOT on ''Avian Influenza
Surveillance and treatment''.

2.3.   Project Coordination and Management

52.    The GoA designated the MoH as the responsible agency for the Project. The MoH
nominated the Deputy Minister as focal point for overall project implementation. The MoH
has been supported by HPIU. The HPIU is in charge of overall coordination, planning,
management and fiduciary aspects.

53.     A Project Steering Committee was established to guide, supervise, and oversee
project implementation with overall fiduciary oversight responsibility. The committee is
chaired by the Minister of Health. Its members are: (i) First Deputy Minister of Health; (ii)
First Deputy Minister of Finance; (iii) First Deputy Minister of Justice; (iv) Deputy Minister
of Territorial Affairs; (v) Deputy Minister of Health; (vi) Head of Credit and Humanitarian
Assistance Programs Department of the Staff of Government; (vii) Head of Health
Economics and Accounting Department of the MoH;(viii) Head of the Medical Care
Provision Department of the MoH; (ix) Head of the State Hygienic and Anti-Epidemic
Inspectorate of the MoH; and (x) Director of the HPIU. The Steering Committee has: (i)
reviewed and approved the reallocations of the projects' budgets and submitted these
amendments to the Government for approval with the prior agreement of the WB; (ii)
supervised the operation of the HPIU; (iii) supervised the expenditures made under
credits/grants; (iv) reviewed and approved the project annual time schedules and the budgets
after approval of Credit/Grant Agreements; (v) reviewed and approved the final results of
tenders for procurement of works, services and goods costing more than of USD 50,000; (vi)
presented suggestions to the Government on the use of any savings during the
implementation of the projects funds and their reallocation; (vii) arranged meetings during
WB missions and discussed the progress made on the project implementation with the WB
team and present a report to the Government on the outcomes of the WB missions. Regular
meetings of the Steering Committee have been held every month; extraordinary meetings
have been called by request of the chairman, director of HPIU or of the 1/3 of members of
the Committee. Any decision of the Steering Committee has been considered valid by a
simple majority of vote of the members present. Component-specific Coordination
Committees were established to guide and monitor implementation of individual project
components or sub-components.

54.     The PIU was established according to Decree of the Minister of Health No. 764 on
October 22, 2009 and was turned into state enterprise according to the decree of GOA No.
765 of December 1999. The unit has its own status, stamp and independent bank account
selected in agreement with the MOF. The PIU has had a core group of professional staff for



                                           59
the entire duration of the project including Director, Procurement Officer, Financial Manager,
Accountant, Secretary/Translator, Architect-Engineer, Office Manager, Legal Specialist,
Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, Community Mobilization Specialist, three component
coordinators and drivers. Other consultants are hired to support specific needs under a
particular component for short-term defined assignments.

55.    Similar to other departments under the MoH, the HPIU agrees with the MoH annual
plans, annual budgets, work plans; submits for MoH approval reports and documents
elaborated within the project frameworks.

2.4.   Project impact in the implementation of the health sector reform and program

56.    The HSMP was adequately designed to meet the Government's reform priorities.
The Project has had significant impact in the frame of ongoing health reforms carried out in
ROA. In particular, HSMP has made significant achievements in implementing PHC reform
on establishment of FM based PHC, in strengthening institutional capacity of SHA to
become as active purchaser of services, in scaling up optimization of the selected health
services networks in Yerevan and marzes.

3.  CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF ACTIONS TAKEN FROM THE WORLD BANK,
GOVERNMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

3.1.   Assessment of World Bank performance during project implementation

57.     WB team's continuous assistance and direct supervision was highly significant both
for project preparation and for implementation stages. Preparation of the Project was
supported by extensive analytical work and technical assistance of WB experts. The Project
objectives were in line with stated Government reform priorities and strategies in the health
sector, focusing on strengthening PHC, optimization of health services network and
improvement of health system governance. Changes to the Project components/sub-
components made during implementation were in accordance with the original development
objectives. Some additional financial allocations and re-allocations were made during the
project lifetime, which significantly facilitated project implementation.

58.    Frequent supervision conducted by the project WB team allowed timely identification
of problems and development of feasible solutions. The Local Project Officer has provided
high quality contribution on an ongoing basis. Prompt responses, experienced experts'
opinions and valuable suggestions and comments from the WB team were very valuable for
the Project successful implementation. MoH and HPIU highly appreciated the effective
cooperation with WB.

59.    The WB was involved in extensive donor coordination activities, in particular with
WHO and USAID. One tangible result was the significant contribution of WHO experts to
the development of the HSPA and NHA reports. This assistance complemented the support
provided by the Project to the HSPA and NHA surveys conduction, HSPA and NHA
working groups, reports printing etc.



                                           60
3.2.   Assessment of Government's actions during project implementation

60.     Key decisions facilitating project implementation. The project benefited from
strong support and active interest of the Government throughout its implementation. A major
step was Government's commitment to increase PHC financing (in 2005 PHC expenditure
was 12,093.3 mln drams as compared to 21,118.3 mln drams in 2009, comprises 75%
increase. Since January 2006, all out-patient services are covered by state order and are free
of charge for the entire population.

61.    Some policy steps were undertaken by the Government providing an important policy
environment for continued implementation of PHC reform. Specifically, Governmental
Decree on the Free Enrollment of patients with FDs was adopted in April, 2006 ("ROA
Government Decree on Approving the Order for Selection of Physician Providing Primary
Healthcare Services and Population Enrollment with the Latter" on April, 2006, No. 420-N).
A regulatory framework related to establishment of FM independent group practices was
developed and approved in 2007 ("ROA Government Decree on Approving the Regulation
on Individual and Group FM independent practices implementation" on April 19, 2007, No.
497-N). In addition, the Government approved the 2008-2013 PHC strategy (Primary Health
Care Strategy for 2008-2013 and its implementation plan Government of RA on June 19,
2008, No. 24-N), which restates the Government's main strategy on development of FM
based PHC system and prioritizes an equal access to quality PHC services as a major policy
goal. The new strategy describes the Government's policy measures on free enrollment and
independent group practice; human resource planning and management; performance based
contracting, etc.

62.     On November 21, 2003, the Government adopted a decree that consolidated twenty
four public hospitals and thirteen outpatient health care facilities into ten networks in
Yerevan. This was a significant step towards the optimization and modernization of health
services network and the WB supported its general direction. Following the hospital
optimization plan in Yerevan, the GOA approved in 2006 the master plan for the
optimization of health facilities in the ten marzes of ROA ("ROA Government Decree on
Approving Optimization Programs for Regional Health Networks - November 2, 2006, No.
1911-N"). The WB agreed to allocate significant credit resources to support the
Government's efforts in reducing the excess capacity in the regions and improving the
efficiency of scarce resources allocation. According to the marz optimization program, most
of the rural ambulatories, which had been merged with polyclinics, became separate and
gained autonomous contracts with SHA.

63.    The MOH recognized the need to strengthen its stewardship role in policy setting and
monitoring and oversight function. In 2003, the Government approved a time-bound action
plan to improve financial management and accounting in public hospitals, and in 2004
prepared and adopted an action plan to improve governance arrangements that is based on
four pillars: (i) introduction of Hospital Supervisory Committees; (ii) improved SHA




                                           61
contracting; (iii) reporting arrangements for public and private hospitals; and (iv)
strengthened regulatory functions of the MOH for public and private hospitals.

64.    Counterpart funds timely availability. Counterpart funds include GOA co-
financing and 5% of construction and/or civil works contribution from communities where
PHC facilities infrastructure were improved. Overall, there were no significant delays in
counterpart contributions during the project lifetime.

65.     Monitoring by Ministry of Health and PIU. The MOH, in close coordination with
the HIAC at NIH, has monitored and evaluated the progress, outcomes and impacts of the
reforms in the health sector. The M&E of the project served two main purposes: (i)
examining the effectiveness of main interventions in project intervention sites; (ii) serving as
a tool for health care facilities to use data for decision-making and project management. The
PIU has assessed the progress in implementation of the APL1 and the extent to which the
objectives of the project has been achieved. The data for measuring process/output M&E
indicators have been collected and analyzed periodically within the components of the
project. Different methods (quantitative and qualitative) have been used for the evaluation of
Component A and B activities: household, PHC provider and patient satisfaction surveys,
marz hospitals data, retrained family physicians and nurses knowledge assessment, etc.

66.     Key lessons learned and reflected in the APL 2 and AF project design. The
following lessons have been drawn from the implementation experience of the HSMP in
Armenia. These have been taken into account in designing and implementation follow-up
health sector reform-oriented projects.

           Need to improve the regulatory framework for FM in urban areas in order to
           ensure that newly trained FD and FN can practice their new skills and FM concept
           in Yerevan and marz polyclinics (due to inadequate medical equipment,
           availability of narrow specialist in polyclinics). This lesson will be addressed in
           additional financing project and technical assistance will be provided with support
           from the project.
           Difficulties in establishing independent FM group practices (lack of motivation of
           polyclinic directors for supporting independent FM group practices establishment,
           in particular providing space; high cost for renting space for FM group practices;
           high level of investments for FM group practices establishment; physicians'
           psychological complex for establishing private enterprises). Technical assistance
           will be provided with support from additional financing project.
           The GOA has demonstrated to be effective in the implementation of the marz
           hospital optimization program as a whole. This has, however, been a politically
           sensitive and technically challenging process. The lesson learned is that the
           implementation of the program was particularly successful in those regions where
           it was followed-up with major investment in the marz hospital networks, while
           not quite effective in the rest, such as in Kapan and Merghri medical centers.
           Additional financing of APL2 will be used to address this issue in some hospital
           networks not covered by the Project.




                                            62
           MoH and its key agencies active involvement are essential for effective
           implementation and sustainability of the Project. Specifically, in health care
           facilities and professionals licensing, hospital governance strengthening and
           hospital financing processes. Further technical assistance will be provided with
           support from additional financing of APL 2 project.

3.3.  Assessment of the efficiency and quality of the relationship between the World
Bank and Government during project implementation

67.    Since the late-1990s, the Armenian government has had a strikingly constructive and
successful relationship with the WB. The first WB supported Armenian Health Finance and
PHC Development Project was implemented from 1997-2003 and significantly contributed to
the success of the country health reforms implementation and developments.

3.4.     Assessment of the performance of various organizations (i.e. training centers,
etc.), firms and technical assistance during project implementation

68.    Despite changes in the Ministerial leadership during the project lifetime (the project
was prepared and implemented under two different Ministers), the project generally enjoyed
strong support and a good working relationship with the MoH. The project benefited from
strong and committed leadership at the PIU throughout preparation and implementation. The
HPIU also benefited from a strong team of technical staff. Besides the MoH and the HPIU,
the MOF, the SHA, NIH, SMU and regional (Marz) Health Departments, and the
management teams of the affected health facilities were the key participants in project
implementation. HPIU staff regular and closer interaction with training institution,
ministerial departments, local governments and communities were essential to successful
implementation of the project.

4.      ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT

4.1.    Total project cost

69.     The International Development Association financing was covered top priority for the
project implementation. The original project cost estimate was US$ 25.4 million, of which
US$ 19.0 million was to be financed by IDA credit, GOA contribution accounted to US$ 2.8
million and beneficiary hospitals input accounted to US$ 2.4 million and community
contribution around US$ 68.700 of the project total cost. The project was supported through
a US$ 1.25 million PHRD co-financing grant from Japanese government. As of June 31,
2010 ninety-nine percent of project cost estimate was disbursed.

70.    Some additional allocations and re-allocations were made during the project lifetime.
The implementation of the project benefited from these decisions. The significant changes
were the following:

        The market prices of construction/renovation activities, including of construction
        materials, fuel and workforce have substantially increased during the years of 2004-


                                           63
       2006, while the costs of civil works planned in the credit agreement were estimated
       according to market prices of 2003, which were the bases for calculation of the
       project total estimated expenditures during the credit agreement negotiations between
       the Government of the ROA and the WB in April 2004. The analysis of the minimal
       price proposals submitted during the tenders, showed that the estimated costs
       increased by about 50%. The PIU proposed to revise the estimated costs for civil
       works in the Procurement Plan and to make appropriate changes in it. In 2006 the WB
       has agreed to increase the estimated costs for civil works in 50%, which equals to
       around US$ 550.000.
       The renovation of the roof of "Surb Astvatsamayr" Maternity Hospital (Merger B.3)
       with a total estimated cost of about US$ 200.000 (not included in the initial project),
       was further approved by the WB and included in the civil works of above hospital as
       stipulated by the tri-partite agreement on the project implementation signed between
       the Yerevan Municipality, PIU and "Surb Astvatsamayr" MC.
       Optimization activities in merger B.4 has not started as the parties were not able to
       reach an agreement. Two of the merger facilities, the Institute of Cardiology and
       Polyclinic #11 have obtained independent status and independent contracts. The
       Government had reallocated the funds for this merger mainly to support marz
       hospitals optimization plans (US$ 3 million). The additional allocations towards the
       Marz hospital modernization sub-component (B5) allowed covering higher than
       anticipated cost for renovation of two marz hospitals Hrazdan MC and Ijevan MC.
       In 2006, as a result of discussions with the WB it was agreed to meet the request of
       the Yerevan State Medical University (Merger B.1) for making amendments in the
       tri-partite agreement on reallocating funds for civil works around US$ 570.000 to the
       purchase of additional biomedical equipment items.
       In 2006 the WB has approved implementation of civil works in two marz hospitals
       (Hrazdan MC and Ijevan MC) which has not been initially envisioned by the project.
       The actual total expenditures for civil works equals to US$ 3.8 million as well as
       expenditures for architectural design of Hrazdan MC and Ijevan MC equals to around
       US$ 100.000.
       In 2006, the WB has approved the expenditures for provision with medical and
       diagnostic equipment and furniture of two marz hospitals (Hrazdan MC and Ijevan
       MC) with the actual total value of about US$ 0.9 million, which has not initially
       envisioned by the project.

4.2.   Estimated yearly recurrent costs generated by the Project and their impact on
the budget

71.     The sustainability of the Project depends on the level of additional recurrent costs as a
result of the investments made to upgrade health care facilities. Recurrent costs generated by
the Project include operation and maintenance of purchased medical equipment, IT
equipment, vehicles and project financed civil works. One part of the recurrent costs for
Yerevan hospitals has been covered by state budget though SHA financed state order
contracts, while the other part through private revenues generated by the concerned hospitals.
All recurrent costs for primary care has been covered from public funds through SHA
financed state order contracts with PHC providers. The recurrent costs impact on the State


                                             64
budget is not considered excessive. The issue of high level of recurrent costs has risen with
renovation of marz hospitals (Ijevan MC and Katayk MC) with limited scare financial
resources from SHA.
4.3.    Impact of project on institutional structure established and or supported by the
project

72.      The Project has had a substantial impact on institutional development in Armenia's
health sector. The Project has allowed for the development of substantial analytical capacity
in MoH, SHA, NIH and different WG members, who continue to work in the health sector on
various capacities. The Project has also undertaken significant steps in the process of
institutionalization of NHA and HSPA reports development on regular basis. The Project has
also supported strengthening the capacity of NIH in providing training in hospital governance
and basic management training courses for health managers. The FM/FN chairs at NIH,
SMU, BMC and marz nursing colleges developed credible capacity for providing residency
and re-training in family medicine/nursing and will continue to play an essential role in FM
based PHC system establishment.

4.3.1. SUSTAINABLITY OF PROJECT INVESTMENTS

73.     The Government is very committed to build on achievements of the completed
Project and continue to modernize provision of PHC services using FM approach as well as
of marz hospital services. This commitment is demonstrated by the PHC strategy, regulatory
documents for FM and marz hospital networks optimization and modernization degree
approved by the Government and by the follow-up APL 2.

74.     Some of the steps that became evident during the implementation of the Project that
have impact of sustainability included: (i) Project support incentives for communities to
increase their involvement in local health care needs; (ii) communities abilities to continue to
mobilize resources to help maintain basic infrastructure of PHC facilities; (iii) Government
commitment to increase PHC financing to adequate level; (iv) project supported massive re-
training efforts while the Government has contributed by funding the FM residency program;
(v) Government has taken major steps to consolidate and optimize excessive health sector
infrastructure; (vi) new regulations have been adopted for improved financial management
and accounting in public hospitals; (vii) Government's institutional capacity for health sector
oversight and accountability was strengthen - institutional capacity for development of NHA
and HSPA reports were established; (viii) policy environment for PHC reform
implementation was developed and approved, in particular related to legal status of FD, make
FD managerially autonomous from specialist care, introduction of open enrolment, etc.
These steps improved the performance of the health sector and ensure sustainability.

4.3.2. CONCLUSION

75.     The HSMP was adequately designed to meet the Government's reform priorities. The
objectives of the HSMP were crucial as stated in the frame of ongoing health reforms carried
out in the country. Being part these reforms and providing adequate financial support it has




                                            65
played a central role in three main areas: (i) development of PHC, (ii) hospital optimization
and modernization, and (iii) strengthening of government institutional capacities.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

1.     During discussion with the ICR mission, WHO expressed its appreciation for the
close collaboration the Bank team has maintained with its staff and consultants. WHO
recognized the role the Project played in the development of the sector and the importance of
the areas that it addressed. While the technical assistance and training provided by WHO
were important in building institutional capacity for the development of NHA and HSPAs,
WHO acknowledged that the integration of the various pieces of analytical work were part of
a bigger picture in the sector.

2.      Equally, discussions with USAID management and staff confirmed that the strong
collaboration between the Bank-supported projects and that of AUSAID had been an
important element supporting the outcomes that the sector has been able to achieve in a
relative short period. USAID appreciated the openness of the Bank team in discussing
strengths and challenges and openly acknowledged that in planning future interventions
USAID relies on Bank's analysis of gaps that need to be addressed. Further, USAID
reiterated the important role the Project has played in the expansion of family medicine and
helping implement hospital optimization in Yerevan and marzes.
