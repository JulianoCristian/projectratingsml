Her teacher\n            is certified family physician Dr. Lena Gevorgyan, who is\n            happy to share her experience. She says that in her time,\n            she, too, was well trained by others. Dr. Gevorgyan has been\n            working with doctors in regional Armenia to refresh their\n            knowledge of family medicine and teach them new techniques\n            and new ways of interacting with patients. It's like a\n            master's degree course where family doctors learn how\n            to best handle a wide variety of medical challenges, most\n            likely alone in a walk-in clinic. In Armenia, 800,000\n            patients have been treated in 145 improved outpatient\n            clinics. However, 70 outpatient units around the country\n            still need to be moved to new buildings."}, "docdt": "2011-02-14T00:26:02Z"}
