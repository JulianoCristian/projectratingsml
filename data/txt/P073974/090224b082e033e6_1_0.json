equipment in rural health facilities, and\n            enhanced knowledge and skills among primary health care\n            (PHC) providers. Roughly 89 percent of the people are now\n            covered by retrained family medical providers compared to 47\n            percent in 2006. Moreover, improving the quality of the\n            principal regional hospitals and health care providers and\n            developing the PHC infrastructure in rural areas will\n            eventually reorient regional patient flows from the capital\n            Yerevan to local health facilities. The recently approved\n            additional financing (AF) supports a further transition to\n            family medicine-based PHC, the completion of the regional\n            hospital modernization process, and the institutional\n            strengthening of the overall system."}, "docdt": "2012-04-17T10:08:01Z"}
