performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: institutionalization of important\n            activities such as National Health Accounts (NHAs) and\n            Health Sector Performance Assessment (HSPAs) can be achieved\n            with strong commitment from relevant staff and management\n            who understand the benefits for decision making derived from\n            the reports. The program has been able to achieve success\n            because reforms spanned key areas of the health care system.\n            The health strategy in Armenia gives evidence of a balanced\n            choice between visible results in terms of\n            rehabilitation/construction and service delivery on the one\n            side and the development of a policy framework and\n            medium-term planning on the other side."}, "docdt": "2010-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
