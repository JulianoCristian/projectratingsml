In\n            2006, agreement was reached between the Government and the\n            Bank to include in the project the renovation of Ijevan and\n            Hrazdan Medical centers; and to carry out the renovation,\n            two civil works contracts totaling US$2,577,500 were signed.\n            The second health system performance assessment and the 2008\n            national health accounts reports have been published.\n            However, no further progress has been observed in the\n            implementation of activities on improving governance\n            arrangements of public hospitals. Similarly, no progress has\n            been made in the independent audit of hospitals in 2009, as\n            the allocation of funds to the public hospitals to conduct\n            audit was not considered by the Government due to lack of\n            state budget in view of the economic crisis. The Government\n            has now planned to allocate resources for hospital\n            independent audit in the 2011 health budget with the\n            expectations that the state budget will come out from the\n            effect of deep recession. The project will close on June 30,\n            2010. The next mission is planned for May 2010. The\n            implementation completion report (ICR) will be prepared in\n            September 2010."}, "docdt": "2010-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
