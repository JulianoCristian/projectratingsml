 Laying the Foundations for Sunstainable Development

 SYNOPSIS
  Armenia’s economy has undergone a profound transformation since independence in the early 1990s.
  Today, it is market oriented and highly receptive to trade, capital, and technological innovation. From the
  late 1990s to 2008, gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by double digits on average, and Armenia
  now ranks as a lower middle-income country. As a result of sustained growth, ambitious reforms, and ex-
  ternal inflows of capital and remittances, poverty plunged from over 55 percent at the start of the transi-
  tion to less than 36 percent in 2010.
