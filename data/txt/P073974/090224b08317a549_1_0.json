During the last two\n            decades, Armenia faced enormous economic difficulties and\n            crisis in social spheres, including the health care system.\n            The main challenge in Armenia\u2019s health system was to ensure\n            better access of the population to quality health services.\n            The Health System Modernization (HSM) Project was designed\n            to improve the organization of the country\u2019s health care\n            system so as to provide more accessible, quality and\n            sustainable health care services to the population. The HSM\n            Project has helped increase the geographical and financial\n            access of Armenia\u2019s most vulnerable population to quality\n            basic health services through infrastructure development,\n            provision of modern equipment to health facilities in rural\n            areas, and the upgrading of Primary Health Care (PHC)\n            service providers\u2019 knowledge and skills. About 80 percent of\n            the country\u2019s population was covered by retrained family\n            medicine providers. Turning the principal hospital networks\n            in the country\u2019s regions into a high quality health care\n            provider\u2019s network, accompanied by a development of the PHC\n            infrastructure in rural areas, reoriented regional patient\n            flows from the capital city of Yerevan to the local health facilities."}, "docdt": "2010-09-15T09:12:05Z"}
