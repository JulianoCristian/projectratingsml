MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 16.1 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR A PUBLIC WORKS AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
1 .      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development credit
to the Republic of Senegal for SDR 16.1 million (US$ 20.0 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval. The proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and
would help finance a public works and employmeat project. The African Development Bank has
agreed to participate in project financing for US$ 8.3 million or 25% of total project cost. The
Government will contnibute US$ 5.0 million, 15% of project costs.
2.       Unemployment is a very serious problem in Senegal, particularly in the greater Dakar
area. In 1982, it was estimated that formal unemployment was running at a level of 19.4
percent. Since then, a number of factors have severely aggravated the situation, some of them
directly related to the adjustment process. Although hard data are not available, some orders of
magnitude can be estimated from an August 1989 USAID study of the informal sector in Dakar.
3.       Senegal has been in the prcoess of adjusting its economy for more than six years. A
fourth structural adjustment loan (SAL TV) is currently under preparation. One effect of the
adjustment program implemented to date has been a significant trade liberalization, resulting in a
reduction of the effective levels of prote.ttion for Senegalese industries. Provisions in the second
and third SALs have opened up the Senegalese economy to serious foreign competition, creating
the need for companies to improve theii productivity to survive, which has necessitated layoffs
of excess workers and plant closings. About 25 enterprises have been closed since 1986; 4,500
workers have been laid-off. The slow supply response of the private sector has meant that these
job losses have not been compensated for by new employment opportunities in other industries
or sectors.
4.       In addition, the significant stabilization policies undertaken by the Senegalese
government since 198G have led to a reduction of the role of the public sector in the economy.
The number of jobs created in the public sector diminished significantly from an average of
5,334 per year in the 1976-1980 period to 1,650 in the 1980-1986 period. This trend is expected
to continue and, indeed, will become worse as programs to downsize the civil service and to
streamline public enterprises are put into effect. These factors, which tend to reduce employment
opportunities, are compounded by two trends that tend to increase the number of job seekers.
First, the age structure of the population is such that each year there are approximately 100,000
new entrants into the labor force. Second, a similar number of migrants, driven out of the rural
areas by adverse climatic conditions and inadequate income opportunities, come to Dakar every
year searching for employment.
5.       Until the investment environment is improved, allowing new investments to generate
additional jobs, the unemployment problem, which public opinion considers as an adverse effect
of adjustment, will pose a growing threat to the Government's ability to sustain the adjustment
process. The increasing discontent among the population has created social unrest which, while
it finds its leadership among unemployed high school and university graduates, is fueled by the
large number of unemployed urban residents and by the growing number of immigrants from
rural areas seeking a better living in the capital city. In order to alleviate the social stress in urban
areas, especially in Dakar, the Government is eager to complement its structural adjustment
program with labor-intensive public works projects which would have an immediate impact on



- 2 -
employment and would also contribute to Dakar's and other cities' efficiency and attractiveness
for investors. The rationale behind such a program is that its results, albeit temporary, will offset
increasing short-term unemployment and ease the transition to more sustainable employment
creztion resulting from the positive effects expected from adjustment in the medium term. In
addidon, the project would extend the objectives of the municipal component of the Municipal
and Housing Development Project (Cr. 1884-SE) which becarne effective in late 1988.
6.       Rationale for IMA involvement. IDA's leadership in donor support for structural
adjustment results in the Association's being considered as Senegal's main partner for addressing
Social Dimension of Adjustment (SDA) issues, notably rising unemployment. In GOS' view,
the proposed project is the vanguard component of its broader SDA program. Meanwhile, IDA's
strategy in the urban sector in Senegal is to imnprove the quality of infrastructure maintenance and
urban services through strengthening municipal institutions and increasing local resource
mobilization, and to foster a more active and less subsidized housing market by removing
institutional and financial bottlenecks which hamper private initiatives in this sector. Therefore, it
was necessary to design the SDA program of labor-intensive public works aimed at improving
the urban environment so that they complement previous IDA endeavors aiming at similar
objectives.
7.       Poject Objectives. The main objectives of the project are: (a) to create, at least
temporarily, substantial new employment in urban areas as rapidly as possible; (b) to improve,
through execution of the works financed by the project, the individual skills of the workers who
will be employed, the corporate competitiveness of the firms that will carry out works so as to
develop their capacity to respond to increased opportunities for sustained employment after
completion of the project; (c) to demonstrate the feasibility of labor-intensive public projects and
test the procedures that will enable the public sector to commission such projects; and (d) to
produce results that are economically and socially useful. In achieving these objectives, the
following conditions should be fulfilled: (a) avoiding the need for increased civil service staff; (b)
combining low cost and high visibility; (c) supporting but not replacing other development
programs; and (d) using transparent, expeditious and flexible procedures for subproject bidding,
appraisal, contracting and disbursements.
8.      ftject Description. The components of the proposed project are: (a) a program of
public facility and infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance in urban areas to be carried out
using labor-intensive methods by local contractors; (b) a package of services related to work
organization, management, and labor force training to be offered on a voluntary basis to local
contractors who will be awarded contracts under component (a); and (c) a supervision and
monitoring component in order to monitor closely the progress of the project and to prepare the
transition toward locally supported employment of the target group. The project will make a
contribution to the development of the Senegalese contracting and engineering consultancy
industries, through increasing the demand for contractors and providing technical and managerial
training and through the extensive use of local consultants for project preparation and
supervisions. The implementing arrangements are critical for effective fulfillment of the project's
objectives: an executing agency has been created as a temporary "self-destructing" body, with
private legal status, with a manager recruited from the private sector. Such an agency will be
able to avoid the cumbersome, slow, and inefficient procedures that public institutions are
obliged to follow in calling for bids, awarding contracts and disbursing, and which result in de
facto discrimination against small contractors.
9.       The project, to be carried out over two years, provides funds for labor-intensive civil
works, equipment, training, technical assistance and incremental operating costs. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$ 33.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$ 5.8 million (17 percent). The subprojects to be executed by the Executing Agency that are
financed under the Credit will be exempted from duties and taxes. A US$ 5.0 million



-3-
contribution--l5% of project costs--will be provided from government budgetary resources, as
agreed upon at negotiations. These funds will be channelled through the Executing Agency and
will be used to execute subprojects selected by the Agency. Cofinancing totalling US$ 8.3
million equivalent (25% of project costs) is being assumed by AfDB. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of IDA
disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Senegal are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8032-SE dated November 3,
1989, is attached.
Implementation Arrangement
10.      Agreed Actions. The Executing Agency was created prior to negotiations and its
statutes and by-laws have been approved by IDA. During negotiations, agreements with the
Government were reached on the detailed operational guidelines of the agency, including, inter
alia, the eligibility criteria of the subprojects to be included in the program and the procurement
procedures. The following actions, aimed at ensuring rapid start-up of the project, will be
conditions of effectiveness: (a) the Executing Agency has been staffed and a Director General, a
Technical Director and a Financial Director have been employed with qualifications and
experience acceptable to the Association; (b) the Executing Agency shall have selected
subprojects whose aggregate estimated cost is equivalent to US$ 7.5 million or more and the
Association shall have approved the selection of such subprojects; (c) a Convention has been
signed by the Borrower and the Executing Agency; and (d) the Executing Agency has
prequalified an initial list of enterprises and engineering fms. A condition of disbursement after
January 1991 will be that the management of the operations of the Executing Agency, the
performance by the Executirng Agency of its obligations under the Convention, (including
procurement procedures) and the performance by the Executing Agency (and Implementing
Eiiterprises) of their respective obligations unde; Subproject Agreements, after review by the
Association and the Borrower, have been found satisfactory.
1l.      Benefits. The project is justified by its economic benefits, its impact on poverty
alleviation and indirectly securing other development/adjustment objectives. First, economic
benefit-cost ratios have been estimated at 3.0 and 2.8 for road rehabilitation and garbage
collection subprojects. Second, the project has been designed to have a substantial effect on
poverty alleviation: the ultimate beneficiaries are the low-paid temporary wvorkers in the building
and construction trades. Since these workers tend to spend their wages close to home,
substantial multiplier effects on local economies can be expected. These benefits are likely to be
more pronounced since the building and construction trades have a greater facility than other
industries to take on additional labor rapidly in response to changes in dema- 3.. Third, the
project will alleviate the difficulties faced by the Government in carrying o% . its adjustment
program by helping to create a favorab'e socio-political climate. Whils the project is not
expected to create permanent jobs, it will pros-Ie a minimum of 7,000 m i-years of temporary
employment. To the extent that the minimum wag. 'SMIG) is actva1ll- ,ot generally honored by
the small firms in construction industry-wages in small aui ,i.inm enterprises average half the
SMIG, the project may well create over 13,000 new temporary jobs, at an average direct cost of
US$ 2,100 per man-year.
12.      Risks. The main risks arise from the possible inability of Senegal's economy to
develop stable job opportunities during the period of program execution, leading to pressure
from the Government to extend the program beyond its initial period or to continue employment
for those who have benefitted from the program by having them hired by the Government,
jeopardizing efforts to improve public sector management. This risk can only be minimized
through the successful execution of the adjustment program. Last, the control of proper use of
funds is more difficult with such a program than with regular investment projects. The



-4-
implemendng aimngements established during project preparation and appraisal and contained in
the Procedures Manual of the Executing Agency (and which is attached to the Convention to be
entered into by the Government and the Agency) have been carefully designed to minimize this
risk.
13.      Rcmmentian. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will comply with the
Articles of Ageement of the Association and reommend tht the Executive Dwcts approe the
p-posed credit.
