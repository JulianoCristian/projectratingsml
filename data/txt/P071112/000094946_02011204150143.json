Lessons emphasize the importance of\n            government commitment to reform, which reinforced the strong\n            ownership of the program, leading to its satisfactory\n            implementation, and conducive to the preparation of the\n            follow-up operation, as part of a programmatic phased\n            approach. However, it is worth mentioning that this has been\n            a high risk - though high reward as well - operation, and\n            that difficulties are likely to arise. Also, the selection\n            of at least two single-tranche programmatic loans, was key\n            to restoring the operational relationship with Jamaica, and\n            in ensuring a successful performance. The flexibility,\n            promptness, and feasibility of compliance, allowed the\n            Government to foresee attainable short-term objectives,\n            which proved advantageous to both parties. Finally, given\n            the risks involved, having an inter-institutional effort was\n            useful, in that the Bank was able to stress unfavorable\n            scenarios in the Government's program, and also\n            leveraged from the work of the Inter American Development\n            Bank on sectoral aspects of non-financial regulation."}, "docdt": "2001-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
