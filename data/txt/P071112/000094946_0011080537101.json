"The Bank Restructuring and Debt\n            Management Program Adjustment Loan Project, will support\n            both the sale of one large bank, and the progress in\n            restructuring two financial institutions. The operation will\n            fund the retirement of part of the Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Company Ltd. (FINSAC) bonds, and will complement\n            other sources of funds, such as fiscal resources, proceeds\n            from asset disposal, and loans from other international\n            financial institutions. In addition, the Government will\n            begin to service in cash, the remaining FINSAC bonds, held\n            as assets in the intervened institutions. Furthermore,\n            restructuring, and management of the public debt, arising\n            from the resolution of the financial crisis, will be\n            accomplished through an approved write-down in FINSAC debt;\n            off-set of FINSAC bonds against Government deposits at the\n            Bank of Jamaica (BOJ); and, by restructuring FINSAC bonds\n            held by BOJ. These measures will allow a reduction in the\n            outstanding stock of FINSAC debt, to be serviced in cash by\n            April 2001. The project will also improve the coordination\n            between bank and non-bank supervisory authorities, by\n            committing an independent assessment of the Basle Core\n            principles by mid 2001. Macroeconomic risks include higher\n            than expected service debt burden, and failure to achieve\n            fiscal stabilization, among others, though a re-assessment\n            approach by the Bank will be considered, should conditions\n            warrant it."}, "docdt": "2000-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
