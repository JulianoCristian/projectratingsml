The principal objective of the program was\n            to promote greater efficiency and economy in the increased\n            production of agricultural products and in the use of public\n            resources in the sector, including enhancing the role of the\n            private sector in the provision of commercially-viable\n            sector support services.  Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) the hybrid\n            structure of the Loan, with a quick disbursing policy\n            component and an investment component that supported\n            sub-projects in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) budget,\n            was not an effective instrument design; (ii) investment\n            component was weakly conceived from the beginning and was\n            never adequately integrated into supervision mission\n            objectives; (iii)further, the coupling of disbursement on\n            investment components with policy requirements for the\n            second tranche release proved to be an inappropriate design,\n            as recognized in eventually de-linking the two components;\n            (iv) in fact, the problem arose due to delay in passage of a\n            draft law through the National Assembly, as required for\n            second tranche release; and (v) finally, there were no\n            monitoring indicators established for the investment\n            component, which resulted in some slippage in execution of\n            works, and weak capacity to evaluate the early phase\n            operations of sub-project components."}, "docdt": "1996-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
