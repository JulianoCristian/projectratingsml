program. The principal objective of the program is to\n            maintain the growth rate of agriculture at a time of reduced\n            public resources. To achieve this objective, actions will be\n            taken to: (i) reform the price, marketing and institutional\n            framework; (ii) reorient the public investment program in\n            agriculture; (iii) strengthen the role of agriculture\n            support services including rationalizing the role of the\n            public sector; (iv) improve management of the natural\n            resources of land, forests and fisheries; and (v) build up\n            the institutional capacity for sector performance monitoring\n            and impact analysis. The foreign exchange provided by the\n            loan will be used to finance: (i) a positive list of\n            agricultural inputs needed to stimulate agricultural\n            production; and (ii) part of the foreign exchange cost of\n            agricultural projects and programs."}, "docdt": "1989-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
