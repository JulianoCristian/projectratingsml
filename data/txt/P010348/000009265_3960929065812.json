strengthen irrigation institutions.  The project consists\n            of: (a) Stage III of the ongoing Bhairawa Lumbini\n            Groundwater Project, which would include construction of 73\n            new tubewells, completion works for 16 Stage II tubewells,\n            and modification of 64 Stage I tubewells; (b) expansion of\n            the irrigation \"line of credit\" pilot projects\n            started under Mahakali II; and (c) institutional development\n            support for the Department of Irrigation (DOI) which would,\n            inter alia, strengthen DOI district and regional offices,\n            support development of DOI's new Planning, Design and\n            Research Division, strengthen DOI internal administration\n            and management functions, and support a farmer participatory\n            joint management pilot program in selected DOI schemes."}, "docdt": "1990-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
