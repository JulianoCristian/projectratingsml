MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THIE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR A FFBTH EDUCATION PROJECr
1.           I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Senegal for SDR 29.1 million, the equivalent of US$40.0 million,
on standard IDA tms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance an education project. Ihe Government
and local communities would contribute US$28.1 million equivalent. Cofinancing estiaed at 10 million
DM (US$5.8 milion equivalent) is expected from the German Goverment (KfW).
2.           Counta Economic Backgound. Like other Sahelian countries, Senegal's economy
depends heavily on externa! fimding, has limited natural resources, a deteriorating agricultura base, a
high population growth rate (3.0% p.a.) and a poorly educated labor force. Per capita GNP in 1991 was
estimated at US$720. By usual measures of well-being Oiteracy, school attendance, infant mortality, and
life expectancy, for example), Senegal falls below the generally poor indicators for Sub-Saharan Africa.
The economy is dependent on the traditional mainstays of millet cultivation and cattle for domestic
consumption, and groundnut production, fishing and phosphates for export, making the economy
vulnerable to climatic vagaries and adverse movements in international commodity markets.
3.           Over the past decade, the Government has been strugglingto reverse economic stagnation.
In the wake of a short-lived boom in groundnut and phosphae export earnings in the mid-1970s, the
Government embarked on an ambitious infrastructure investment program and expanded public
enterprises, creating an unsustainably large resource gap. The gap was exacerbated by two severe
drought years in the mid-1970s, a drastic fall in world market groundnut prices, and a sharp rise in
petroleum import prices. Distortions in the structure of economic incentives, including price controls,
import restrictions and excessive regulation of the economy, also contributed to thae stagnation.
Consumption growth by Government (6.5% p.a.) and the private sector (5.0% p.a.) outstripped the
growth in GDP (3% p.a. in 1974-78) so that, by 1979, the savings rate had turned negative. The spurt
in expenditure was sustained by external borrowing, often for investments in non-productive assets.
Between 1975 and 1980, disbursed Government and Government-guaramteed commercial debt incrased
more ta two-fold.
4.           In response to the crisis, since 1980, the Government has implemented a series of
adjustment programs through which It has liberalized the economy, reduced distortions in the agriculturl
and industi  sectors, strengthened public investment programming, initiated reforms in the public
enteprise sector, restructured the banking sector, and put in place a more prudent extnl debt
maagement policy.' Both fiscal and extemal balances have improved significandy and inflation has
*       been restrained to under 3% a year. Ptoblems remain, however. Progress in implementing structura
adjustment measures has been slow. Small and medium size enterprises remain severely constrained by
lack of access to credit and by high labor costs, and frequent policy changes have discouraged new
*       investment. Real wages of farmers, labor productivity, and per capita food production have fallen due
to declining soil fertility in the main growing region (the Groundmnt Basin), high popuation growth, and
the consequent expansion of farming into marginal lands where yields are lower. Crtical expenditures
on supportng infrtucture have lagged, stagnation of the private sector and slower growth of the public
sector have depressed incomes in urban areas, and the competitiveness of the economy remains weak.

5.           The Government's overriding objectives as set out in its "Medium-Term Economic and
Fincial Policy Framework Paper (1990191-1992193)" are to achieve an annual growth rate of real GDP
of 3.5% and end the need for balace-of-payments financing. The framework emphasizes continued
promotion of the private sector and efficiency improvements in public sector resource management. On
the structural side, the stategy aims to put in place a comprehensive agricultural policy, further liberalize
the labor market, introduce greater flexibility in wage setting, reduce the cost of energy, and accelerate
public enterprise reform. On the financW front, the program aims to improve the efficiency of tax
admiistration, increase the private sector's access to credit, and reduce the civil service wage bill.
Budgetary allocations for the maintenance of Infrastructure, basic education, and primary health care are
expected to lncreae in order to provide the necessary foundations for sustainable development. la the
health sector, the Government is undertakingg measures to improve the efficiency and coverage of health
care, focusing on materna and child care aud essential medicines. In education, the Governent's main
long-term objective is to provide primary education for all school-aged chidren. To this end, the
Government plans to allocate sufficient resources to primary education to cover the cost of teachers'
salaries and of instructional materials and sup,plies.
6.           &d. The Government's Education and Training policy is based on the
work of a national conference on education (Etats Gbzdrauz) held in 1981. The conference's
recommendations were translated into a stey for education reform adopted by the Government in 1985
which has guided sector development since then. The reform program generally aims to make the
education system more equitable, effective, efficient and responsive to national development needs, and
specifically aims to attain universal primary education. ITe Government has made some progress in
implementing this program. Due to a moderate expansion of capacity combined with the application of
effidency measures (double-shift teaching in urban schools and multigrade teaching in rural schools),
public primary school enrollments increased at a rate of about 3.5% a year between 1985/86-1990/91,
contributing to an increasb in the primary enrollment ratio from 54% to 58% over that time.
7.           Factos both external and internal to the education system, however, have und.riued
its suanable development. Externally, slow economic growth, declining government budgets, and
competi  priorities during the 1980s, combined with a high school-age population growth rate, have
constained the Governmentes capacity to meet the rising demand for education and maintain its quality.
Within the sector itself, school expansion, quality, and efficiency have suffered from heavy dependence
on cenral Govermment finacing, inadequate planning, management and use of resources, and a filure
to develop and implement sound sectoral policies, especially in higher education. As a result, access to
primary education remains limited and inequitably distributed across regions, between urban and rural
areas, and between girls and boys, and the quality of education at all levels is poor.
8.            TMjct OWectives The Government's education development program for the period
1993-98 aims mainly to expand access to, and the quality and efficiency of, primary education, with the
specific target of raising the primary enrollment ratio from 58% in 1992 to 65% by 1998 while improving
equity in access. The proposed project would assist the Government to cary out this program by
supporfting ongoing policy reforms and by financing primary classroom construction in the most
educationally underserved regions as well as programs to boost girls' enrollment and improve the quality
of education. Secondary objectives of the project include improving the quality and efficiency of
secondary and higher education and stegthening education sector planning and management. Ptogress
in achieving these objectives will be assessed against monitoring indicators that have been developed and
agreed upon with the Govemment which include annual targets for classroom constuction, teacher
recruitnent and deployment, girls' enrollment, rates of repetition and double-shifting, and student:staff
ratios.
9.            adfe  Descrit. The proposed project would be a specific investment credit,
operatng within an agreed policy framework designed to support measures in primary education to



-3-
contain costs, diversify sources of financing, and reduce Inquities bet veen urban and rur  areas, and
between boys and girls; in secondary and higher education to improve intenal efficiency; and in sector
planning and management, to decentralize education planning, adminisuiaon and supervision to the
regional and departmentl levels in an efort to make the system more resposive to local needs. With
respect to investmens, the project would finance those designed to: (a) expand access to primary
education and improve Its quality by supportng the construction of about 1,310 new classrooms in the
six most educationly underserved regions (i.e., those with primary enrollment rados below 45%), the
rehabiltion of 1,080 classrooms, special measurs to boost girls' enrollment, a textbook supply and
distibution prgram, in-service and pre-service teacher training, school improvement liniatives, and a
program to assess the impact of the educational system on leaning outcomes; (b) improve the quality and
efficiency of secondary and higher education by funding studies leading to a long-term development
program for general secondary education, and providing modest support for urgently needed physical
improvements in the short-run; and (c) strengthen sector and project management and planning capacities.
Total project costs are estimated at $US72.8 million. The cost estimates and disbursement plans are
shown in Schedules A and B, respectively.2
10.           .je¢ ImAMOMen. Day-to-day management and implementation of each project
component would be carried out by designated units in the Ministry of National Education (MEN). The
Project Coordinatng Unit (PCU) within the MEN would be responsible for day-to-day coordination of
project acdvities, administrative and financial matters, monitoring project imple on and outcomes,
and inter-agency coordination. Responsibility for managing the primary classroom construction program
would be delegated by the MEN to the Agence d 'Exdcuon des Traaww d'l-u&  Public (AGEI), a
non-govement  contract management agency. The project's policy measures are integrad in the
various components and will be implemented by the respective MEN units, with the PCU providing a
monioring and advisory finction. The project is expected to be completed over a five-year peiod; the
IDA credit would be disbursed over six years. Senegal's standard disbursement profile is seven years.
11.            W      l     ty. Four aspects of the project's design promote the sustainabiity
of the programs beyond project completion. First, efficiency measures introduced in primary, secm.dary
ad higher education and in teacher training will ensure a more cost-effective use of availale resources.
Second, the application of cost recovery for primary school textbooks is ewpected to result in a self-
financing supply of teubooks for all primary school children. Third, the program to support quWality
improvement initiatives at the school level and the classroom construction and rehabilitation components
of the project support the participation of NGOs, communites and the private sector, thereby helping to
broaden the resource base for education. Fourth, assuming that the education budget grows at the same
rate over the projer" period as it has over the past years, the Government should be able to fiance the
recurrent costs generated by the project through its budgetary resources and through cost savings resuting
from the project.
12.              L eared. ITis would be the fifth education project in Senegal. Ihe firstthree
projects (Cr. 253-SE, US$2.0 mfllion, 1971; Cr. 530-SE, US$15.0 million, 1975; and Cr. 908-SE/SAC
11-SE, US$26.5 million, 1979), all completed, provided support mainly for post-primary tedcnical and
agriculturl education. The fourth project (Cr. 1735-SE, US$12.0 millIon, 1987), under impl,
supports primarg education development and a sector adjustme program where good progress has been
made in itroducing efficiency measures. Double-shift and mwltigrade taching have resulted In a more
efficient use of teachers and failities, and central aminonhas been downsized by the redeploymen
of some 1,300 administraors to primary teaching posts.

13.          From an operational perspective, completion reports for the first three projects reported
delays in contract awards and inadequate coordination and monitoring capacities. Implementation of the
ongoing project has been constrained by linking disbursements for investments in primary education to
roductions in spending for higher education (which has proven difficult to achieve, especially those
regarding cuts in student subsidies), and by weak capacities and inefficient procedures of the concerned
Government departments to undertake a relatively modest (400 classrooms) school construction program.
Ihe proposed project addresses these problems by requiring up-front imnr'ementation of a set of policy
meaures in higher education as a condition of negotiations. delinldng sub-sectoral investments from the
implementation of policy refrms in other sub-sectors, and delegating responsibility for school
construction from Government to a non-governmental agency under management contract.
14.          Rationale for IDA Involvemen. The rationale for the proposed project is consistent
with the Bank's country strategy as discussed on May 21, 1992 in conjunction with the Board presentation
of the Second Public Works and Employment Project. The country strategy im  mainly to promote
competitiveness, establish the basis for self-sustained growth, improve management capacity in the public
sector (particularly in areas such as poverty alleviation and the environment), and promote health and
educational services to ensure that a healthy and educated labor force is avaflable to contribute to and
susain development. The focus of the proposed project on expanding access to primary education,
particularly for girls, is expected to increase literacy rates, improve productivity and health care, and
provide a labor force better equipped to adapt to changing economic trends. The proposed project also
forms part of our overall education strategy which emphasizes sustained policy dialogue with the
Government on sectoral issues, the importance of primary education to national development, expanding
access to education for the most disadvantaged groups, supporting the implementation of efficiency
measures in the sector, and mobilizing donor support for sector investments. Future Bank support for
the sector includes operations in vocational training and higher education.
15.          .ged Adions. As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Government would: (a) sign
a contract with AGEIIP for the management of primary classroom construction financed under the
project; (b) adopt an operational plan, satisfactory to IDA, for the distribution and sales of textbooks,
includim! draft contracts with disibutors and booksellers, and provisions for an anna audit of the
texbook revolving fimd; (c) establish the PCU, with the director and four senior professional staff in
post; (d) frnish to IDA bid documents for civil works and furniture for the first year of the primary
school construction program, and for civil works for the teacher training colleges, inspectorates, collkges,
and bycte libraries; (e) appoint an independent auditor under a multi-year contract acceptable to IDA; and
(f) provide IDA with the audits reports required pursuant to the Development Credit Agreements for the
following credits: First Energy Sector Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1710-SE), Financial Sector Adjustment
Credit (Cr. 2077-SE), and the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2090-SE). As a conditongf
M M=  for School Development Fund (SDF), the Government would (a) adopt terms of reference
satisftory to IDA for the operation of the SDF, including an implementation timetable and a draft
manual of procedures (containing proposal evaluation criteria and a list of allowable expenditures), and
(b) employ an auditor, with qualifications and experience, and under terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA, to conduct smi-amual technical audits of the SDF operations.
16.          Ensironmental Aset. This is a Category C project, without any direct impact on the
enviromnent. Classrooms and latrines would be sited and constructed following design stdards and
procedures already approved by the Bank under the ongoing education project (Cr. 1735-SE). School
buildings, being smal and located on vacant Government or community property, do not displace anyone.
17.         "troj  - 2b          Categoe. The project responds to the human resource development
and antipoverty objectives of the Government. Increasing primary enrollment, particularly in rural areas
and among girls, increases opportunities and productivity among the most disadvantaged groups, lowers



-5 -
Ifnt mortality, improves health and mntrition, and results in higher levels of education and improved
living standards in succeeding generations.
18.          hut Bnfit  Project benefits would be widespread. Over tue five-year period 1993-
1998, the project would provide about 65,000 additional student places in the five regions where access
to primary education is lowest, representing a capacity increase of 2bout 30% in these regions, mostly
(77%) in rural arew. Impl ion of the Government's fill progm supported by the project would
provide about 200,000 additional student places resulting in an enrollment increase of about 25% over
the life of the project. Mutually reinforcing qualitative improvements, in the fornm of better trained
teachers, an adequate supply of textbooks, more effective supervision by inspectors, ad student
assessment and feedback, would improve internal efficiency, reduce wastage and improve the quality of
learning. Achievement of these objectives will be closely monitored according to a set of indicators that
have been developed and agreed upon with the Government. Ihe project would also introduce several
innovative measures, with possible far-reaching effects, such as: (a) the introduction of an experimental
"School Development Fund," designed to finance quality Improvements initiated and developed by
schools; (b) well-targeted measures and programs to boost girls' primary school enrollment in
department where girls comprise less than 41% (the nationa average) of enrollment; (c) establishment
of a sustainable supply of good quality primary textbooks, expected to benefit all primary school children,
through delegation of textbook production, distribution and sales to the private sector and institution of
a cost recovery system; (d) increased delegation of responsibility for education planning, management
and administration from the central ministry to regional and departmental offices in an effort to make the
system more responsive to local necds which, in the long run, would benefit all schools; and (e) improve
the efficiency and lower the cost of classroom construction by delegating responsibility for school
construction management from the MEN to a non-governmental contract management agency. Local
communities would also be required to participate financially in school maintenance, reducing the burden
on the Government's budget.
19.          froiect RLIs. There are three main risks. Eiat. the Government's capacity to manage
a classroom construcdon program of the scope envisaged under the project is inadequate, as demonstrated
by long delays and high costs in school construction under the ongoing education project (Cr. 1735-SE).
This problem would be addressed by delegating responsibility for managing school construction to
AGETI. Second, the innovative programs proposed under the project, in particular the *School
Development Fund' program and programs to boost girls' participation, are risky and may not fuily reach
their objectives. Risks in these areas would be addressed by careful monitoring of program development
during the first year of the project and by structured annual reviews of progress, with the expectation that
the programs would require modifications during project implementation. Third, full cost recovery for
textbooks may not be feasible and Govenment may be required to partly subsidize their provision.
Preliminary studies indicate, however, that parents are willing to pay provided that books of good quality
are available at a reasonable cost when needed. The project would take great care in assuring the
reliability of the supply network, turning to the private sector to handle all distribution and sales
activities, against agreed profit margins.
20.           qMmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Imglement3dgn Issues
Of the sixteen credits curreny disbursing, five below have significant disbursement lags.
1.    J adusWa Sector Rng (Cr. 1868-SEN). The credit became effective on October 31,
1988, almost nine months after signing. About US$10 million have been disbursed. Disbursements
under the line of credit (about 90% of the IDA credit) began only in October 1990 after an amendment
to the credit agreement to facilitate its use. The new procedures allowed participating banks to submit
subprojects directly to the Bank. Previously, bottlenecks had occurred because the banks were required
to go through one financial intermediary which acted as interlocutor with the Bank. Currendy,
commitments total approximately 70% of the line of credit.
2.    Municpd Housing Development Project (Cr. 1884-SEN). The credit became effective on
November 3, 1988, five monts after signing. About US$22 million have been disbursed.
Disbursements have been slow due to the cumbersome procurement procedures and inadequate
counterpart fiuding. In response, the Senegalese have agreed to use sample bidding documents already
approved by the Bank, and arrangements are being made to ensure adequate and more timely provision
of counterpart funds. Disbursements are expected to pick up.
3.    Devel== Manaee t PWec (Cr. 1910-SEN). The credit became effective on March 6,
1989, nine months after signing. About US$9 million have been disbursed. In 1990, the project
components were trimmed to a manageable number to increase the effectiveness of the reform effort.
At that time it was decided ta other issues would be dealt with on an ad hoc basis. A review of project
implementation for the 1988-92 period is currendy underway which may highlight other administrative
reform measures to which the project may contribute. For now, adoption of an integrated training
program to be financed under the credit should accelerate disbursements for this component. On the
procedural side, the project unit has not been preparing replenishment requests as early as it should and
it has been agreed that the unit will accelerate the rhythm of their preparation.
4.    Second Small Rural Operations Project (Cr. 1992-SEN). The credit became effective on June
7, 1989, two monts after signing. About US$9 million have been disbursed. During the past two years,
oversight of the project has been transferred from one ministry to another resulting in delays in project
implementtion and unauthorized deviations from the project development objectives. Following
numerous communications and missions by the Bank disbursements were suspended in August 1992. The
Government agreed with the conclusions of the mid-term review mission which informed the Borrower
that the credit would be cancelled unless certain institutional restructuring measures were implemented
to put the project back on tracL Although the Government agreed with the conclusions of the mid-term
review mission these measures have not been taken. Bank staff have recommended cancellation of the
remaining US$ .4 million.
5.    Second Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 2107-SEN).  The credit became effective on
January 23, 1991, nine months after signing. About US$2 million have been disbursed. The project had
a very slow start due to cumbersome procedures for procurement and for disbursements from the Special
Account. Implementation also suffered from persistent weaknesses in accounting and financial
management. A new accounting system is being implemented which should improve financial
management. The Ministry of Finance has agreed to increase the level of the imprest account which
should facilitate project execution. As a result, the procurement process has also improved as project
staff have been able to focus on implementing procedures properly. Disbursements are expected to pick
up given new commitments under the credit.
