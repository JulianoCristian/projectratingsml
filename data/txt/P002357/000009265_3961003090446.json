program for the\n            period 1993-98 which aims mainly to improve access to, and\n            the quality and efficiency, of primary education, with the\n            specific targets of raising the primary enrollment ratio\n            from 58% in 1992 to 65% by 1988.  Secondary objectives\n            include improving the quality and efficiency of secondary\n            and higher education and strengthening education sector\n            planning and management.  To achieve these objectives, the\n            project supports policy measures:  (a) in primary education\n            to contain costs, diversify sources of financing, and reduce\n            inequities between urban and rural areas, and between boys\n            and girls; (b) in secondary education to improve internal\n            efficiency; and (c) in sector planning and management, to\n            decentralize education planning, administration and\n            supervision to the regional and departmental levels.  In\n            addition, the project will finance investments designed to:\n            (a) expand access to primary education and improve its\n            quality and efficiency; (b) improve the quality and\n            efficiency of secondary and higher education; and (c)\n            strengthen sector planning and management capacities."}, "docdt": "1993-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
