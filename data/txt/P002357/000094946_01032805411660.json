development\n            impacts are substantial. Lessons stress the importance of\n            careful analyses of poverty data, for it lays the foundation\n            for cost-sharing proposals, and contributions, which no\n            matter how relatively small these may seem, it may however\n            translate into a major burden for family budgets. The\n            efficacy of project implementation units (PIUs) should\n            uniquely lie, on an ad hoc basis, to streamline, and\n            accelerate project specific procedures; however, some PIUs\n            evolve into seemingly, powerful entities. Therefore, the\n            development of institutional capacity within existing\n            services, is suggested, including the dissolution of this\n            PIU, but reintegrating its staff into line directorates.\n            Conversely, the volunteer teacher program is a good example\n            of a naturally assimilated reform, whose acceptance -\n            through African educators - is growing in other countries in\n            the sub-region. In addition, school construction could be\n            more competitive, by providing opportunities to small and\n            medium enterprises who possess technical competence, and,\n            school book distribution schemes could profit from adequate\n            private sector incentives. Moreover, the school development\n            fund proved that disbursement flexibility to poorly educated\n            groups, empowers them in identifying their needs, and in\n            turn, provides timely information assistance for project implementation."}, "docdt": "2001-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
