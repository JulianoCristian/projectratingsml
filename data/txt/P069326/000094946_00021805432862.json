support\n            the government's program to reform sector governance.\n            There are four project components. The first 1) helps\n            improve essential infrastructure for inter- and\n            intra-university information technology networks, management\n            information systems, modern library systems, and faculty\n            training; and 2) supports the Higher Education Development\n            Fund (HEDF), which allocates investment funding for\n            university-based academic and entrepreneurial sub-projects,\n            information technology, proposals, and faculty development\n            centers. The second component improves governance by\n            supporting the Higher Education Council's Secretariat,\n            the Higher Education Accreditation Council; and university\n            management and planning. The third component helps reform\n            the community college system by developing new programs and\n            human resources, and upgrading facility and equipment. The\n            fourth component supports project implementation capacity by\n            funding staffing and equipment."}, "docdt": "2000-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
