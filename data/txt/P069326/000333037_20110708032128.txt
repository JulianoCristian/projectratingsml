                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the Government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covering two education
projects in Jordan. The first operation, the Higher Education Development Project, was
financed through IBRD Loan No. 4539-JO in the amount of US$34.7 million and a
planned government contribution of US$31.1 million. The loan was approved on
February 29, 2000, became effective on October 7, 2000, and was closed on June 30,
2007, one and a half years after the original closing date.

The second operation, the Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy Project, was
financed through IBRD Loan No.7170-JO in the amount of US$120 million, a planned
donor contribution of US$120 million, and a planned government contribution of
US$130 million. The loan was approved on May 8, 2003, became effective on May 28,
2003, and closed on June 30, 2009, one and a half years after the original closing date.

This PPAR was prepared by Maurice Boissiere, IEG consultant. The findings are largely
based on a two-week mission to Jordan from October 17 - 28, 2010. The mission met
with education authorities in Jordan as well as private business people. The mission
visited schools in Amman and Irbid as well as a number of universities. A list of persons
met is in Annex C. The mission also examined: (a) World Bank project files; (b) project
related reporting and evaluation; and (c) education studies with data by government,
other development partners, and civil society organizations, as well as the relevant
research literature.

IEG gratefully acknowledges the logistical assistance and support of the Ministry of
Planning and International Cooperation, especially Eng. Lamia Al Zou’bi (Head of
Evaluation Division) and Ms. Sana Elhennawi (Senior Evaluator, Impact Assessment
Unit) for expediting the work of the mission. A special acknowledgement is also due to
Ms. Firyal Aqel of the Ministry of Education and Ms. Buthaina Alshare of the Ministry
of Higher Education and Research for their support. Many other ministry and university
officials were generous with their time, especially in arranging visits to project sites.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft PPAR was sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and feedback. Their comments are
presented in Annex E.

Summary
The objective of this PPAR is to assess the development effectiveness and lessons arising
from two education projects in Jordan. The Higher Education Development Project
(HEDP), with a total cost of US$65.8 million and a loan of US$34.7 million, was
approved on February 29, 2000.The Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy
Project (ERfKE), with a total cost of US$370 million and a loan of US$120 million, was
approved on May 8, 2003.

With a Gross National Income per capita of $3,310 (2008), the economy of Jordan
depends very much upon remittances from its skilled labor working abroad in the oil-rich
countries of the region and external grants/loans from international and regional partners.
During the 1970s the economy showed robust economic growth in the range of 10
percent per year, driven by high oil prices and remittances from Jordanian workers
abroad. However, during the 1980s, especially after oil prices dropped, Jordan
experienced a difficult economic period. After working through an IMF adjustment
program the economy stabilized, but the robust growth of the 1970s has not yet resumed.
In recent years the Kingdom enjoyed good economic growth of about 6 to7 per cent
annually, except for a slowdown in 2009 with the onset of the global financial crisis.

Despite this good macroeconomic growth, there are still persistent problems with high
unemployment (12.1 percent in 2008), even among university graduates (17.7 percent in
2005, falling to 12 percent in 2008). Partly this is due to rapid population and labor force
growth, which requires even higher rates of economic growth. However, there is
evidence that this unemployment problem also has structural causes rooted in mismatches
between job expectations and skills needed in the growing economy. Thus, the education
system is in need of reforms to produce skills needed for the global knowledge economy.

Based upon concerns about the declining quality of higher education, the government
requested the Bank to conduct an in-depth study, resulting in the “Jordan Higher
Education Development Study” (1996), which also set the stage for preparation of the
Higher Education Development Project (2000). Many of the issues in Jordan are shared
with higher education reforms world-wide, as shown in the Bank’s 1994 policy paper,
“Higher Education: The Lessons of Experience”. The policy paper identified a package
of reform elements that the Bank regarded as “best practice.” Adapting this “best
practice” package to the Jordanian situation began with project preparation in 1997 and
led to HEDP, which is based on the Jordanian Higher Education Study and the Bank
Higher Education policy paper recommendations.

The HEDP, financed by a of US$34.7 million, was approved by the Bank in February
2000 and became effective in October 2000. The project closed in December 2007 after
an extension of 18 months. The objective of the project was to: “initiate improvements in
the quality, relevance and efficiency of higher education in Jordan and support the
Government’s program to reform sector governance.” The project aimed to achieve these
objectives by investing in Information Communication Technology (ICT), scientific
equipment and faculty training needed to upgrade university academic programs, as well
as a Management Information System (MIS) to improve system-wide efficiency. The
reform program for sector governance aimed at increasing relevance by strengthening
                                             x


recently created governance structures such as the Higher Education Accreditation
Council for quality assurance and the Higher Education Council for overall policy
making. The system of community colleges under the oversight of Al Balqa Applied
University (BAU) was to be reformed to improve links to the labor market.

The overall outcome of the HEDP is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. The objectives
of the project are relevant to the human resources pillar of the Country Assistance
Strategy and project design was substantially relevant. Some improvements in quality
resulted from provision of much needed ICT equipment for teaching and learning and
some changes in teaching methods. However, the reforms of governance fell short of
most of their objectives. The HEC did not implement the formula funding for recurrent
budgets, the MIS needed for the formula funding was not completed, the competitive
fund for new academic programs only became fully competitive near the end of the
project, and the reforms of the community colleges under the oversight of BAU to
improve labor market relevance were not completed. Thus, the objectives for quality,
relevance, efficiency, and governance were only modestly attained. The risk to
development outcome is moderate since there are many outstanding issues in reform to
be addressed. The performance of the Bank was moderately unsatisfactory, given the
long delays in preparation and insufficient focus on reforms during supervision. The
performance of the Borrower was moderately unsatisfactory based upon insufficient
leadership for the reforms during implementation.

Preparation for the Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy Project began in May
2002. The loan of US$120.0 million was approved in May 2003 and became effective a
few weeks afterwards. This project closed in June 2009 after a six month extension. The
objective of the project was to: “assist the Borrower in improving the quality, relevance
and efficiency of its early childhood, basic and secondary school education systems, so as
to produce the graduates with skills necessary for the knowledge economy.” The project
aimed to achieve these objectives by developing a new comprehensive vision and
strategy for basic and secondary education, developing new curricula and training
teachers, upgrading the learning environment in schools, and promoting early childhood
education. The skills needed for the knowledge economy were interpreted to cover the
broad cognitive competencies of critical thinking and creative problem-solving, as
opposed to memorizing masses of facts.

On balance, the overall outcome of the ERfKE project is rated satisfactory. Relevance of
project objectives and design and efficiency of the project are rated substantial. The
project objectives are relevant to the human resources pillar of the CAS, which also
emphasizes the knowledge economy. The Ministry of Education produced a new
curriculum for all grades, and completed the final roll-out stage in 2008. Textbooks,
teachers’ guides, and e-learning materials in key subject areas supplemented the
curriculum. The target of training 50,000 teachers in basic ICT skills was exceeded, in
that 85,118 teachers were trained and 55,000 were certified, compared with a baseline of
5,000 trained ICT teachers in 2003. By project closing, 80 percent of Jordan’s schools
were connected to the Internet, exceeding the target of 70 percent. In addition, almost all
schools now have at least basic ICT equipment. Classroom construction and renovations
somewhat reduced crowding, contributing to an improved learning environment,
although overcrowding still remains a challenge.

Results on a number of indicators, including performance on learning assessments, show
improvements from the new curricula, learning materials, and teacher training. The
results of the 2008 National Assessment for the Knowledge Economy learning evaluation
showed a clear improvement in performance in math, science, and reading. Information
from IEG interviews with private sector enterprises suggests improvement in those areas
of knowledge economy skills that are desired by Jordanian employers with, an increase in
the proportion of computer literate graduates entering the labor force.

An education management information system was completed but required further fine-
tuning. At project closing, it was not yet ready to play its critical role within the education
decision support system, which, in turn, was intended to be one of the major instruments
to improve efficiency. Consequently, although the design of Education Decision Support
System was completed, its utilization had to be put on hold for the next phase of the
ERfKE program (which is supported under a follow-on project). Major outputs were
produced to support evidence-based strategic policy and planning, although these are not
yet used for decision-making. The project costs were kept reasonable and, in some areas,
cases showed substantial cost savings. The performance of the Bank was satisfactory at
entry and during supervision, as the Bank team was proactive in identifying and resolving
project issues. The performance of the Borrower was satisfactory, based on the high
level of leadership and the efficient implementation by the Ministry of Education team.
Lessons

A number of lessons can be highlighted based upon the experience of these two projects.

      The continuing high unemployment rates among university graduates is a cause
       for concern, despite attempts to make higher education more relevant. Although
       limited progress has been made, the higher education system can do much more to
       improve quality and relevance, including becoming actively linked in real time
       with the labor market and economy. More up-to-date labor market information is
       needed as well as much more private sector representation in the governance of
       universities and community colleges.
      Despite the problems in the first two rounds of the competitive Higher Education
       Development Fund, the modest success of the third round demonstrated that such
       competitive funding mechanisms can work in Jordan, if time and care are taken to
       adapt them to local circumstances.

      The difficulties experienced in the formula funding arrangement for recurrent
       higher education budgets were both technical and political (in terms of getting
       stakeholder consensus). The technical part has to do with establishing a good
       MIS and the design for this has been completed. Although this reform measure
       did not come to pass, it generated useful debate and may still be feasible if more
       political effort is forthcoming.

      The emphasis on critical thinking and creative problem-solving at each level
       means that some mutual adjustments are needed. Higher education curricula need
                                    xii


to continue adapting to the new secondary graduates and the admission
procedures for higher education need to adapt to the criteria of the knowledge
economy.

1. Background and Context
1.1     The objective of this PPAR is to assess the development effectiveness and lessons
arising from two projects related to higher education reforms and the knowledge
economy in Jordan, spanning about a decade of World Bank support. The Higher
Education Development Project (HEDP), with a total cost of US$65.8 million and a
loan amount of US$34.7 million, was approved on February 29, 2000 and closed June 30,
2007. The Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy Project (ERfKE), with a
total cost of US$370 million and a loan amount of US$120 million, was approved on
May 8, 2003 and closed June 30, 2009.

Jordan’s economy and employment issues
1.2      The modern day Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, with a population of about 6
million (2008), covers a geographic area with rich and ancient history going back to
earliest ancient times of the Middle East. The Kingdom has many sites from ancient
Mesopotamian times to Greek and Roman times and afterwards. As a modern nation-
state, Jordan was formed after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World
War I and has enjoyed relative domestic stability in a region noted for instability. This
stability and the forward looking attitude of its government, a constitutional monarchy
under King Abdullah II, led to a strategy that emphasizes development of its human
resources, given its lack of oil and natural resources, except for potash, some phosphates.
There is also considerable potential from tourism sites based upon its ancient heritage.

1.3     With GNI per capita of $3,310 in (2008), the economy of Jordan depends very
much upon remittances from its skilled labor working abroad in the oil rich countries of
the region and external grants/loans from international and regional partners. About one-
third of the labor force was working abroad throughout the past decade with their
remittances accounting for around 15 percent of GDP during 2004 - 2008. Agriculture
plays a small but important role (about four percent of GDP), limited very much by
arable land and shortages of water. The modern service sector, including a growing
tourism sector, is becoming more important at about two-thirds of GDP, and industry,
especially mining and construction contributes the remaining 30 percent. After the June
1967 Arab-Israeli war, Jordan had to make major adjustments, and during the 1970s
managed to enjoy robust economic growth in the range of 10 percent annually as oil
prices and remittances from Jordanian workers abroad drove economic growth.
However, during the 1980s, especially after oil prices dropped, Jordan experienced a
difficult economic period. After working through an IMF adjustment program the
economy stabilized, but the robust growth of the 1970s has not yet resumed. In recent
years the Kingdom enjoyed good economic growth of about 6 to7 percent annually
except for a slowdown in 2009 with the onset of the global financial crisis.

1.4     Despite good macroeconomic growth, Jordan is still experiencing high
unemployment rates, while at the same time employing low skilled foreign labor in some
sectors. The unemployment rate, defined according to International Labor Organization
standards as the ratio of those not employed but seeking work to the total labor force, has
been high overall for the past decade, rising from 13.7 percent in 2000 to a peak of 15.3
                                                 2


percent in 2002 and declining to 12.1 percent in 2008. Among university graduates, for
example, the unemployment rate reached 17.7 percent in 2005, higher than the 14.4
percent for community college graduates and the 11.1 percent for secondary graduates in
the same year. In 2008 the unemployment rate for university graduates was still high, at
12 percent. To some degree this is structural as the foreign labor is unskilled and
employed in occupations such as maids and domestic service that would not fit with
Jordanian traditions. Other unskilled occupations in construction were done in the past
by Jordanians, but rising expectations have led to young Jordanians avoiding heavy
manual labor. The Bank’s Labor Market Report (2008) finds that much of the youth
unemployment is rooted in social attitudes and expectations among educated youth, often
times unrealistic. In this respect, young Jordanians may be adopting attitudes seen in the
oil rich economies of the Gulf Cooperation Council, such as Saudi Arabia or Kuwait,
even though Jordan has no such source of income. Since there was not an extensive
unemployed insurance program until the recent Social Security Law of 2010, most
unemployed youth are supported by their families while they wait to find what they
consider an appropriate job in the domestic public sector or the oil economies of the Gulf
region.

1.5     However, more rapid economic growth is needed to create employment to match
the rapid population growth, still averaging around 2.5 percent per year. To address these
challenges, the government developed the National Agenda (2006), a comprehensive
strategic plan developed through a process of consultation with all stakeholders in
Jordanian society. The Bank’s 2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which supports
the National Agenda, estimated that economic growth in the range of 6 to7 percent
annually is needed over a sustained period to make a dent in the unemployment problem.
The government is hoping to develop high growth in some export sectors, having
concluded a Free Trade Agreement with the United States and an Association Agreement
with the European Union (EU), and also hopes to attract more foreign direct investment
as well. It recognizes that this means Jordanian workers must be seen as competitive in a
knowledge economy environment. The problem has been that many of the jobs created
have been in sectors like construction or textiles that do not demand high knowledge and
skills. The labor market and unemployment problems are rooted in both the macro-
economy and the structure of the demand and supply of and for educated labor, a problem
discussed in greater detail in later sections of this report.

Evolution of education policy
1.6     The Jordanian government for many years has supported a strong education
policy to develop its human resources, which it regards as the principal source of its
wealth. By 1960 Jordan already had established a reputation for efficiency in executing
public projects, such as roads, and had also set up an extensive elementary and secondary
school system. The first two-year teacher training colleges were established during the
1950s to provide teachers for this growing school system, and it was clear that a national
university was also needed.1 In 1961, the University of Jordan was established and now
the country has 10 public universities and 12 private ones. To promote scientific and

contains a time line of key events of education in Jordan.

technical progress the Royal Scientific Society was formed in 1968. During the 1980s
the teacher training colleges were transformed into a set of community colleges to
provide a broad range of practical training as well as to continue to provide teacher
training. In 1988 the requirements of entry level teachers for basic education were
upgraded to a four-year university degree, leaving the community colleges to serve
mainly as technical training colleges. Throughout all of these changes, the government
of Jordon has been trying to keep pace with the demographic pressure by continuously
building schools, but it has been forced to use rented facilities sometimes to
accommodate the surge in enrollment.

1.7    The education system has undergone rapid expansion over the past few decades
and access has improved almost to the point of universal primary education. Early
childhood education (ECE) includes kindergarten 1 and 2, typically for ages 4 and 5.
Basic education is compulsory and defined as grades 1 to 10, while grades 11 and 12
comprise secondary education, which ends with a General Secondary School Certificate
of Education (often referred to as the Tawjihi in Arabic). The Tawjihi is a high-stakes
exam, which is used for selection to university. The primary gross enrollment rate has
increased from 71 percent (1994) to 98.2 percent (2006). The transition rate to secondary
increased from 63 percent to 97 percent over the same period. The table below shows the
absolute increase in enrollment of the past decade.

Table 1.1: School Enrollment (2000-2010)
Level                                         2000            2010     Increase (annual)

1.8     University enrollment in 2007 was 218,900 in total, with 163,200 in public
universities and 55,700 in private ones. The public universities tend to be large - seven of
the ten have more than 10,000 students, including the University of Jordan with over
37,000 students in 2008. None of the private universities have more than 10,000
students. The 45 community colleges enrolled about 26,000 students in 2007. The gross
enrollment rate for the 18-25 year old population was 22 percent in 2006 compared to
18.5 percent in 2001. These represent significant achievements for a country that has
experienced such rapid population growth and absorbed waves of refugees from conflicts
in the region.

1.9      Not surprisingly this expansion of enrollments has translated into considerable
fiscal pressure on government resources. Overall, the government spends about 4.5
percent of GDP and 15 percent of public expenditures on education. However, only 14.7
percent of education expenditure is for higher education, which is about 0.65 percent of
GDP. In contrast, other middle income countries spend about 1.6 percent of GDP for
higher education. Relative to other countries, Jordan spends more on basic education,
reflecting in part the need to keep up with population growth. On the other hand, in
higher education finance, Jordanian society is more willing to contribute to cost recovery
via tuition and private education than are societies in Egypt and Yemen, where tuition
fees are unconstitutional. Cost recovery in Jordan makes up to some extent for reduced
                                                          4


government funding, which declined from JD 60.1 million (2004) to JD 45 million
(2007) while enrollments in public universities have more than tripled since 2001.

World Bank engagement
1.10     The Bank started support of education projects in Jordan in 1972, with a total of
16 projects approved since then, covering all levels of education. The early projects
focused on skilled manpower goals and school construction to increase access. By the
late 1980s, quality considerations came to the fore and sector work emphasized the need
for reform of the curricula and teacher training to overcome the outdated emphasis on
memorization of subject matter. In 1989, the first Human Resources Sector Investment
Loan (HRSIL1) was approved to initiate a 10-year program of education reform at the
elementary and secondary level. HRSIL2 followed in 1995 to continue the 10-year
program. These two projects focused on developing creative thinking and problem
solving skills, especially in improving educational performance in science and
mathematics. The Bank has also supported demand-driven vocational training (The
Employer Driven Skills Development Project ( 2008)) aimed at helping the Vocational
Training Corporation, which was established to oversee job training, and the Ministry of
Labor respond better to labor market demands.

1.11 Based upon concerns about the declining quality of its higher education, the
government requested that the Bank conduct an in-depth study, resulting in the “Jordan
Higher Education Development Study” (1996), which also set the stage for preparation of
the Higher Education Development Project (2000). The study identified many issues that
are still prominent on the agenda up to now. Many of the issues in Jordan are shared with
higher education reforms world-wide. The Bank’s 1994 policy paper on “Higher
Education: the Lessons of Experience” examined reforms in Europe and the US as well
as higher education reform projects in Asia, East Europe and Latin America and
Caribbean. The Bank policy paper identified a package of reform elements that the Bank
regarded as a “best practice” set of higher education reforms (Box 1-1). Adapting

Box 1-1. The World Bank’s Higher Education Reform Strategy
“Higher Education: the Lessons of Experience” (World Bank 1994) developed the elements of
the Bank’s higher education reform strategy, which include: university autonomy: accountability:
quality assurance and accreditation; transparent financinga usually under a finance council;
competition for research and investment funding, usually under a research council; differentiated
missions among colleges (short-cycle labor market) and universities (long cycle and research
programs); diversified finance, including some public subsidy; cost recovery via tuition and
loans; equity safeguards via student loans and scholarships; and overall system coordination and
oversight via some sort of higher education council or ministry. This “reform package” was
refined further in the Bank’s “Constructing Knowledge Societies: New Challenges for Tertiary
Education” (2002).

                                                       5


 this package to the Jordanian situation began in the 1997 Project Concept Document,
 which was followed by many studies in Jordan by international and local consultants
 supported by a Population and Human Development (PRHD) grant. It will be seen in the
 next section that the components of HEDP are derived almost directly from the
 Jordanian higher education Study and the Bank higher education policy paper.

1.12 There is still the widespread perception that the quality and relevance of higher
education in Jordan is below where it should be given the acceleration of international
mobility of professors and students and competition among national higher education
systems, and the slow progress in Jordanian higher education. The concern was
expressed by the academic community and the government that Jordanian economic
competitiveness was being reduced due to shortfalls in quality and relevance in the higher
education system. It is often mentioned in the press that universities in Jordan and the
Arab region as a whole are low in international rankings, such as in the Times Higher
Education Supplement, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, or Webometrics of the
Cybermetric Lab of the National Spanish Research Council (this is the largest, ranking
12,000 universities based upon information available via the Internet). Despite caveats
that such international rankings may not use standards relevant to Jordan’s aspirations
and situation, Jordanian academics are concerned about the perceived decline of the
higher education system. The Higher Education and Accreditation Commission (HEAC)
is starting work on its own system of ranking that would have more direct relevance for
Jordan.

1.13 Around this time the concept of a “knowledge economy” was also being brought
to the fore, partially through the 1999 World Development Report, the dissemination of
economic research on the contribution of knowledge to economic growth, and the rapid
development of the internet (Box 1-2). The knowledge economy concept fits in well with
the emphasis on critical thinking and problem solving in the first and second Human
Resources Sector Investment Loans (HRSIL), but in Jordan it was recognized that an
even greater push was needed beyond these approaches. Both schools and universities in
Jordan were lacking in sufficient quantity and quality of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) infrastructure along with the human resources base to make optimal
use of it. After starting up the HEDP project, preparation began on the ERfKE project
since it was believed that economic competitiveness would also be enhanced by
integrating the knowledge economy into the reform of basic education. After completing
HEDP, a Higher Education Reform for Knowledge Economy was prepared and approved
by the Bank (May 2009), but it was cancelled by the government

Box 1-2. Key Dimensions of the Knowledge Economy
The Bank’s flagship report on education in the Middle East and North Africa, “The Road
NotTaken” (2008), highlights the following four key dimensions of the Knowledge Economy: (1)
an incentives framework for acquiring and using knowledge; (2) an educated population capable
of responding to these incentives; (3) an innovative network of firms, universities, consultants,
research and other organizations that can acquire and adapt knowledge; and (4) a dynamic
information infrastructure that facilitates transfer and use of knowledge.

based upon budgetary concerns due to the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. The
Bank continued to support higher education through programmatic economic and sector
work on specific topics, such as the reform of the community colleges and student
financial aid.

1.14 By the time these two projects started, Jordan was thus in the position of having
provided almost universal access to education at all levels for its rapidly growing
population, except for early childhood education. Over-crowded schools are still a
concern in urban areas, while in rural areas schools are underutilized. The government is
also concerned about learning achievement and quality. The unemployment problems in
the labor market also gave rise to concerns about relevance of the education and
professional training being provided in higher education. The government believed that
the problems of the education sector were also related to management and governance
deficiencies in these sectors, hence the need to stress governance issues in the reform of
education. Moreover, having concluded trade agreements with European Union and the
United States, the government wanted to attract foreign direct investment and hoped a
more skilled and knowledge oriented labor force would play a key role. In an attempt to
improve role of community colleges in providing such labor force development, in 1997,
the government created the new Al Balqa Applied University that would oversee the
community college system as well as being a university in its own right. Thus, by this
time, the structure, and also the problems and challenges of the basic and higher
education system, that led up to the two Bank supported projects under review in this
PPAR were in place

1.15 The role of other donors has been important for the development of education in
Jordan, and the government and Ministry of Education have been exercising good
coordination of grants from a variety of donors. The largest donors have been the Arab
Fund for Economic and Social Development, Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), European Union (EU), United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the United Kingdom’s Department for International
Development (DFID), while others have carved out smaller specialty roles. JICA has
been important in support of the science curriculum, especially areas like physics.
Comprehensive data for all donor contributions to education is not available, but the
financial contributions to recent education projects give a picture of the pattern of grants.
For example, in the ERfKE project the EU contributed US$45 million, the Arab Fund
US$33 million, USAID US$26 million, CIDA US$ 17 million, and Islamic Bank US$23
million. However, most of the external donor involvement has been in the basic
education sector, with the exception of CIDA’s significant technical assistance for the
community college segment of the HEDP.

2. Higher Education Development Project, 2000-2007

Design
2.1     The Higher Education Development Project (HEDP) was approved on February
29, 2000 and became effective on October 7, 2000. It was financed by a US$34.7 million
IBRD loan with a planned government contribution of US$31.1 million. Although Jordan
was well-endowed with university graduates at the time the project was being prepared,
their skill mix and the nature of their teaching methods, which was based largely on
lecture and memorization, resulted in shortages of managerial and midlevel modern
technical skills which included innovative problem-solving capacity. The problems of
quality and efficiency at the university level were affecting Jordan's international
competitiveness. Universities and colleges lacked modern information technology
systems, laboratories and libraries required for modernizing programs of study. Teaching
was theoretical and most programs were not relevant to the needs of high-growth export
sectors. Enrollments in community colleges were declining sharply and unemployment
among graduates reached over 20 percent during the 1990s, although now it has lowered
to about 14 percent. The university sector lacked effective policy-making advisory boards
to assist decision makers in reforming the sector and making resource allocation
decisions. There was no strategy to link the allocation of resources in public university
programs to the needs of the labor market.

2.2     During the 1990s changes were initiated in the governance structure of the higher
education sector to make it more effective. The Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research was abolished in 1998, and the Higher Education Council (HEC),
which existed before as an advisory and policy making body to this Ministry, was kept as
the main the policy-making body. Universities had their own Boards of Trustees and
their role the governance was strengthened, while the Presidents of the universities were
responsible to the Boards of Trustees and for university administration. The Higher
Education Accreditation Council was started in 1998 to oversee the quality of higher
education, although at first it started its work with the private universities. On paper the
governance of Jordanian higher education was moving in the direction of the Jordanian
Higher Education Study (1996) cited in Chapter 1. In practice, the capacity and financial
resources of these institutions were lacking and the HEDP project was being prepared to
address these concerns.

2.3     The Project Development Objective, as stated in both the Loan Agreement and
Project Appraisal Document, was to “initiate improvements in the quality, relevance, and
efficiency of higher education in Jordan, and support the Kingdom’s program to reform
sector governance”. It should be noted that reform of sector governance would also
support the objectives of quality, relevance and efficiency, but the importance of sector
governance to project success led it to be singled out as an objective. Box 2-1
summarizes the components.

Box 2-1. Components of the Higher Education Development Project
(Costs exclude contingencies)
Component 1-Initiate Improvements in Quality, Relevance and Efficiency (US$52.0
million). This component was to provide System-wide Support to (i) establish an ICT
infrastructure to provide access for faculty and students to internet and data bases, (ii) link
universities to each other, (iii) provide an integrated MIS, (iv) develop an inter-university library
system, and (v) establish Faculty Development Centers in eight universities to upgrade faculty. It
also was to set up the Higher Education Development Fund (HEDF) to provide grants to
universities via three windows: (i) competitive grants for new programs, (ii) a Faculty
Development Center Fund, and (iii) an ICT Fund.
Component 2 (US$1.9 million) Improving Sector Governance. This component was to
strengthen the Higher Education Council (HEC) by establishing an HEC Secretariat and (i)
providing technical assistance to set its analytical functions, (ii) providing equipment needed to
support these functions, (iii) technical assistance to design student loan and scholarship schemes,
and (iv) staff training locally and internationally. It supported the Higher Education Accreditation
Council (HEAC) in its role of accreditation and evaluation of public and private universities and
their programs of study, providing technical assistance, computers, and other resources. It also
supported improved planning and management at the university level by providing training for
university managers and faculty to improve financial management and overall management,
consistent with the new autonomy and accountability features allowed under the HEC and HEAC.
Component 3 - Reform of the Community College System (US$5.6 million). Al Balqa
Applied University (BAU) was formed as a new university in 1997 to oversee the community
colleges as a system to make them more relevant and effective. The component supported (i) the
development of a manual for organizational structure and procedures, (ii) an assessment of an
MIS for BAU and the community colleges , (iii) provision of the required hardware and software,
and (iv) fellowships and training for MIS staff and users. Activities to support program
development, included: (i) fellowships for staff in the Program Development Unit to manage
program renewal, (ii) fellowships for five Program Unit staff to establish a competency based
curriculum, (iii) technical assistance to establish procedures for the Unit and to guide the first
year of the new Associate Degree Programs. Teaching staff were to be strengthened through a
variety of mechanisms such as using lead instructors for the Associate Degree Program
framework, providing fellowships to lead instructors, and short-term secondment to business or
industry. Computers and other equipment were financed, as well building technical skills needed
for the BAU Associate Degree Program.
Component 4 - Project Implementation Capacity (US$1.5 million). This included staffing of
the PIU, administrative costs, incremental staff at universities and support to the National
Steering Committee (NSC), which was established during preparation to as a high level body to
guide policy and project preparation, and continued as a high level steering committee of
ministers and other officials, while the PIU was responsible for day to day implementation

2.4     The design and preparation of this project extended over a period from July 1997,
when concept review took place, to appraisal in September 1998 and approval in
February 2000. The preparation process was a participatory one supported by many
background studies by Jordanians and international consultants financed from Population
and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grants at the time. The preparation period
took a relatively long time compared to the average for Bank projects, partly due to the
                                             9


institutional complexity of the project and the preparatory work done with the support of
the PHRD. Sometimes Jordanian counterparts needed more time for their work program,
and other times Bank management discussions and meetings over the complexity of the
ambitious design absorbed more time than usual. Internal processing changes, such as
the new Loan Administration Change Initiative and standards of readiness for appraisal,
introduced delays as well.

2.5      The project design provided for technical assistance in the Loan, which was
reduced by US$6.0 million at the time of Negotiations (November 1998) at the request of
the government. It was reluctant to borrow so much for technical assistance and believed
that it would be able to obtain finance for the technical assistance from other donor
grants. Resolving this took time, both within the government and the Bank. The Bank’s
management looked upon this as a “high risk, high return operation”. A post-
Negotiations mission took place in November 1999 to reach final agreement. The project
was approved in February 2000 and became effective in October 2000, almost two years
after appraisal.

2.6     The rationale for the objectives and design are rooted in the Bank policy towards
higher education as it evolved over the 1990s. The Bank policy paper, Higher
Education: the Lessons of Experience (World Bank 1994), and the background studies
starting back in 1995 provided much of the conceptual rationale for public investment in
higher education and the encouragement of diversified funding and differentiation in the
missions of higher education institutions. Formula funding and competitive funding
arrangements were becoming more common in Bank support for higher education.
Formula funding refers to setting transparent principles for allocating recurrent budgets
based upon the number of students in different fields of study, the unit costs of different
fields of study, and other policy objectives, such as reducing repetition or the time to
graduate. This is in contrast to the practice of institutions negotiating their budget each
year with the authorities, which is not transparent and often depends upon political clout.
Competitive funding refers to funding investments in new programs and equipment
through the process of institutions submitting proposals that are judged competitively
based on merit, criteria, and procedures agreed upon beforehand by all involved. This is
considered to be more effective and demand driven by the institutions as opposed to
central planning. This project, along with some covenants in the Loan Agreement,
followed most of the elements of the Bank higher education reform strategy identified in
the 1994 Bank policy paper and the background literature upon which it was based. The
only elements of the Bank’s higher education reform package not included in the project
was the reform of university research and a student loan/scholarship program, which
were to come later in the Jordan higher education strategy.

2.7     Finding appropriate arrangements for implementation was problematic. There
was no Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research at the time, since it was
abolished in the mid-1990s, leaving only the HEC with the oversight of relatively
autonomous universities. The arrangements for implementation originally envisaged a
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) located within the Ministry of Planning and
International Cooperation, but that was rejected as inappropriate for a higher education
project. The HEC was considered, but it had no secretariat with a developed capacity for
implementation. The National Center for Human Resources Development (NCHRD),
                                             10


which had developed an implementation and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) capacity
in previous education projects, was therefore selected as the home base for the PIU. Near
the end of the project, after the re-establishment of the Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research in 2001, the PIU was moved back into this Ministry, but with
considerable downsizing of staff. At the level of individual universities, the University
Implementation Units were established to implement the grants and other activities.
Although their capacity varied considerably among universities, overall they played as
essential role for those decentralized activities of the project, such as the execution of the
grants under Higher Education Development Fund (HEDF).

2.8     According to the M&E framework prepared during appraisal, the PIU was to
monitor indicators, including collecting baseline data, and present reports to the National
Steering Committee (NSC), comprised of high level representatives of the universities
and ministries, which was the top level oversight body for the project. Depending on the
indicator, the universities were to supply some of the needed data. The Results
Framework was developed during preparation and the indicators for each objective
carefully chosen.

Implementation
2.9     The project was approved February 29, 2000 but did not become effective until
eight months later on October 7, 2000. This was followed by project launch mission in
November 2000 in which there was extensive participation by all of the universities and
Government agencies. The Bank team conducted a seminar that provided training in all
aspects of the project implementation, such as procurement and disbursement procedures.

2.10 Table 2.1 below shows the actual versus planned expenditure for the project by
components and total. The loan amount of US$34.7 million was almost fully disbursed
with US$1.7 million being cancelled at the end. According to the disbursement category
of the Loan Agreement, US$32.0 million was allocated for goods and equipment and
only US$500,000 for technical assistance, reflecting reluctance by the government to
borrow for technical assistance. However, during the Mid-Term Review mission in June
2003, the government requested, and the Bank agreed, to increase the amount for
technical assistance by US$1.5 million (for a total of US$2.0 million) by using the
unallocated category of the Loan Agreement for technical assistance. There was no
distinction made in the disbursement categories with respect to goods for ICT
infrastructure and for the HEDF grants. The goods needed for a demand-driven grants
program like HEDF cannot be predicted before the proposals from each round come in.
In the end, there was more disbursed for the ICT infrastructure than for the HEDF grants,
but the Loan Agreement was flexible in that regard. The government counterpart budget
at appraisal was estimated to be US$31.4 million, but the actual turned out to be only
US$9.3 million. Almost all government counterparts were to cover the staffing costs of
the HEC, HEAC, and the PIU. In the end, as a result of government austerity, these
entities were not staffed as fully as was intended. It must also be taken into account the
re-establishment of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in 2001
meant that the staffing needs of the HEC were less than at appraisal.
                                                                 11


2.11 Subcomponent 1.1 aimed to improve the quality, relevance and efficiency of
teaching, learning and administration in the universities. This subcomponent provided
ICT networks, infrastructure including servers and PCs, which upgraded access for
student and faculty. This was the most procurement intensive part of the project in terms
of equipment and goods.

2.12 Subcomponent 1.2 included the HEDF which also had the objective of improving
quality and relevance of higher education. The HEDF was to achieve this by sponsoring
competitive proposals that followed the agreed guidelines and procedures of the project.
The guidelines were formulated during preparation to select and fund projects that would
add to the quality and relevance of higher education programs. During the course of the
project three rounds of competitions were held, in total financing 33 grants for new or
upgraded programs and 7 entrepreneurial grants for projects with private sector
industries. The HEDF also involved large amounts of procurement of equipment and
other resources needed to carry out the individual grants. Procurement for this
subcomponent was carried out efficiently.

2.13 Component 2 was aimed mainly at initiating improvements in governance and did
not require so much spending and procurement of equipment as opposed to institutional
reforms. Significant legal and institutional changes took place soon after the project
become effective. In September 2001 a Royal Decree re-established the Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research, which had been abolished in the mid-1990s.
The Decree also realigned the roles of the HEC and HEAC and established Boards of
Trustees for each university. Still, the project activities to support HEC and HEAC were
relevant and carried out. Support was also provided for the Ministry of Higher Education
and Scientific Research as well.
                                             12


2.14     A major element of the governance reform was to be the introduction of formula
funding for allocating recurrent budgets from the government to the universities.
Although most universities had some sort of data or information system, and had basic
information on enrollment and finance, it was necessary to design a system that was
compatible across all universities. It was decided that this could be done in-house with
local expertise, but eventually, after a few years of difficulties, it was decided to engage
an outside consulting firm. In the meantime, fundamental technical information was
lacking for the formula funding. There were political and administrative problems
involved as well, including gaining a sufficient consensus on the formula to be used.
Given that the government subsidy to higher education budgets were declining to a small
proportion of higher education spending (in the range of 10 to 20 percent), the
universities increasingly felt that formula funding had become irrelevant due to the
relatively small amount to be determined by formula. Changes also took place in the
policy and governance environment, such as the re-establishment of the Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research in September 2001. In July 2003 the
government requested that the Bank modify the loan covenant for formula funding in
light of such changes and the preparation of a new higher education strategy that was in
process, to which the Bank agreed.

2.15 Component 3 was aimed at the governance reforms for the community colleges.
An organizational study was conducted in 2003 to analyze and recommend changes in
the organizational structure and procedures of the community college system. Training
and fellowships were provided to BAU and community college staff to strengthen the
capacity for new program development. A tracer study was conducted in 2005 to assess
to provide labor market analysis and feedback from employers. This component also
financed equipment for computer, language and science labs as well as for the
infrastructure for the MIS of the community college system. The Canadian International
Development Agency provided technical assistance the studies and training under another
separate Canadian-Jordanian project for vocational and technical education.

2.16 With respect to fiduciary concerns, there were no issues. The audit reports were
prepared and no fiduciary issues were encountered. The environmental category for the
project was Category C. The standard safeguard and management procedures were
included in the Project Appraisal Document and followed during implementation and
there were no safeguard issues.

Achievement of objectives
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION

2.17 The main purpose of the large investment in ICT (computers, network
equipment,and others) was to improve quality of learning and teaching programs in the
public universities. These investments together with improved funding and governance
arrangements were intended to result in better quality. The main outputs that would
contribute to quality were the higher education system-wide ICT network, the Faculty
Development Centers, and the HEDF financed 33 new programs and 7 entrepreneurial
grants with private sector institutions. The HEAC improved capacity would also be a key
output to improve quality.
                                                    13


2.18 The quality of higher education was also to be monitored by the introduction of
new teaching methods, use of new media and technology, and the introduction of student
evaluations of faculty teaching. As a baseline of comparison, teaching methods at the
project start was still traditional lecture, many times faculty reading from old and out of
date notes. At the start of the project hardly any new technology or media was used in
the classroom and student evaluations were not used at all. As a result of the project
component activities, at least 20 percent of faculty were trained via the Faculty
Development Centers, new technology and media was in use in 70 percent of the classes.
Student evaluations of faculty and teaching were done in all public universities involving
12,500 teacher evaluations between 2004 and 2006. However, analysis of the results of
these surveys was not available and the practice has not continued in all universities and
there has been no practical impact of this potentially useful tool. Faculty training was
also provided to the community colleges to improve quality, but the teacher evaluations
as above were not applied and evaluation studies for quality of teaching were not done.

2.19 The work of the HEAC became more independent and far reaching over time.
Initially, it was accrediting only private universities, but after the legal changes of 2001
and 2007, all universities are subject to its accreditation and quality assurance. The IEG
mission meetings with the HEAC revealed a readiness to move to output/outcome based
measures of quality, such as introducing the use of field examinations (physics,
economics, others.) in collaboration with the Educational Testing Service of Princeton,
New Jersey, USA. In visits to universities, the mission learned that comprehensive
examinations in major fields of study are still administered by various faculties. There
have apparently been no efforts to determine trends of achievement over time.2

2.20 When asked about the quality of incoming university students, most professors
commented that they were well prepared to make use of the heavy investments in ICT by
the project. Given the increased use of ICT in basic and secondary education, this
probably reflects positively to a large extent on the Education Reform for the Knowledge
Economy Project, discussed in Chapter 3. In terms of higher-level cognitive skills, there
was more variation in opinion among university professors, with some still complaining
about a gap in the ability to think creatively and solve problems. Most of those
interviewed thought that the university entrance exam (the Tawjihi) still relied too
heavily on rote learning. It should be noted that this was not at all a scientific survey, so
more rigorous M&E is needed on learning outcomes in the universities. This was not a
part of the project design, but it should be considered for the future.

INCREASE THE RELEVANCE OF HIGHER EDUCATION

2.21 The practical definition of relevance implied by the indicators and discussions of
results has to do with programs that relate to the economic and social needs of the
country. The main outputs that would contribute to this objective were the HEDF (which
2
  However, it should be noted that assessing learning achievement in higher education has not made as
much progress internationally as in basic education. Nothing like TIMSS yet exists for higher education,
although OECD has made some recent attempts and the Collegiate Learning Assessment in the United
States is in progress. The major fields tests of the Education Testing Service referred to above has not
reached the scope of international assessments, but they could be useful if a country wants some feedback
for academic accountability.
                                            14


was also aimed at quality) and governance reforms aimed at the labor market, especially
reform of the community colleges . The competitive HEDF was conceived as a measure
to encourage and provide incentives for such new programs. However, these new
programs can also be viewed as contributing to quality and the competitive mechanism as
contributing to the efficiency of the investment program. There was no concept of
competitive funding prior to the project. By the end of the project, 33 subprojects were
approved while enrollment in new programs sponsored by the HEDF was 2,150 for the
first set of 11 new undergraduate programs and 5,200 in the revised and upgraded
program. Compared to the student population of about 163,000 in public higher
education, these are small numbers, but they were expected to grow, for which no data is
now available. The IEG mission reviewed the list of programs for all three rounds and
they dealt with relevant topics like geology and water engineering, biotechnology,
upgrading computer engineering, and restoration of archeological sites. Each round
introduced new and relevant program themes to the higher education system.

2.22 An external evaluation of all three rounds by external consultants was
commissioned in 2005 as part of the M&E for the project and it was concluded that,
although it did not fully reach its objectives in terms of being fully competitive, by the
third round the HEDF was operating competitively as planned. Part of the problem in the
first two rounds was a failure to communicate clearly to university teams what kinds of
proposals were requested. By the third round many workshops and support to the
university teams resulted in better prepared proposals. The IEG mission also visited and
talked to a few academic leaders of these new programs, most of which are still on-going.
Despite the initial round not being fully competitive, it appears that the HEDF introduced
an entrepreneurial spirit which, in some cases, spilled over to other areas of university
operations. Some professors also reported that they felt more confident about applying
for grants under the EU Frame Work Programs for which Jordan is now eligible as a
result of its Association Agreement with the EU.

2.23 In terms of labor market relevance, the reformed community colleges under BAU
were to play the major role in the project. The governance problems (discussed below) of
the community college system did not lead to improved employer satisfaction with the
skills of graduates according to surveys carried out by the Canadian technical assistance
to the community colleges (parallel funding to the project). Employers felt the training
was still too theoretical and lacking in practical skills. Enrollment in community colleges
fell from 29,000 to 25,500, partly due to some programs with little labor market
relevance being closed. But there is also a preference among students for the four-year
degree programs being offered by some community colleges, even though graduate
unemployment remains high. Some community college administrators reported to the
mission that community college graduates in technical fields have much better
employment rates compared to graduates in the humanities/social sciences.

2.24 The World Bank Labor Market Study in 2008 shows that for university graduates
the lowest unemployment rates are for the medical (7 percent) and engineering (9
percent) fields. The highest unemployment rates are for education (29 percent), public
administration (28 percent), and computers (22 percent). The high unemployment rate
for computer fields is surprising, given the perception that there is high demand.
Universities should question why their graduates have such a high unemployment rate in
                                              15


computer fields. Is it the quality of training, or is the training too theoretical? Or is there
just too much supply relative to demand? There appears to be only a small response to
higher unemployment in humanities, compared with engineering. The proportion of
students enrolled in engineering relative to humanities/social studies has hardly changed
between 2001 and 2008. Enrollment in the high unemployment humanities/social science
decreased slightly from 60 percent (2001) to 56 percent (2008), while that in low
unemployment engineering increased slightly from about 12 percent (2001) to 15 percent
(2008), according to a study by a private research institute (Jordan Center for Policy
Research and Dialogue). The Labor Market Study (2008) also mentions that students
lack accurate information about the current demand for the specializations from which
they can choose.

2.25 According to the Labor Market (2008) study, Jordanians and foreigners are on a
par with respect to quantity of education, but there is concern with respect to quality,
initiative and critical thinking ability among Jordanian workers. Moreover, employers
report that “attitude toward work” or “employability” is much higher among foreign
workers, resulting in higher productivity of foreign labor. This factor involves attitudes
and expectations of young Jordanians, and it is similar to complaints that employers in
the richer countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council have been making about their
national labor force versus foreign labor force. All of the Council’s countries are trying
to “nationalize” their own professional job markets and are encountering similar
problems as in the Jordanian labor market. Career information and counseling might help
here, but it is difficult to address such expectations through higher education alone.

RAISE THE EFFICIENCY OF HIGHER EDUCATION

2.26 The main outputs that would contribute to this objective are the MIS for higher
education, the formula funding for allocating recurrent budgets to the universities, and the
HEC that was to oversee higher education policy and the formula funding. The
efficiency objective of the project was not defined in great detail, but the main indicator
used specified the reduction of administrative staff relative to teaching staff. The idea
here was that administrative staff was excessive and that more resources could be
allocated to the frontline mission of teaching without losing administrative efficiency.
While there was no hard evidence presented in the project documentation that the target
ratio of 2.0 (administration to faculty) was optimal, there was a consensus in Jordanian
higher education that the baseline value of 2.7 in the year 2000 was too high and should
be reduced. It turned out that the ratio of administrative to teaching staff did not improve,
starting out at 2.7 (2000) administrative to teaching staff and rising to 2.8 (2007),
compared to the target of 2.0 for the year 2007.

2.27 The system-wide MIS could also be counted as one of the efficiency measures of
the project if it had been implemented as planned. The main shortfall of the HEC and
Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research was in not implementing formula
funding of recurrent costs of higher education. This was planned to be operational by the
end of the project, but it failed to become operational. It would have provided
information on other aspects of efficiency, such system-wide unit costs by fields,
graduation rates, costs to produce a graduate, etc. The MIS could have provided
information on efficient use of all resources. Although the public finance for higher
                                                  16


education dropped from 50 percent to 20 percent of operational spending within public ,
the revenues generated by the parallel tuition and fee paying programs partially made up
for the declining public finance. Overall, spending per student (in nominal terms)
declined from 1,886 Jordanian dinars in 2001 to 1,775 Jordanian dinars in 2007
according to a higher education finance study conducted by a Jordanian private research
institute.3 With inflation averaging 3.4 percent over this time period, the reduction in
spending per student was even more in real terms, a reduction of about 28 percent. Thus,
all sources of revenues should be counted in the efficiency objective, which a good MIS
would help to track. The MIS design also failed to provide measures of collection of data
on the benefit side which could have been used for a cost-benefit analysis of external
efficiency. Without good information about learning outcomes, it is difficult to say if the
decline in cost per student is improved efficiency or under-spending. If learning
outcomes remained constant, for example, reduced spending would indicate improved
efficiency.

GOVERNANCE

2.28    The Governance objective was stated as supporting the government’s program to
reform sector governance. The reform program was laid out in the Letter of Sector
Development Policy included in the Project Appraisal Document. In one way or another,
all component activities were aimed at governance reform, but improved governance
would also support the objectives for quality, relevance, and efficiency of the system.
The MIS and the HEDF in component 1 were to move the system in the right directions,
providing relevant information and competition for new program development. The main
outputs for the governance PDO were the HEC and HEAC reforms and capacity
development in component 2, which were aimed at governance in the universities. The
main output for governance of the community colleges focused on the reform of
governance and management of BAU in component 3 and the community colleges it
managed, so as to improve their labor market relevance.

2.29 Some elements of the package of policy reforms were achieved. The HEDF
became more competitive after each round, the first round only being competitive within
each university, i.e., the best proposal in each university was selected. In rounds 2 and 3,
the competitive criteria were applied more rigorously and some universities received
more than one grant. Also, the capacity of the HEAC has been augmented and after the
2007 legal changes, the HEAC is now officially named the Higher Education
Accreditation Commission, completely independent of the HEC and the Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research. In addition, to eliminate potential conflicts of
interest, in 2009 further changes to the Higher Education Law no longer allowed
university presidents to be members of the HEC, while at the same time strengthening the

M. Al-Salmat and and M. Hanania (2009) by the Jordan Center for Policy Research and Dialogue.
However, more detailed cost data by fields of study would be needed. There seems to be no technical
reason to prevent to the establishment of an MIS. Indeed, near the end of the project, a design was
produced, but funding was not available. Another study on higher education finance conducted for
preparation of the second higher education project showed how variation in per student spending across
universities could be analyzed and factored into the MIS and formula funding. See “The Financing of
Public Universities in Jordan” (2008) by the Higher Education Policy Institute, Oxford UK.

role of the Boards of Trustees in governing universities and broadening the private sector
membership of the Boards.

2.30     The HEC played its proper role of formulating policy to be implemented by the
universities and coordinated/facilitated by the Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research according to the 2001 law. The project did provide some results in
improving the capacity of the secretariat of the HEC by way of ICT equipment and some
training. However, as cited in the previous sections, the main shortfall of the HEC was
its leadership in formula funding and ensuring competition in the first two rounds of the
HEDF grants.

2.31 BAU oversight of the network of community colleges initiated prior to the project
did not turn out to be the solution to the problem. However, the project did attempt to
reform the structure of BAU and its community colleges and the organization plan and
procedures manual were completed. No decisions were taken on this. The MIS for the
community colleges was completed in contrast to that for the universities. BAU itself
appears to have more academic aspirations as a four-year degree and research university
within its fields of technology and applied sciences, as opposed to developing two-year
community college training programs. The community colleges did not appear to have
enough autonomy within this oversight scheme, although improvements were introduced,
such as the Deans’ Council, which allowed heads of community colleges to participate in
management meetings and decisions at BAU. Still, there is evidence from some of the
community colleges visited by the mission that individual community colleges are being
innovative and pro-active in seeking out connections with private employers and
providing needed occupational training. New arrangements for technical education will
take the community colleges from under BAU’s oversight and place it under the
Jordanian Academy for Technical Education and attempt to tap into and foster this
innovative spirit shown by a few community colleges.

Ratings
OUTCOME

2.32   Relevance of objectives. The relevance of project objectives is rated
substantial, given the importance of higher education to the government program of
human resource development and also to the most recent Bank CAS (2006) and CAS
Progress Report (2009). The first of the four CAS clusters was to strengthen the
investment climate and build the human resources base for a knowledge economy. The
National Agenda, the overall economic strategy document of the government that was
formulated in 2006, is also very similar to the CAS in that respect.

2.33 The relevance of project design was also substantial, but ambitious, as it
attempted to introduce into Jordanian higher education the package of “good principles
and practices” developed by the Bank and partners over the decade of the 1990s in sector
work and policy papers. If fully implemented, the reforms of the project were likely to
help achieve the objectives since the governance reforms would make the allocation of
recurrent and investment spending more effective and efficient. Other aspects of the
reforms, such as improving the HEC and HEAC, were project outputs likely to contribute
                                            18


to initiating improved quality and relevance. Also, the improved ICT infrastructure and
the faculty training would update quality of learning and teaching. Overall, the list of
outputs of the project (system-wide ICT network, Faculty Development Centers, MIS,
competitive funding, formula funding, the higher education councils, and reforms of
BAU and community colleges) seemed appropriate for the objective of initiating
improvements in quality, relevance, efficiency and governance. Given the debate and
ferment in Jordanian Higher Education, it seemed like a good time to attempt this reform.
These goals are still relevant for higher education today and looking forward.

2.34 Efficacy. The project development objectives were modestly achieved, except
for the objective of improved efficiency, for which was achievement was negligible.
The widespread introduction of new computers and scientific equipment is very evident
along with teaching innovations, many of which are being continued. These are input
measures and outcome measures, such as learning assessments, were not part of the M&E
design or available as part of the normal university operations. Thus the achievement of
the objective to improve the quality of higher education is rated as modest. The
achievement of the objective of increasing the relevance of higher education is rated
modest since surveys of employers still showed dissatisfaction with graduates of the
community colleges and, despite introduction of new academic programs under the
HEDF. , enrollment patterns are still concentrated in the humanities/social science fields
where unemployment rates for university graduates are still high. Yet, most of the new
programs, such as those training professionals to deal with the water problems of the
country, are relevant to the national economy. The achievement of the objective of
improving the efficiency of higher education is rated as negligible since the major goal of
cost savings by the reduction in excessive administration was not achieved. There was
no evidence of improved efficiency in other respects. The governance objective, which
also supports all of the other project objectives, had shortcomings in terms of community
college reform and the overall programs of university governance did not achieve
formula funding and competitive funding in the first two rounds. However, the third
round worked as planned according to the external evaluation of the HEDF (2005). The
capacity of the HEC and HEAC, which is important for system governance, did improve
during the course of the project through staff development for their secretariats and
provision of equipment and facilities for their operations. The governance objective is
also rated as modest.

2.35 Efficiency. Efficiency is also rated modest. The project resources went mainly
to finance ICT, scientific and engineering equipment to support quality improvement and
relevance of new programs. Procurement of these items was carried out for the most part
in professional and timely manner. It was noted before that delays were encountered in
the design of the MIS by the individual universities until this was contracted out to an
ICT consulting firm. The competitive fund for new programs (HEDF) also had
shortcomings in efficiency during the first two rounds of competition when they did not
function competitively according to the program guidelines. Another source of
inefficiency came about from delays in the community college component which led to
failure to complete the strategic plan for reorganization of the subsector. Overall,
physical inputs and equipment were procured efficiently for all components, but
outcomes were not fully achieved. Thus, although lacking data to compute a cost-benefit
ratio, these qualitative considerations lead to rating efficiency as modest.
                                            19


2.36 Outcome. Based upon the above, the outcome of the project is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. Relevance of project objectives and relevance of design were each
substantial, efficacy of each PDO was modest, except for the efficiency PDO which was
negligible, and efficiency of the project was modest.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.37 The risk to development outcome is rated moderate. Although there is a
consensus on the need to reform, there is also a lively debate on reform priorities.
However, all of the reform issues were discussed openly in the 2007 Dead Sea Forum on
higher education and the result was a new strategy for the higher education sector.
Despite the cancellation of the Second Higher Education Project to follow up on these
reforms, the government and Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research are
cooperating with the Bank via programmatic economic and sector work to confront
priority issues. The risk is that there are a large number of issues that need to be tackled
in a systemic way and the Ministry will be moving too slowly on individual issues. As a
result, some of the limited achievements of the Project, such as the Competitive Fund, the
completed design of the MIS and technical basis for formula funding, may not be
sustained.

BANK PERFORMANCE

2.38 Overall Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Quality at entry,
which was moderately unsatisfactory, suffered from unduly long delays in preparation.
Bank management reviews took a long time while risks associated with an ambitious
reform were being debated. All of the risks were rated in the end as modest except the
one that the government might not secure adequate technical assistance grants to replace
the technical assistance from reducing the loan amount. This was rated high and was to
be monitored carefully. However, there was no measure specified to be taken if the
grants for technical assistance did not materialize even though it had been looked upon as
a “high risk, high return operation”. The Bank team, staffed by qualified higher
education experts, and building upon the analysis of the 1996 Higher Education
Development Study, carried out good background studies. However, preparation lost
momentum during the delays. In hindsight, the PHRD grant could have been used to do
pilot programs and trial runs of difficult reforms, such as formula funding and
competitive grants. There were good examples of this from other Bank operations, which
could have been adapted to the Jordanian situation during piloting, given that the culture
of higher education in Jordan was not used to competitive institutions. This would have
improved the implementation plan adopted at appraisal and negotiations and reduced the
need for dated covenants on these important reform measures.

2.39     Quality of supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The negative risks
identified in the Project Appraisal Document predominated and higher level Bank
management reacted too slowly. The supervision team provided regular assistance on
implementation issues, such as procurement and disbursement, beginning with an
excellent project launch mission in October 2002 at the time of effectiveness. This, along
with increasing the amount of technical assistance by US$1.5 million from the loan at
mid-term review, helped to compensate to some extent for the reduced amount of
                                           20


technical assistance due to government reluctance to borrow for technical assistance.
While this helped with the provision of equipment and computers under Component 1,
the aide-memoires of supervision missions indicate that there was insufficient focus on
reform measures of governance in Component 2 (University Governance) and 3
(community colleges). There was no evidence that high level regional management
intervened in efforts to get the policy reforms of the project on track.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

2.40 Overall Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Government
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. During preparation, there was no
strong leadership from the side of the borrower. The Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research was abolished in the mid-1990s before preparation began in favor of
the HEC exercising oversight of autonomous universities. While this works in some
countries, in this case the HEC was not strong enough with a high capacity secretariat.
As a result, the Ministry was re-established in 2001 after the project had been effective
for more than a year. Frequent changes in ministers, did not allow for this development
to take root. Although the system wide MIS experienced delays and problems, holding
back progress on the technical aspects of formula funding, lack of high level leadership
was also a critical factor. By the time a strong minister was appointed, much delay had
been experienced, and this minister eventually was changed as well, creating another
leadership vacuum. Although autonomous in many ways, the universities were still
subject to external pressures in other ways. Thus, the executive branch could pressure
universities to hire more administrative staff than they needed, presumably for some
government job creation or personal favors. Admissions to universities outside of the
unified admissions framework were also the result of external pressure, thus reducing the
efficacy of the project in improving the efficiency of the higher education system.

2.41 Implementing agency performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The
PIU was staffed with competent and dedicated professionals and performed its technical
tasks of procurement satisfactorily. It did a good job of delivering some intermediate
outputs for ICT and computer labs in the universities. Because of its location in the
NCHRD, outside of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research and HEC,
it performed less well on reform measures. Partly as a result of this arrangement, the
system wide MIS experienced delays and problems, holding back progress on the
technical aspects needed for formula funding of university recurrent budgets. In addition,
the PIU staff lacked the prestige of high level academics when it came to dealing with the
universities and could not supply the leadership needed to get the universities to change
behavior.

QUALITY OF MONITORING AND EVALUATION

2.42 The quality of M&E is rated modest. Its design was comprehensive in terms of a
global MIS and indicators, though these were all input oriented as opposed to outcomes.
Although the PIU was responsible overall for monitoring indicators, the plan for
obtaining these indicators did not assign clear responsibility within the universities,
which would be the originators of much of the data. A few indicators for intermediate
outcomes were defined, but these were also affected by lack of a clear plan to produce the
                                           21


needed data. The M&E design could have followed the overall results framework more
closely and could have used more control groups in the methodology of evaluating the
achievement of project objectives.

2.43 Implementation of M&E was affected by the problems with the global MIS,
which was not achieved, although individual universities implemented or improved their
own individual systems. A few evaluation studies, including tracer study for community
colleges and the performance of the competitive fund (HEDF), were carried out, but they
were done too late for the results to be used. These could not be used for a system wide
improvement, but were used at the institutional level.

2.44 Utilization of the results turned out to be limited. The Ministry of Higher
Education and Scientific Research was motivated to also establish a Directorate of
Computers, Information and Statistics which is producing enrollment data at the system
level, but cost and financial data is lagging for the system as a whole. The individual
universities submit financial statements and reports to the Ministry which could be
utilized further as a basis for analyzing costs per students.


3. Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy I
Program, 2003-2009

Design
3.1     The US$370 million Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy I Program
(ERfKE) was approved on May 8, 2003. It was to be financed by a US$120.0 million
IBRD loan, US$130 million in counterpart funds by the Borrower, and US$120 million
from donors. The PDO as stated in the Loan Agreement was “to assist the Borrower in
improving the quality, relevance and efficiency of its early childhood, basic and
secondary school education systems, so as to produce graduates with the skills necessary
for the knowledge economy.” The Project Appraisal Document, however, stated the
PDO was “to support the government to transform the education system at the early
childhood, basic and secondary levels to produce graduates with skills necessary for the
knowledge economy”. The two formulations are identical with respect to skills necessary
for the knowledge economy. The Loan Agreement formulation is more specific with
respect to what is meant by “transforming the education system,” thus this formulation
will be followed here.

3.2     The rationale behind the objectives and design is rooted in the experience of
Jordan and changes in the global economy. Access to education in Jordan had been
making good quantitative progress throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This has occurred
despite the rapid growth in school age population. The two operations prior to this one
(HRSIL 1 and 2, 1989 and 1995) also supported curriculum changes that promoted more
student centered learning, especially in science education. But the shift in the role of
knowledge in the economy and the use of ICT made it imperative for Jordan to aim
higher in its goals for education. It was decided that an overall transformation of
                                                     22


curriculum, teaching and management was needed as opposed to incremental
improvements.

3.3     In September 2002, the “Vision Forum for the Future of Education” was held.
This high level conference, held under the auspices of King Abdullah, advanced the
vision of Jordan as a regional hub for ICT. The Bank arranged to bring in high level
policy makers from East Asia-Pacific region to this Vision Forum to share their practical
experience in reforms for the Knowledge Economy with Jordanian policy makers. With
Bank assistance, a “Statement of Sector Policy” was developed to build upon the
outcome of the “Vision Forum.” The government thus developed a comprehensive
proposal for the reform of education that was aimed at the education dimension of the
knowledge economy (refer back to Box 1.2) that was elaborated in the Education Reform
for the Knowledge Economy Project.

Box 3-1. Components for the Education Reform for Knowledge Economy Project
Component 1 was to Reorient Education Policy and Administration (US$8.1 million).
Subcomponent 1.1 was to redefine the vision and prepare a comprehensive national strategy for
education. Subcomponent 1.2 was to improve management and decision making. Subcomponent
1.3 was to set up an integrated Education Decision Support System (EDSS) to improve decision
making. Subcomponent 1.4 was to conduct research, monitoring and evaluation, national and
international learning assessments, and policy analysis. Subcomponent 1.5 to develop effective
and efficient management and investments in educational reform, including school based
innovations.
Component 2 was to Transform Education Programs and Practices for the Knowledge
Economy (US$46.8 million). Subcomponent 2.1 aimed at a new curriculum and learning
assessment methods. Subcomponent 2.2 focused on the professional development of teachers,
supervisors and principals to implement the new curriculum. Subcomponent 2.3 provided the
required resources in terms of equipment and learning materials.
Component 3 was to Support a Quality Physical Environment for Learning (US$57.7
million). Subcomponent 3.1 aimed to replace structurally unsafe and overcrowded schools.
Subcomponent 3.2 was to upgrade existing schools to support learning for the knowledge
economy through provision of computers and science labs.
Component 4 was to Promote Readiness for Learning through Early Childhood Education
(ECE) (US$6.2 million). Subcomponent 4.1 focused on institutional capacity building in the
field of ECE, and Subcomponent 4.2 was to promote professional development of early
childhood educators. Subcomponent 4.3 was to provide increased access to KGs, especially in
rural areas that had limited access to ECE, while Subcomponent 4.4 was to promote
parental/community participation by piloting community-based centers in selected governorates.

3.4     The implementation arrangements in the Project Appraisal Document called for
the Ministry of Education departments to carry out the project as part of their functional
responsibilities, supported and coordinated by the Development Cooperation Unit (DCU)
located in the Ministry. Thus, there was no PIU in the usual sense of that term. The idea
was to build up the capacity of the Ministry of Education.
                                                               23


3.5     The design of M&E assigned a key role to the National Center for Human
Resources Development, which was to carry out external M&E by conducting 30 studies
and surveys. The Center had been involved in previous Bank-supported education
projects in the role of a policy and coordination body. The day-to-day progress of
implementation was to be monitored by the DCU and respective directorates in the
Ministry of Education.

Implementation
3.6     The project became effective on May 28, 2003, only 3 weeks after Board
approval, and the project launch mission took place in July 2003. Thus from appraisal to
start-up the project progressed much faster than average for Jordan and the Bank wide
average. This reflected strong ownership by the government and Ministry of Education
as well as the detailed and thorough preparation.

3.7     Planned and actual expenditures financed by the loan, by component, are
presented in Table 3.1. The donors referred to in Chapter 1 made parallel contributions
for separate parts of the overall ERfKE program and their contributions and those of the
government are not included in the table. The loan was fully disbursed with the
government counterpart actual contribution of US$144 million exceeding the planned
US$130 million contribution estimated at appraisal

3.8      Component 1 on Policy and Administration made good progress throughout
implementation. The Vision Forum 2002 was elaborated further into a comprehensive
and detailed National Strategy that was completed by 2006. This helped to guide
decision making and the work on the MIS and EDSS. However, delays in the MIS,
which provided an essential input to the EDSS, caused the EDSS to be put on hold
resulting in lower-than-planned expenditure on this component (only 30.9 percent of the
appraisal estimate). The consulting firm engaged for the EDSS did complete the design,
and it is anticipated that sometime in the future the EDSS will be operational. A
communications strategy to educate and inform the public and stakeholders was
developed but not implemented. Within the Ministry of Education a policy unit was set
                                            24


up and staffed as planned, and a Directorate of Information and Computer Technology
was established to help with education statistics and ICT support. This component also
included an Innovation Fund that awarded grants to schools based upon proposals.
However, it was not well connected to other activities of the project and turned out to be
not very effective or innovative or result in changing policy. This functioned like a
matching grant in the end, but schools learned to prepare proposals based upon self-
evaluations and school development aims.

3.9     An important part of Component 1 was the monitoring measures set up as a part
of policy analysis. The continuing participation of Jordan in Trends in Mathematics and
Science Study (TIMSS) was part of this, and a new national assessment of learning,
National Assessment for Knowledge Economy (NAfKE), was also implemented under
this component. In conjunction with the NCHRD, 30 studies were conducted on various
topics of importance to the reform program.

3.10 Component 2 on Education Programs and Practices was in some ways the
heart of the transformation for knowledge economy reform. A new knowledge economy
curriculum was formulated and plans were made to train teachers to implement the new
curriculum. During the first two years curricula teams were formed and trained with
some external support from the loan and other donors. A plan for an orderly phased roll-
out of the new curricula was made, starting with Grade 10 in 2006, Grade 6 in 2007 and
Grade 1 in 2008. This plan was implemented as designed, allowing time for teachers to
be trained and new texts and materials to be prepared. Science lab equipment for the new
curriculum was also procured during this time.

3.11 Component 3 on Quality Learning Environment was mainly a program of civil
works. A main issue was safety, since many rented facilities were not appropriate as
schools. This component also sought to respond to the rapid growth of the school-age
population and reduce overcrowded classrooms, thereby improving the learning
environment. As result, this component wound up costing more than all the other
components combined, making up for the reduced expenditure on Component 1 when the
EDSS was put on hold. The civil works were carried out well with only a few problems
along the way. Early in the project there were some delays in the evaluation of bids and
the quality of bid evaluation reports needed to be improved. These problems were
resolved through intensive help in supervision to improve familiarity with Bank
procurement procedures. As a result of the Bank loan, the government constructed 41
new schools and renovated or extended 538 schools. In addition, classrooms were
constructed for ECE, building 300 public kindergartens and rehabilitating classrooms
(140 from the Bank loan and 100 with USAID support). These new schools were also
provided with appropriate furniture and equipment.

3.12 Component 4 on Early Childhood Education provided the much needed
increased access in rural areas. It also provided a new curriculum and approach, with the
extensive training and provision of materials required. The construction of classrooms
came under Component 3 and was carried out efficiently for ECE as for the other grades.
Equity was a partial consideration in this component in so far as access of rural areas to
ECE was part of the goal.

3.13 While the project objectives and components were not changed during the life of
the project, some modifications were made to the Loan Agreement. In May 2005 and
October 2006, changes were made to streamline implementation and procurement
procedures for the Innovation Fund. Since the grants for this subcomponent were small,
a specific disbursement category was created and allowance was made for direct
contracting for the acquisition of goods. In September 2006, there was a reallocation of
US$9 million for school construction. At mid-term review, it was determined that there
would be a budget over run estimated to be US$8.8 million, mainly in school
construction. The government revised its project implementation plan together with its
financing plan, and the budget overrun was avoided.

3.14 With respect to fiduciary aspects, there were no concerns. The audit reports were
prepared and no fiduciary issues were encountered. With respect to environmental
safeguards, the project was rated as environmental category B due to the school
construction and rehabilitation under the project. The Project Appraisal Document
included an Environmental Management Plan and school construction and rehabilitation
were done according to this plan without any issues.

Achievement of the Objectives
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF EARLY CHILDHOOD, BASIC, AND SECONDARY EDUCATION

3.15 The concept of quality used in the project can be taken as implicitly defined in the
Vision Forum 2002 and the National Education Strategy that followed during project
implementation. Quality was conceived of as improved learning outcomes as result of
increased teacher training, new books and curricula. To a large extent the project made
good progress on improving quality as measured from the vantage point of learning
outcomes, key outputs (curricula, books, and teacher training), and inputs. One of the
main indicators chosen was the performance of Jordanian students on the international
assessment of learning Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).4 A small
positive improvement was recorded in the TIMSS from 2003 to 2007 at the same time as
enrollments increased. Math scores went from 424 to 427 and science scores from 475 to
482. This represented a small but marginally significant increase in scores. However,
going back further to Jordan’s 1999 first participation in TIMSS, Jordan made the largest
improvement of all participating countries between 1999 and 2007 and some experts
argue that looking at this longer term trend is more significant than looking at shorter
term variations (Patrinos 2008). In addition, the ranking of Jordan improved more than
most other participating countries, both within the region and internationally. All of
these components and their outputs were evaluated by the NCHRD under the M&E part
of the project, using evidence collected from credible sampling methods and instruments,
and showed substantial results.

4
  The Tawjihi or General Secondary School Certificate of Education exam, which is taken by most
secondary school graduates as university selection exam, was not chosen as an outcome indicator because
of its heavy reliance on memorization of subject matter, according to many informed observers, and thus
not in line with the project objectives. TIMSS and NAfKE are sample based tests carefully constructed to
assess critical thinking and problem solving. The Tawjihi is under reform and will be changed over the
next few years.
                                                     26


3.16 The difficult question is to what extent this could be attributed to new curriculum
framework that was implemented from 2005 to 2007. After all, it takes a few years to
design the new curriculum, during which time things continue as before, and the TIMSS
data cover 2003, two years before the new curriculum started, to 2007. Meanwhile,
teachers need to be trained and new textbooks and learning materials provided. Then
there is the issue of how widespread is the adoption of the new teaching methods. One
of the M&E studies by NCHRD shows that the dissemination of new methods takes some
time after their design. The other attribution issue is that there were two large education
projects in Jordan during the 1990s (HRSIL 1 and 2) and, given the time lags in
improving any education system, some of the improved performance may be also due in
part to those interventions. For example, the TIMMS science score improved most from
1999 to 2003 when it rose from 450 to 475, larger than the gain from 475 to 482 from
2003 to 2007. The TIMSS math score was unchanged from 1999 to 2003.

3.17 However, the results from the NAfKE learning assessment in 2008 showed a clear
improvement in performance in math, science, and reading since 2006. The percentage
of students in the lower levels of achievement was reduced, while their percentage
increased in the high and advanced levels of performance. There was an improvement in
math for 9th and 11th grades, in science for the 9th grade, and in reading for all three
grades tested. Early childhood learning outcomes were not assessed in this round of
NAfKE, but will be assessed in future rounds. It might be possible to attribute some of
the improvement from 2006 to 2008 inputs from the project, but the previous HRSIL
projects may still be part of the causal chain. The HRSIL-2 ended December 2002, with
a great deal of curriculum, textbook, and teacher development that entered the system
during the last years of the project. It would be expected that the impact would continue
to be felt during the first few years of ERfKE, and could be partly responsible for the
improvements in TIMSS from 1999 to 2003, but it is less likely to be responsible for the
NAfKE improvement. The sample-based studies of teacher training, curricula and new
text books showed a significant improvement in these areas from 2005 -2007. These
evaluation studies, which are among those carried by the NCHRD, used stratified
sampling methods that were adequate in size and used appropriate instruments to collect
data, such as classroom observations and structured interviews.5 Given the
improvements in teacher training and curricula from 2005-2007, it is likely that the
sustained effort of ERfKE1 in these areas is also responsible to a large degree for the
improved learning outcomes registered by NAfKE in 2008.

IMPROVE THE RELEVANCE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD, BASIC, AND SECONDARY
EDUCATION

3.18 The project objectives define relevance in terms of the skills needed for the
knowledge economy. The project outputs aimed at this objective included the revised

5
   The teacher training evaluation used a sample of 164 schools representative of those participating in the
NAfKE study. The sample was a random stratified one with strata by sex , location and school level. This
involved 486 teachers, 164 principles and 60 trainers. The curriculum evaluation used a similar random
stratified methodology with a sample size of 117 schools with 276 teachers. Six instruments were
developed for: textbook analytical scheme, teachers’book analytical scheme, electronic content analytical
scheme, classroom observation schedule, students’ attitude questionnaire, and focus group interviews.
                                            27


vision and strategy for basic education, the development of cognitive skills via the new
curricula and teacher training, access to ICT and how to apply ICT in the new curricula.
While no precise definition is given for knowledge economy in the project documents, it
is broadly assumed by the government, Ministry of Education, and the Bank project team
to include a high level cognitive skills that can be creatively applied by graduates of the
system. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the high-level National Vision Forum held during
2002 as part of preparation, explored many aspects of the Knowledge Economy and its
implications for education. ICT skills are assumed in most of the literature on this topic
as essential for the knowledge economy, especially for the service sectors that are
important for Jordan. The ability to access, assess and apply information via the Internet
and elsewhere will be critical to success in the knowledge economy. To that extent,
ensuring access to on-line portals to 70 percent of basic and secondary students starting
from a base of virtually zero at the start of the project is a considerable achievement. As
mentioned previously, most university professors attest to the vastly increased ICT
proficiency of incoming university students. This will take a stronger root in the future as
the ECE component has given a big push to cognitive development early on with
Kindergarten access rising to 51 percent from 41 percent at the start of the project.
Overall, access to computers at all levels has improved and the evaluation evidence from
NAfKE (although ECE evaluation results are still to come) and the new curriculum on
improvements in cognitive skills (as opposed to rote learning) indicate that there are
substantial outputs to knowledge economy skills as usually formulated in the literature.

IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF EARLY CHILDHOOD, BASIC, AND SECONDARY
EDUCATION

3.19 The key outputs aimed at efficiency of the sector were the completion of the MIS
and its incorporation in the EDSS. Some major progress was made in efficiency, which
the Project Appraisal Document took to mean the conventional cost-benefit ratio, but
some of the goals had to be put on hold or moved into the next phase (ERfKE2).
Jordan’s basic school system appeared to be fairly efficient in terms of student flows
(repetition rates range from less than one percent in lower grades to less than 3 percent in
upper grades), which was maintained throughout the project. Costs per students (in real
terms) increased from 310 JD in 2004 to 380 JD in 2008, reflecting investments made in
the quality of the system (see Rawle (2008) in preparation of ERfKE2). However,
benefits, especially defined in terms of wage differentials from more education, could not
be measured, so the project focused on the cost side of efficiency. Some examples of
progress on the cost side of efficiency equation relate to the management of school
construction and the cost savings that were realized. The planned EDSS was to be one of
the major measures to improve efficiency. The MIS was completed, but required further
fine tuning before it could be connected to the EDSS. As a result, although the design of
the EDSS was completed after some delays, it was put on hold until the next phase of
ERfKE.

3.20 There were some pilot initiatives for decentralization supported by CIDA that also
made progress. Their wider replication, however, is being included also in the ERfKE.
Thus, Ministry of Education planning and budgeting continued along its traditional lines.
The newly created Policy and Strategic Planning Secretariat was created and the use of
evidenced-based policy and planning was partially implemented. The efficient utilization
                                            28


of school facilities, in terms of overcrowding in many areas and underutilization in
others, remained a challenge as demographic changes took place as rapidly as school
construction.

PRODUCE GRADUATES WITH THE SKILLS FOR THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY

3.21    The concept of knowledge economy is discussed in the official Letter of Sector
Policy included in the Project Appraisal Document, based in part upon the National
Vision Forum held in 2002. Still, as in many other Bank projects, the concept remains
elusively broad. It usually involves use of ICT to transform the education system in
terms of learning goals, professional development and overall system management.
Much progress was made in knowledge economy goals on the input side with
documented increases in computer installation and usage. IEG mission visits to the
schools confirm such widespread progress, despite the comments from teachers that
much more is needed, mostly because of enrollment growth.

3.22 Key outputs of the project included a new strategy for the Knowledge Economy
(the Vision Statement) and the new curriculum structure that integrated ICT into the
curriculum at all levels. Other key outputs involved the ICT infrastructure for the schools
and teacher training to make this effective. The Vision Statement 2002 sees education as
responding flexibly to the economy and also stimulating the economy. The ability to
access, assess and apply information in a variety of job situations is at the heart of the
concept of knowledge economy.

3.23 The evidence from evaluations on learning outcomes, new curricula emphasizing
cognitive skills, and access to ICT shows improvements in areas in which Jordanian
employers said they wanted to see improvements. The impression gained from the IEG
mission from visits to schools was consistent with these evaluations. Interviews by the
IEG mission of professors and representatives of private employers suggest that these
improvements are already showing up in more computer-literate graduates going into
university and the labor force. This is being addressed more systematically in the
collaboration between the Ministry of Education (and other ministries) and the Bank in
the current programmatic wconomic and sector work that deals with the topic of school to
work transition.

Ratings
OUTCOME

3.24      Relevance. The relevance of objectives is rated substantial due to the
importance of knowledge economy objectives to the overall CAS (2006) and, in
particular, the human development pillar in the CAS. The CAS in 2006 aimed overall at
transforming Jordan from a lower middle income economy into a modern knowledge
based economy. A Progress Report on the CAS was prepared in 2009 and reaffirmed the
original four clusters of CAS objectives, including the first one about building human
resources for a modern knowledge-based economy, that is, ICT skills and basic cognitive
competence to use ICT appropriately. The National Vision Forum (2002), a conference
that set national education policy based upon the concept of the knowledge economy, is
                                             29


also strongly supported by the project. This education policy vision is still in place as set
out it in the Letter of Sector Development Policy prepared for the follow-on Second
Education Reform for Knowledge Economy Project. The other aspects of project
objectives (quality, relevance and efficiency) are important to developing human
resources in a way that takes into account the fiscal priorities of the government.

3.25 The relevance of the project design is also rated substantial due to the way it
integrates ICT in education with developing the critical thinking and problem solving
skills needed for the knowledge economy. Given that the concept of knowledge
economy stressed an educated population with access to and ability to use the national
ICT infrastructure, the project results chain linked up with this human resources
component of a knowledge based economy. The various outputs of the components of
the project, especially reorienting education policy and transforming curricula, teaching
and learning, are aimed at the PDOs for the knowledge economy. There are other
dimensions of a knowledge based economy outside the purview of the education system,
such as a network of dynamic firms and research institutions along with a system of
market incentives to use knowledge in creating economic value added. However, the
project contributed to those dimensions of the knowledge economy for which the
education system is deemed responsible.

3.26 Efficacy. The efficacy of each PDO is rated substantial, except for the objective
of improving the efficiency of education, which is rated modest. The improvements in
learning that are at the core of the project are confirmed by improving test scores for both
basic and secondary levels. The steady increase in the test scores on TIMSS for grade
eight from 1997 to 2007 demonstrates important progress, despite the fact that some of
that increase could be due to the previous two education projects. The national
assessment (NAfKE) was initiated under the M&E part of the project and also
demonstrated significant progress in reading, math and science from 2006 to 2008. The
NAfKE, as part of the evaluation studies done by the NCHRD, was conducted for grades
5, 9 and 11 for reading, mathematics and science based upon the new curricula.
Evaluation studies carried out by the NCHRD for curricula development and teacher
training, all of which showed significant improvement. The early childhood activities
were not subject to assessment of learning outcomes, but they were evaluated by the
NCHRD for their impact on access, new curricula and training of teachers, all of which
showed significant progress. Studies of readiness to learn were also started for grade 1
and should provide outcome data over time. Thus the quality objective in terms of
learning outcomes and provision of quality inputs (curricula, textbooks and teaching) for
early childhood, basic and secondary levels is rated substantial.

3.27 The relevance objective is also rated substantial since the project achieved a
redefined vision and strategy and went a long way towards providing the new curriculum
and teacher development needed, although more time is needed to mainstream the
changes. The achievement of the objective of improving the efficiency of early
childhood, basic and secondary education faced some short comings. An important
aspect of efficiency for the system was improving student allocations to schools so as to
alleviate overcrowded or underutilized schools. The IEG mission observed overcrowding
in almost all of the schools visited (except for early childhood levels) and was informed
that this was typical. The mission was also informed by principals and Ministry of
                                            30


Education staff that there are still rural schools that are underutilized due to low
enrollment. On the positive side, many new schools/classrooms were constructed that
allowed for reduction of rented school facilities and helped to keep overcrowding of
schools in check. Completion of the EDSS, a key tool to enhance efficiency was carried
forward to the follow-on project. Overall, the objective of improving the efficiency of
the system is rated as modest. The last objective of graduates for the knowledge
economy is rated substantial. The evidence from the evaluations on learning outcomes,
new curricula emphasizing cognitive skills, and access to ICT showed improvements in
these areas in which Jordanian employers said they wanted to see improvements. Visits
to schools by the IEG mission gave impressions that were consistent with the evaluations.
Although this is also anecdotal, interviews of the IEG mission with professors and
representatives of private employers, these improvements are already showing up in more
computer literate graduates going into university and the labor force.

3.28 Efficiency. The efficiency of the project is rated substantial. Although the
project involves aspects that are hard to quantify in terms of calculating rates of return,
the project costs were kept reasonable due to efficient implementation and the economic
analysis of the Project Appraisal Document cited Jordanian labor market data indicating
that the benefits of increased learning would be significant. The procurement of
computers for the knowledge economy (Component 2) and civil works for school
construction (Component 3) were carried out with cost savings in these components.
Considering the likely benefits, this would give a good cost-benefit ratio, although it is
difficult to quantify. The ECE was also implemented efficiently, using the same cost-
benefit criteria as for the other components. The main efficiency problem was in EDSS
not being set up completely, though the MIS needed for this eventually did come on line.

3.29    Outcome. Based upon the above, the outcome of the project is rated
satisfactory. Relevance of project objectives and relevance of project design were
substantial, efficacy of each of the PDOs was substantial (except for the efficiency PDO
which was modest), and efficiency was substantial. The evidence from project
Monitoring and Evaluation showed that the outputs (new curricula, teacher training,
provision of ICT access, new school buildings where needed) from each of the
components resulted in learning outcomes aimed at graduates for the knowledge
economy. Implementation went smoothly with the loan being fully disbursed in a way
that kept the focus on the PDOs and not just on procurement and disbursement for
computers equipment and buildings.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

3.30 The risk to development outcome is moderate. A strong foundation with
considerable momentum for reform was established by the project. However, the
adoption rate of the new methods still needs improvement according to M&E studies of
the project. In the schools visited by the mission the interest of the staff in receiving
more training and equipment was evident. The outcomes achieved thus far must be
sustained in the face of increasing enrollment pressure and overcrowding from
demographic changes internally and externally. The next phase of transformation and
reform calls for decentralization and school-based management, a challenge that will test
the capacity gained under the first project.
                                           31


BANK PERFORMANCE

3.31 The Bank’s performance was satisfactory. Quality at entry was satisfactory.
The Bank helped to organize the 2002 Vision Forum and the team organized international
experts and background studies related to knowledge economy themes that were relevant
and completed on time. This Vision Forum kept the focus on strategic issues in the
knowledge economy as well as on procurement of ICT equipment. The Bank made use
of its comparative perspective from high performing Asian countries to benefit the
perspective of Jordanian policy makers. The preparation was efficient and proceeded
faster compared to the Higher Education Project. By the time of appraisal a detailed
LogFrame and results framework was ready, although it could have been more clear
about specific responsibilities for M&E.

3.32 During supervision, some of these areas of responsibility for M&E were clarified
with the NCHRD, which had the bulk of responsibilities for carrying out studies. The
quantity and quality of supervision was satisfactory with the Bank supervision team
being proactive in identifying and resolving procurement and staffing issues. The team
also discovered that there would be cost over-runs, which it helped to resolve. The
supervision team also ensured the experience of this project was used in the preparation
of the follow on project.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

3.33    The Borrower’s performance was satisfactory. The government provided
adequate support to the overall project and its performance was satisfactory.
government counterpart funding was provided on time and in sufficient amounts. The
Ministry of Education senior executives provided the high level leadership needed to
keep the reform moving and provided advocacy for the project within the Cabinet in a
way that was lacking in the HEDP since there was no Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research for a while during preparation and start-up of the HEDP. The
planning capacity of Ministry of Education could have been stronger if the EDSS had
become operational on schedule.

3.34    The DCU was the implementing agency and performed satisfactorily. The
DCU was established within the Ministry of Education to support this complex project
requiring coordination and sustained effort. The DCU was not a PIU in the usual sense,
but played the role of coordinating among the directorates/departments of the Ministry of
Education which maintained their usual lines of responsibility. This helped to develop
Ministry of Education capacity internally and maintained Ministry ownership of the
project. The DCU also helped in coordinating the contributions of various donors who
came into the project as it progressed

QUALITY OF MONITORING AND EVALUATION

3.35 The quality of M&E is rated substantial. The M&E design called for an
intensive use of data. The use of both national and international assessments for
benchmarks was a novel feature for the Middle East and North Africa region. The M&E
                                           32


design also provided for a large number (more than 30) of evaluation studies to be carried
out by the NCHRD.

3.36 Implementation of M&E was completed according to the M&E framework.
However, the EDSS was not completed since this required the MIS, which was behind
schedule. The MIS was completed by the end of the project, the learning assessments
involving both TIMSS and NAfKE were completed, and the NCHRD carried out the
planned evaluation studies. The design of the EDSS, which would improve utilization of
M&E results in decision making, was also completed.

3.37 The utilization of M&E contributed to project activities and objectives. In terms
of the knowledge economy objective, the learning assessments and large number of
background evaluation studies are giving a detailed picture of students’ strengths and
weakness. This was used for the preparation of next phase of the reforms (ERfKE2) and
has fostered a culture of evidence-based policy in the Ministry of Education. The EDSS
is planned to be implemented when financing becomes available.


4. Lessons and Perspectives

4.1    Although this report focuses on two projects, it should be viewed in a broader and
longer-term perspective, taking into account four decades of Bank support for Jordanian
education. The Bank’s support has been made more effective overall because the
government has been serious and forward looking in its vision for education policy and
programs. Both the Bank and the government need to look back now and analyze what
adjustments are needed to improve implementation and adapt to the much different policy
environment that now prevails.

Lessons
4.2     A number of lessons can be highlighted based upon the experience of these two
projects.

      The continuing high unemployment among university graduates is a cause for
       concern, despite attempts to make higher education more relevant. Although
       limited progress has been made, the higher education system in Jordan can do
       much more to improve quality and relevance, including becoming actively linked
       in real time with the labor market and economy. More up-to-date labor market
       information and private sector representation is needed in the governance of
       universities and community colleges to gain this real-time and up-to-date
       perspective on the labor market.
      Despite the problems in the first two rounds of the competitive Higher Education
       Fund, the success of the third round demonstrated that such a competitive funding
       mechanism can work in Jordan, if time and care are taken to adapt it to local
       circumstances.
      The difficulties experienced in the formula funding arrangement for recurrent
       higher education budgets were both technical and political (in the sense of getting
                                            33


       stakeholder consensus). The technical part has to do with establishing a good
       MIS and the design for this has been completed. Although this reform measure
       did not come to pass, it generated useful debate and may still be feasible if more
       political effort is forthcoming.
      The emphasis on critical thinking and creative problem-solving at each level
       means that some mutual adjustments are needed. Higher education curricula need
       to continue adapting to the new secondary graduates from the reformed curricula
       and the admission procedures for higher education need to adapt to the criteria of
       the knowledge economy.

Perspectives
4.3     Jordan has a long history of high aspirations for education and Jordanian society
is willing to sacrifice and pay the costs required for quality education. However, with
limited resources these high aspirations have to be tempered by considerations of
effectiveness and efficiency. Recognizing the need to find its appropriate place in the
global knowledge economy, the government and its education authorities are honestly
taking steps to assess and measure its progress by international standards as well as by its
own national needs. Performance in TIMSS and PISA shows how far Jordan has to go in
basic education, yet their have been solid improvements in the last decade or so. In
higher education there are a variety of international rankings, all of which put Jordanian
universities in the middle tier internationally, although regionally the country ranks high.

4.4      In the case of the higher education interventions, while the shortcomings with
respect to objectives of the HEDP are acknowledged, the project set in motion positive
developments in higher education that should be continued in an effort to increase the
reform momentum that has not yet reached its potential. As a result of the debates
occasioned by the two higher education projects (including one that was cancelled) and
Jordanian-World Bank sector analysis, there is now a window of opportunity for reform.
Bank support can still be a catalyst for reforms and should take an even longer
perspective than that of the five- or even ten-year time frame. Experience of higher
education reform in other regions, for example in East Asia or Latin America, shows that
it takes a full generation for reform to take root. It takes time to develop the academic
community, students, and professoriate, to world class standards. The Bank can play a
support role in the twenty-year vision, helping to analyze and better define the
implications for a small country such as Jordan. In the end, Jordan will have to decide
what vision it subscribes to and what costs it is able and willing to pay.

4.5      Although progress has been made in specific areas, there is still no sense of a
coherent “national system of higher education ” for public universities. Rather, the
universities enjoy some autonomy, although very limited in some areas, but effective
coordination of overall higher education policy and its implementation is still not yet well
developed. The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research and HEC have
their roles to play in this respect, but they do not appear to have a strong enough set of
coordination incentives to get the constituent parts to behave as a system with a well
defined purpose. For example, the formula funding came to be seen as irrelevant by the
universities since the public budget to be allocated was reduced to a very small
proportion of university operating budgets. This fits with the experience in some
                                                    34


countries that the amount allocated by formula funding needs to reach a critical minimum
size to have influence as an incentive to steer the system in the desired policy direction.

4.6     As a result of success in expanding secondary enrollment and high social demand,
the fiscal pressure on higher education will continue and likely increase. Since Jordanian
higher education is part of a global system with demand for good faculty and modern
equipment all being subject to international prices in a way not present in primary
education, international unit cost norms will apply to Jordan as well. More cost recovery,
increased public budgetary support, and increased provision of quality private higher
education will all be needed in a properly balanced way to maintain access, quality, and
relevance of higher education in Jordan. A slower rate of expansion of higher education
would also help to manage fiscal pressures, but social demand is such that political
pressure to expand enrollments must somehow be managed. The political strategy to
form a sufficient social consensus for this is critical.

4.7     At this stage of education reform, more attention needs to be paid to the linkage
between secondary and tertiary education. Better secondary school graduates contribute
to a better quality higher education system and the quality and relevance of that system
provides better teachers for basic education levels. If the secondary reforms are
successful at improving the critical thinking and problem-solving skills of graduates, then
the university and community college pedagogical approaches must adapt as well. Old-
style lectures based upon a professor’s notes should become completely a thing of the
past. The use of e-learning and other uses of ICT in university education should continue
to be disseminated throughout the system. Some professors have remarked that the
higher cognitive competencies generated by secondary reforms are still not widespread
enough among first-year students. In such cases, the burden of developing these
cognitive competencies needs to be taken up in the higher education system. Students
graduating from secondary also need better information and counseling about potential
choices of fields of study and careers, given that some fields with high unemployment
appear to have excess supply. The Bank is starting up some econimic and sector work on
labor markets that could help in this direction.

4.8     For both basic and higher education, the concept of knowledge economy needs
more elaboration and precision in order to provide an operational set of principles and
achieve the aim of a more global competitive economy. It needs to be broadened beyond
education and encompass the whole network of education, labor market, innovative firms
and institutions that promote economic growth.6 This has been given a good start thus far
in Jordan, where education projects have involved more than buying ICT equipment.
Although there has been real institutional change in education, there is still a need for
some kind of high-level coordinating and steering mechanism that can at the same time
pay attention to strengthening links of the education system to the rest of the knowledge
6
  See the previously cited Bank report, “The Road Not Traveled: Education Reform in MENA” (2008) for
an excellent analysis of the components of the knowledge economy. Also see the study by M. Noland and
H. Pack, “The Arab Economies in a Changing World” (2007), which includes examples from Jordan in
comparison to other Arab as well as high performing Asian economies. Both of these studies emphasize
the first lesson above that education is limited in what it can do for employment creation unless education
and economic reform work together to create jobs that demand knowledge and skills. This does not
diminish the urgent need for education reforms, but places these reforms in proper context.

economy network. On the Government side this involves a wide range of ministries
(such as education, labor, commerce, and planning). On the private sector side this
involves chambers of commerce and industry, private universities, and training institutes.
An inter-ministerial mechanism has been established to review programs and make
adjustments, all with the aim and incentives for contributing to the knowledge economy
according to the comprehensive strategy of the National Agenda. The challenge is to
sustain this effort and avoid bureaucracy while promoting dynamic coordination among
all of these agencies.

4.9     To summarize, the main challenges going forward based upon by the experience
of these projects within the context of economic developments over the past decade are:

       Recognizing that higher education reforms require sustained effort beyond the
        standard five-year project cycle. Based upon the HEDP experience and that of
        higher education reform projects in other countries, the Bank and the government
        can work out a strategy of Bank support for higher education over the long run.
        This has already started with the programmatic sector work and could be scaled
        up even more, given the magnitude of the reform challenge.

       Developing a truly “national system of public higher education ” by using
        increased levels of public subsidies allocated though a clear set of formula and
        competitive funding mechanisms that can steer the system in the desired policy
        directions.

       Improving the linkages in reform of basic and higher education by making the
        curriculum reform at both levels consistent with higher order cognitive skills and
        the admissions and examinations policies more consistent with the curriculum.

       Improving the operational aspects of the concept of the knowledge economy and
        linking it more closely with the National Agenda by setting up implementation
        structures that can monitor and evaluate the knowledge economy initiatives
        (basic and higher education) on a regular basis.

       Developing a labor market monitoring system for higher and basic education that
        makes full use of the quarterly surveys of employment/unemployment as well as
        tracers and special purpose surveys to determine trends in the labor market by
        sectors and professions that could be used in timely fashion for education policy.
        As noted above, this will require cooperation of all ministries and agencies
        involved in the execution of the National Agenda.

Annex E. Borrower Comments
Feedback by the Ministry of Education
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
June 14, 2011

General Comments

Thank you for the submitted project performance report conducted by The Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) that covered two educational programs funded partially by the World
Bank: The Higher Education Development Project and the Education Reform for Knowledge
Economy Project (ERfKE I).

The report is a comprehensive, evaluation focuses mainly on the achievement of objectives, the
risks to development outcome, Bank Performance, Borrower Performance and the quality of
Monitoring and Evaluation. The report has clearly addressed these evaluation aspects.
However, the evaluation has less focus in addressing the sustainability aspects and the impact
of the said two projects.

The evaluation covered two essential educational projects and separately addressed the key
analyses and findings for each project. This is also a good opportunity to have wider
perspectives and address key findings, analysis, and recommendations with respect to the
education sector as a whole. The report covered this with limited scope (bullets points as
lessons learnt). This aspect, which is not fully covered and analyzed in the report, was
proposed as one of the key questions to be covered:

Has the interaction among the levels of education improved with respect to quality, relevance
and efficiency, e.g., better prepared entrants to higher education ? Did improvements in higher
education make for better prepared teachers in basic and secondary education

Specific Comments

Page 22, para 3.5, it is mentioned that:

The design of M&E assigned a key role to the National Center for Human Resources
Development, which was to carry out external M&E and also more than 30 studies and
surveys. The Center had been involved in previous Bank supported educational projects.
The day-to-day progress of implementation was to be monitored by the DCU and respective
directorates in the MoE.

Please note the following:
    Because of the M&E role, NCHRD conducted 30 studies and surveys not beyond
       this.
                                            49                                       ANNEX E


      The Center had been involved in previous Bank supported educational projects but
       with different functions (not M&E functions), but rather as a policy and coordination
       body.

Page 23 Para 3.8: it is mentioned that: A public relations campaign to educate and inform
the public and stakeholders was carried out.

A public relations campaign was not implemented; however, a communication strategy was
developed but not implemented.

Page 24, Para 3.11:
    Component 3 on Quality Learning Environment was mainly a set of civil works
      procurement. A main issue was safety since many rented facilities were not
      appropriate as schools.

Please note that in addition to safety and growth issues, this component also targeted
overcrowded schools.

      The government constructed 41 new schools and renovated/extended 538 schools.

       Please note that is what constructed through the WB loan only not through the whole
       ERfKE reform in general.

Page 29, Para 3.5:
It is mentioned that: The early childhood activities were not subject to assessment of
learning outcomes, but they were evaluated by the NCHRD for their impact on access, new
curricula and training of teachers, all of which showed significant progress.

Please note that NCHRD conducted a study using EYE tool to assess grade 1 students
readiness to learn, which could provide good feedback on learning outcomes!


Page 32, Para 3.35

It is mentioned that: Implementation of M&E did not complete the EDSS since this required
the MIS, which was behind schedule.

It is not clear what the link is between the M&E and the EDSS. M&E activities were
completed based on the M&E framework and the identified studies.
