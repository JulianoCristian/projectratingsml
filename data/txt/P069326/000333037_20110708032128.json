follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            continuing high unemployment rates among university\n            graduates is a cause for concern, despite attempts to make\n            higher education more relevant. Although limited progress\n            has been made, the higher education system can do much more\n            to improve quality and relevance, including becoming\n            actively linked in real time with the labor market and\n            economy. More up-to-date labor market information is needed\n            as well as much more private sector representation in the\n            governance of universities and community colleges. The\n            emphasis on critical thinking and creative problem-solving\n            at each level means that some mutual adjustments are needed.\n            Higher education curricula need to continue adapting to the\n            new secondary graduates and the admission procedures for\n            higher education need to adapt to the criteria of the\n            knowledge economy."}, "docdt": "2011-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
