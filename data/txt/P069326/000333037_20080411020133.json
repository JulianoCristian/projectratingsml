follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, Global Environment\n            Objectives (GEO) outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:  the\n            design of competitive funds needs extensive participation to\n            succeed. The guidelines for the competitive fund were\n            prepared by someone external to Jordan universities and they\n            were never validated and disseminated widely. In order for\n            such a vast reform aiming to create a culture of quality\n            within all universities to be successful, the procedures\n            manual needs to be designed, and validated by faculty and\n            administrative staff within universities in addition to\n            extensive training for academics to write proposals\n            accordingly. This requires a lot of time and well\n            coordinated efforts but this preparation will ensure a\n            better buy-in which is a critical factor for success of the\n            competitive fund. For a competitive fund to add value it\n            needs to be streamlined with government policies for\n            development in higher education and broader economic\n            priorities. Secondly, to be most effective a competitive\n            fund needs to be headed by a well-known and respected\n            academic who can manage the competitive process both\n            technically and administratively in a transparent and\n            efficient way. Political support to this reform champion is\n            essential to implement the competitive scheme in a\n            professional, transparent and unbiased manner."}, "docdt": "2007-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
