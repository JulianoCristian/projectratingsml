The project promotes and directs actions to\n            strengthen the institutional framework for sub-national\n            levels of government and to strengthen productive\n            investments. More specifically, it will (a) facilitate\n            participatory planning at the municipal and regional level,\n            institutions; (b) promote the formation of municipal\n            associations to create and implement territorial development\n            strategies and achieve economies of scale in administering\n            funds; (c) provide co-financing for investments in basic\n            infrastructure and production support services; and (d)\n            strengthen local public and civil society actors involved in\n            defining and implementing territorial development\n            strategies. The project may have differentiated impacts in\n            that a portion of the soil can have diverse effects\n            depending on the characteristics of the site especially\n            depending on the relative abundance or scarcity of land. In\n            areas of smallholdings, the immobilization of agricultural\n            land certainly has greater impact in areas of large estates.\n            For example, a subproject that includes the involvement of a\n            small farm in an area that exceeds 5 percent would be very\n            damaging and should be seriously considered for exclusion."}, "docdt": "2011-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
