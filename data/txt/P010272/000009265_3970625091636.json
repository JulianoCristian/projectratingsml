  Project will support the Government in formulating and\n            implementing programs of structural and policy reform in key\n            sectors and subsectors of the economy, and in maintaining an\n            environment of sound macro-economic management. Financing\n            will be provided for studies, specialized consultancies,\n            training and equipment necessary for building up the\n            institutional capacity to design and implement policy\n            reforms on a permanent basis. The project will assist the\n            Government in the areas of macro-economic management,\n            resource mobilization, agricultural policy, industrial\n            strategy, and energy, transport, urban, and education sector\n            policies. Given the Government's experience in\n            implementing two previous technical assistance projects,\n            there are no major project implementation risks anticipated.\n            There is the possibility, however, that the Government may\n            not implement some policy reform proposals, or may proceed\n            more slowly than desirable."}, "docdt": "1986-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
