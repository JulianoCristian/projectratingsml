                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the second ISR for the Additional Financing Project. Additional Financing (AF) is intended to support the implementation momentum that was created during the previous
                         years of project implementation and to extend ICT services to the areas that were not covered during the original period, especially the north and east of the country. The
                         implementation of Additional Financing also requires that continued tracking of - some of the most- important indicators in the parent project. These indicators included: (i) Number
                         of citizens carrying out on line transactions with the central Government; number of CIOs trained as agents of change in Government Departments and Agencies and the number of
                         jobs created through IT and IT enabled services. The performance so far has been as follows: In 2010 there were 5.8 million citizens that carried out on line transactions with- the
                         Central Government; (ii) Number of CIOs trained as agents of change in Government Departments and Agencies and (iii) Number of jobs created in the ICT industry-and ICT
                         enabled services. The performance so far has been as follows: In 2010 5.8 million citizens carried out -on line transactions with the Central Government and by December 2012
                         citizens on line transactions had increased to 7.2 million (a 24% increase). In 2010 80% of CIOshad been trained and the percentage had increased to 99.7 % by December 2012.
                         The job and employment agenda is being tackled through fostering ICT and IT enabled services industries . The original estimate for job creation for 2010 was 10,000 jobs.
                         However, by the end of 2012 this sector had created over 70,000 jobs that were directly attributable to the project's intervention. The implementation of activities that are being
                         supported by the Additional Financing has started in earnest and it is projected that disbursements , which were initially low due to delays in procurement will now improve. The
                         linking of the rest of the country to the Lanka Government Network (with additional financing to the Re-Engineering Government Component) will provide the necessary tools for
                         public sector staff to be more productive and efficient and in turn enable the delivery of convenient and effective services to the citizens . This is in addition to the introduction of
                         twenty new e-services (G2G, G2C, and G2B) that are being implemented in collaboration with 550 government organizations and 25 district secretariats. Training in specific areas of
                         change management is being provided for government officials from the northern districts of Jaffna, Vuvuniya, Kilinochchi, Trinco, Mulativu and Mannar in Government entities
                         where e-services will be rolled out.
