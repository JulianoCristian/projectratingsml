                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has achieved some major results over its lifetime. Over 50,000 new jobs were created in the ICT industry over the past 6 years, and over 35,000 private sector workers
                         have been trained to incorporate ICT in their business. ICT has become the 5th largest source of much-needed foreign exchange for Sri Lanka, as the country has become a top-30
                         outsourcing destination in the world. Several key laws were adopted, creating a much-needed ICT legal framework. Government has implemented an active ICT program, with over
                         97% of government agencies being integrated into the new ICT career-track, with functioning IT officers, and active ongoing training. The internationally-recognized Sri Lanka
                         government on line portal started offering services to the public in 2009, used by over 5 million people so far and rising. Over 600 tele-centers have been established, used by over
                         120,000 citizens monthly, linking poor people around the country with markets and information essential to their livelihoods. The project is the most comprehensive ICT project in the
                         World Bank, is well-rooted in the middle-income agenda of Sri Lanka, has won many international awards and accreditations, and has achieved truly transformative improvements in
                         the country's global competitiveness as assessed by international rating agencies. With the arrival of peace, the project has been expanding to the Eastern and Northern provinces .
