                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the first ISR for the Additional Financing. Additional Financing is intended to support the implementation momentum that has been created during the previous years of project
                         implementation and to extend ICT services to the areas that were not covered during that period, especially the north and east of the country. The focus will mainly be on connecting
                         75 government organizations (7 District Secretaries, 60 Divisional Secretariats and 8 provincial Ministries) through the Lanka Government Network and thus complete linking a total of
                         550 government organizations in 25 districts to the Lanka Government Network. The deployment of this infrastructure throughout the country will provide the necessary tools for
                         public sector staff to be more productive and efficient and in turn enable the delivery of convenient and effective services to the citizens . The additional financing will also support the
                         implementation of twenty new e-services in collaboration with government organizations and district secretariats. The government officials from northern districts of Jaffna, Vuvuniya,
                         Kilinochchi, Trinco, Mulativu and Mannar will be trained in specific areas of change management for government entities , where e-services will be rolled out.
