                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the third ISR for the Additional Financing Project. Additional Financing (AF) is intended to support the implementation momentum that was created during the previous years of
                         project implementation and to extend ICT services to the areas that were not covered during the original period, especially the North and East of the country. The implementation of
                         Additional Financing also requires continued tracking of - some of the most- important indicators in the parent project. These indicators included: (i) Number of citizens carrying out
                         on line transactions with the central Government; number of Chief Information officers (CIOs) trained as agents of change in Government Departments and Agencies and the number
                         of jobs created through IT and IT enabled services. The performance so far has been as follows: In December 2012 7.2 million citizens carried out on-line transactions with the
                         Central Government and by April 2013 it had increased to 9.1 million (a 26% increase since December 2012). In 2013, 42% of the new 165 CIOs to be trained had been trained and
                         the plan is to train the balance training is planned during the next few months.The job and employment agenda is being addressed through fostering ICT and IT enabled services
                         industries. By the end of 2012 this sector had created over 70,000 jobs that were directly attributable to the project's intervention and a survey is planned to collect the data on project
                         achievements before end of the Project.

                         The implementation of activities that are being supported by the Additional Financing has started in earnest and the disbursements have picked up which were initially low due to
                         delays in procurement. The linking of the rest of the country to the Lanka Government Network (with additional financing to the Re-Engineering Government Component) will provide
                         the necessary tools for public sector staff to be more productive and efficient and in turn enable the delivery of convenient and effective services to the citizens . This is in addition to
                         the introduction of twenty new e-services (G2G, G2C, and G2B) that are being implemented in collaboration with 550 government organizations and 25 district secretariats. Training
                         in specific areas of change management is being provided for government officials from the northern districts of Jaffna, Vuvuniya, Kilinochchi, Trinco, Mulativu and Mannar in
                         Government entities where e-services will be rolled out. Already the setting up of 40 tele-centers in the Northern and Eastern provinces has been initiated.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Disbursements under the Additional Financing Project have been low due to delayed procurement and slow replication of the e-services program. A fortnightly review is planned on
                         the procurement process to avoid further delays.
